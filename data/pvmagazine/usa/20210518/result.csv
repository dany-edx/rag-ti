The alliance’s primary goal is to encourage passage of House Bills 4715 and 4716, legislation what would change Michigan law to allow subscription-based community solar projects. Because direct participation in these programs is currently prohibited under state law, solar energy access has been limited.
The 13 founding organizations include:
According to the Alliance, more than 50% of American households don’t have access to solar power because they rent, live in a multi-tenant building, have roofs unable to host a solar system, or live in a service territory of a utility that won’t allow it. Community solar offers a solution to these customers, and provides access to the economic and environmental benefits of solar generation.
The association also established partnerships with the Lansing Board of Water and Light, the City of East Lansing, the City of Lansing, and Michigan Energy Options.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/18/eyes-in-the-sky-how-solar-plant-owners-can-benefit-from-aerial-inspection-technologies/,"GUEST POST,MONITORING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",,"MAY 18, 2021",Eyes in the sky: How solar plant owners can benefit from aerial inspection technologies,"Aerial inspection, paired with solar-specific data models and analytical software, has become one of the fastest-growing technologies in solar plant operations and maintenance (O&M).
Depending on the use case, aerial inspection can be done by unmanned drone or manned aircraft, and with satellite imagery also used to assist with data model generation.
Although innovations are occurring rapidly, many solar plant O&M operators still aren’t using airborne monitoring and analysis to its full potential. When asset owners don’t take advantage of these tools, they are missing a chance to mitigate risk and optimize the health of the DC side of their system. The causes of possible plant underperformance remain underreported and insufficiently analyzed, resulting in financial returns being left on the table.
Software is used to digitize site-specific schematics and fuse the data model with and aerial-based thermography and photography. This offers a powerful holistic tool for:
Software enables this process to scale across the solar industry by analyzing utility-scale and commercial and industrial (C&I) datasets in bulk and standardizing the reporting process. It accurately identifies, classifies, and prioritizes all anomalies and provides the exact onsite location for efficient remediation.
While the O&M and asset management benefits of aerial inspection and data analysis are numerous and increasing, this article will focus on a few practical, boots-on-the-ground/wings in-the-air examples of improvements these new technologies have delivered.
Solar O&M managers have traditionally relied on I-V curve tracing (current–I–and voltage–V) to offer the asset owner a broad-spectrum review of site performance at the string and combiner levels during the maintenance process. This tool is used to help determine issues such as whether there is a string offline, whether panels are failing in some sort of serial or design defect manner, or if a lightning strike or other event has caused a non-obvious production guarantee issue not detected by the plant’s monitoring system.
While both I-V curve tracing and the less-expensive voltage current inspection method can be useful in identifying some symptoms of underperformance, they also have some disadvantages.
For example, I-V curve tracing works really well to measure the degradation of individual PV panels to see if the panels are following the guaranteed production profile. But, when used as a tool to diagnose what’s going on with an entire string or multiple strings, the results are more challenging to interpret.
Because the I-V curve measures many other things besides the panels themselves, it can be difficult for a field technician to clearly determine if there is some problem that he or she should investigate. The I-V curve may look irregular, but figuring out what is behind the cause of that irregularity is not straightforward. From a training perspective, it can be hard to establish clear guidelines for what technicians should do when they see certain things and decide whether or not to investigate.
In addition, I-V curve tracing presents a safety risk. Technicians are often doing I-V curves from a combiner box, unterminating and terminating parts of the system. It’s not always easy to run all the systems when wearing all the necessary safety gear. Solar components like connectors and termination blocks were not designed to be disconnected and reconnected regularly, not multiple times a year or even once a year. Usually, these devices are locked into place, and that’s where they sit.

Other issues with I-V curve tracing include a lack of real-time, continuous diagnostic information leading to under-detection of defects or underperformance between inspections, as well as the additional cost of sending technicians to the work site with incomplete information or guidance to search for supposed problems.
I-V curve testing is time-consuming as well, as it takes hours for each megawatt of installed capacity. Documentation and reporting to the customer can also lack clarity and make it difficult for them to interpret and act on the findings. Put all these factors together, and I-V curves are not highly effective as a maintenance method to determine if there is an overall problem going on.
While aerial thermography was considered experimental several years ago, it has become increasingly required by asset owners and used by operators. Most O&M contracts include the use of thermal imagery as part of the maintenance package, albeit by a ground technician using a hand scanner. This approach is cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive. Enter aerial inspection.
Aerial thermography is quicker, more cost-effective and predictable compared to boots-on-the-ground manual inspections. It only takes hours to inspect a large PV power plant; the granular data collected down to the sub-module level provides actionable evidence of root cause issues.
Contrast this with the time- and labor-intensive interpretation of I-V curves or individual handheld thermal images that were done at different times of the day or week under changing weather conditions. The O&M and asset management teams can take the results and analysis from the eyes in the sky and identify specific work site locations that need corrective maintenance. They then can prioritize their punch list based on the impact the anomalies could have on performance. For the owner, aerial thermal images and related analyses are clear, color coded, and easy to understand.
Thermography is only part of the aerial inspection story. Aircraft are also equipped with high-resolution color cameras to help stratify the actual cause of an anomaly detected by the thermographic apparatus. Cracking and internal hotspots can all look similar on thermal images; photos offer the ability to go beyond classifying the issue as merely a “hotspot” and get to the root cause of the problem.
Underpinning all of this is the use of a “digital twin,” which leverages as-built drawings to create a standardized data model that provides the intelligence of electrical relationships within the inverters and combiners of the PV system, where every panel is represented properly in terms of location and those relationships. On the ground, technicians can use smartphone or tablet apps to use the data model to quickly go to the problem areas that need attention. Additional data, such as serial numbers and vital documentation, can be associated with elements of the digital twin and shared with the appropriate counterparties.
One area where aerial inspection technologies have made a profound impact is warranty claims. Until recently, the prevailing attitude in the solar industry has been that if I-V curve tracing could be done on every maintenance procedure, that data would be all the documentation needed to file warranty claims.
Many OEMs are accepting aerial data on its own, without additional I-V curve information.

Aerial inspection brings a clarity and relative simplicity to the warranty claims process. The integrity of the data and transparency of the aerial inspection and analysis process has made module anomalies easier to identify and prove potential warranty claims than the traditional I-V curve methods. Many OEMs are accepting aerial data on its own, without additional I-V curve information.
Aerial inspection hardware and software offers asset owners and O&M providers a way to communicate clearly and quantitatively with each other. A digitized, audit-friendly platform provides detailed classification and location of anomalies, optimizing workflow and system performance, reducing labor costs by effectively deploying field technicians and allocating resources, and improving worker safety.

The company said the platform enables it to produce frameless, thin, lightweight and conformable solar panels with efficiency and performance equivalent to standard solar panels. The platform is the result of five years of research, development and testing.
Maxeon Solar Technologies
According to Maxeon, Air solar panels can be adhered directly to the roof without the need for racking or other mounting systems. Because of their adhesive and low-weight nature, the technology will initially target installations on roofs that are not engineered to support the weight of conventional solar systems.
In Europe, where Maxeon Air will first launch, the company estimated an unserved annual market for low-load roofs of more than 4 GW.
The Air panel uses no metal frame and no glass, resulting in an install load of roughly 6 kg/m². The product essentially appears to be a solar panel sticker, with Maxeon describing that the integrated adhesive layer enables installation directly on the roof surface, without racking, anchors, or ballast, and enabling installation on uneven roofs.
The company said that the cells within the panel incorporate a solid metal foundation along with stress-relieved cell interconnects. It said these protect against corrosion and enable fault tolerant circuits that allow energy flow even with cracked cells.
Additionally, the panels feature an efficiency of 20.9%, a low power-temperature coefficient, shade tolerance, wide spectral response, and hot-spot resistance.
General product availability is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2022.

The study finds that adding four-hour-duration batteries sized to 50% of the capacity of a solar or wind project raises the value by $3–$22/MWh depending on the year and region, with an average value of $10/MWh. The highest boost was found in California ($15/MWh), where the value of adding storage to solar rises in tandem with increased solar penetration.
The study said an even higher value comes from siting the same batteries separately, in a nearby high-value location.
It said this strategy results in higher value than co-located projects in nearly all markets and years. Values ranged from $2–$50/MWh, with an average value boost of $12.50/MWh. The highest values were found in constrained regions, like New York’s Long Island. Lower values occurred in Texas in certain years of the study period.
The report said that the “value penalty” of co-located projects can be reduced through a number of strategies, including recharging batteries from the grid during low-price hours, or sizing the interconnection capacity so both the generator and the battery can deliver power to the grid at the same time.
Almost all planned grid-scale solar in California is paired with solar.

The report said that a big part of the savings stems from the federal tax credit for renewable energy production that can also be applied to batteries, so long as the batteries are directly charged by the renewable generator. The tax credit, worth as much as $10/MWh, can tip the scale toward co-location, making coupled projects more attractive to a developer than separate locations.
The report said that at the end of 2020, 34% of solar and 6% of wind capacity were being developed in the U.S. with co-located batteries. In the West, 70%–90% of proposed solar is paired with storage, including almost all grid-scale solar projects in California. Almost two-thirds of all grid-connected batteries in California are part of hybrid solar + storage systems, rather than in potentially higher-value locations. In other regions, the share is typically less than 40%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/18/price-pressures-may-delay-15-of-utility-scale-solar-projects-this-year-roth-capital-warns/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,COVID-19,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 18, 2021","Price pressures may delay 15% of utility-scale solar projects this year, Roth Capital warns","Equity research firm Roth Capital Advisors warned clients in a May 16 research note that current price pressures could delay as much as 15% of planned 2021 utility scale solar development.
“With everything at elevated levels, some projects will get pushed,” the firm said.
Roth Capital said that U.S. utility scale module pricing six months ago for delivery in the third quarter of 2022 was on the order of $0.25 per Watt freight on board (FOB), or $0.27/W delivered duty paid (DDP).
It pegged more recent pricing at $0.28/W FOB and as high as $0.32/W DDP. It said that with unlevered internal rates of return as low as 4-8% and levered IRRs of between 13-18%, “there is not much room to absorb input cost inflation.”

The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s most recent Short Term Energy Outlook forecast utility-scale solar additions to be around 15.7 GW this year and 15.9 GW in 2022. Shaving off 15% would trim new capacity additions by more than 2.3 GW this year alone.
Roth Capital said that pricing appears to be up across the solar value chain. It reported that Tongwei raised its cell pricing for the fourth time in a month, and that LONGi announced its largest price increase in the last 12 months.
In a quarterly earnings statement, Albuquerque-based Array Technologies, which makes single-axis trackers, said the industry is dealing with increases in steel and shipping costs that are “unprecedented both in their magnitude and rate of change.” It said that compared to the first quarter or 2020, spot prices of hot rolled coil steel more than doubled in the first quarter of 2021. It said prices have continued to increase in the second quarter with spot prices up “over 10% since April 1.”
Image: Array Technologies
Array said that steel makes up almost half of its cost of goods sold. And because it does hold large inventories, “a significant increase in the price of steel over a short period of time can negatively impact our results.”
The company said it was passing through higher commodity and shipping costs to customers, fixing commodity prices with suppliers, entering into long-term contracts with freight providers, further diversifying its supply base, and increasing order lead-times to give it more time to procure raw material.
Array said that it believed that its competitors were being hit by the same cost increases and, in some cases, “much more significantly because their smaller size gives them less buying power with suppliers.” The near-term pressure could help it grow its market share if some competitors are unable to deliver given their inability to buy raw materials at a competitive price “or at all.”
Array said it expected steel prices and shipping costs to normalize once the “restart” of the global economy is complete following the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. Even so, in its earnings statement, the company suspended its performance guidance for the rest of the year. It said it expected to update guidance following a review of all of its open purchase orders, and once commodity and shipping prices stabilize.
Array Technologies is not alone in feeling the effects of higher supply chain prices. In its quarterly earnings report, SolarEdge Technologies warned that a spike in ocean freight rates was likely to impact its second quarter results.

“Ocean freight prices have increased by more than 100% over the last month, and our pre-negotiated prices have gradually expired and exposed us to higher fright costs worldwide,” said Ronan Faier, SolarEdge’s chief financial officer in an early May earnings call. Higher costs for certain components and freight costs related to the expedited shipping of components will also factor into lower Q2 margins, he said.
Faier said SolarEdge is managing component shortages while still being able to meet its annual operating plan. At times, however, it has had to pay more for a component or resort to air transport to ship components to its contract manufacturers’ facilities.
In an earlier market research note, Roth Capital described 2020 as a year of upside driven by an ever-improving demand outlook. By contrast, it characterized 2021 as a “supply-side story” with “steady and unrelenting increase” in prices of raw materials and components.

Those are the key findings in a report from the International Energy Agency.
Climate pledges by governments to date – even if fully achieved – would fall “well short” of what is needed to bring global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to net zero by 2050, according to the report, Net Zero by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector.
The report sets what it described as a “cost-effective and economically productive” pathway resulting in an energy economy “dominated by renewables like solar and wind.”
“The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal… make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director.

“The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal… make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director.
The roadmap sets out more than 400 milestones to guide the transition to net zero by 2050. These include no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment for new coal plants without some form of carbon capture technology. By 2035, the roadmap calls for no sales of new internal combustion engine passenger cars, and by 2040, completion of a shift by the global electricity sector to net-zero emissions.
The report said that a worldwide push to increase energy efficiency is an essential part of these efforts. It said that such a push would result in the global rate of energy efficiency improvements averaging 4% a year through 2030, or about three times the average over the last two decades.

Most of the global reductions in CO2 emissions between now and 2030 would come from technologies available today. But in 2050, almost half the reductions would come from technologies that are currently only at the demonstration or prototype phase.
The IEA report said this demands that governments “quickly increase and reprioritize” spending on research and development. Progress in advanced batteries, electrolyzers for hydrogen, and direct air capture and storage could be impactful, the report said.
The IEA report said that total annual energy investment would grow to $5 trillion by 2030 in the net zero pathway, adding an extra 0.4 percentage points a year to global GDP growth, based on a joint analysis with the International Monetary Fund. The increase in private and government spending would create clean energy jobs, including energy efficiency, as well as in the engineering, manufacturing, and construction industries. All of this would put global GDP 4% higher in 2030 than it would be based on current trends, the report said.
By 2050, global energy demand would be around 8% smaller than today, but able to serve an economy more than twice as big and a population with 2 billion more people. The report said that by that date, almost 90% of electricity generation would come from renewable sources, with solar PV and wind together accounting for almost 70%. Most of the remainder would come from nuclear power.
CS Energy said it is providing EPC services for one of the largest portfolios of distributed generation solar projects to date in Rhode Island. When completed, this 50 MW portfolio will push CS Energy’s total to over 100 MW of clean power projects in the state over the last five years. The latest portfolio will generate lower-cost solar energy for a local university and contribute to the state’s target of 100% Renewable Electricity by 2030.
In 2020, CS Energy completed large-scale solar projects in New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Virginia and is currently constructing over 500 MW of large-scale solar and energy storage projects in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maine, and Ohio.
UL said it acquired Clear Sky Analytics’ software platform and related assets. Clear Sky Analytics co-founders Ajay Saproo and John Corson will join UL. Terms of the deal, which closed May 17, were not disclosed.
The software platform analyzes solar asset performance and provides prescriptive insights. The deal expands UL’s solar offerings and the depth of its solar and wind renewables expertise, which includes advisory services across project life cycle and supply chain.
Since Clear Sky’s inception in March 2017, the company has provided development and operational services for more than 150 solar projects, including prior work with UL.
Residential solar and energy storage provider Sunnova Energy International said it priced $500 million of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026 in a private placement to institutional buyers. Sunnova also granted the initial purchasers of the notes the option to buy up to an additional $75 million of the notes. Sale of the notes is expected to close on May 20.
Sunnova will not be able to redeem the notes prior to June 2024. Sunnova estimated that the net proceeds will be around $487.1 million (or $560.2 million if the initial purchasers exercise their full option to buy additional notes. The company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding debt, for other general corporate purposes, and to finance or refinance, recently completed, pending, or future projects.
Puma Energy and its joint venture partner PASH Global activated a solar power network in 200 Puma service stations on Puerto Rico. The network will generate an estimated 30,000 MWh of renewable energy per year and provide more than 27,700 MT in greenhouse gas savings. Puma Energy also said that a 1,252 kW solar project at its Bayamón Terminal would start up soon.
The joint venture initiative with PASH Global at island service stations includes an investment of $25 million, enabling the petroleum products provider to cover between 50% and 60% of its electric consumption, and save 8% and 10% on its electricity bill.
Fleet electrification provider XL Fleet Corp. acquired World Energy Efficiency Services for $16 million. World Energy provides energy efficiency, renewable technology, electric vehicle charging station, and other energy solutions to customers across the New England region.
The deal included $8.0 million in cash and an obligation to issue shares of XL Fleet common stock valued at $7.0 million. The purchase price is subject to an adjustment for closing date net working capital and an additional earn-out payment of $1.0 million payable based on the achievement of World Energy’s 2021 revenue target.
World Energy generated $18 million of total revenue and was free cash-flow positive for 2020. The transaction was approved by both companies’ Boards of Directors and was closed as of May 17.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/18/the-american-supply-chain-is-alive-and-well/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,NORTH AMERICA",,"MAY 18, 2021",The American supply chain is alive and well!,"The U.S. is on the cusp of a clean energy renaissance, but only if we walk the walk and limit our reliance on foreign supply chains. It’s possible. As a nation of inventors, entrepreneurs, builders and creators, we’ve always been nimble and scrappy enough to switch gears, hit a roadblock or two along the way, clear the path and persevere.
After spending nearly 30 years in the energy industry, and experiencing years of limiting political and market incentives, we have arrived at a moment that is different from any other period in our industry’s recent history. Renewable energy jobs surpassed 11.5 million in 2020.
In the U.S. alone, nearly 1 million people are employed in the renewable energy sector, almost five times more than fossil fuels. Wind service technician is the fastest growing occupation in the U.S. and solar installer is the third fastest growing according to the U.S. Board of Labor Statistics.
Cost is no longer an impediment to progress. The levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, for solar and wind projects are at historic lows and the cost of energy storage systems, which harness this energy and prevent it from being wasted, have plummeted 85% in the last decade and are projected to drop an additional 54% over the next decade.
China has long dominated the solar market, but without energy storage technologies, or simply batteries, renewable energy alone can’t provide the assurances that companies and communities need to feel safe and secure in their electric power supply. Batteries provide a modular, scalable, regional solution that can support the electric grid in the event of an outage, whether caused by extreme weather or a simple maintenance issue.
Recent outages, such as the aftermath of the winter storm in Texas or last summer’s California wildfires, have shown that we’re just one unexpected event away from the reality of a potentially catastrophic grid failure.
As renewables become an increasingly vital part of our complex energy infrastructure, intermittency, or fluctuations between surplus and scarcity of supply, must be managed. Excess production when demand is low, known as curtailment, can be captured and stored to increase the use of renewable energy sources.
In April 2020, California had 15 GW of curtailments, or unusable energy, in a single day—greater than all the energy storage capacity installed globally in 2020. And yet, there was still a scarcity of power when the state experienced 20 days of rolling blackouts last summer. Long duration discharge storage is a critical building block for a more sustainable energy system.
America has the ability to corner the 4-12-hour long-duration energy storage market on a global scale, but only if we have the will to embark on a manufacturing boom that we haven’t seen since the Model T. Investment in our domestic supply chain could alter the course of our economy and usher in a new and long overdue era of “made in America” leadership.
Today, 87% of these batteries are manufactured outside of the U.S. with China alone estimated to account for nearly three-quarters of global production as of the end of 2020. Further, over 95% of batteries deployed for stationary storage in the U.S. today are made from lithium-ion, which can only be sourced from a few countries including China and Korea.

Lithium has its place given its effectiveness at producing short bursts of energy, like those required in electric vehicles, but long duration storage made from safe and sustainable materials will be instrumental to unlocking the clean energy future that America should be marching toward.
At Eos, we’ve been doing this for years, from bringing resilience to the California power grid during last summer’s wildfires to supplying power to remote communities in Nigeria. Our batteries are powered by zinc, a widely available and conflict-free commodity. From there, we take a less-is-more approach—our product is non-flammable, non-toxic, fully recyclable after its life, and efficient in that it can operate in a wide voltage and temperature range.
As President Biden and Congress consider an infrastructure package and dig into U.S. competitiveness, we need to focus on investing in infrastructure and innovation here at home so that we’re better prepared for the next crisis, whatever it may be. We need policies in place to create a level playing field to compete, including a standalone energy storage investment tax credit and the removal of barriers to interconnection and market participation.
The good news is that we’re on the cusp of what could be a rebirth of American manufacturing and innovation in energy resilience as corporations race to reduce emissions and meet climate change goals. The number of companies that set targets and report progress increased nearly 300% from 2019 to 2020 and this figure is likely to grow with the U.S. and other countries setting aggressive targets for carbon mitigation.
I’m proud to say that Eos is leading the way. What if we took an underutilized factory in Pittsburgh and turned it into a modern-day manufacturing facility? We’ve done it. What if we trained Americans who were out of work and placed them into high paying clean jobs? We’ve done it—growing from 50 to 200 employees in just six months. What if every facet of our energy supply chain was sourced with components from the U.S. so that we would never encounter supply shortages? We’ve done it—from our Edison, New Jersey, headquarters to our Voltage Valley suppliers.
We’ve already created 200 jobs in the U.S. and with the right environment to grow, we’ll create more. Let’s supercharge our domestic supply chain and use American ingenuity to source it, manufacture it and scale it now. Energy storage is a critical tool to develop the grid of the future. If we don’t invest in this future today, it won’t be there when we need it the most.
