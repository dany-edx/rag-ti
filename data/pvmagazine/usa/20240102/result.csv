However, domestic battery manufacturing is still in its nascent stages.
Just over a year ago, in quick response to the IRA incentives, a raft of manufacturers announced plans to set up shop in the U.S. And the announcements continue: Freyr announced a multi-phase project that is expected to bring battery manufacturing to Georgia. Kore Power recently received a conditional loan commitment from the DOE Loans Program Office, receiving $850 to build battery cells for electric vehicles and grid-scale storage. LG Energy Solution quadrupled its announced investment in two manufacturing plants in Arizona.
While the announced build-out of domestic manufacturing is promising, many questions remain as to whether the manufacturers can overcome the many hurdles on the way to meeting the growing storage needs. According to the SEIA report, U.S. manufacturing capacity for all lithium-ion battery applications is currently at 60 GWh, while demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the U.S. is likely to increase over six-fold from 18 GWh to 119 GWh by 2030.
The SEIA report forecasts that the announced manufacturing facilities could increase domestic capacity to over 630 GWh over the next five years. However, much of this supply may be directed toward meeting demand of EV manufacturers, rather than that of non-vehicle applications like BESS.
SEIA said over 25% of the new factories have not publicly stated their intended markets and some (if not all) of their capacity may go to BESS, so there is still hope for steady supply.
Material supply and cost
The majority of batteries manufactured in the U.S. are lithium, and while the U.S. has vast reserves of lithium other materials are needed such as phosphorous and graphite. These materials are sourced primarily from outside the U.S., so domestic manufacturers are competing on a global scale, often finding high prices and short supply.
Workforce challenge
As with the rest of the renewable energy buildout, securing a strong, skilled workforce is a challenge. According to the SEIA report, roles critical to energy storage supply chains include mining, chemical and electrical engineers, machine operators, production technicians, and more. While apprenticeship incentives are part of the IRA, growing the workforce long term requires committed collaboration among manufacturers, government agencies, training facilities, and other stakeholders.
Building a domestic renewable energy supply chain includes support for energy storage development at all levels, and the report contends that this will require investment, partnerships with experienced manufacturers, and collaboration with allies

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/02/energy-storage-provider-bluetti-enters-rooftop-solar-market/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 2, 2024",Energy storage provider Bluetti enters rooftop solar market,"Bluetti, a provider of both off-grid portable batteries and home energy storage designed to be paired with solar, has announced it will step into the rooftop residential solar market in Texas.
The company announced Bluetti Solar +, a solar and battery home power solution designed for Texas homeowners.
With a plethora of energy equipment choices, particularly with battery energy storage providers, home solar shoppers are often deterred from moving forward by the complexity of the decisions at hand, said Bluetti. The company said by providing an integrated solar and storage solution and a personal project manager under one roof, these complexities are simplified.
“Embarking on the solar journey promises enduring financial and environmental benefits. However, the intricate processes involving research, paperwork, and coordination among multiple parties can be daunting,” explains Francisco Wang, vice president of business development at Bluetti.
With a system proposal software, the company provides customers with a view of their post-installation residence, expected financial returns, and backup duration of their solar battery system. Once customers approve the proposal, a dedicated BLUETTI Solar + project manager oversees the design, permitting process, paperwork completion, buildout, troubleshooting, and inspector quality assurance.
The company’s home energy offering comes with solar panels, Bluetti energy storage with integrated inverters, and a custom production monitoring system. The panels come with a 25-year manufacturer’s warranty, and the batteries are covered for 10 years.
New battery
Last November, Bluetti introduced a new modular residential battery system. The new EP760 battery system allows for up to four lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries of 4.96 kWh to be stacked, delivering up to 19.8 kWh energy storage capacity.
Bluetti said the system has been designed to respond to growing calls for an affordable home backup system and takes less than 10 milliseconds to switch from grid power to battery power.
The EP760, which operates at 240 V, can be integrated with existing or future solar systems, supporting up to 9,000 W solar charging.
“Even without solar panels, the EP760 offers an intelligent peak load shifting feature that enables homeowners to charge the system when grid electricity is cheap and discharge it during peak hours, reducing overall energy costs,” the company said.
The inverter measures 636 mm x 325 mm x 370 mm and weighs 44 kg. It has three maximum power point tracking (MPPTs) with an input voltage range of 150 V to 550 V and an efficiency of 97%. The maximum PV input voltage is 500 V. Each battery module measures 636 mm x 325 mm x 338 mm and weighs 58 kg.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/02/first-solar-closes-700-million-in-tax-credit-transfer-sales/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 2, 2024",First Solar closes $700 million in tax credit transfer sales,"U.S. thin-film solar module manufacturer First Solar announced it closed two separate tax credit transfer agreements to sell $500 million and $200 million of Inflation Reduction Act advanced manufacturing tax credits.
Under the tax credit transfer, Fiserv agreed to pay $0.96 per $1 of tax credits to First Solar during the first half of 2024, inclusive of fees and commissions paid by First Solar to the placement agent. Fiserv is a global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions. Citigroup Global Markets acted as placement agent for the transfer of Section 45X tax credits.
The tax credits were generated as a result of the sale of solar modules produced in 2023 by First Solar in the United States, including at its new factory in Ohio.
“This is the IRA delivering on its intent, which is to incentivize high value domestic manufacturing by providing manufacturers with the liquidity they need to reinvest in growth and innovation,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “This agreement establishes an important precedent for the solar industry, confirming the marketability and value of Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credits.”
The deal from First Solar marks one of the first major sales of 45x tax credits. The deal was inked on December 22, 2023, less than two weeks after guidelines for accessing the credit were released.
“As it relates to the 2023 financial year, we expect a pre- and post-tax impact of up to $28 million, resulting in a reduction of our diluted earnings of up to $0.26 per share for the year,” said Alex Bradley, chief financial officer, First Solar.
First Solar has the option of receiving these funds either as a tax benefit or a direct cash payment from the U.S. Department of Treasury. The company opted for the Tax Credit Transfer over the Direct Payment option, citing the ability to monetize it 12 to 18 months sooner through a third party. This third party can immediately apply the credit to their own tax liability and provide an instant cash payment to First Solar. In contrast, the Direct Payment would only be processed after First Solar files its tax returns, potentially delaying funds until the second or third quarter of 2024, pending the Internal Revenue Service’s processing and refund issuance.
First Solar’s vertically integrated solar manufacturing facilities are unique in their production of the entire supply chain. This was highlighted in an industry note released by Roth MKM on December 14, 2023, suggesting that First Solar may qualify for the full $0.175/W wafer, cell, and module credit.
Calculations based on the $700 million credit, valued at $0.96 on the dollar, indicate a total manufacturing credit of approximately $729 million. This implies that First Solar manufactured around 4.16 GW of solar panels eligible for the credit in 2023, at a rate of $0.175/W.

With First Solar’s average sales price at $0.32/W, the tax credit amounts to roughly 55% of the cost of their solar panels. This, combined with the potentially higher value of the IRA’s Production Tax Credit compared to some power purchase agreement costs, and the downward trend in solar module pricing due to massive capacity expansions, leads to an intriguing possibility. It’s conceivable that power purchase agreements could be signed at $0.00/kWh before the 45X manufacturer’s credit expires in 2029.
Currently, no other U.S. manufacturers are eligible for the comprehensive suite of solar module manufacturing tax credits. While a number of manufacturers are eligible for the solar module assembly tax credit, eligibility for the cell credit is notably scarce, and this rarity extends to credits for wafers and solar glass as well. Q Cell might benefit from the polysilicon tax credit due to the partial operation of the Moses Lake facility by the end of 2023. However, this polysilicon must be exported and processed into wafers and cells prior to being installed in Q Cell modules, as their facilities are not fully operational yet.
In addition to boosting U.S. manufacturing, transferability of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are also gaining momentum in the developer space. Read more about strategies to utilize credits in solar project development here.
“Over the past year, nearly $100 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments have been announced, with plans for close to 100 new facilities across the U.S.,” said José Zayas, executive vice president of policy and programs for the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
First Solar expects to invest over $2 billion in new manufacturing facilities in Alabama and Louisiana and expansions in its Ohio plants. The company expects to have 14 GW of vertically integrated U.S. solar manufacturing capacity by 2026. It is also investing up to $370 million in a research and development center in Perrysburg, Ohio, expected to be complete by 2024.
“This remarkable progress is only just beginning. Projections show the Section 45X manufacturing tax credit will help spur billions of dollars in new economic activity over its life,” said Zayas.

Although total global solar capacity will continue to increase rapidly over the next decade, the pace of installation growth will begin to slow in 2024, compared to rates seen in recent years.
According to the head of Wood Mackenzie’s global solar division, if the forecasts for 2023 are met, the average annual growth of PV installations from 2019 to this year will have been 28%, including a 56% increase in 2023 compared to 2022.
However, on average, the current pace will be maintained and there will be no annual growth from 2024 to 2028, which will include some years with contractions. Wood Mackenzie is forecasting 270 GW of new solar installations worldwide for this year, while the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects additions of 349 GW for 2023.
Global solar market growth follows the typical S-curve. In recent years, growth has increased rapidly at the steepest part of the curve. Starting in 2024, the sector will pass the inflection point, characterized by a slower growth pattern. The global solar market is still many times larger than it was a few years ago, but it is natural for an industry to follow this growth path as it matures.
Not all regions are currently at the same point on the S-curve. Africa and the Middle East, for example, have a long way to go before reaching their growth inflection points. Two large markets are driving this growth pattern on a global scale, however: Asia-Pacific, dominated by China, and Europe. It is worth remembering that any change of course in China has a strong impact on the world market since the country leads new capacity additions, with some 180 GW that will be connected this year.
What could affect this slowdown is the global commitment to the energy transition. On December 13, world governments meeting at the UN COP28 climate convention in Dubai agreed to what was described as a “historic” declaration, setting for the first time a target for the transition from fossil fuels. This objective establishes a change of course for the global energy system. Oil, gas and coal consumption continues to grow, although more slowly, and all three fuels reached new all-time highs in 2023. In addition, COP28 agreed to triple renewables by 2030.
Global coal demand will increase by 1.4% in 2023, exceeding 8.5 billion tons for the first time. While in the European Union and the United States consumption is expected to increase by around 20%, in India and China it will remain strong, with 8% and 5% respectively in 2023. By 2026, however, it is expected that global coal consumption will decrease by 2.3% compared to 2023 levels.
Renewable energy is also booming. According to Wood Mackenzie, global wind and solar energy production in 2023 is 55% higher than in 2020.

While flow batteries have been around for a while, they have failed to gain traction and excite investors. However, one of the most promising startups in the field, Germany’s CMBlu Energy, recently pulled in more than $100 million in investments and is gradually expanding its market presence.
CMBlu’s technology recently caught the attention of the DoE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), which has tasked two prestigious labs, the DoE’s Argonne National Laboratory and Idaho National Laboratory, with validating its credentials.
Over the course of the project, Argonne and Idaho National Laboratory will deploy and evaluate CMBlu Energy’s Organic SolidFlow battery technology with the goal to provide insights for bolstering the resilience of microgrids. The project also seeks to make fast charging of electric vehicles more affordable in rural and underserved communities by reducing charging facility installation and operational costs.
OCED selected the initiative in September to be one of six demonstration projects as part of a long-duration energy storage lab call.
“We’re honored to participate in this project with two preeminent research teams that are advancing clean energy,” said Ben Kaun, president of CMBlu Energy. “The unique capabilities and resources of Argonne and [Idaho National Laboratory] will enable CMBlu to accelerate the commercialization of our Organic SolidFlow battery solution. Our long-duration energy storage is designed to support grid resilience and integration for EV fast charging and microgrid applications, and this demonstration is an excellent opportunity to validate its real-world performance.”
The project will span two regions. In the Midwest, Argonne researchers plan to demonstrate the effectiveness of CMBlu’s technology at the lab’s Smart Energy Plaza. The plaza is a fully renovated and repurposed gas station designed to conduct research on the integration and management of electric vehicle charging, renewables, building systems, and energy storage. Argonne researchers will gather data and analyze how the technology can inform real-world scenarios.
“Demonstration projects, especially those at national labs, efficiently mature our understanding of new technologies in key use cases,” said battery scientist Sue Babinec, program lead for stationary storage at Argonne. “This collaborative project will validate CMBlu’s Organic SolidFlow battery while providing a path for expansion of electric vehicles to underserved communities.”
At the Idaho National Laboratory Battery Test Center in Idaho, researchers will conduct performance tests, including assessing how well the Organic SolidFlow batteries perform at different temperatures. This rigorous testing is crucial to ensure the technology’s reliability in diverse environments. The Idaho National Laboratory center serves as the DoE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s (EERE) primary center for battery life and performance testing.
“This awarded work provides a unique avenue to showcase the strengths of [Idaho National Laboratory] and Argonne to explore flow battery performance at colder-than-room temperatures, relevant to energy storage needs at northern latitudes and winter conditions,” said Kevin Gering, a distinguished staff scientist at Idaho National Laboratory. “We are enthusiastic about applying our collective expertise to understand CMBlu’s Organic SolidFlow battery’s performance so the technology can find those critical niches it can thrive within.”
While other redox flow batteries use metal ions, CMBlu’s Organic SolidFlow batteries use carbon-based molecules for its electrolytes. According to the company, certain carbon-based molecules have the intrinsic ability to be oxidized and reduced or charged and discharged. These molecules are essential elements in the “redox” reactions that power all living cells. 
Energy converter stacks are at the heart of CMBlu’s modular redox flow battery technology. Both reduction and oxidation take place in these stacks although separate from each other. According to CMBlu, the battery output depends on the material and surface area of the electrodes, as well as the kinetics of the redox process. Increasing the stack size yields a higher output.
CMBlu fills two separate storage tanks with a solid polymer and then transfers it to and from the liquid electrolyte, which is pumped into an electrode stack for charging and discharging cycles.
The company’s storage technology is intended for use in large-scale, multi-hour stationary projects. The company says it has a “potentially unlimited” cycle life with proper maintenance. It offers up to 90% efficiency, approaching the 95% efficiency of lithium-ion batteries. It can be easily scaled to GWh scale, says CMBlu. The technology is touted as non-flammable.
The company is currently developing multiple pilot projects in the United States and Europe to demonstrate its technology. It has active projects with WEC Energy Group in Wisconsin, Salt River Project in Arizona, and several sites in Europe, including Austrian energy supplier Burgerland Energie’s 300 MWh project.
CMBlu was among the winners of the 2018 pv magazine Annual Award for its organic flow battery tech.

DOE aims to “pinpoint” areas where consumers are harmed by inadequate transmission, whether by higher electricity prices, more frequent power outages from extreme weather, or longer outages.
Designation of a National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC), as authorized by the Federal Power Act, makes federal financing and permitting tools available for transmission deployment.
NIETC designations will be based on:
DOE’s National Transmission Needs Study found that 54,500 GW-miles of within-region transmission must be added for a clean grid under “the most likely power sector future.” Interregional transfer capacities to transmit electricity between regions would also need to increase by nearly 125 GW, the study said.
DOE invites information and recommendations regarding NIETC designation by February 2, as detailed in its guidance. The department expects to release a preliminary list of potential NIETC designations in the spring, and will then invite information in response to that list. DOE is hosting a webinar on the process on January 3.
Federal financing available for transmission projects in NIETC corridors includes public-private partnerships through the Transmission Facilitation Program under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and direct loans through the Transmission Facility Financing Program under the Inflation Reduction Act.
NIETC designation also allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue permits for the siting of transmission lines within a NIETC corridor “under certain circumstances” where state siting authorities do not have authority to site the line, have not acted on an application for over a year, or have denied an application.
DOE anticipates re-opening the NIETC designation process after each publication of its triennial National Transmission Needs Study or as determined by the Secretary of Energy.
