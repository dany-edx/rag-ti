The installation is intended to return $10 million in clean energy and support services to the university. First Solar is making a donation valued at $300,000 that includes more than 2,000 of First Solar’s Series 6 thin film modules, totaling nearly 1 MW of capacity. The remaining 2 MW of capacity will also use Series 6 modules.
The project will be constructed at the 9H Ranch near the university, on land owned by 9H co-founder and UW alumnus, Gene Humphrey.
9H is sponsoring a yearlong renewable energy design challenge for UW engineering seniors. With this latest project, 9H plans to hire additional student interns as well as funding $15,000 worth of projects for seven student groups to design and build solar and energy storage projects out of the new research facility.
Support for solar energy research and development at the state-funded university in Wyoming is especially significant, considering the state’s solar history.

To date, the state has installed roughly 140 MW of solar, good for 40th most in the nation, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA projects the state will add 178 MW of PV over the next five years, making it 47th in the nation over that span.
Utility PacifiCorp, in its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan, outlined plans to add 1,415 MW of new solar in Wyoming, paired with 354 MW of battery storage, to be phased in between 2024 and 2038. This capacity was planned to replace retiring coal-fired generating units, including Jim Bridger units 1 through 4; Naughton units 1, 2 and 3; and Dave Johnston units 1 through 4.
There is also the 240 MW Dinosolar project, developed by Enyo and planned for construction near Casper, Wyoming, in the west-central part of the state. Not much has come out about that project since the Natrona County Planning Commission issued the project a permit in May 2020; but, if completed, it would be the largest installation in the state, nearly doubling Wyoming’s entire installed capacity thus far by itself.
Once the 9H Ranch research project becomes operational, all of its energy proceeds will be donated back to the university.
Additional partners helping fund the 9H Research Foundation and student projects include Creative Energies Solar, Wyoming-NASA Space Grant Consortium, Alt E Wind and Solar, Black Bean Capital Partners, RiskThinking.AI, and Climate Risk Labs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/08/bill-would-mandate-rooftop-solar-on-new-homes-and-commercial-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,MASSACHUSETTS",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 8, 2021",Bill would mandate rooftop solar on new homes and commercial buildings,"Massachusetts lawmakers proposed a bill that would require rooftop solar on new residential and commercial buildings.
The Solar Neighborhoods Act (H.D.3098) would mandate that solar panels be installed on the roofs of newly built homes, apartments, and office buildings. A companion bill, S.D.159, was filed in the Senate.
A bill summary said that all new buildings would need to be built “solar-ready.” Within one year of the bill’s passage, the Department of Energy Resources (DOER) would develop and adopt amendments to the state’s building code to ensure that roofs are strong enough to support solar panels, that available roof space is maximized, and that buildings can make room for necessary electrical infrastructure.
For single-family homes, the solar energy system would need to produce enough electricity each year to meet 80% of the average demand for similar houses. For other buildings, DOER would set minimum solar energy system requirements.
Buildings may be exempted if the roof is too shaded, if a solar hot water system or other renewable energy technology is installed, or if the building has a green roof. The DOER also could grant exemptions to affordable housing developments.
The House bill is modeled after a similar policy in California.
In 2018, California became the first state to require that all new homes be built with solar panels starting in 2020. The mandate is expected to significantly expand the country’s leading solar market, which currently has more than 29 GW of installed capacity.
Last year, Environment America began championing rooftop solar mandates in 10 states, including Massachusetts. A report from the environmental advocacy group found that such a mandate in the Bay State would add more than 2.3 GW of solar capacity by 2045. That’s almost equal to Massachusetts’ total installed capacity, including utility-scale solar, of about 2.9 GW.
One town near Boston already requires new commercial and multi-family buildings to include rooftop solar.
Last legislative session, the state’s Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy gave a favorable report to similar legislation. However, the solar bill did not advance to a vote on the floor of either chamber.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/08/developer-plans-10-mw-community-solar-project-at-n-y-landfill/,"COMMUNITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 8, 2021",Developer plans 10 MW community solar project at N.Y. landfill,"Source Renewables, a New York clean energy developer, said it plans to use a landfill in South Buffalo as the host site for two community solar arrays totaling 10 MW.
Source Renewables applied to the City of Buffalo to rezone the landfill to accommodate a distributed generation solar farm. According to the company, the project would consist of two 5 MW solar arrays expected to produce enough electricity to power more than 2,500 households per year.
The Marilla Street Landfill was used as a disposal area by the former Republic Steel Co. for waste from steelmaking operations. A group called Steelfields acquired the property in 2002 and provided state agency monitors with environmental information.
Source Renewables said the proposed community solar project represents an opportunity to repurpose the property to produce clean electricity, create jobs, increase tax revenue, and save money for local residents who can’t install their own solar.
The company’s South Buffalo expansion follows its recent sale of a 17 MW community solar portfolio to Distributed Solar Development, an energy venture company owned by BlackRock.

First Solar said it is in talks with Rio Tinto to procure the mineral for its cadmium telluride (CadTel) semiconductor processing in the United States.
The mineral is a byproduct of copper smelting. Rio Tinto said it expects to start production in the fourth quarter, creating a new North American supply for the mineral. The Utah plant will have a capacity to produce around 20 tonnes of tellurium per year.
First Solar uses a layer of CadTel semiconductor that is 3% the thickness of a human hair. It said that CadTel is efficient, cost-competitive, and fast to produce, helping it make its modules in around 4.5 hours. First Solar said that CadTel technology has a carbon footprint that is around 2.5 times lower than crystalline silicon panels.
First Solar sources its CadTel from suppliers in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. It declined to disclose quantities or names of suppliers, but said that Rio Tinto’s supply, if contracted, “could add to existing sources.”
For its part, Rio Tinto is looking to extract more from each rock it mines in order to reduce waste and meet demand for critical minerals.
Tellurium also can be used as an additive to steel and copper to improve machinability, making these metals easier to cut, as well as added to lead to increase resistance to sulfuric acid, vibration, and fatigue.
Kennecott’s smelting process in Utah also recovers gold, silver, lead carbonate, platinum, palladium, and selenium. Elsewhere, Rio Tinto is investing in facilities to extract battery-grade lithium from waste rock at its Boron, California, mine site, and scandium oxide from waste streams at a complex in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec.

Texas utility regulators declined on March 5 to roll back some of the $16 billion that the state’s grid operator may have overcharged power companies during February’s winter storm. For now, at least, regulators are signaling that Texans should live with the downside of a power market that can have rare, but eye-watering, price spikes.
At least some Texas electricity customers could have benefited from a move to adjust the electricity market prices for the week of the storm.
“I totally get how it looks like you’re protecting consumers” by readjusting electric prices, Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Chair Arthur D’Andrea was quoted as saying. “But I promise you you’re not.” D’Andrea was named by Gov. Greg Abbott to replace DeAnn Walker as chair following her resignation in early March over the PUC’s handling of the power crisis.
D’Andrea reportedly said that a retroactive decision would have winners and losers. “You don’t know who you’re hurting. And you think you’re protecting the consumer, and it turns out you’re bankrupting [someone else],” he was quoted as saying.
Independent market monitor Potomac Economics had called on regulators to roll back the market price for power for at least part of the week of the storm. During the storm, regulators directed the Electric Reliability Corporation of Texas (ERCOT) to set wholesale power prices at $9,000/MWh, the maximum price.
ERCOT remained at its highest level of emergency alert until the morning of Feb. 19, five days after the storm hit. Potomac Economics said that correcting the apparent overcharge would not result in any revenue shortfalls for ERCOT’s generation resources. It said that corrected prices would cover the generator’s as-offered costs and reflect the actual supply, demand, and reserves during the roughly 33 hours from midnight Feb. 18 to 9:00 a.m. Feb. 19.
Microinverter company Enphase Energy said that Urban Solar deployed a large-scale commercial solar system using its technology at the Praxis of Deerfield Beach senior living community in Florida. Solar arrays cover nine buildings and are expected to produce more than 1 million kWh of electricity in its first year of operation. Enphase said it supplied almost 1,800 of its IQ 7+ microinverters managed by nine Envoy communications gateway devices. The gateway devices connect to a software monitoring platform. The 224-unit senior living community is owned by MRK Partners. It was originally built in a master meter configuration, for which the local utility required the use of a single-phase solar system.
Canadian Solar completed the sale of two operational projects in Japan totaling 61 MW to Canadian Solar Infrastructure Fund for roughly $283 million. To finance the acquisition of the 53 MW Oita Hiji-machi and 8 MW Miyagi Ogawara projects, the infrastructure fund recently raised more than $166 million on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Canadian Solar participated in the deal and owns 15% of the infrastructure fund, which also issued more than $175 million of long-term debt to maintain its capital structure. Since the infrastructure fund’s listing in October 2017, it has grown to own 25 solar power plants totaling 184 MW across Japan.
