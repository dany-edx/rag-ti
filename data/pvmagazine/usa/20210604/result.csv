The bill was introduced by San Diego Assembly member Lorena Gonzalez in February.
The bill went to the full Assembly for a vote on June 2, but was 16 votes shy of the 41 needed to pass. It was brought up for reconsideration later that afternoon, but again failed to receive enough votes. On June 3, the bill was moved into the state legislature’s Inactive File, meaning it will not be voted on again during this year’s legislative session. It could be reintroduced in January 2022.
The bill looked to cut net metering rates paid to rooftop solar customers and remove some benefits for existing solar customers. In late May the draft bill was significantly revised by lawmakers.
The revisions removed a section that would have lowered net metering rates to wholesale electricity rates. That would have worked out to roughly 3 cents per kWh, a drop from the current range of 20+ cents per kWh. The revision also returned the length of time that legacy net metering rates would be given to existing customers to 20 years, instead of 10 years.
The watered-down revision of AB 1139 also would have given California’s Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) an extra six months to make its own decision regarding a net metering successor tariff, extending the deadline to August 2022. The initial bill included provisions that would have taken effect had the CPUC not hit a February deadline.
Even with the revisions, the bill came up short twice in the legislature and is off the table for now.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/04/ferc-opens-the-door-for-solar-advocates-to-take-alabama-regulators-to-court/,"BANKRUPTCY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ALABAMA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 4, 2021",FERC opens the door for solar advocates to take Alabama regulators to court,"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has declined to grant a petition to initiate enforcement action against the Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC) for allowing Alabama Power to impose punitive charges against customers with rooftop or on-site solar.
While this may initially sound like inaction against those charges, the decision opens a lane for the petitioners to pursue their case against the PSC in federal court. FERC’s decision not to enforce was expected.
In support of the petitioners’ case, FERC Chairman Richard Glick and Commissioner Allison Clements expressed their concern that the PSC may be violating federal law by discouraging rooftop or customer-sited solar growth in Alabama.
I joined with @FERC Chairman @RichGlickFERC today to express our concern that the Alabama PSC is imposing backup charges for QF solar customers that may violate PURPA requirements. Here’s our full joint statement: https://t.co/XyX1EUoNKH
— Allison Clements (@ClementsFERC) June 2, 2021

In their joint statement, Commissioners Clements and Glick found that “[p]etitioners have presented a strong case that the Alabama Commission failed to adhere to regulations set forth in FERC Order No. 69 [FERC’s order establishing its PURPA regulations], violating the requirements of [federal law].”
The charge igniting this case is a monthly capacity fee of $5.41/kW that solar customers have been paying since 2013. The petitioners behind the case are four owners of small PV systems – ranging from 2 to 6 kW – and a local nonprofit, the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution (GASP). The petition was filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) and Ragsdale LLC on the PV owners and GASP’s behalf.
The petitioners argue that Alabama Power’s solar fixed charges violate the PURPA regulations. PURPA prohibits rates for sales of electricity that discriminate against qualifying facilities, and the petitioners submit that their systems qualify.
Additionally the group maintains that the solar fixed charges are not based on a cost-of-service study, nor consistent systemwide costing principles, arguing that both are required under PURPA. The petition adds that the charges are based on lost revenues resulting from reduced customer usage, which is not unique to solar adoption, making them discriminatory.
“We are pleased that Chairman Glick and Commissioner Clements recognize the apparent illegality in how Alabama Power, with the full support of the Alabama Public Service Commission, is treating customers who make private investments in rooftop or customer-sited solar,” said Keith Johnston, Director of SELC’s Alabama office. “We are now prepared to take the next step of seeking relief from a federal district court so that Alabama Power customers can finally reap the benefits of solar to the same degree as customers in other solar-rich states.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/04/sunrise-brief-watch-how-this-solar-array-will-boost-the-international-space-stations-power-capacity/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 4, 2021",Sunrise brief: Watch how this solar array will boost the International Space Station’s power capacity,"The latest SpaceX Dragon resupply spacecraft left NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 3, carrying more than 7,300 pounds of science experiments as well as new solar arrays for the International Space Station (ISS).
The resupply mission will deliver a new ISS Roll-out Solar Array (iROSA), produced by Redwire, to the space station in the trunk of the Dragon spacecraft. After the Dragon docks to the space station’s Harmony module, the robotic Canadarm2 will extract two arrays, the first of six arrays to be delivered to the station. Astronauts will install them during spacewalks planned for June 16 and 20. The power upgrade costs around $100 million.

The iROSA technology is based on a previous demonstration of roll-out panels performed on the station in 2017. Redwire said the array’s design uses composite booms to serve as both the primary structural elements and the deployment actuator. These are paired with a modular photovoltaic blanket assembly.
Instead of using motors for deployment, iROSA uses stored energy from carbon fiber booms that are cut and rolled back against their natural shape for storage. When it is time for them to be deployed, the stored strain energy of the booms enforces the unrolling deployment actuation. When fully deployed, the now-rigid booms provide the solar arrays’ structural stiffness and strength.
The new solar arrays will be attached at a slight angle to an outboard set of the lab’s existing arrays to provide additional power, helping make up for age-related degradation. While the new panels are smaller than the originals, they produce more power.
Energy Internet Corp. said it is working with Intel to develop a reference design based on long-duration energy storage to accelerate the adoption of sustainable carbon-neutral computing in data centers.
EIC said that long-duration energy storage will provide “more resilient and available” carbon free renewable power to data centers, at costs lower than today’s designs.
As part of its scope of work, EIC will incorporate its software defined machines (SDM) and liquid piston heat engine (LPHE) technology into reference design architecture to offer a variety of energy storage offerings for different segments in the data center market.
The reference architecture will be tailored for different data center classes, such as remote/edge, medium scale (up to 50 MW) and hyperscale (greater than 50MW). The reference architecture will make use of EIC’s zero-carbon long-duration (more than 10 days) energy storage solution.
All sources for U.S. energy consumption totaled 92.9 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) in 2020, a record 7% decrease from 2019. Consumption fell for all fuels compared with 2019 except renewable energy, which rose by 2%. Petroleum consumption fell 13%, natural gas was down 2%, coal sank 19%, and nuclear electric power was off by 2%.
The data was provided by the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA). It converted sources of energy to British thermal units to compare different types of energy that are usually measured in units that are not directly comparable.
In 2020, the sector consumed 60% of all renewable energy used, a level last reached in 1998.

The electric power sector has made up around one-half or more of U.S. renewable energy consumption since the 1960s. In 2020, the sector consumed 60% of all renewable energy used, a level last reached in 1998. The industrial sector’s share of U.S. renewable consumption has fallen from about 30% to 20% in the last 15 years. In that time, the transportation sector’s share has grown to more than 10%, mostly because of increased fuel ethanol consumption. U.S. residential and commercial sectors consistently account for less than 10% of combined U.S. renewable consumption.
In 2020, U.S. energy consumption decreased in all four end-use sectors after accounting for electrical system energy losses. Transportation sector consumption fell 14% from 2019 levels, the industrial sector declined by 4%, the residential sector by 3%, and the commercial sector by 7%. Industrial sector consumption exceeded transportation sector consumption for the first time since 1999 after accounting for energy losses.
