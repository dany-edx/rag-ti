Panels lay flat upon the ground as “earth mount solar” installations, casting aside the use of trackers, mounts, and racks for a low-material approach. 
The dramatic reduction in panel cost in recent years has fueled this change. According to Erthos, at current module prices, it is more cost-effective to buy additional solar modules to make up for the loss of efficiency from foregoing trackers.
Erthos says it can install projects in half the time of typical utility scale plants, at nearly half the cost, with costs running less than $0.50/W. The simple, flat outlay of the panels require 70% less underground trenching, 70% less cable, and very little water consumption, according to the Tempe, AZ based startup. The project is not anchored into the ground, so there is no digging cost and no sub-surface risk to contend with as well.  
The design eliminates the use of gaps between rows and the array is installed as a large unified sheet, and Erthos said this allows their project to use one third the land area of a conventional utility scale solar design. While this approach is land-conscious, it is not compatible with a new approach some developers are adopting to support native grasslands, and to prevent erosion and flooding.
A key feature of the flat-faced system is an autonomous robot that rolls around on the panels and clears them of soiling. As part of their energy services division, Erthos maintains the cleaning robot, and claims less than 1% soiling through the life of their 20-year operations, maintenance, and cleaning contract.
Since the panels lay completely flat on the ground, Erthos says their projects are resistant to category-four hurricanes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/25/reviewing-energy-storage-targets-as-maine-becomes-the-ninth-state-to-participate/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,CONNECTICUT,MAINE,MASSACHUSETTS,NEVADA,NEW JERSEY,NEW YORK,OREGON,UNITED STATES,VIRGINIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 25, 2021",Reviewing energy storage targets as Maine becomes the ninth state to participate,"Maine has joined the trend of adding state energy storage targets, becoming the ninth state to do so. Signed by Governor Janet Mills, the target sets out a plan for 300 MW capacity by the end of 2025, 400 MW through 2030. After that, the Governor’s Energy Office will reevaluate every two years for new storage goals. 
The state’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) also plans to configure new electricity rate designs to encourage energy storage growth by the end of 2022. Such structures will include time-of-use rates and incentives to lower peak demand for power. 
The bill outlines four actions that will be taken to achieve this goal: 
The state has begun work towards the achieving the goal, enacting a program that will deploy 15 MW of storage in critical care facilities. 
Energy storage market assessment studies will be conducted by the Energy Office of the governor with a report due March next year. 
The state joins Connecticut, California, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Nevada and Oregon in creating energy storage targets as part of their decarbonization plans.
A wide range of strategies have been enacted. Maine’s policy sits between New York, who has legally mandated the deployment of storage, and New Jersey, who’s lofty 2 GW storage target has been viewed as aspirational and unproductive, lacking robust integrated incentives and rate structures.
Here’s a look into the targets set by the other eight states:
Connecticut was the second most recent state to enact an energy storage target, setting its sights on 300MW by year’s end 2024, 1 GW by 2030. The act seeks to provide net positive present value to ratepayers, provide resiliency and demand-response benefits, support the state-based energy storage industry, and maximize value through the participation in capacity markets.
The state will consider both behind-the-meter and front-of-meter applications, and is due to report the status of program developments related to the targets by the end of 2021. It will support programs and rate designs that avoid or defer investment in traditional electric distribution capacity upgrades, placing priority on the use of battery storage. 
Launched in 2015 by Governor Baker’s administration, the Massachusetts Energy Storage Initiative targets 1,000 MWh of storage capability by 2025. As of February 15, electric distribution companies have reported 179 MWh of storage with an additional 874 MWh in the pipeline. One reason such a large backlog sits in the pipeline is due to transmission cost-sharing issues in the Bay State.
In May, the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources held a stakeholder event discussing the potential of including energy storage technologies in the state’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (APS), and the addition of potential energy storage incentives. The event resulted in the creation of a Clean Peak Energy Standard, but storage was rejected from being included in the APS.
The state also released a study that reviews the cost benefits of storage associated with reduced peak demand, deferred transmission, distribution, and capacity investments, reduced emissions, reduced cost of renewables integration, and increased grid flexibility, reliability and resiliency. The study identified use cases for storage, highlighted barriers to battery adoption, and recommended policies and programs for proper storage valuation. Near and long term workforce benefits to Massachusetts were evaluated as well.
In 2018, Governor Cuomo announced a legal mandate of 1.5 GW by 2025, and 3 GW by 2030.
The target focuses on stimulating third-party investment, uncovering and rewarding locational and time-of-use values, and removing impediments to accessing finance and data that highlight areas of the grid with the greatest need for the benefits of storage.
The act authorized $350 million in bridge incentives, including funding for solar-plus-storage projects within the NY Sun initiative, plus another $53 million to support the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).
The state directed New York’s six utilities to hold competitive procurements for a minimum of 350 MW of bulk-sited energy storage. Recommendations to improve wholesale market design and improve distributed energy resources are a key part of New York’s plan, as well.
The evaluation of training needs and training inventory, and investments in workforce development will aid New York’s storage deployment goals.
New Jersey has targeted 2 GW of deployment by 2030, signed into law by Governor Murphy in 2018. It set a goal of 600 MW by 2021, but largely has not seen a lot of progress towards that number.
One hurdle has been a state analysis by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) that found few economic uses for storage in the near term. A report by Rutgers University analyzed the value of storage, but declined to endorse policy intervention, citing the lack of a strong financial case.
The state has release an Energy Master Plan but it only mentioned that the BPU is “preparing to establish a process and mechanisms to achieve the state’s energy storage goals.” Without clear market-based solutions or significant investments, New Jersey will struggle to hit its 2 GW goal.
Often a pioneer in alternative energy technologies, California authorized the state’s Public Utility Council (CPUC) to evaluate and determine energy storage targets in 2010. The CPUC issued a decision in 2013 to mandate a procurement target of 1,325 MW by 2020, and set three primary goals: one, grid optimization for peak reduction and reliability support, and the deferral of transmission and distribution upgrade investments; two, the integration of renewable energy: and three, the reduction of greenhouse gas emission.
Data: EIA
The California Energy Storage Alliance (CESA) commissioned consultancy group Strategen to forecast storage needs. They determined that meeting an interim goal of 60% renewable penetration by 2030 will itself spur a requirement of between 2 GW and 11 GW of long-duration energy storage. If California is to achieve its target of being net-zero with carbon emissions by 2045, the state will need to deploy between 45 GW to 55 GW of long-duration storage.
In 2020, Virginia changed state laws to allow renewables to be developed more swiftly through a permit by rule (PBR) program for projects under 150 MW. This year, the PBR was extended to energy storage projects. This is in pursuit of Virginia’s mandate of 3.1 GW of energy storage by 2035.
The Virginia Clean Energy Association (VCEA) set some guidelines for this program. At least ten percent of storage must be behind-the-meter. 35% of storage must be procured from non-utility third parties, and projects must not exceed 500 MW in a single project to count towards the mandate, save one 800 MW pumped hydro project. These restrictions help ensure a dispersed and diverse set of installations to better meet demand-response and transmission-congestion related issues.
The VCEA listed several use cases for storage including commercial customer bill management, co-location with renewables, peaker plant alternatives, microgrids for resiliency, and merchant wholesale services. The state will utilize the Commonwealth Opportunity Fund and the Virginia Talent Accelerator program to provide “deal-closing” funds and occupational training in support of energy storage development.
Nevada aims for 1 GW of storage by 2030, as adopted by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) of Nevada. Described as “goals, not mandates”, the regulations set forth sets targets for utilities with gross annual operating revenues of $250 million or more in the state, and requires energy storage as part of their integrated resource plans.
The PUC was given authority to “waive or defer compliance under certain circumstances” and can also change the targets at will.
The plan sets biennial targets of a compounding 200 MW at each point of review. It calls for setting forth points of interconnection for the implementation of storage systems.
Several facets of this goal were listed in the plan, including the integration of renewable energy, grid reliability improvement, peak demand response, grid investment deferral, the replacement of ancillary services by fossil fuel plants, and the reduction of greenhouse gases. However, the state’s plan lacks program deployment and funding as demonstrated by some of its peers.
Oregon was another early adopter of energy storage targets, setting an initial goal of 5 MWh by the end of 2019. It was supported by $2 million individual rebates for consumers of $2,500 for battery deployment, and up to $15,000 for low-income service provider supplying batteries.
The state has a renewables portfolio standard of 50% by 2040, lagging some of the other states mentioned here. A renewal of an energy storage target has not yet been set.
In 2018, Arizona proposed a 3 GW by 2050 target, but it was not enacted. The Arizona Corporation Commission has long presided over battles between alternative energy advocates and the grid operators in the state. It is unclear if a new plan will be enacted. However, with a growing set of use cases and data supporting the benefits of storage, it is likely Arizona and other states across the union will take notice of which state plans nurtured growth and resiliency.
The most recent bills, namely from Maine and Connecticut, draw directly from the state-level energy storage target design framework built by the Energy Storage Association (ESA) this year. The framework establishes three major principles:
First, states should use targets to support market growth of storage, informing the size, structure, and timeline of storage events. ESA recommended using short-term “learning by doing” targets to jumpstart investment while longer-term goals are evaluated.
“Rule of thumb” metrics are recommended to establish short-term targets (for example, percent of peak demand or percent of renewables.) Longer-term goals should be tied to the associated benefits, such as resilience, peak demand reduction, renewable portfolio standard support, and decarbonization
Second, ESA said storage target metrics, review, and accountability mechanisms should be set in accordance with a state’s overall policy goals. Review structures should be set up to analyze progress toward the target and should strive to be aligned with existing energy planning and procurement processes. 
Third, the framework said storage targets should aim to deploy a diversity of project sizes, types, and business models.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/25/how-do-we-prevent-solar-fires-if-we-dont-know-anything-about-them/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,O&M,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 25, 2021",How do we prevent solar fires if we don’t know anything about them?,"PV system fires have a tendency to strike a nerve within the industry. While rare compared to other system disaster events, such occurrences always garner considerable attention, and no installer or manufacturer wants to have their handiwork or hardware at the center of such a disaster.
The issue with solar system fires is how little is known about them. Questions have lingered for years as to what the common causes are, where system failures are occurring, and how often these failures could happen. These questions are the same ones being pursued by Dr. John R. Balfour, president of High Performance PV, and Lawrence Shaw, chief solar systems engineer at Higher Powered, LLC.
To Balfour and Shaw, the most clear and pressing issue with preventing PV system fires is how little data is kept on them. All reported fires in the country are tracked by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) using data given by local fire departments. However, when a solar system is determined to be the cause of a fire, that’s as deep as the reporting goes, with no exploration into specific failure or causation. Furthermore, if a responding fire department doesn’t have solar photovoltaics listed as an option in their reporting system, it gets filed to USFA miscellaneously.
The USFA also releases its fire data some time after it has been collected, with the most current data on file at this minute being from 2019.
As it stands, solar system fires are underreported (sometimes not at all), available data is dated, and specific causations remain a mystery.
While publicizing system fires, faulty hardware, components aging poorly, and improper installation can be seen as a poor reflection on the industry at large, Balfour says that this is an inconvenience that must be hurdled in order to address a larger industry issue.
“Almost all of these issues are quite controllable,” said Balfour. “And that control goes back to having accurate shared information, i.e. component and system data.”
Over the course of their work, Balfour and Shaw came across a case study in Japan and Britain of a hundred solar system fires. Of these fires, the majority of them were caused by aging and failing system components, and a significant number of failures were attributed to components greater than or equal to seven years of age.
Aging system components frequently being the cause of fires may come as a surprise, as blame is often attributed to improper installation in the general discourse of PV system fires. However, one small case study is not enough to rule installation issues out as a contributing factor either. It also must be considered that not all components that fail are old and that some components could be faulty from day one. 
However, many companies and owners of projects that have caught fire, according to Balfour, don’t want to share that information because of the negative reflection. This attitude, however, creates a circular issue: if fires are treated like a taboo issue that should be moved on from as soon as possible, the proper installation, operations and maintenance, and training procedures can’t be put into place to identify failure causes, so we remain at the same point of not knowing what causes solar system fires, nor how to prevent them.
The two believe that the catalyst for more in-depth and informative data tracking will come from financiers and insurers of solar projects. If solar system fires become more frequent and/or destructive, they’ll become a legitimate industry-wide concern for project economics and reliability. Financiers won’t want to approach projects without some level of certainty that the proper precautions are being taken, and insurers may not provide coverage to projects that aren’t implementing preventative O&M and other precautions. This is similar to what’s happening with solar projects in hail-prone regions, where research into hail damage mitigation and monitoring was sparked by the insurance industry.
To try to put a number on what these losses could look like, Shaw has developed a methodology to estimate the future costs and impacts from reported PV system sourced fires in California. By estimating the number of PV systems in the state that are older than seven years (in-line with the Japanese case study) and using available data to track the number of fires in California annually, Shaw’s model is able to generally predict the amount of PV fires that will occur in California and what their cost will be, both monetary and in terms of physical harm if current industry practices persist.

Once built, the plant will become home to the only non-captive Lithium-Ion manufacturing business in the U.S., said Lithion.
The company will develop storage units as well as their Valence line of battery modules used in the electrification of many applications across various industries. Lithion is a vertically integrated manufacturer of cells, rechargeable and non-rechargeable battery packs and modules serving industrial, medical, robotic, military, and energy end-markets. 
Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company has purchased the Altamont Winds project, managed by Castlelake L.P. The 57.5 MW facility is the single largest asset in Greenbacker’s wind portfolio. 
The project in its final stages of commissioning and has a long-term power purchase agreement with East Bay Community Energy, a community choice aggregator (CCA). CCAs allow residents, businesses, and municipalities to procure power from an alternative supplier, while still using the transmission and distribution services of their local electric utility provider. 
Altamont Winds is sited in Alameda County, within the Altamont Pass, an area that has been operating wind assets and providing energy to the Bay Area since the 1980s. The wind farm is placed near the load pocket created by San Francisco, giving it strategic value in serving energy usage and capacity needs, said Greenbacker. 
This project boosts the Greenbacker’s total nationwide capacity to just over 300 MW. It has a 1.18 GW portfolio comprised of 855 MW of utility-scale and distributed solar, 16 MW of battery storage, and 12 MW biomass facilities. 
Nautilus Solar Energy has acquired a New York community solar project from Saturn Power, sized at 6.34 MW. Located in Norwich, NY, the project is slated to begin construction in Q2 2021. Once completed, the project will provide renewable energy to 775 households within the NYSEG utility territory. 
The project will employ up to 50 local construction and installation workers, said Nautilus. The company will be responsible for project and asset management, maintenance, and the acquisition and management of customers. Canadian-based Saturn Power developed the project. 
Community solar is among the fastest growing sectors in the New York clean energy industry, said Nautilus. Anyone who pays an electric bill in the project’s area can subscribe to the service, and Nautilus said customers can save ten percent on utility bills with no upfront cost, long-term commitment or cancellation costs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/25/new-asce-committee-will-focus-on-advancing-the-reliability-of-solar-pv-structures/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,QUALITY,RACKING,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 25, 2021",New ASCE committee will focus on advancing the reliability of solar PV structures,"The Structural Engineering Institute (SEI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) recently approved the formation of a new committee whose purpose is to provide guidance to the solar industry on the design, development, and construction of solar photovoltaic (PV) structures.
This committee, called the Solar PV Structures Committee, is comprised of engineers, manufacturers, contractors, permitting officials, and owners. The mission of the committee is to focus on the structural and geotechnical design of the unique structures that support PV modules on building rooftops, carports, and ground mount facilities so that these structures can be both reliable and economical in a consistent manner throughout the country.
To the untrained eye, PV structures may be perceived as simple to design and well-understood by the engineers and manufacturers that design and build them. However, the reality is that the racks that support the PV modules are unique structures, and the current structural design standards and building codes, typically written with conventional bridges and buildings in mind, are not sufficient for the solar industry to be both reliable and economical.
The continual push to economize PV facilities is driving the need for detailed design guidance from the PV industry as the benefits of “sharpening the pencil” can be tremendous. On large-scale utility projects, the structural elements are repeated thousands of times and optimization of these elements can yield significant savings.
For instance, on a 200 MW project, there can easily be 100,000 piles. Decreasing the pile length from 15 ft to 13 ft can save millions of dollars. But properly justifying this optimized pile length requires a thorough understanding of the behavior of a PV racking structural system under all load conditions, as well as a concurrence among all stakeholders on the acceptable risk of failure compared to the cost required to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
Without a reliable and consistent approach to the design of these types of structures the solar industry will continue to struggle with failures, misunderstandings, inconsistent designs, and potential litigation.
The committee strives to be the PV industry’s arena for collaboration and sharing lessons learned so that everyone can benefit. This can be challenging, but to better understand the behavior of PV structural elements, collaboration needs to take place. Buildings and bridges have decades of experience and research that can be used in their design – PV structures do not.
For ground mount PV structures, no formal industry guidance has been provided to engineers on how to reliably and consistently design them. When there is no design guidance, engineers do their best while working within the constraints of the project schedules and budgets. This tends to lead to inconsistent and/or unreliable designs. This new committee wants to fill in this knowledge vacuum and provide the guidance the industry is looking for.
The committee is currently collaborating on important topics such as wind loading, snow loading, corrosion, frost jacking (heaving) of piles, pile testing, PV-specific reliability indices, and more.
An ASCE Manual of Professional Practice is currently being developed that will be followed by a detailed industry design standard. The committee plans to publish updates and best-practice articles so that PV solar structural and geotechnical engineers can begin to perform consistent and reliable designs. Stay tuned for future articles on the advancement of structural and geotechnical design of solar PV structures.
Jon Manning is a structural engineer with Kimley-Horn. Steve Gartner is the chair of the new ASCE committee on solar PV structures and is a senior structural engineer at HDR. Both are based in Minnesota.
