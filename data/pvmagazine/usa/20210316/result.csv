The project is expected to break ground in the next few months. The factory will begin operations in early 2023 and produce battery packs and modules made from lithium-ion cells.
Given that the battery is the most expensive component of an electric vehicle, Lion said it expects to see a  reduction in the cost of its vehicle manufacturing while better controlling and optimizing a key component of its supply chain.
The project and its development represent an investment of approximately C$185 million ($148 million) by Lion. The company is also getting about C$100 million ($80 million) in financial support from the federal and provincial governments. The facility is expected to create 135 direct jobs. Lion currently employs over 465 people at its other Quebec plant.
 
With a planned yearly production capacity of 5 GWh, Lion said it will be able to electrify around 14,000 medium- and heavy-duty vehicles annually. The company said it expects its highly automated factory to produce one battery module every 11 seconds and a full battery pack every 5 minutes.
Lion’s innovation center will focus on research and development, with the goal of exploring new advancements in performance, range, and energy capacity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/16/wisconsin-utilities-propose-another-big-solarstorage-project/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,WISCONSIN",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 16, 2021",Wisconsin utilities propose another big solar+storage project,"We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service (WPS), units of WEC Energy Group, are again teaming up with Madison Gas and Electric (MGE) to propose a second solar and battery energy storage project.
The utilities filed plans with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for the Darien Solar Energy Center, a 325 MW solar+storage project to be built in Rock and Walworth counties in the southeast part of the state.
If approved by state regulators, the $446 million project would include 250 MW of solar generation and 75 MW of battery storage. It would be built on 2,000 acres and include up to 850,000 solar panels.
Chicago-based Invenergy would develop and build the Darien Solar Energy Center. Construction would start in late 2021, with the project slated to go online by the end of 2023.
Under the partnership, We Energies and WPS would own 90% of the project, or 225 MW of its solar output and 67.5 MW of the storage. MGE would own the remaining 10%, or 25 MW of solar and 7.5 MW of storage.
In February, the companies announced plans for a $426 million, 310 MW facility, the Paris Solar-Battery Park. If approved by regulators, Invenergy would build that project, too, in nearby Kenosha County; the utilities would have a similar 90/10 ownership agreement.
The Darien and Paris projects are part of WEC Energy Group’s plan to invest $2 billion in new solar, wind, and battery storage projects for its utilities by 2025. The parent company said these investments are part of its goal to cut carbon emissions 55% by 2025 and 70% by 2030.
The projects also would help MGE move away from coal, highlighted by the planned retirement of its co-owned Columbia Energy Center. In May 2019, MGE announced a goal of achieving net-zero carbon electricity by 2050.

Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, and Southern California Edison together proposed a plan to the state’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC), which set a March 15 deadline for proposals to revise net metering rules.
The utilities’ plan would address what they said is “an unfair and growing inequity” stemming from earlier versions of the rooftop solar Net Energy Metering program. They said the cost shift leads to electricity customers without solar systems paying about $3 billion more annually to “subsidize” existing rooftop solar customers.
The utilities claimed the alleged subsidy represents the costs of the electric grid that solar customers use, “but for which they do not pay.”
The California Solar and Storage Association’s proposal included measures to increase the amount of solar+storage.

Solar advocates filed their own proposals with the commission, and said the utilities’ plan would hurt the industry’s growth. “The real issue at hand isn’t so much a ‘cost-shift’ as the utilities claim but a ‘power shift’ from utility to consumers and small businesses” who install solar, said a statement from the Save Solar Campaign, which includes the California Solar and Storage Association and the Solar Rights Alliance.
California’s net metering system was set up in 1995, when the state counted about 10,000 home-based solar systems. In 2016, regulators approved what has been called NEM 2.0. At the time, regulators kept credits tied to retail rates rather than the lower wholesale rates.
The California Solar and Storage Association’s proposal to the CPUC included measures to increase the amount of solar+storage. And the group objected to two utility proposals. One would be a new Distributed Generation Successor Tariff that would cost about $24 a month. The second was a proposed Residential Grid Benefits Charge that would cost around $11 per kilowatt for a solar system.

California faces a massive build-out,"If California hopes to hit its goal of having a carbon-free electricity system by 2045, then the state will need to add up to 6 GW of new renewable and energy storage systems every year and roughly triple its current grid capacity.
That’s a tall order. Over the past decade, the state has added 1 GW of solar and 300 MW of wind capacity on average each year. And over the next three years, electricity providers regulated by the state’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) are slated to add 8 GW of carbon-free generating capacity.
The California Energy Commission (CEC), California Air Resources Board (CARB), and the PUC made those assessments in a joint agency report mandated by Senate Bill 100, the state’s landmark policy requiring that renewable and zero-carbon energy resources supply all electric retail sales to customers by 2045. The bill was signed into law in 2018 and calls for those resources to replace fossil fuels for generating electricity in the state.
Hitting the clean energy goal will boost total annual electricity system costs by nearly $4.6 billion by 2045.

The report said the state’s electricity mix is already more than 60% carbon free. About one-third of that comes from renewable sources, predominantly solar and wind.
EV Connect, a California-based software-as-a-service company, will work with the Battery Innovation Center (BIC) and Energy Systems Network (ESN) to deploy a vehicle-to-grid-capable charging system to support school bus fleet, truck, and other customers in Indiana. EV Connect will provide its electric vehicle charging management technology and 500 kW bi-directional bus-scale superchargers from Rhombus. The test aims to generate data on battery life, available cycles, and an understanding of discharge rates to help companies weigh how V2G will affect their products and systems.
Canadian Solar will invest in German-based SolarWorX as part of the start-up’s series A investment round. Canadian Solar is joined by co-investors EIT InnoEnergy, a European investor, and DEG – Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft, the German development finance institution. Funding will help SolarWorX expand its product portfolio and sales activities in its overall push to electrify some of the 1.2 billion people globally that lack a stable electric grid connection.
SolarWorX provides a modular off-grid solar product called Solego that offers 80 Wh or 160 Wh battery capacity. The systems offer voice support in English, French, Swahili, Wolof, and Fula.
Texas-based power retailer Griddy Energy filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Texas. The company’s proposed reorganization plan includes offering releases to former customers with unpaid electricity bills. The company was buffeted by high electricity prices during the mid-February winter storm that crippled the Electric Reliability Corporation of Texas (ERCOT) grid operator. “The actions of ERCOT destroyed our business and caused financial harm to our customers,” said Griddy CEO Michael Fallquist in a statement. Griddy made national headlines as some customers complained they were billed 300 times more than normal for electricity during the storm.
Daqo New Energy Corp. signed a three-year high-purity polysilicon supply agreement with Gaojing Solar Energy Technology Co., a new solar wafer manufacturer. Under the agreement, Daqo will provide Gaojing with 45,900 metric tons of high-purity mono-grade polysilicon between June 2021 and May 2024. Prices will be negotiated by both parties monthly based on market conditions. Gaojing will make an advance payment to Daqo New Energy.
Gaojing plans to develop 50 GW of large-size solar wafer capacity in three phases. Construction of the first phase, with a production capacity of 15 GW, has begun and is expected to be complete by September. Phase II is expected to reach full production of 15 GW in 2022, and Phase III will bring additional 20 GW online by the end of 2023.

The U.S. Solar Market Insight 2020 Year-in-Review report, released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, found that the industry installed a record 19.2 GW of capacity last year. That was a 43% increase from 2019 and bested the market’s previous annual record of 15.1 GW set in 2016.
California, Texas, and Florida were the top three states for annual solar capacity additions for the second straight year. In 2020, 27 states installed over 100 MW of new solar capacity, a record.

Annual residential solar deployment rose 11% from 2019, reaching a record 3.1 GW. However, the report said this was lower than the 18% annual growth in 2019, as residential installations were impacted by the pandemic in the first half of 2020.
Annual non-residential installations fell 4% from 2019, with 2 GW installed in 2020. The report said the pandemic impacted this segment, too, through delayed project interconnections and prolonged development timelines.
For the second year in a row, solar led all technologies in new U.S. electric-generating capacity added, accounting for 43% in 2020.

The U.S. solar industry also saw its biggest quarterly gain ever in the fourth quarter, adding 8 GW of new capacity. For perspective, the market added 7.5 GW of capacity in all of 2015.
The report said there was a historic 6.3 GW of utility-scale projects installed in the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing the annual total just shy of 14 GW. The report said that 5 GW of new utility solar power purchase agreements were announced during the quarter. That brought the volume of project announcements in 2020 to 30.6 GW and the full utility-scale contracted pipeline to 69 GW.
For the first time, Wood Mackenzie also released a long-term forecast as part of the U.S. Solar Market Insight report series. By 2030, it expects that the total operating U.S. solar fleet will more than quadruple, installing a cumulative 324 GW of new capacity to reach a total of 419 GW.
Michelle Davis, senior analyst from Wood Mackenzie, said the two-year extension of the investment tax credit at the end of 2020 will drive greater solar adoption and led to a 17% increase in deployment in the report’s 2021-2025 forecast.

“After a slowdown in Q2 due to the pandemic, the solar industry innovated and came roaring back,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. She said that the forecast shows that by 2030 the equivalent of one in eight American homes will have solar.
