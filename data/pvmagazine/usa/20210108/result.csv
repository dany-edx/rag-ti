In a statement, Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng said that although the United States is a valued cross-border ally, the tariffs are “unwarranted” and have caused Canada’s solar exports to its neighbor to drop by more than 80%. She added the tariffs “clearly violate the provisions and the spirit” of CUSMA, the recently enacted successor of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Following a Section 201 global safeguard investigation, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on imported crystalline silicon PV cells and modules in 2018. However, the U.S. International Trade Commission had ruled that Canadian imports were not a substantial contributor or major threat to U.S. solar manufacturing. According to Ng, that meant the United States was required under the countries’ trade agreements to exclude Canada from the penalty. The tariffs were imposed anyway, and despite company lawsuits and other government attempts, the tariffs against Canada remain in place.
“Canada will always stand up for its workers and against unjustified trade actions,” said Ng. “If Canada and the United States are not able to resolve this action through consultations, Canada may request the establishment of a dispute settlement panel to adjudicate the matter.”
Since they were imposed, the U.S. tariffs have faced opposition from solar stakeholders, both domestic and abroad. The Solar Energy Industries Association and other advocacy groups have called on the incoming Biden administration to revoke the tariffs. Although President-elect Joe Biden has signaled his support for renewable energy, the solar tariffs’ fate remains uncertain.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/08/an-innovative-offtake-contract-makes-its-solar-sector-debut/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 8, 2021",An innovative offtake contract makes its solar sector debut,"An innovative financing deal is the latest evidence that solar is entering the mainstream among big institutional investors.
Lightsource bp secured what’s known as a proxy generation power purchase agreement (pgPPA or Proxy Gen) with the Capital Solutions unit of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS), in partnership with Nephila Climate.
The pgPPA covers electricity generated by Lightsource bp’s 153 MW Briar Creek solar farm, under construction in Navarro County, Texas.
In simple terms, a pgPPA is a renewable energy contract designed to manage weather-related risk. In practice, it settles energy transfer from a facility based on a proxy generation index, rather than on the metered generation. That means proxy generation is an hourly index that determines the volume of energy that a project would have produced if it had been operated as specified by the developer or owner.
The arrangement hinges on both the owner and the offtaker agreeing on a set of weather metrics to establish the proxy generation component. In the case of Lightsource bp’s Briar Creek facility, REsurety Inc. will serve as the calculation agent over the life of the contract.
The pgPPA reflects the fact that solar “can stand on its own two feet” and not be so tied either to a purchase power agreement or public policy directive, said Lee Taylor, REsurety’s founder and CEO in an interview with pv magazine USA.
Taylor said that the pgPPA structure emerged a few years ago in the wind energy sector, and variations are common in agribusiness, as well as ski resorts, among other weather risk-related markets. One of the technique’s first uses in renewable energy was with the 178 MW Bloom Wind facility in Kansas, part of the Southwest Power Pool. U.S. Capital Power operates Bloom Wind under a 10-year fixed price contract with Allianz Risk Transfer that covers 100% of the project’s output.

Under the contract, signed in 2016, Capital Power swaps the market revenue from the wind project’s generation for a fixed annual payment over a period of 10 years. The agreement secures long-term predictable revenues and mitigates generation volume uncertainty related to the intermittent nature of the wind resource.
Taylor said that similar structures have been used on wind projects in PJM and ERCOT in the U.S., as well as in Australia. The Briar Creek deal is considered to be the technique’s first use in a U.S. solar project.
“This deal is a great example of the evolution of renewable energy products here in the U.S.,” said Kevin Smith, CEO of Lightsource bp in the Americas. He said that innovative power contract structures such as virtual and pgPPA’s are “valuable tools we can leverage to meet the needs of our corporate partners, manage risk, and continue to finance and build new solar projects.”
Ariane West, Director of Structured Finance, Nephila Climate, said that risk transfer approaches “are essential to support investment and financing of infrastructure on the scale needed to achieve zero carbon targets.”
Purchase power agreements are commonly used structures between a solar facility’s owners and an energy offtaker, often a utility or large manufacturer. In a variation known as a virtual PPA, contract terms focus on the amount of energy the facility delivers to the grid. Typically, the quantity is measured by an electrical meter at the point of interconnection. By settling the energy delivery at the interconnection point on an “as generated” basis, the buyer is exposed to a number of operational risks.
In a pgPPA, the focus is the amount of energy that should have been delivered to the grid had the plant operated according to equipment efficiency factors and operational best practices. The approach shifts operational risk away from the offtaker and onto the seller.
The pgPPA measures the actual wind or solar resource at the facility. It then runs that measurement through an agreed-to formula that estimates how many megawatthours should have been produced given the facility’s size and operations under best practice standards.
In the case of Briar Creek solar, REsurety is providing the hourly solar radiance data, which will be managed using PVsyst photovoltaic software.
The Briar Creek solar farm is about 40 miles south of Dallas, and is expected to start commercial operation at the end of 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/08/could-hb-786-halt-the-growth-of-solar-in-ohio/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,OHIO",,"JANUARY 8, 2021",Could HB 786 halt the growth of solar in Ohio?,"A controversial Ohio bill may be halting the development of large solar and wind projects in the state for up to three years.
The bill, House Bill 786, will force us to take a giant step backward when it comes to reducing fossil fuel usage, reversing efforts already in place that aim to help our planet see a better and more sustainable future.
HB 786 will prevent any new solar or wind facilities capable of producing more than 50 megawatts of electricity to be certified. This bill will also prevent smaller scale wind farms from producing five or more megawatts of electricity.
The bill will end after it’s in place for three years, or if the General Assembly creates additional legislation before the three years are over.
This bill will be a significant blockade in efforts to expand and build out existing solar and wind projects that are already underway. Aside from missing out on opportunities to positively impact the environment, the state would also be missing out on the financial and economic benefits that come from using solar and wind energy.
This new bill does not have strong support from the public. Many people believe that the legislation shows just how hostile legislators and lawmakers are when switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
Rather than proposing this new bill as something we should be concerned about, representatives are saying the goal of this bill is more like putting a pause button on the world of renewable energy and efforts in place to make solar and wind power more widely available as the go-to option when it comes to electricity.
Bills such as HB 786 prevent us from making sustainable changes that will have long-term positive effects on our environment and require us to continue damaging the planet in the meantime because of the restrictions on solar and wind energy production.
With the bill having such negative feedback and support from the public, we can be hopeful that the bill does not progress any further. Overturning the bill would allow solar and wind energy companies to expand and continue to build out their farms, continuing to help our environment by making these energy sources more accessible.
Although to some, it is merely clicking a “pause button,” the reality is that there will be so much irreversible damage during this pause that is unnecessary and avoidable. Rather than trying to make up for this damage in the future, we can prevent it altogether by devoting time and energy to pushing toward switching the focus to renewable energy resources.

The site of a former explosives plant in Berkeley County, West Virginia, is slated to be the future home of a $100 million solar electricity facility.
Local officials announced that Colorado-based Torch Clean Energy will build a 100 MW utility-scale solar project at the site.
“Torch is excited to be working with Berkeley County to develop the Bedington Energy Facility,” Torch Clean Energy President Jon Kilberg was quoted as saying in local news reports. “The project will repurpose a former explosives manufacturing site, and — with approximately $100 million invested — will be one of the nation’s largest brownfield renewable energy projects.”
The agreement includes a payment in lieu of taxes, in which Torch Clean Energy agreed to make significant yearly payments based on the number of megawatts generated. The company will also install a 100 kW solar array on a Berkeley County School at no cost to the Berkeley County Board of Education.
Reports said that Berkeley County would be paid $1,850 per megawatt of production capacity, and the developer has offered a $450,000 contribution to the county for “quality of life” initiatives, such as parks and public spaces, public safety and cultural and historical assets.
Water-gel explosives and smokeless powder were manufactured at the site in the 1970s, and ammonia-nitrate fuel-oil explosives were produced in the 1970s and 1980s. Flexible explosives also were manufactured until 1994, when DuPont ceased all explosive-manufacturing operations there.
New York-based Plug Power Inc. and SK Group, a South Korean business group, are partnering to accelerate hydrogen as an energy source in Asian markets.
As part of the deal, SK Group is making a $1.5 billion investment in Plug Power.
The partners plan to provide hydrogen fuel cell systems, hydrogen fueling stations, and electrolyzers to the Korean and broader Asian markets. A statement said that the combination of SK Group’s presence in Asia’s energy industry and Plug Power’s expertise in hydrogen fuel cell systems, fueling stations and green hydrogen generation “represents a powerful team to accelerate the growth of hydrogen economy in Asian markets.”
Plug Power said it has deployed more than 40,000 fuel cell systems for e-mobility. Its technology and services are used by Amazon, BMW, The Southern Company, Carrefour and Walmart.
French renewable energy developer Valorem has secured a power purchase agreement for a 5 MW agrivoltaic project it is developing in the Dordogne department in southwestern France, reports pv magazine France.
Meanwhile, in the U.S., a researcher at Oregon State University says that using land for both solar photovoltaic power and agriculture could provide 20% of this country’s total electricity generation. Read “Could agrivoltaics feed our demand for clean energy?”
The National Science Foundation awarded $39 million to a team at the University of California San Diego to build a testbed to better understand how to integrate distributed energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, smart buildings and electric vehicle batteries into the power grid.
The goal is to make the testbed available to outside research teams and industry by 2025.
“We will be replicating the entire California power grid on one campus,” said Jan Kleissl, the project’s principal investigator.
The testbed will be built upon a number of technical innovations at UC San Diego that create a microgrid encompassing distributed energy resources, including energy storage, electric vehicles and independent electrical and thermal systems in buildings. This distributed system is monitored and controlled by computing and networking systems that make it accessible to local and remote researchers as a programmable platform.
Gary Matthews, vice chancellor resource management and planning for UC San Diego, said “the ability to interact with buildings and change their energy profile intelligently both enhances grid stability and saves a tremendous amount of energy.”
DERConnect will include more than 2,500 distributed energy resources on the campus’ microgrid, with its fuel cell and solar panels, a dozen classroom and office buildings, as well as 300 charging stations for electric vehicles. It will also entail constructing a new energy storage testing facility.
Researchers hope to be able to begin testing their equipment in 2022. Industry partners include Johnson Controls and Sunspec Alliance.
