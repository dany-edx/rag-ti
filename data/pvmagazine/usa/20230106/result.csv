The two meetings will take place:
174 Power Global, a Hanwha Energy USA Holdings affiliate, has requested a 30-year right-of-way grant to construct and operate the utility-scale solar project located on federal lands about 85 miles west of Phoenix. The project developer submitted a right-of-way application in October 2019 when the project was known as Taurus Solar, and subsequently changed the name of the project in August 2022.
The Jove Solar Project will be situated on 3,495 acres of public lands managed by the BLM and 38 acres of La Paz County land. The power facility would connect into the regional transmission system via the planned and approved Cielo Azul 500-kilovolt switching station and Ten West Link 500 kV transmission line, whose construction is pending.
The solar project’s location was selected based on numerous factors, especially the area’s frequent clear skies, high solar resource, and access to electric transmission.

On December 7, 2022, the BLM Yuma Field Office published a Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement to analyze the potential environmental effects of Jove Solar. The notice initiated formal scoping and a two-year mineral segregation.
To promote clean energy goals, the BLM provides sites for environmentally sound development of renewable energy on public lands. These efforts support the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, as well as Congress’ direction in the Energy Act of 2020 to permit 25 GW of solar, wind and geothermal production on public lands through 2025.
Project information including maps and an online commenting tool may be accessed on the project’s ePlanning website.
Written comments will be taken through February 1 by email at: BLM_AZ_CRD_Solar@blm.gov or via the ePlanning website link above. Letters may be sent to:BLM Yuma Field Office, Attn: Jove Solar EIS – Public Comment, 7341 E 30th St., Suite A, Yuma, AZ 85365-6525
On December 5 the BLM announced new plans to refine and speed up the development of renewable energy in its southwest region, as it aims to deploy 25 GWac of capacity by 2025. BLM also said it would begin reviewing three facilities in Arizona totaling 1 GWac, including Jove Solar (600 MWac).
BLM said they are expanding on their “programmatic” process to move renewable projects through the development process that was produced in 2012.
The other two Arizona solar facilities –300 MWac Pinyon Solar project in Maricopa County owned by Avantus (formerly 8 Minute Solar Energy), and 300 MWac Elisabeth Solar  in Yuma County – are also in the early stages of development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/06/revamped-rooftop-solar-enterprise-sales-platform-reduced-install-times-by-37-days/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 6, 2023",Revamped rooftop solar enterprise sales platform reduced install times by 37 days,"In 2022, rooftop sales platform provider Palmetto introduced an enterprise sales product called the Clean Energy Software Platform. The platform enables corporate partners like consumer brands, utilities, and enterprises operating in other spaces to enter the clean energy market by offering their customers rooftop solar.
The enterprise sales software division partners with organizations that already serve residential customers, like real estate development and mortgage companies, consumer lenders, home improvement retailers, electric utilities, and financial services platforms, connecting them with tools to sell solar.
“In the same way Shopify provides everything you need to start a business – procurement, inventory management, marketing, payments, shipping/logistics – Palmetto is extending its offering to enterprises, enabling businesses and retail platforms alike to sell clean energy products and solutions,” said Christopher Kemper, chief executive officer of Palmetto.
The enterprise business unit helps partners and clients with net-zero decarbonization targets, aims at increasing customer lifetime value and prepares them to enter the clean energy markets. Palmetto offers one end-to-end digital solution for consumers from education, solar potential estimates, design, engineering, and financing the rooftop system. It also helps with procuring the panels and other supplies, identifying and contracting qualified installers, facilitating permitting and inspection, and providing service and maintenance for the lifetime of the product.
“Residential clean energy can be a tough business to break into, and we believe today’s U.S. rooftop solar adoption – only about 3% of U.S. homes – is largely indicative of the disjointed and difficult customer experience,” said Kemper. “We are enabling sellers to do what they do best – lead generation and selling products – while Palmetto handles the rest.”
Since rolling out the new enterprise division, Palmetto reported improved process times and customer satisfaction ratings. Notably, Palmetto said the speed to installation was streamlined with automation, improved workflows and better turnaround times. This resulted in systems getting installed 37 days faster than previous averages, said Palmetto.
Palmetto also reported a 37% increase in customers reporting they were likely to refer the product to friends or family, and a 5% decline in change orders and cancellations due to operational inefficiencies. Year-over-year, Palmetto’s total installations grew 75%, and its system activations increased 82% year-over-year.

“Utilities and energy providers across the country are amidst a much-needed modernization, including the ability to track, measure, and use data to make smarter decisions on behalf of themselves and their customers,” said Eduardo Berlin, vice president of energy intelligence, Palmetto.
Last year, Palmetto announced its mapping software, Mapdwell, charted the solar potential of 107 million buildings – roughly 75% of all U.S. rooftops. It used the software to launch its instant proposal service in 2021.
“Mapdwell now covers 81% of the U.S. population in 38 states and Washington D.C., including all current Palmetto service areas,” said Berlin. “Our goal is to map the solar potential and derive energy load profiles of every building across the U.S. — and we’re on track to accomplish just that in the very near future.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/06/how-and-why-to-electrify-everything/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 6, 2023",How and why to electrify everything,"With an estimated 40% of the United States carbon emissions coming from our homes and the vehicles we drive, switching to all electric will reduce emissions. Rewiring America, an electrification non-profit, recently released a guide to going all electric and making the most of the Inflation Reduction Act.
The group estimates that to achieve zero emissions, we need to install 1 billion new machines, or 50 million machines a year for the next 20 to 25 years. The organization estimates that the average U.S. household can save $1,800 a year in utility costs by switching to all electric, and it calls incentives offered through the IRA an “electric bank account” with a balance of $10,600 to electrify, which can ramp to an $858 billion cumulative investment in households and communities across the country. Rewired also provides a calculator that shows you the IRA-related tax credit is for each electric appliance.
In addition to encouraging individuals to make the choice to buy electric appliances and vehicles, Rewiring America says we also need large-scale changes in policy around renewable energy, government subsidies, and industry accountability.
Rewire America lists the appliances that need to be replaced: fossil-fuel burning furnace, water heater, gas kitchen stove, and gas clothes dryer—in addition to any gas-burning vehicles. Solar panels with battery backup can power these machines. The caveat is that these items are expensive, and replacing them all at once is impractical and beyond the reach of many Americans. But it would be wise to make a plan to replace these items at the end of their life.
The guidebook lists the following as examples of the savings and advantages:
Heat pumps: Can both heat and cool your home while using only 30% of the energy to do so.
Electric vehicles: A typical EV costs you 5¢ per mile to drive, while a typical gasoline vehicle costs you 13¢ per mile
Induction cooktops: These deliver better performance than gas stovetops, with higher heat and improved control, which is why many professional chefs and home cooks prefer them. They can boil water in half the time, for example. Plus, you won’t hurt your hand if you touch the burner when it’s on – they only heat the pan.
Rewired points out that these aren’t new inventions: heat pumps use the same basic technology as your refrigerator; electric cars were first popular in the late-1800s before gasoline cars dominated the 20th century; and induction cooking was invented in the early 1900s. According to Rewired it’s because of more recent improvements in these technologies, including better batteries and computerized control, that these machines got their performance advantages.
Advantages of switching to electric include the fact that they are healthier and safer because you’re not burning fossil fuels inside your home, and you’re not storing fossil fuels in your basement or garage. They can also save you money because they use less energy, which makes them cheaper to run over their 10- to 25-year lifetimes.
Rewiring America estimates that more than 103 million American households would start saving money on their monthly utility bill right away if electric heat pumps for space and water heating cost the same to buy and install as the fossil-fueled machines they’re replacing (i.e., those that run on oil, propane, or outdated, inefficient electric resistance heaters). If your electricity comes from renewable sources like solar and wind, they will run without producing any carbon emissions.
The non-profit believes that electrification applies to all households, and when combined with the right policies, results in economic savings and health benefits that disproportionately benefit low income and historically disinvested communities. One caveat is that currently some electric machines are more expensive to buy than their fossil fueled versions, although they usually lower your bills once installed. Rewiring America is working on policy initiatives to help eliminate this extra up-front cost through rebates, with an emphasis on helping low- to middle- income (LMI) households get these machines and the lower bills they provide.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/06/federal-agencies-receive-updated-climate-guidance-report/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 6, 2023",Federal agencies receive updated climate guidance report,"The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) released updated Guidance on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change to help federal agencies better assess and disclose climate impacts as they conduct environmental reviews.
This step was by directed by an executive order signed by President Biden in January 2021. The action restores federal agency emissions guidance, which was previously withdrawn in 2016 by the Trump Administration.
As federal agencies roll out clean energy projects, including those funded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, the updated guidance is expected to improve sustainability while keeping environmental reviews “focused and efficient.”
“The interim guidance will enable clean energy developers to move forward with projects, particularly on federal lands, that not only reduce climate impacts from the power sector, but that also create jobs and add economic benefits for communities in areas where solar projects are sited,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The guidance, which CEQ is issuing as an interim guidance, is open for public comment through March 2023. It is aimed at providing more clarity and predictability for conducting reviews, including highlighting existing tools and best practices.
The update is also expected to improve transparency in the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. The guidance now evaluates the social cost of climate change. It also provides specific recommendations for renewable projects to keep environmental reviews focused and provides steps to make projects more climate-smart and resilient.
“Disclosing and reducing emissions will ensure we’re building sustainable, resilient infrastructure for the 21st century and beyond,” said Brenda Mallory, chair, CEQ. “These updated guidelines will provide greater certainty and predictability for green infrastructure projects, help grow our clean energy economy, and help fulfill President Biden’s climate and infrastructure goals.”
CEQ’s new climate change guidance recommends that agencies account for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews. The updated guidance provides agencies with a common approach for assessing their proposed actions, while recognizing each agency’s unique circumstances and authorities. Specifically, the guidance:
“The White House Council on Environmental Quality is taking an important step forward in supporting the development of clean energy projects that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. power sector,” said Ross Hopper.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/06/capitalizing-on-the-inflation-reduction-act/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 6, 2023",Capitalizing on the Inflation Reduction Act,"In August 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the landmark Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, hailed as the most significant piece of climate legislation in history. In a recently released white paper, “Capitalizing on the Inflation Reduction Act”, Reuters highlights the significance of the extension of the existing 30% investment tax credit (ITC), as well as the Clean Electricity Investment Credit and a Clean Electricity Production Credit, which are similar to the ITC and production tax credit (PTC) but are technology neutral. This paper looks at the impact of this legislation on utility-scale projects in the United States, energy storage, infrastructure challenges, and the threat of a potential Republican administration.
The report calls the IRA “just a shadow of a much grander legislative vision”, because the Biden administration had planned to invest $3.5 trillion into climate change and social policy actions through a package called the Build Back Better Act (BBB). But the BBB sputtered when Senator Joe Manchin refused to support the legislation. The IRA contains many of the BBB’s energy and climate provisions and forms part of a trio of important Biden infrastructure acts, with the other two being the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act, both approved in 2021.
Read more about what’s in the Inflation Reduction Act for solar here.
Reuters reported that the act “is set to kickstart a new era of wind and solar growth after global economic headwinds slowed progress in recent years.” In the whitepaper, Reuters contends that beyond the regulatory certainty that the IRA provides over the coming decade, it is notable for extending tax credits to new types of clean energy infrastructure, such as battery storage and hydrogen electrolysis equipment.
Storage
One way of improving profitability of projects is to add battery storage and store excess production so it can be exported at times of higher demand and lower supply, according to the Reuters report. The analyst firm Wood Mackenzie expects 59.2 GW of energy storage capacity to be added to U.S. grids through 2026 as a result of the IRA.
While storage can help developers and asset managers overcome grid constraints, the interconnection queue remains a challenge. According to Wood Mackenzie, “Despite impressive growth, the U.S. grid-scale energy storage pipeline continues to face rolling delays into 2023 and beyond,” said Vanessa Witte, a senior analyst with Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team. “More than 1.1 GW of projects originally scheduled to come online in Q2 were delayed or cancelled, although 61% of this capacity, 709 megawatts, is still scheduled to come online in Q3 and Q4 of 2022.”
Infrastructure
The Reuters report notes that developers of U.S. utility-scale wind and solar projects are concerned that the IRA does not contain sufficient support for improvement of grid infrastructure, and thus, the growth potential may be stymied. The Biden administration is aware of this issue, with the Department of Energy announcing in November that it is soliciting $13 billion in new U.S. electric grid expansion and modernization grant applications under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Despite concerns over transmission infrastructure, the provisions of the IRA have buoyed the industry. And while many asset developers and owners have already increased their deployment plans, according to the Reuters report, there is still some uncertainty over the fine details of the act and many are awaiting specific guidelines from the IRS to learn how to implement the incentives.
A final concern noted by Reuters is whether the IRA will survive a Republican administration. It points out that not a single Republican lawmaker voted for the act in the Senate or in the House. However, there are reasons to hope a Republican president might not roll back most of the provisions in the act. A study of the IRA carried out by the University of Maryland School of Public Policy ’s Program for Public Consultation found 13 out of 20 provisions in the act were backed by Republicans and independents as well as Democrats. Nine out of 14 energy-related provisions had bipartisan support, the research found, including tax credits for clean energy equipment and production. The least popular measure was tax incentives for carbon capture and storage.
The report concludes that, while many rush to take advantage of the new regulatory framework, the issue now is whether supply chains and grid infrastructure can keep up. This will be a major topic of conversation at Utility Scale Solar & Wind North America 2023, which Reuters Events is hosting at the Westin Galleria Dallas in Texas in June. The event will feature more than 60 speakers and 400-plus attendees, 75% of which will be senior leaders.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/06/solar-energy-loan-fund-surpasses-30-million-of-residential-loans/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,ALABAMA,FLORIDA,GEORGIA,SOUTH CAROLINA,TENNESSEE",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 6, 2023",Solar Energy Loan Fund surpasses $30 million of residential loans,"The Solar Energy Loan Fund (SELF), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization providing unsecured financing solutions to Florida and Southeast U.S. residents adding solar and home improvements, recently surpassed $30 million of cumulative loans.
As a green bank and Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), to date SELF has provided loan products to historically underserved and underbanked low-to-moderate income (LMI) communities such as retirees, working class families, veterans, disabled homeowners and those with poor credit background.
SELF has issued more than 3,000 green home loans, which average about $10,000 per loan but can range up to $50,000, for rooftop solar, high efficiency air conditioners, roofing repairs and other residential sustainable improvements.
“SELF is an implementation tool to retrofit and build new resilient, affordable housing while fostering green jobs, energy equity, resilience, and clean energy for all,” said Doug Coward, executive director of SELF. “LMI homeowners are the most susceptible population to climate change, heat waves, and severe weather, and they have participated and benefited the least from the fast-emerging clean energy economy.”
Fort Pierce, Florida-based SELF was formed in 2010 with $3 million in seed grants from the Department of Energy.  The non-profit prides itself as being the first local national green bank.  In recent years SELF expanded outside of Florida into Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, and has partnerships with the cities of Orlando, St. Petersburg and the Atlanta (Georgia) Housing Authority.
Unlike traditional banks, SELF knocks down traditional barriers by advancing financial inclusion and filling key gaps that have historically set back LMI communities from accessing small loans for home improvements, including solar.
SELF has two dozen investors, including crowdfunding platform, KIVA.org, while 900+ contractors throughout the Southeast are able to assist customers with loan accessibility through SELF.  The non-profit has leveraged the original DOE grant by a 13:1 margin and provided financial assistance to more than 9,000 people.
Maria Duanne Andrade, chief financial officer of SELF, created the agency’s inclusive underwriting process based on the homeowner’s ability to repay the loan balance, rather than a credit score-based rating system.  Its credit system enabled the launch of its flagship Green Home Loan program for LMI homeowners with less than 2% default rates.
“Green banks have the power to unlock economic, environmental, and social benefits, especially in underserved communities,” said Andrade. “Financial systems are overly reliant on credit scores, and traditional underwriting methods leave too many people behind.”
SELF-originated loans are primarily funded by either crowd-funding or a mix of local banks, impact funds and faith-based institutions such as churches.
SELF loan financial terms:
 Residential projects eligible for financing include:
Green Bank meets Fintech
In recent years, SELF’s Andrade has put the loan originator into adjacent markets, providing green loan products to minorities, small building landlords and developers of affordable housing buildings, as well as a septic to sewer loan product.
Meanwhile, the organization has been pivoting to keep up with the emergence of financial technology applications that provide rapid access to small loan products.  In December, SELF’s plug-and-play fintech platform received a $3 million grant from JP Morgan Chase in order to provide capital to minority and novice affordable housing developers.
According to EnergySage, other providers of secured and unsecured solar loans in Florida and the southeast region include Climate First Bank, Dividend Finance, Sungage, Sunlight Financial, Sunnova Energy, Mosaic, GreenSky Credit and EnerBank USA.
According to Wood Mackenzie, the solar loan market grew 37% from 2021 to 2022. Homeowners see the greatest monthly savings on 25-year loans, which also match a residential solar installation’s warranty period.
Interest in residential solar financing will continue to grow now that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) extended the solar investment tax credit at 30% for another 10 years.

And the winners are…
Winner: Huasun Himalaya G12 Series
Challenger manufacturers such as China’s Anhui Huasun Energy Co are setting the pace in HJT development. 
In August 2021, Huasun announced 25.26% efficiency on an M6 (166 mm) wafer device – equaling the world record. Expanding to a G12 (210 mm) wafer, the Himalaya G12 (full name: HS-210-B132DS700) peaks at 22.5% module efficiency and a 700 W output in a 66-cell format. The Himalaya offers typical HJT benefits including a lower temperature coefficient of -0.26% and up to 93% bifaciality. The real innovation, gained with cell equipment partner Maxwell, is in the cell processes used to deposit the amorphous silicon and transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers –  reducing light absorption and boosting efficiency.
Huasun wants 20 GW of production capacity by 2025, manufacturing more-than-25.5% efficient cells by that point.
Winner: Gamesa Electric Proteus PV
This up-to-4,700 kVA central inverter showed a careful evolution of Gamesa’s PV central devices, bringing commendable efficiency and features to match a range of demands from solar developers. The comparatively higher efficiencies and power densities from the Proteus, plus Gamesa’s well-tried liquid cooling solution, also allows for less de-rating at high temperatures. Features coming as standard include Q@Night functionality,  and operation at altitude, to be compelling, overall, as part of the efficacy of the solution.
BOS
Winner: EKO Instruments MS-80SH Pyranometer

EKO Instruments’ Class A pyranometer is packed with features that make it stand out in the market for these sensor products that provide the crucial yet often overlooked service of measuring solar irradiance at a site. The MS-80SH features an integrated dome heating system to keep the sensor free of dew and frost that can impact measurement accuracy and can cause dust and dirt to stick to the outside of the dome that houses the sensors.
The company says its pyranometer has the lowest energy consumption on the market and the heating system can be switched on or off remotely, allowing further energy savings. The product is designed for easy compatibility with data loggers and SCADA systems, and internal diagnostics systems enable users to monitor internal temperature, humidity, tilt, and roll angle without having to visit the site and carry out a physical check.

Winner: Villara Energy Systems: VillaGrid 

VillaGrid is a residential, lithium titanate (LTO) battery offering twice the continuous power of conventional lithium-ion batteries at 10 kW; four times the peak power at 30 kW; double the lifespan, via a 20-year warranty; and improved safety, as a non-flammable chemistry. Its US manufacturer says even the smallest, 5.75 kWh VillaGrid battery can back a home during a power outage.
The LTO device doesn’t require a heating or cooling system and works well in temperatures between -30 C and 55 C, outperforming other lithium-based chemistries. It can be installed at up to 10,000 feet (3,048 meters). VillaGrid is engineered to last 25 years, far outstripping the industry average of 10 years. Guaranteed end-of-warranty capacity is 70%. “Your solar panels last 25 years and so should your batteries,” Villara says.
Manufacturing
Winner: ROSI, High value module recycling
France-based ROSI offers solutions to recover silicon lost as kerf during wafer slicing, and full end-of-life treatment for solar modules. “Our goal is to realize a truly circular economy for the PV industry and beyond,” the company stated in its award application. “The high-value recycling technology allows the reintegration of recovered materials into several key European industries, such as PV, batteries, and semiconductors.”
The company expects to have its first industrial PV module recycling site up and running early this year, initially able to process 3,000 tons of module waste annually, with plans to increase to 10,000 tons next year. Unlike most PV recycling operations to date, it will focus on the recovery of high value materials locked up within the modules as well as the glass that makes up the bulk of the panel’s weight. ROSI promises to produce silver and high-purity silicon at its recycling plant, and to recover 95% of the economic value of module materials, compared to its estimate current industry practices reclaim only 35%.
Sustainability
Winner: Brighten Haiti, Solar4Schools
A presidential assassination, gang violence, outbreaks of dangerous illness, and a chronic energy shortage as a result of armed street blockades have wreaked havoc on Haitians. Gangs blockaded diesel supplies in the capital, Port au Prince, late last year, prompting the closure of schools, hospitals, and much else.
NGO Brighten Haiti’s Solar4Schools program has offered a glimmer of light.
Brighten Haiti supplies 6 kWp solar systems to schools, each of which it says it can deliver on the back of a $6,000 donation from a US sponsor. Some 54,500 students in 109 schools have benefited, according to Brighten Haiti.
Solar4Schools leverages the Secure Power islanding capability  offered by German company SMA Solar Technology, which can deliver up to 2 kW of power in the event of grid outages at a price 87% cheaper than solar-plus-storage. In sustainability terms, the program features “functioning used and blemished modules from the U.S.”
Publisher’s pick
Winner: Growatt
In January 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we awarded pv magazine’s Publisher’s Pick for 
2020 to inverter manufacturer Growatt. Normally we would have not considered the same company just two years later but Growatt pulled off an amazing feat: it battled the pandemic, supply chain constraints, and a severe semiconductor chip shortage to top its 2020 revenue by 69%. This spectacular achievement, along with its continued innovation on the product and technology front, makes another Publisher’s Pick for 2022 more than well deserved.
Almost two-thirds of Growatt’s 2021 revenue of CNY 3.2 billion ($459 million) came from products sold in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The Shenzhen manufacturer has emerged as a leading player in the energy transition and is on the cusp of emerging as a PV unicorn with an upcoming Hong Kong IPO worth an estimated $1 billion.
