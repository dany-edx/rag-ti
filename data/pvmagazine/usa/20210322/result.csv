The project will include solar energy and battery storage for businesses that provide essential goods and services for residents of Castañer. After Hurricane Maria struck in 2017, the village was without electricity for six months. More broadly, the storm destroyed virtually all of the island’s transmission infrastructure.
Now, the community will develop the microgrid in collaboration with The Solar Foundation and the Microgrid Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayagüez (UPR-M). Project development also will be supported by the Puerto Rican Solar Business Accelerator (PRSBA), which is funded by a grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration.
The Solar Foundation and UPR-M will provide direct support to Castañer in all phases of the project, including the presentation of sustainable financing options, drafting of the request for proposals, project design, and project management. The Solar Foundation will also donate solar equipment valued at around $40,000 to help reduce the overall cost of the project.

The community of Castañer was joined in the project by the Hydroelectric Cooperative of La Montaña (CHM), a nonprofit that seeks to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters. CHM was tapped by Castañer as the community representative in the microgrid pre-development and development stage.
The microgrid is expected to serve as an example for other communities wishing to develop similar projects. Plans call for  construction to take place this fall.
In the coming weeks, The Solar Foundation will announce a round of applications for a second microgrid project supported by the PRSBA.
A combination of microgrids and renewable energy was mandated last summer in a utility integrated resource plan (IRP) for the island. The mandate came from the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau, the island’s chief energy regulator. Puerto Rico’s utility, PREPA, had been developing its IRP since March 2018. The energy bureau ruled that microgrids must be a central part of grid planning.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/22/pge-and-bmw-expand-electric-vehicle-test-program-in-california/,"EV,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 22, 2021",PG&E and BMW expand electric vehicle test program in California,"Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and BMW Group said they will expand their six-year-old pilot program focused on charging electric vehicles (EVs) with excess renewable energy to support grid reliability.
Designed for a larger group of BMW EV drivers—about 3,000 EV drivers compared to 100 and 400 in phases one and two, respectively—phase three will further explore how paying drivers to shift charging times can help meet the needs of the electric grid and use excess renewable energy. PG&E will work with BMW to send signals to participants encouraging them to charge at times that support the grid.
Participating drivers earn incentives for smart charging, including $150 at sign-up and up to an additional $250 a year by following charge-time recommendations. The total amount earned over the two years depends on individual participation in charging events.
Future EVs may be able to discharge the vehicle battery to support the grid during emergencies. PG&E and the BMW Group will explore this potential by testing vehicle-to-grid functionalities in a lab setting. Efforts could support bill savings for EV-driving customers and include testing EV batteries for use as backup generation and other grid services.
Through smart charging, EVs act as a grid resource to support reliability. Smart charging focuses on moving EV charging away from times when electricity is in high demand and toward times when less demand exists along with more renewable energy on the grid, such as mid-day.
Around 320,000 EVs plug into PG&E’s electric grid. As EV adoption continues to grow, the potential for these vehicles as a flexible grid resource becomes more significant, the utility said.
The ChargeForward pilot was launched in 2015. Optimizing charging with renewable energy was the focus of the second phase. Initial tests showed participants averaged more than 55% of renewable energy charging, more than double the national average at the time.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/22/hunt-energy-partners-with-manulife-to-develop-energy-storage-across-ercot/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 22, 2021",Hunt Energy partners with Manulife to develop energy storage across ERCOT,"Dallas-based Hunt Energy Network formed a venture with Manulife Investment Management to develop 500 MW of energy storage within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).
The new company will be called HEN Infrastructure and will develop and manage a portfolio of distribution-level energy storage assets in ERCOT, dispatched by Hunt Energy Network’s TraDER platform.
The assets are intended to provide ERCOT with distributed, coordinated, fast-responding generation and load resources to balance power across the grid. The TraDER platform will automate trading and settlement activities.
HEN Infrastructure currently has 100 MW of energy storage assets in development across ERCOT with operations targeted for the first quarter of 2022. The firm has another 400 MW that it hopes to deploy over the following 36 months.
Investment bank Javelin Capital acted as advisor to Hunt Energy Network on the transaction. Hunt is led by Pat Wood III, a former chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Texas.
It’s been a bit of March Madness for energy storage in ERCOT. Wärtsilä said it will supply energy storage technology for two projects with a combined rated capacity of 200 MW in south Texas. The Madero and Ignacio plants will provide grid support, including frequency regulation, to ERCOT.
The order was placed by Able Grid Energy Solutions, a utility-scale energy storage project development arm of MAP RE/ES. Wärtsilä has also signed 10-year guaranteed asset performance agreements for the equipment. As part of the deal, Wärtsilä will supply its GridSolv Quantum energy storage technology as well as a management platform to monitor and control energy flow.
And earlier in the month, it was reported that an entity linked to Tesla will develop a 100 MW lithium-ion battery energy storage facility south of Houston. Gambit Energy Storage could have the grid-connected facility in service by June.
The project would include lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4 or “LFP”) batteries, similar to those used in portable electronic devices such as laptops, mobile phones, electric bikes, and cars. The project site is near a 138 kV substation in Angleton, Texas, and would offer black start capability to help the ERCOT grid recover after a blackout.

Tom Wolf (D) said the state will power nearly half of the government’s electricity needs through seven new solar energy arrays totaling 191 MW.
Lightsource bp will build, own, and operate the solar arrays. The commonwealth’s General Services agency contracted with utility Constellation to secure a 15-year fixed-price supply agreement.
The governor’s office said that Solar Renewable Energy Credits generated by the projects will be retired upon purchase by the commonwealth, ensuring that the SRECs are not used by another entity.
The portfolio will be built across the state and is expected to go into operation on Jan. 1, 2023. The projects are part of the governor’s GreenGov initiative, Project to Utilize Light and Solar Energy (PULSE).
The portfolio will also boost the state’s total installed solar capacity, which currently sits at 664 MW. This is an impressive figure on a national scale, but Pennsylvania still lags behind its Mid-Atlantic neighbors Maryland (1.3 GW), New Jersey (3.6 GW), and New York (2.7 GW). The Keystone State is ahead of much-smaller Delaware (150 MW).
Specific capacities for each of the projects were not released, although site locations were.  The seven installations will be built across six counties: Columbia, Juniata, Montour, Northumberland, Snyder, and York. All totaled, the projects are expected to cut carbon dioxide emissions statewide by 157,800 metric tons each year.
Besides powering government electricity needs with in-state renewable generation, the state aims to cut its energy use at least 3% annually; replace 25% of the state vehicle fleet with electric vehicles; and attain high-performance energy standards in building construction, lease, or renovation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/22/minute-to-design-it-solar-design-apps-save-time-creating-proposals-for-owners/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COST AND PRICES,INSTALLATIONS,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 22, 2021",Minute to design it: Solar design apps save time creating proposals for owners,"Only a few years ago, showing up prepared for a potential client involved Google Earth, a ruler, and an inkjet printer. This took time, and the numbers were always rough.
In a sales environment where only one in 10 viable projects moves forward, getting from a good idea to a hard yes or no from a customer needs to happen fast.
So, let’s imagine ourselves as solar developers under pressure and tasked with creating a design for a client proposal in only one minute. The 60-second race is on!
My firm started using Helioscope around 2014 to do quick commercial solar system layouts. Once a rooftop has been targeted, we can design a project – if we were in a race – in less than a minute. At the end of that minute, we’ll know the potential electricity generation, and how many solar panels fit on the site.
(And for the residential market, Aurora Solar has amazing features for the smaller, tighter, tree-surrounded rooftops on our homes.)
Once logged into Helioscope, the only button that matters is the big orange one labeled New Project. Clicking it launches a window that asks for a project name, address, and hardware profile.
Click the New Project button in Helioscope. Time needed to complete action: 3 seconds
Our hardware profile — which we’ve already configured to specify the main components and techniques our company deploys in construction — is chosen by default. Some of the key components include solar panels, racking, and inverters, and site-specific information such as angle of panels, and required setbacks.

After entering our information, we click Create New Project. Time needed to complete action: 10 seconds.
Now we’ve arrived at the project’s custom site page within Helioscope. New designs, unique site conditions, shading, and the final design deliverables can be navigated to using this page. Our quick layout challenge takes us first to the New button, then the Create New Design field.
That’s when we get to the array design page, which is where the tool’s real beauty lies. With this page, the team at Helioscope has given the solar system sales person the ability to customize and fine-tune design on the fly, without using engineering resources.
Time needed to complete action: 20 seconds
This account has a carport profile in place (which we selected while setting up this new solar layout), so Helioscope “designs” the solar system for us. The design includes a fairly accurate conversion of Google Earth imagery dimensions into solar panel sizes, angles, and shadows.
This happens as easily as you can connect dots with a mouse. (Seriously, folks, this is magic.)
The software also chooses an inverter to connect to the panels. If you’re lucky, your solar system’s size will be a perfect fit for the default profile’s solar inverter. If not, you’ll need to find a unit that matches the output.

Time needed to complete action: 0-10 seconds
At this point, we have a nascent design of a solar power system that includes total number of solar panels, angle and azimuth of the solar system, and inverters and rough wiring.
From here, press the large “Save & Exit” button near the top of the page. Then move to the “Reports” button and click “Simulate.”

Time needed to complete action: 10 to 30 seconds
You’ve now set in motion the final action to have a technical solar power deliverable, more than enough for a first conversation with a customer.
Helioscope produces a clean, shareable diagram of the solar array, overlaying the site’s Google Earth image. The deliverable calculates the number of solar panels and inverters and provides their model numbers.
Also calculated are multiple levels of electricity generation data: monthly and first-year totals, as well the various points in the generation process where energy losses occur. These electricity loss data fields represent our final quality check before we hand the document to the customer.

First-year electricity generation along with the system’s total solar panel wattage is required to create a financial model. That model, along with the Helioscope proposal, are typically the only documents a developer needs to provide a client in the early stages of a project.
What’s more, having the opportunity to share your screen and refine the design based on the prospective customer’s input is a real added value that enhances your business reputation and just may seal the deal.
Total elapsed time for our simulated race? As little as 43 seconds.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/22/sunrise-brief-clouds-and-storms-are-impacted-by-lingering-wildfire-particles-researchers-say/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 22, 2021","Sunrise brief: Clouds and storms are impacted by lingering wildfire particles, researchers say","As the frequency and size of wildfires continue to increase, research by Carnegie Mellon University scientists found that the chemical aging of particles emitted by fires can lead to more extensive cloud formation and intense storm development.
The researchers said that introducing large amounts of ice-nucleating particles due to fires can cause “substantial impacts “on cloud microphysics.
(Read “Storm season has the solar industry looking to protect assets from costly hail damage.”)
The scientists collected plant materials, burned them, and analyzed the particles emitted in the smoke. They focused on ice-nucleating particles that can catalyze ice crystal formation at higher-than-usual temperatures and affect cloud formation.
With a specialized chamber reactor, mass spectrometers, electron microscopy, and a microfluidic droplet freezing technique, the researchers analyzed the particles. They also simulated the aging that these particles would undergo in the atmosphere. Their work found that chemical aging of particles emitted by wildfires can lead to more extensive cloud formation.
The U.S. National Science Foundation-funded research was published in Science Advances.
Last year marked the first time that coal was not the largest–or even the second-largest–source of annual electricity generation in the United States since at least 1949.
U.S. coal-fired electricity generation totaled 774 million MWh in 2020. That was less than both natural gas-fired (1.6 billion MWh) and nuclear-powered generation (790 million MWh), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
However, EIA said it expects coal-fired generation to increase and for nuclear-powered electricity generation to decrease in both 2021 and 2022.
Coal-fired capacity was 313 GW in 2008 and its capacity factor was 72%. Capacity factors measure the output for a fleet of generators as a percentage of what those generators are capable of producing. In 2020, coal’s operating capacity was 223 GW, and the fleet’s capacity factor was 40%. U.S. nuclear power had 97 GW of capacity in 2020, and a capacity factor of 93%.
EIA said expects coal-fired generation to grow and for nuclear-powered generation to fall both this year and next. Higher prices for natural gas will make coal more competitive. This expected increase in coal’s use more than offsets the upcoming retirement of 2.8 GW of coal capacity in 2021 and another 8.5 GW in 2022, EIA said.
EIA also said it expects nuclear-powered generation to drop as three nuclear plants (totaling 5.1 GW of capacity) retire this year. One nuclear power plant, Vogtle, in Georgia, plans to add 1.1 GW of capacity in November 2021 and 1.1 GW in November 2022.
Ameresco said it achieved commercial operation at its 4.95 MW solar energy site in Tiverton, and mechanical completion at its 5.71 MW site in Cumberland, both in Rhode Island.
The Rhode Island Airport Corp. entered into a long-term agreement as the designated off-taker of energy generated from both sites. The airport is expected to net an annual cost savings of around $790,000 once the two projects are in service.
Commercial operation of the Cumberland project is expected by April.
Southern California Gas Co. said that natural gas diverted landfill waste is now flowing into its pipeline system from Anaergia Inc.’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility, around 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
A mile-long pipeline connects the facility to an existing SoCalGas pipeline. This is the fifth project in which landfill gas has been injected directly into SoCalGas’ system.
The facility uses anaerobic digestion technology and processes up to 300,000 tons of waste diverted from local landfills. SoCalGas said it is now distributing natural gas from nearly 25 dairy farms and more than 18 cities’ refuse collectors.
Earlier this month, Australian energy storage company Redflow Ltd said it will supply a 2 MWh energy storage system made up of 192 zinc-bromine flow batteries to the Rialto facility.
The microgrid was funded in part by a grant from the California Energy Commission and consists of batteries, a biogas conditioning system, and a control system.
