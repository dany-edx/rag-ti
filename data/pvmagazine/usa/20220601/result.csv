The energy will be sold via a 15-year power purchase agreement, providing power equivalent to the needs of 20,000 California homes. 
As a community choice aggregator, EBCE supplies electricity to residential, commercial and municipal customers, delivered by PG&E transmission and distribution lines. The program offers Alameda County and its 11 cities the ability to purchase renewable energy at rates to competitive with traditional generation. The not-for-profit organization reinvests earnings back into the community to create local programs, renewable energy projects, and jobs. 
This project, called Luciana, provided jobs for over 200 workers during construction, mainly sourced from local union halls. The project provides ongoing revenues to Tulare County. 
“Considering the unprecedented supply chain challenges the industry faced this past year, we are proud to have successfully achieved commercial operation of the Luciana project through our partnership with East Bay Clean Energy (EBCE),” said Cary Vandenberg, CEO of Idemitsu Renewables.
The project is another step in EBCE’s pursuit of 100% clean energy for all customers by 2030. Launched in 2018, the organization serves over 1.7 million residential and commercial customers. EBCE is one of 19 community choice aggregator programs in the state of California.
The organization has saved $10 million annually for its customers when compared to PG&E rates, and provides $100,000 in sponsorships to local programs in athletics, STEM education, music and art, and more.

Community choice aggregation
Community choice aggregation (CCA) programs allow local governments to procure power on behalf of their residents, businesses, and municipal accounts from an alternative supplier while still receiving transmission and distribution service from their existing utility provider. By aggregating demand, communities gain leverage to negotiate better rates with competitive suppliers.
Currently, there are CCA programs in ten states with another seven states investigating the programs, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). California was the third state to enact CCA legislation, following Massachusetts and Ohio.
California CCAs offer contracts ranging from 33% to 100% renewable energy supply. Unlike the process in many other states, communities in California do not have to hold a referendum to start or join a CCA. Local elected officials authorize participation in a CCA by a simple majority vote.
The state’s first CCA, Marin Clean Energy, was launched in 2010, and at the time was branded as a “risky scheme,” said EPA. Since then, it has been proven to be an economically viable service, and the state has seen CCA activity flourish in the past decade.

According to Nautilus, two portfolios are comprised of five projects in Cumberland, Kennebec and Penobscot counties, totaling 26.2 MW in total capacity. All five projects are in various stages of development, with the first projects expected to reach operation by the third quarter of 2022. Nautilus will act as the long-term owner of the projects and will be responsible for overseeing construction, maintaining its long-term performance, and acquiring and managing customer subscriptions. Any residential Central Maine Power utility customer is eligible to subscribe to the projects through Nautilus with no upfront cost, no long-term commitment, and no cancellation fees, Nautilus reports.
The projects will all operate under Maine’s NEB program, which allows customers to benefit from clean energy savings by offsetting their electrical bills with either owned or shared energy projects, like community solar, which, in turn, spurs further development of these assets within the state. The NEB program has become critical in establishing a healthy and growing community solar market in Maine.
Nautilus Solar acquired these portfolios in two separate transactions with BNRG Maine, bringing Nautilus’ capacity of acquired and developed community solar projects within the state to more than 92 MW, of which 52 MW will be operational end of Q3 2022 and 88 MW by the end of 2022. Nautilus has made a big push into community solar since being acquired in 2019 by Power Sustainable, a subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada.
In April, Nautilus announced the completion of a 24.9 MW community solar portfolio in New York. Comprised of four projects located in Allegany, Cattaraugus, Genesee, and Steuben counties, the combined portfolio provides enough power for an estimated 1,950 households and multiple commercial subscribers, including the Target, Lowe’s, and Hannaford Brothers. Two months before that, the company announced the completion of a pair of community solar portfolios in Colorado and Minnesota.
In Colorado, Denver-based Pivot Energy and Nautilus completed a 13 MW community solar portfolio, which is made up of seven projects located in Crowley, Weld, and Logan counties. The installations provide energy to an estimated 1,700 households and 12 commercial subscribers, including the Town of Breckenridge. The projects are in the Xcel Energy and Black Hills Energy utility territories.
In Minnesota, Nautilus acquired twelve community solar projects in Minnesota totaling 16.8 MW of solar capacity, located in Blue Earth, Sherburne, Wabasha, Winona, Sibley, Wright, Pope, and Meeker counties. The projects are all in various stages of development, with the first several projects expected to be operational by the end of 2022. Once completed, the projects will provide a clean energy option to 4,200 households in Minnesota within the Xcel Energy electric utility territory. Any residential Xcel Energy utility customer in Minnesota located in the same or adjacent county to a project may subscribe through Nautilus with no upfront cost, no long-term commitment and no cancellation fees, Nautilus reports.

In September, US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm issued a challenge to add another 60 communities to the program in the next six months, which was recently achieved.
Two organizations were awarded $10 million to manage the further expansion of the program,w which has already helped hundreds of communities. The expansion goal is to add another 500 communities over the next five years, while also adding new areas of focus including solar and storage, low- and moderate-income solar financing, and other strategies to accelerate deployment and benefit underserved communities.
Of the more than 60 new communities that accepted the September challenge to join SolSmart, at least 40% are considered underserved communities, helping to achieve DOE’s goals of increasing equitable access to clean energy and President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative. The recent expansion includes the first Puerto Rican communities to participate in the program. In addition, the expansion of the SolSmart program will help the United States reach President Biden’s goal of having an equitable, clean electricity grid by 2035.
“SolSmart has helped hundreds of local governments make it easier and more affordable to go solar, and I am thrilled to see the program take root in Puerto Rico, where solar power’s climate resilience adds enormous benefit for the grid,” said Secretary Granholm. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting local governments transitioning and expanding access to clean energy like solar power, particularly in underserved communities.”
The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) will share the $10 million award to manage the program to encourage more equitable solar deployment and the adoption of emerging technologies, including a combination of solar power and battery storage.
The communities that accepted the challenge and were recently designated as SolSmart communities are:

The 260 MW/260 MWh battery energy storage project is the largest of its kind in Texas to date. This project is part of the $1 billion investment that Vistra is making within the Texas ERCOT market, and is the second of seven new zero-carbon projects Vistra is bringing online in Texas over the next few years as part of its Vistra Zero portfolio.
“As our fleet and electric grids across the country transition to cleaner generation, we haven’t lost sight of our essential role in providing reliable, affordable electricity. The battery storage technology at DeCordova accomplishes those objectives – providing instantaneous-start, dispatchable generation to help balance the intermittency of renewable energy as the electric grid transitions to low-to-zero-carbon resources,” said Curt Morgan, CEO of Vistra.
The DeCordova Energy Storage Facility has more than 3,000 individual lithium-ion battery modules, which can store enough electricity to power approximately 130,000 homes. The battery containers as well as inverters were supplied by Sungrow, the project integrator. Mortenson provided the engineering and construction, which was complete in less than one year.
The DeCordova storage facility is co-located with a quick-start natural gas power plant. “This pairing means we essentially have a large, one-hour battery system with dispatchable, reliable generation, leading to continuity of operation and resiliency of the grid,” said Jim Burke, Vistra president and chief financial officer. “In addition, these gas-fueled generation units have seven days of diesel backup in the event of any disruption of natural gas supplies, which is yet another example of the resiliency aspect of the Decordova site.”
Under the Vistra Zero portfolio, the company now has nearly 3,300 MW online with plans for 7,300 MW of zero-carbon generation by 2026. The Vistra Zero has a goal of retiring 8,000 MW of fossil-fuel powered plants by 2027.
In addition to the DeCordova project, Vistra plans to complete the 108 MW Emerald Grove Solar Facility in Crane County, Texas. And while some think that everything is bigger in Texas, Vistra also owns and operates the 400MW/1,600 MWh battery energy storage system in Moss Landing, California, the largest of its kind in the world. The Moss Landing site was in the news less than a year after it was completed, as it was knocked offline when an unspecified number of batteries overheated. Following the incident Vistra reported that the fire was likely not caused by the batteries.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/01/investors-are-flocking-back-to-natural-gas-but-renewables-remain-attractive/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 1, 2022","Investors are flocking back to natural gas, but renewables remain attractive","Ernst & Young (EY) has released a report detailing transactions in power and utilities (P&U) for Q1 2022, with data showing that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has shifted the energy landscape significantly. Investments in non-Russian natural gas are rising and there is a renewed focus on energy supply security.
According to EY Strategy and Transactions Partner, Miles Huq, the proposed REPowerEU plan to reduce the EU’s dependence on Russian gas imports by two-thirds within a year and phase them out altogether “well before” the end of the decade will require the region to invest significantly in import capacity and pipeline infrastructure. With these plans in mind, the U.S. liquid natural gas market has skyrocketed in anticipation.
In the Americas, 33 deals were completed in Q1 2022, with a cumulative deal value of $15.5 billion. The deal value across both continents was primarily driven by the US, as it typically is, with deal value totaling up to $13.2 billion, representing 85% of the total deal value across both continents. The deal making activity in the US was the highest across the past nine quarters, driven primarily by two major multibillion-dollar deals in the gas utility and renewables segment.
The two deals referenced are Infrastructure Investments Fund’s agreement to acquire South Jersey Industries, Inc., a gas utility for $7.6 billion on February 24, and Blackstone Infrastructure Partners’ $3 billion equity investment in Invenergy Renewables on January 7. At the time on the investment, Blackstone shared that the capital would enable Invenergy to accelerate development on its 3 GW pipeline of solar and wind projects expected to be completed by the end of 2023.
The report also highlighted a number of important transactions in the renewables space, with the Americas as a while witnessing $6 billion in transactions across 20 deals in the quarter. Among these important transactions was the $775 million in equity capital investment into southern-based solar developer, Silicon Ranch, led by Manulife Investment Management, which was joined in the round by existing Silicon Ranch shareholders, including Shell, TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund, and Mountain Group Partners.
Shell invested in Silicon Ranch in 2018 and owns about 45% of the company, and the funding provided by that January 6 deal is expected to enable Silicon Ranch to build about 2 GW of solar projects by January 2025, doubling its current built capacity. Shell also shared that Silicon Ranch could be in the business of acquisition making, like its 2021 purchase of Clearloop, a company that sells carbon offsets to corporations to fund solar projects in low-income communities.
The report also highlights Montreal-based independent fund manager Axium Infrastructure’s acquisition of a 49% equity interest in a 1,415 MW portfolio of wind and solar farms in the US. The projects, all of which have already entered operation, were developed by Constellation Renewables, which retains the remaining 51% stake. The 49% stake was sold to Axium by Canada’s Manulife Investment Management, acting on behalf of John Hancock Infrastructure Fund and its affiliates.
The report also covers Brookfield Renewables’ purchase of utility scale-solar and energy storage developer, Urban Grid, and its pipeline of development-stage projects for $650 million in January. That pipeline is comprised of 1 GW of solar assets and 7 GW of battery assets, both standalone and co-located with solar. Brookfield shared that the acquisition would bring its development pipeline to roughly 31 GW, effectively tripling it.
Finally, the report also brings up the January 19 announcement from 8minute Solar Energy that it closed $400 million in financing from EIG, a leading institutional investor in the global energy and infrastructure sectors. According to 8minute, the funds will help the company to continue to operate and grow its portfolio of clean energy assets, which includes more than 18 GW of solar and 24 GWh of storage throughout California, Texas, and the southwestern United States. The investment will also will enable 8minute to focus on technology innovation and advanced solar plant design, and to begin building projects on its own balance sheet, two important developments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/01/california-dont-tax-the-sun-rooftop-solar-rally-planned/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 1, 2022",California “don’t tax the sun” rooftop solar rally planned,"This February, following several weeks of industry outcry, public protest, and political leader involvement, California’s Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 was successfully delayed. NEM 3.0 was an anti-rooftop solar proposal that slashed the value for homeowners and sweetened the pot for the major investor-owned electric utility companies in California.
As originally proposed, NEM 3.0 would have cut the payments made by utility companies to rooftop solar owners for exporting their excess PV production back to the grid. EQ Analysts said the proposal would lead to a 57-71% overall reduction in solar savings for homeowners.
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) recently presented revisions, and the revised NEM 3.0 remains a utility-friendly, homeowner-unfriendly proposal. The revision includes new structures that cut home solar value, including a “glide path”, non-bypassable charges, and a tariff to boost community solar.
The newly-introduced “non-bypassable charges” would add $0.05/kWh to a customer’s bill, whether or not they own solar. These charges would apply to the electrons generated by the customer’s rooftop solar array and delivered to their own homes. Regulations make it very difficult, or even illegal, to disconnect from the grid entirely in many areas in California.
The revisited NEM 3.0 is met with heavy opposition from environmental groups, workforce and labor groups, solar industry advocates, and Californians who support personal choice and oppose electric utility monopoly. These groups are now organizing a rally to submit public comments to Governor Gavin Newsom and the CPUC.

The “Don’t Tax the Sun” rally is planned for 10:30 am on June 2. It will take place at Grand Park, Los Angeles, and the CPUC Building in San Francisco. RSVP links to the event, organized by the California Solar and Storage Association, can be found here.
Additionally, public comment can be submitted to the CPUC online by June 10th, by following this link.
What’s at stake?
California’s rooftop solar industry represents over 1.4 million homes, small businesses, and other structures topped with PV. The state accounts for 50% of rooftop solar installations in the United States, and of the 230,000 people employed in the solar industry, as many as 68,000 jobs are supported by the state’s rooftop solar business. The proposal is expected to do significant damage to this industry, which is largely made up of small businesses and local employees.
Based on California’s clean energy goals, as much as 28.5 GW of rooftop solar needs to be installed through 2045, according to Environment California. If all this capacity were instead installed on land, 148,000 acres would be needed to support it, an area about half the size of Los Angeles. Rooftop solar directly mitigates energy sprawl, the increase of land use dedicated to producing electricity.
Last month, Regulators from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a comprehensive report outlining the state’s path to carbon neutrality, and chief among the recommendations was support for solar, specifically rooftop solar. The NEM proposal is in direct contrast with CARB’s recommendations, said Environmental Working Group president Ken Cook.
“It is imperative the governor reject the plot by utilities to undermine one of the main pillars of CARB’s roadmap to ensure renewable energy is the dominant source of electricity in the state. Anything less would send a clear signal that felonious, corrupt companies like PG&E can decelerate California’s progress in addressing the climate crisis,” said Cook.

Research has indicated that the partial shade offered by solar panels creates a microclimate that reduces evaporation and significantly boosts the production of vegetation in arid climates.
While these results are preliminary and anecdotal (and perhaps a tall tale from a fleece salesman down under), they offer potentially exciting field results that could be applied globally.
Graeme Ostini, a wool broker, says he’s been grazing his merino wethers (a variety of sheep) at a solar farm where sheep can graze under the modules. Ostini and other grazers say that over the past few years, these sheep have been ‘cutting an amazing amount of wool’.
Ostini said, “It is actually quite astonishing. Some of the sheep look fantastic. They’re growing exponentially and the wool cuts are in the top 5% in the district.” Ostini has been grazing sheep at the site for four years now.
At a separate site, a Tom Warren runs about 250 merino ewes and wethers on 54 hectares of land, land that he also leases to a solar developer.

Warren claims that while his wool yields remained the same, the quality of his wool improved significantly due to reduced contamination. The panels did more than provide shade for the sheep and grass: by slowing evaporation, they also prevented dust from contaminating the wool.
Mr. Warren noted that the solar panels condense water that drips onto the grasses and provide an additional source of water, increasing the carrying capacity of the land by around 25%. Warren also noted that, by leasing his land to the solar farm and grazing his sheep there, his income had increased.
The higher quantities of grass available for grazing were not surprising. Dr. Elnaz Hassapour Adeh, a researcher at Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences, found that several key grazing grasses were able to significantly increase their output mostly due to significantly increased water efficiency – by 328%.

In total, the researchers found that areas that were partially or fully covered by solar panels increased their biomass production by 90%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/01/trackers-vs-the-elements-part-three-minimizing-production-losses/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,INTERVIEW,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 1, 2022","Trackers vs. the elements, part three: minimizing production losses","Any conversation about tracker resilience, especially in regard to wind and hail, is also a conversation about optimizing electricity generation. In short, the less time that solar modules spend in their stow function, the more time that they’ll spend out in the field generating electricity optimally.
Maximizing generation hours in a project’s lifetime is paramount to delivering on PPA agreements and keeping project revenue maximized. In practice, achieving the lowest possible stow time comes down to three major components: hardware reliability, weather monitoring systems, and tracker controls software.
Surviving the storm
While modules take the brunt of collisions with hail or any other striking object, mitigating damage to a system does not start with the module, but with the tracker.
For Nextracker, this mitigation comes in the form of NX Navigator, a software and smart control system that includes a hail function. This function moves the entire solar array to a safer, 60-degree stow angle.
As might be expected, the issue for modules has always been with repeated, large impacts. For individual impacts, many module faces can withstand a single stroke from an ice ball upwards of 40 millimeters (mm) in diameter, or around the size of  golf ball, according to Kent Whitfield, VP for quality at Nextracker, as well as up to 11 strikes of 25 mm hail. By stowing modules, not only is the risk of module face-strikes reduced, but the system is not further compromised by the increased wind speed.
As was reference in the second entry to this series, Arctech Solar and has released a whitepaper outlining resiliency efforts that can be taken to minimize stow time in projects.
For Arctech, this resiliency takes the form of stowing modules at a zero-degree angle in high-wind scenarios, a solution made possible by the advent of rigid trackers and zero-degree stowing in instances of high wind.
Wind stow speed in the age of large-format modules (LFMs) are typically around 12m/second gusts, a relatively common speed, meaning LFM projects will stow more, less energy will be generated, and levelized cost of electricity will be raised. For rigid trackers, the critical wind speed sits at 22 m/s, nearly doubling the parameters for wind under which a project can operate.
In testing, Arctech found that its rigid tracker, stowed at zero degrees, spent just 15 hours, 0.17% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing 204 MWh in that time, roughly 0.09% of projected generation, for a financial loss of just over $5,700. A traditional tracker with a wind threshold of 16m/s and a 30-degree stow angle spent 243 hours, 2.77% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing 1,711MWh in that time, roughly 0.77% of projected generation, for a financial loss of almost $48,000. A hypothetical worst-case scenario with a wind threshold of 12m/s and a 45-degree stow angle spent 1,288 hours, 14.7% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing nearly 9,300MWh in that time, roughly 4.17% of projected generation, for a financial loss of over $260,000.
Eye in the sky
Since hail is a known stow-causer, it is important to know not only where these storms happen but how often. The hail modeling sector has grown rapidly in the last three years, and pv magazine has had conversations with Peter Bostock and John Sedgwick of VDE Americas, who have been working on more accurate models to predict the return interval of stow-necessitating hail.
For most of the solar industry’s history, hail threat prediction models were both general and minimal in nature, with developers relying on basic heat maps to locate what areas had severe hail potential. Applying this approach to an asset spread over a large project footprint that has to operate at peak potential for 30 years is way too general. Modeling needed to be done on a granular, site-specific basis.
Array Technologies, Inc.
“Even at a given location, there’s a size distribution,” said Bostock. “And if you map larger locations, there’s a broader spread to that location.”
To fill this need, VDE developed a tool that blends data from human storm spotters as well as from doppler radar.
Spotter data is useful because it can provide tangible context as to the size of the hail as well as its concentration and distribution. Doppler radar also is used, as it scans and tracks weather data constantly, typically at an 11 degree angle toward the sky. This means that the scanning elevation is higher as distance increases from the radar center. This is better for tracking hail, which forms high in thunderstorms.
By overlaying spotter data with radar feedback data and finding correlations between the two, Bostock said that the radar data an be corrected for the likely size and concentration of the hail in real-time. VDE used this approach to develop a tool that can predict the return interval, the likelihood of a certain type of hail occurring, and the expected size of  hail across different locations.
Sedgwick and Bostock said that by applying appropriate mitigation elements, operational elements, and equipment installed with appropriate stow management, the effects of hail can be significantly mitigated.
Everyday operations
What happens on the majority of the days of the year; the ones where there is no extreme wind or hail, days where trackers will spend the entire day going through their predetermined functions, with no interruptions? How do you squeeze every watt out of a sunny day?
According to Dean Vukovic, the General Manager of Terrasmart’s ground mount division, achieving a project’s peak, optimal yield is about the three Ps: predict, protect and produce.
“On the predict front, we’re using a machine learning-based approach, that’s taking out a rolling history and modeling what our expected performance should look like, at least from the mechanical and the structural side,” explained Vukovic. “So that we can go harvest information, deliver that to the OEM teams, and predict with confidence what we believe that system is going to do. Within that, we’ve got some pretty advanced weather monitoring algorithms, where we plug into various APIs and make sure that we’re doing the best job possible to predict a future weather event that could cause some sort of harm or disruption to the system. We’ve put a lot of time, effort and energy into that space, because that’s going to be one of the one of the biggest things that can cause some variability in these systems’ performance.”
According to Vukovic, getting these predictive models as accessible and encompassing as possible is paramount for Terrasmart, as they form the basis for the company’s protection and production software solutions.
“From a protection point of view, we’re using some of those predictive algorithms to really form as the basis of protection,” he began. But, for us, we’ve also invested a fair bit of time into how we deliver information in the best possible way, so that teams or asset owners can really take the appropriate action. Our platform, our graphical user interface, how we deliver information at a portfolio level, that whole engagement process between harvesting the data at the row level and delivering it up to people and teams that can take action; this is front and center for us, and we feel like we’re pretty innovative in that space.”
Terrasmart is now on the fourth year of developing its predict, protect, and produce software, dubbed PeakYield, with additional improvements to the solution based on user feedback.
“On the technical side of protect, we have and continue to bake a lot of smarts into the robots, the network controllers, and weather stations themselves, to have them be as self sufficient as possible,” said Vukovic. “Whether it’s power or battery management, network conductivity or comms related issues, or some mechanical average variation, whatever the case may be, we really distill that information in a clean, crisp fashion that it allows people to take action.”
And while relaying data on its own doesn’t seem like it would minimize downtime in project generation, Vukovic shares that the more educated and in-tune EPCs and asset operators are with their projects, there will be less downtime.
“If we can get that information delivered in a succinct way, then it means that these teams aren’t tearing through just slabs of data to understand if there’s an issue the system and software is doing that already for them,” said Vukovic.
