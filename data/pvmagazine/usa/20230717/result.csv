The grants are intended to mobilize private capital into clean technology projects to create good-paying jobs and lower energy costs for American families, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities. In addition the projects will cut harmful emissions, thus protecting people’s health and tackling the climate crisis.
“Communities on the front lines of the climate crisis will be the first to reap the benefits of President Biden’s historic investments in the clean economy,” said Michael S. Regan, EPA administrator. “The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will spur private investment into clean technology projects and expand economic opportunity for communities that have been left behind, for families that want lower energy costs, and for workers who need good-paying jobs. This is what President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is all about.”
One of the grant opportunities is the National Clean Investment Fund, which will provide grants of up to $14 billion to support two to three national clean financing institutions in partnering with the private sector to provide financing for tens of thousands of clean technology projects nationwide.
By mobilizing significant private capital, these national nonprofits will work to ensure that every dollar of public funds generates several times more in private investment. At least 40% of the funds from the National Clean Investment Fund must be dedicated to low-income and disadvantaged communities, including those that are rural communities, tribal communities, communities with environmental justice concerns, energy communities, and persistent poverty counties.
The second grant opportunity is the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, which will provide grants of up to $6 billion to support two to seven hub nonprofit organizations. The goal is to enable the organizations to provide funding and technical assistance to public, quasi-public, not-for-profit, and non-profit community lenders working in low-income and disadvantaged communities.
These non-profits can potentially enable community lenders including community development financial institutions, credit unions, green banks, housing finance agencies, and minority depository institutions to finance clean technology projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities. 100% of the funds from the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator will be dedicated to low-income and disadvantaged communities.
“By funding a national network of non-profit financing institutions that will deliver capital to tens of thousands of clean technology projects in local communities across the country, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will transform local economies and help us meet our climate goals,” said Jahi Wise, senior advisor and acting director of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. “Investments like this one will expand opportunities for the communities that have too often been left out and left behind.”
The two grant opportunities fall under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund that is part of the the Inflation Reduction Act. They build on the $7 billion Solar for All competition, in which the EPA will award up to 60 grants to states, territories, Tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofits to expand residential solar access for low-income and disadvantaged communities.
The program will enable grantees to “expand existing low-income solar programs or design and deploy new Solar for All programs nationwide,” EPA said in a notice. Applications for the Solar for All program must include a notice of intent, which is due from interested parties by July 31.
All three competitions are intended to help meet the President’s climate goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50% to 52% below 2005 levels in 2030, and achieving net zero emissions by no later than 2050. They also help advance the President’s commitment to environmental justice and the Justice40 Initiative, which sets the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments in climate, clean energy, and other areas flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution. At least $18.6 billion of the $27 billion across the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is dedicated to low-income and disadvantaged communities.
The deadline to apply to the grants is October 12, 2023. EPA intends to make two-to-three awards under this competition. Applicants must be eligible nonprofits as defined in Section 134(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act and as further explained in the NOFO.
Coalitions, led by an eligible nonprofit, are also eligible to apply to this competition. Additional details on eligibility can be found in Section III of the NOFO. EPA has published the NOFO for this grant competition on grants.gov.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/17/bifacial-perovskites-show-93-backside-efficiency/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 17, 2023",Perovskites show 93% bifaciality,"Research by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on bifacial perovskite solar cells has yielded backside efficiencies of 91% to 93%, leading the researchers to conclude that bifacial perovskites may be a preferable pathway for a lower levelized cost of electricity. The results are published in Joule magazine.
Perovskites hold promise for their low cost to produce, and their thinness allows them to be deposited on most surfaces. While challenges remain with the stability and longevity of perovskites, new efficiency records have been achieved month after month in recent years.
Past iterations of bifacial perovskites have struggled to keep up with monofacial cells, which currently have a record efficiency of 26%. Bifacial cells are also more expensive to produce than their single-face counterparts. The NREL researchers noted that for the technology to compete, a bifacial cell should have a front-side efficiency close to the best-performing monofacial cell, and that the backside efficiency rating should be close to 100% of the front side efficiency.
In the newly produced single-junction NREL bifacial cell, an efficiency of 23% was recorded on the front, with the back side achieving 91% to 93% of that efficiency level. The research team said that bifacial cells could generate 10% to 20% more power than single-face cells.
Before constructing the record-breaking cell, researchers used optical and electrical simulations to determine the ideal thickness. The front layer had to be thick enough to absorb most of the photons from a certain part of the solar spectrum, but a perovskite layer that is too thick can block the photons.
On the back of the cell, the NREL team had to determine the ideal thickness of the rear electrode to minimize resistive loss. The team noted the balance between the resistive and optical losses needs to be considered. The transparent oxide rear electrode needs to be sufficiently thick to minimize the resistive loss, but it also needs to be sufficiently thin to minimize parasitic absorption.
The research team found that an ideal thickness for a perovskite layer is around 850 nanometers, which is incredibly thin. For reference, a human hair is roughly 70,000 nanometers thick.
Albedo, or the reflectivity of the surface beneath the solar cell, impacts the output of the backside perovskites. The bifacial output power was measured at 28.5 mW per square centimeter with an albedo of 0.3 and 30.1 mW per square centimeter for an albedo of 0.5.
This research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office. Read more about recent developments in perovskite research here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/17/massachusetts-greenlights-800-mwh-battery-energy-storage-facilities/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 17, 2023",Massachusetts greenlights 800 MWh battery energy storage facilities,"The Massachusetts Energy Siting Facilities Board has approved two energy storage facilities with a combined capacity of 400 MW/800 MWh. This decision overturns previous rulings that hindered the development of these facilities. Once operational, they will fulfill 80% of the state’s 1 GWh energy storage deployment target for 2025.
The final rulings for the Cranberry Point Energy Storage and the Medway Grid projects were issued on June 30th.
The Medway facility in Medway, Mass. will be located in the Eversource utility region, and connect to an Eversource substation. Medway expects to place 140 Tesla Megapacks on the site. Megapacks use lithium iron phosphate technology. The substation associated with the project will include one 300 MVA transformer.
Previously, these two facilities were considered outside of the purview of the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board, a verdict that surprisingly opened the door for further project deliberation. As of the end of June, the board granted the facilities zoning by-law exemptions, which effectively clears the path for their construction.
The facilities had maintained that they were essentially generating units offering services to Massachusetts and the broader New England ISO region. However, Save the Pine Barrens, a local environmental group, argued that since the facilities captured, stored and redistributed electricity, they couldn’t be classified as ‘generators’. Consequently, the group contended, the projects should not proceed.
Countering this argument, the board ruled that the units did indeed qualify as generating units, upholding existing precedents. It also affirmed that the units were crucial for the state to achieve its energy goals, and that the alternate site suggestions provided or the “no build” option would not serve the public interest.
The Cranberry Point facility is being developed by Plus Power of San Francisco. Per the project’s website, the facility has been under development since 2017, and was initially approved by the Town of Carver’s Planning Board and Conservation Commission in March 2019. The project is located in Carver, Mass. in Eversource territory, and it will connect to an Eversource substation, and as noted previously, will service the whole of the New England region. The developer says the project will use Tesla Megapack batteries, and lithium iron phosphate batteries.
This ruling was facilitated by then Attorney General Muara Healey, who invalidated the City of Carter’s moratoria on solar and battery projects. Healey, now serving as the state’s Governor, cited legal precedents and deemed municipal justifications insufficient. She asserted that the moratoria, which unreasonably restricted solar and storage systems without substantial proof of public interest, violated M.G.L. c. 40A, § 3. She further stated that the moratoria hindered the state’s solar energy policy and that the rationale of studying impacts was not compelling enough to uphold them. 
This article was amended to change lithium ion phosphate to lithium iron phosphate.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/17/first-solar-inks-5-gw-supply-deal-with-energix/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,ISRAEL,POLAND,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 17, 2023",First Solar inks 5 GW supply deal with Energix,"Energix Renewables signed an order for 5 GW of First Solar modules to be supplied between 2026 and 2030. The cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film modules will be used for project under development in Israel, Poland and the United States.
First Solar continues to book module orders well into the future as demand for U.S.-made solar components remains red hot due to domestic manufacturing incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act and an increased emphasis on renewables in utilities and corporate procurement plans.
The procurement deal includes a contract with First Solar’s recycling service division to handle end-of-life management of decommissioned modules. The recycling service involves closed-loop semiconductor recovery for use in new modules, while also recovering other materials including aluminum, glass, and laminates. First Solar’s CdTe thin-film modules have among the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV module today.
“As we grow our pipeline, we want a trusted partner that will not compromise on quality, its commitments, or principles, and that partner is First Solar,” said Asa (Asi) Levinger, chief executive officer, Energix.
The company’s CdTe technology certified a new record in Q1 2023 with a conversion efficiency of 22.3%. A $370 million investment will lead to the creation of a new research and development center in Perrysburg, Ohio, which is expected to be completed in 2024.
First Solar is investing about $1.3 billion in expanding U.S. manufacturing from 6.5 GW of annual nameplate capacity to over 10.9 GW by 2026. Much of this investment is directed toward the $1.1 billion, 3.5 GW annual output facility in Alabama. Another $185 million is being directed toward expanding First Solar’s existing manufacturing facility in Ohio.
As some traditional crystalline polysilicon-based panels face global supply chain challenges and exemptions from participation in the U.S. market, project developers are turning to First Solar’s differentiated CdTe supply chain with strong traceability.
“This is another example of a large, sophisticated player choosing to de-risk its development portfolio by working with us,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer, First Solar. “They recognize that they do not simply get a high-quality, high-performance, responsibly-produced PV module, but a trusted partner and long-term pricing and supply certainty, which are rarities in the solar industry.”
Energix is a large global renewable energy developer with operations in the U.S., Poland and Israel, with an active development portfolio of over 8.5 GW of generation and 7 GW energy storage. The company has 850 projects under or near construction and 867 MW of operational projects.

And while the number of deals went down, total funding went up.
Total corporate funding, including venture capital (VC) funding, public market, and debt financing, was up 54% year-over-year (YoY) compared to $12 billion raised in the first half of 2022. The number of deals dropped from 91 in the same period last year to 80 in the first half of this year, a decrease of 12%

 
“Even amidst the tightening financial market conditions and high interest rates, the solar industry remained strong in the first half of the year. Besides AI, cleantech is one of the few sectors still attracting VC interest. Demand due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is so strong that even interest rate-sensitive public market and debt financing in solar was up year-over-year. The lack of easy money, however, affected M&A activity negatively,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.
Global VC funding rose 3% YoY with 33 deals worth $3.8 billion compared to 53 deals in the same period last year, worth $3.7 billion.
Top five VC deals:

Developers and independent power producers (IPPs) acquired 5.5 GW of solar projects, whereas utilities acquired just under 4 GW. Insurance companies, pension funds, energy trading businesses, industrial conglomerates, and IT firms acquired another 2.1 GW. Oil and gas companies acquired 1.8 GW of projects, and investment firms acquired 407 MW.
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) were down in the first half of 2023, with 116 project acquisitions for 25.5 GW of solar projects compared to 148 project acquisitions totaling 37.8 GW in the first half of 2022. The largest deal was by Brookfield Renewable, which agreed to acquire Duke Energy’s unregulated utility-scale commercial renewables business in the U.S. The business comprised close to 3.5 GW of utility solar, wind and energy storage projects, and was acquired for cash consideration of $1.1 billion and the assumption of $1.7 billion total debt.
Solar public market financing in the first half of 2023 totaled $6.7 billion in 14 deals, which was 103% higher than the $3.3 billion financed in eight deals in the first half of 2022. Solar debt financing activity in the first half of 2023 reached $8 billion in 33 deals, a 60% increase compared to 1H 2022, when $5 billion was raised in 30 deals.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/17/lincoln-parks-first-community-solar-program/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MINNESOTA",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JULY 17, 2023",Lincoln Park’s first community solar program,"Duluth Minnesota’s Lincoln Park neighborhood has 6,000 residents, most of whom have a household income of less than $35,000 a year. To support economic stability and energy resilience in this neighborhood, local nonprofit Ecolibrium3 collaborated with community and state partners, including the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Commerce) and Clean Energy Resource Teams (CERTs) to construct a 38 kW community solar garden and start The Resilience Hub. 
“These partnerships provided technical assistance, community outreach, visioning, and project funding,” said Gabe Epstein, project associate with the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA). 
Both projects represent the state’s push to include low and medium-income customers in its community solar program. Minnesota has constructed more than 826 MW of PV systems across 400 sites to accommodate over 28,000 residents since the program’s launch in 2013. 
Community solar gardens (CSGs) are solar installations where customers subscribe for a share of the electricity produced to help offset their energy use and save on their monthly utility bills.
Since launching in 2020, Duluth’s CSG has generated 135 MWh of electricity and earned $13,000 through net metering. This popular program allows owners of commercial and residential PV systems to sell excess electricity back into the grid.   
The Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans (MACV) and Community Energy Fund generated 34 MWh or $2,972 and 102 MWh or $8,915, respectively, to make up the project’s kWh and monetary value since its launch. 

Ecolibrium3 (ECo3) will allocate 75% of energy savings to an ECo3 Energy Fund for low-income families with emergency bill payments and home weatherization or energy-efficient appliance costs. The remaining 25% of energy generated will power the Duluth Veteran’s Place.
It’s important to note that the dollar values are slightly below 25% and 75% of the total income generated because ECo3 keeps about 10% to cover operational costs.
Grants and donations funded the $209,000 array while land was donated from the City of Duluth, which still owns it. The garden was constructed on Lake Superior, also the entrance to the Lincoln Park neighborhood from downtown.
Resilience Hub 
A case study by CESA found 27% of 18- to 64-year-olds in Lincoln Park have a disability. In comparison, 71% of residents reported a lack of affordable housing and 41% of people in the neighborhood experience barriers to getting food. The Resilience Hub, part of the larger ECo3 project, aims to address this and other community-reported challenges. 
The concept was created by the Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN) which defines Resilience Hubs as “community-serving facilities augmented to support residents and coordinate resource distribution and services before during and/or after a natural hazard event,” said Epstein.
The Lincoln Park Resilience Hub houses ECo3’s office and includes a warming center to protect people from extreme cold. Epstein reports it will soon have a cooling center providing an escape from heat waves. There will also be a computer lab and workforce development training space as well as a commercial kitchen for aspiring entrepreneurs. There will be a grocery store and transportation access close by too. 
“Ecolibrium3 hopes to add solar arrays and battery storage eventually,” said Epstein. 
CESA will host a webinar on July 27 where Eco3 Founder and CEO Jodi Slick will discuss this project and what was learned.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/17/solar-plus-storage-evaluated-for-resilience-at-seven-florida-community-health-centers/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,FLORIDA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 17, 2023",Solar-plus-storage evaluated for resilience at seven Florida community health centers,"The Florida Association of Community Health Centers (FACHC) is reaching out to its member health centers in Florida to improve resilience to power outages.
Health centers’ options for backup power systems include solar-plus-storage, not just generators, “which is what most of our health centers have,” said Gianna Van Winkle, on a webinar. Van Winkle is the association’s director of emergency management programs and lead author of the association report “Supporting Access to Health Care: Resilient Emergency Power for Florida Community Health Centers.”
The association surveyed its members about power outages and any backup systems the centers currently use, and then facilitated screening studies for solar-plus-storage installations at seven Florida health centers. American Microgrid Solutions, a firm that designs and develops microgrids, prepared the screening studies. Results are shown in the table below from the FACHC report.

Marriele Mango, project director at the nonprofit Clean Energy Group and the report’s co-author, acknowledged that solar+storage systems often “don’t pay for themselves,” given modest annual utility savings, as shown in the table.
Andrew MacCalla, health resiliency advisor at the humanitarian organization Direct Relief, said that the financial return on investment for solar-plus-storage systems at health centers may be adequate to justify the systems in California, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, New England and the Northeast, which have higher costs for electricity. Direct Relief installed clean energy microgrids at about 20 health centers in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria using donated funds, MacCalla said.
In areas with low costs for electricity, evaluating the health benefits may be more important in making the investment case. Possible benefits include providing uninterrupted refrigeration for medications and vaccines that require refrigeration, and providing ongoing care for patients who may otherwise need to drive to a distant hospital for care. Florida health centers reported an average financial cost of $41,000 per day from not having emergency power, counting expenses such as loss of medication and vaccines, canceled appointments, and staff-related expenses, said the FACHC report.
Solar-plus-storage screening studies are planned for eight more Florida health centers. All health center sites that move forward with solar-plus-storage through the FACHC project will have a hybrid system consisting of solar, storage and a fossil-fuel generator. Some already have a generator, and others will add one. Direct Relief has committed to funding installation of up to 15 systems in Florida.
Regarding health centers’ interest in integrating solar-plus-storage with existing generators, Van Winkle said that “some health centers have pretty good experience with the generators that they have. Then again, after Hurricane Ian, I heard of a number of health centers that had their generator damaged by debris, or flooded, or having some type of overheating or mechanical failure, or a gas leak. So I think we’re all realistic knowing that they can fail. But until you experience something like that firsthand, you might not have the motivation to seek out something new.”
As a possible funding source for solar-plus-storage, health centers nationwide are eligible to apply for mitigation funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), says the FACHC report, explaining that mitigation funding is a form of non-emergency disaster assistance.
MacCalla said the National Association of Community Health Centers is “very involved” in educating health centers about the value of resilient emergency power, and providing case studies “to show which of their colleagues are doing it and why health centers should try to do this.”
About 14,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers across the United States provide medical care in areas where economic, geographic, or cultural barriers limit health care access.
Installing a clean energy microgrid at all 14,000 community health centers nationwide would require an investment of $3 billion to $5 billion, MacCalla said, implying an average cost between $215,000 and $360,000 per system.
