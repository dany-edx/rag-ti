He voiced support for nonpartisan permit reform for renewables development, one of the most immediate and addressable bottlenecks to the United States’ march toward climate disaster mitigation.
“The need to provide energy affordably and reliably for today, as well as make the necessary investments to decarbonize for tomorrow, underscores the inextricable links between economic growth, energy security and climate change. We need to do more, and we need to do so immediately,” said Dimon.
Dimon said in addition to reforming permitting, siting and interconnection issues for power generation and transmission, the U.S. may need to invoke eminent domain to site local clean energy rapidly. Eminent domain involves the seizure of, and compensation for, private lands for public purposes. Siting is a key issue to address for renewables, as distributing energy generation in places closer to the end-use point comes with efficiency and materials use benefits, particularly for transmission infrastructure.
“We simply are not getting the adequate investments fast enough for grid, solar, wind and pipeline initiatives,” he said.
Policies like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) hold the potential to unlock over $1 trillion in clean technology development. However, these policies must be implemented effectively to achieve climate goals, he said.
This view is evidenced from recent analysis from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In its projections for the impact of IRA incentives on solar buildout, EIA found that the implementation of bonus credits and other ancillary programs will dictate the outcome. Low-case projections for IRA bonus content place the buildout of renewables in a similar range to a no-IRA environment, suggesting that there is still a need for guidance from authorities to evaluate the true effect of the historic legislation.
Dimon said the upside to effective implementation of policy and a robust energy transition is “undeniable.”
“Widespread investing across the private sector will aid domestic manufacturing, invigorate research and development in green innovation, help create resilient supply chains, lift up local economies and build the U.S. clean energy workforce by up to 9 million jobs over the next decade,” he said.
With the ongoing war in Ukraine and roiled trade relations across Europe and Asia, a new strategy for energy security is rising. Renewable energy and decentralized supply chains are being pursued as a matter of national security.
Among other strategies, Dimon suggested the U.S. develop a Marshall Plan for global energy and food security. The Marshall Plan was a 1948 initiative that provided aid to war-torn Western Europe. The U.S. provided about 2% of its GDP to revive European manufacturing, and in four short years, industrial production in Western Europe increased 55%, said the World Bank organization.
This kind of strategy could spur the manufacturing needed to support global solar buildout. An international consensus showed that solar capacity must grow over 7,000% to 75 TW by 2050 to stave off the worst effects on climate.
“A major risk for the next decade would be to make poor assumptions or mistakes in modeling the required growth in the PV industry, and then realize too late that we were wrong on the low side and need to ramp up manufacturing and deployment to unrealistic or unsustainable levels,” said a report from the Terawatt Conference, a coalition of 41 institutions across 15 nations.
For the United States, the JP Morgan executive warned that polarization, paralysis, and a basic lack of analysis cannot prevent the world from addressing these challenges.
“I also want to express exasperation with some of my fellow citizens who don’t pay the taxes they owe on the order of $600 billion a year, who won’t consider sensible policy measures like a carbon tax to stem climate change and who sometimes seem to only like democracy when the voters agree with them. Democracy by its nature is compromise,” he said.

The world accomplished the feat of installing 1 TW of solar about one year ago. Now, global researchers say that humanity must reach 75 TW of solar capacity to meet global decarbonization goals.
“Time is of the essence, so it’s important that we set ambitious and achievable goals that have significant impact,” said Martin Keller, director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
This consensus was shared at the Terawatt Workshop, a global workshop bringing together NREL, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy in Germany, and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan. Its findings were published in a report called Photovoltaics at Multi-Terawatt Scale: Waiting is Not an Option, published in Science. The report was assembled by 41 institutions from 15 countries. 
The Terawatt Conference first convened in 2016, addressing the challenge of reaching at least 3 TW by 2030. In 2018, the target was moved to 10 TW by 2030, and 30 TW by 2050. That year, the group successfully forecast that the 1 TW threshold would be crossed over a five-year span.
Today, the U.S. makes up roughly 17% of global energy consumption, carrying a large share of responsibility to decarbonize. Cumulative solar deployment across residential, commercial, and utility scale could range between 536 GW to 1.4 TW by 2050, said the Energy Information Administration (EIA). According to the research coalition, the rate is not nearly enough, though EIA has historically been conservative in its renewables forecasts.
EIA analysts project that renewables, including solar, wind and storage, will represent 69% of capacity additions in the U.S. through 2050. Yet, EIA’s own data shows that solar, wind, and battery energy storage technologies are now 82% of new capacity additions actively planned to come online. This kind of highly conservative reporting may be problematic, said the Terawatt Conference report. 
The Terawatt researchers argue that low-balling global photovoltaics (PV) deployment projections while waiting for consensus on other energy pathways or last-minute technological breakthroughs is a strategy that the world cannot afford to take. They said that manufacturing capacity for solar components must ramp up, and that waiting is “no longer an option.”
“A major risk for the next decade would be to make poor assumptions or mistakes in modeling the required growth in the PV industry, and then realize too late that we were wrong on the low side and need to ramp up manufacturing and deployment to unrealistic or unsustainable levels,” said the report.
The consensus report highlighted three challenges for the global PV industry:
The workshop participants said that the global PV industry must redesign the technology around environmental effects a circular economy, though recycling materials is not an economically viable solution at present.
The report concluded that 75 TW by 2050 is “is both a major challenge and an available path forward. Recent history and the current trajectory suggest that it can be achieved.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/07/florida-chevy-dealership-activates-730-kw-rooftop-solar-system/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EV,SUSTAINABILITY,FLORIDA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 7, 2023",Florida Chevy dealership activates 730 kW rooftop solar system,"A central Florida, family-run Chevrolet dealership nearing 100 years in business added an electrifying accolade to its corporate milestones by adopting solar. Dimmitt Chevrolet, a Clearwater, Fla., new and used car dealership, activated a 730 kW rooftop solar array installed by ESA Solar.
Consisting of more than 2,000 panels, Dimmit Chevrolet’s solar system is expected to generate more than 1 GWh of electricity per year. The annual clean energy produced is the equivalent to 750 homes and will offset over 156 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The dealership is expected to power 100% of its operations by the on-site solar facility, and by tapping into expanded federal tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, will return all capital invested through energy savings in just under five years.
“This is a major step towards our goal of becoming a more sustainable and environmentally friendly business,” said Lawrence Dimmitt III, owner of Dimmitt Chevrolet. “As we continue to add more EV options for customers, our electricity use will continue to go up. It just makes sense to invest in clean energy.”
Auto dealers have a substantial opportunity to attract consumers as the demand for EVs increases. EV sales increased 45% from 2020 to 2021, and hybrid vehicle sales nearly doubled, according to Boston Consulting Group. By 2025, BCG estimates that EVs may account for 19% of all new U.S. car sales, and by 2035, as much as 68% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S.
Other auto dealerships to add solar to their operations include Arlington Toyota of Palatine, Ill., Parkway Auto Group of Dover, Ohio, and TC Chevy of Ashland, Ore., according to pv magazine USA.
Based in Maitland, Fla., ESA Solar works with auto dealers across the U.S. to develop tailored solar programs to maximize available tax credits and incentives, while generating an immediate return on capital. Dealers that operate in multiple states can evaluate their portfolio and quickly determine the locations with the highest return on investment by leveraging ESA’s auto dealer program, the developer said.
“The Dimmitt enterprise is an example of an entrepreneurial leader in the franchised auto dealership space that saw the opportunity to put capital to work, and hedge against increasing electric rates while reducing tax liability,” said Morgan Brawner, executive vice president of ESA. “Leveraging solar to offset 100% of annual energy needs will prove to be a competitive advantage as EV market share grows over the coming years.”
Besides selling new and used all-electric Bolt and Bolt EUV models, Dimmit’s center is equipped with more than 20 EV charging stations. According to the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center, Clearwater, Fla., has about 18 active public charging station locations at parking garages, supermarkets, shopping centers and municipal locations.
Founded in 2017, ESA is a Florida-based commercial, community and utility scale solar developer which has developed projects in more than 10 states. Collectively its team has developed over 3 GW of projects over their career.
This was amended on April 10, 2023 to change the capacity to 1 GWh instead of 1 GW, and the number of homes from 750,000 to 750.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/07/transforming-the-grid-with-electric-vehicles/,"EV,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 7, 2023",Transforming the grid with electric vehicles,"The impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on the world’s power grids is a top concern for utilities because each EV represents a load on the system equivalent to a single home. In the future, if everyone drives home after work and then plugs in their EV as the sun is setting and when rooftop solar production drops, our already stressed grid networks might face regular power outages and the costs of maintaining grid reliability could mushroom.
Yet a tipping point for EVs in becoming mainstream consumer offerings is steadily approaching. By 2030, government vehicle fuel efficiency regulations and continued development of advanced battery chemistries and manufacturing capacity are likely to make EVs cheaper to purchase than competing liquid or gaseous fuel-powered vehicles. Consumer Reports noted that the total cost of ownership of an EV is cheaper than a traditional gasoline-fueled vehicle. So, the future will soon be today.
For the electric power sector, EVs are a boon because they increase demand for kilowatt hours. While basic load growth is good for the sector, the uneven distribution of that growth within a specific location or at a specific time of day could prove burdensome for utilities. Actively managing and spreading the EV charging load across infrastructure assets may not only prevent infrastructure upgrade costs but may also decrease grid balancing costs.
Solar and EV parallels
Concerns over EVs echo the industry’s past views of solar energy. As rooftop solar systems began to pop up at random across the grid, they had the potential to impact utility resource planning. As costs continued to come down, market traction multiplied. Also, the widespread adoption of solar transformed assumptions about grid management, with excess solar production during the middle of the day, when demand was low, and declines in solar production in the early evening, when demand ramped up.
Then there’s the equity issue. Only some consumers can afford solar or EVs, and others feel shut out. The issue of access permeates the new energy landscape, where prosumers are purported to be in the driver’s seat, contributing to climate change solutions by generating and consuming electricity in the most sustainable manner possible, right in their own homes. As with other forms of new technology, early adopters lean toward more affluent single-family homeowners. Yet to meet the scale of the energy transition, high-end prosumers can’t do the job alone. They need help from the rest of society. New energy-as-a-service business models and government incentives, such as those included in the Inflation Reduction Act, are allowing more consumers to participate in the new energy economy by lowering costs for solar, batteries and EVs.
Bidirectional utility
Like solar, EVs can be good grid neighbors if public policies and regulations are put in place to allow these resources to be bidirectional. With solar, it was the policy of net metering, which essentially allowed solar asset owners to barter for electricity with host distribution utilities, sending clean electricity back to the grid when there was no demand for it on site. With EVs, a similar relationship is possible, if regulators figure out an adequate compensation mechanism for EVs to buffer the grid with the “batteries on wheels” and the ability of software to modulate EV charging to meet the needs of the grid in real-time.
The technology for EVs to be a viable grid asset is already here. Vehicle grid integration (VGI) technologies, including software, enable EVs to participate in grid balancing. EVs can do this by modulating the rate of power at which the battery is charged, or by also providing power back to the grid, known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G). Though this may seem like a win-win for the electric power sector, V2G is still a fledgling solution with significant hurdles to overcome. Opportunities for deployment vary significantly by location depending on the confluence of a growing EV population, an intelligent grid, penetration of renewable resources, and open market regulatory structures.
The opportunities for EVs to be viable grid assets are clear:
The outstanding challenges that remain include:
EVs as a solution
Thanks for advances in artificial intelligence and software platforms, EVs can represent solutions to the variability of weather (and the corresponding availability of renewable energy resources) by modulating charging when there is a surplus of clean energy available. When there’s a shortage of supply, EV charging can be throttled back. Because solar is available during the day (and the wind often blows strongest in the early evenings and night), possible synergies emerge. Our energy systems are being transformed by dramatic increases in distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar and EVs. These DERs are challenging conventional thinking. EVs could be the most transformational of all with smart software serving as the key enabling technology to maximize value for both asset owner and grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/07/indiana-utility-to-add-425-mw-of-utility-solar-projects/,"ACQUISITIONS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIANA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 7, 2023",Indiana utility to add 425 MW of utility solar projects,"EDF Renewables North America  announced two agreements with American Electric Power utility Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) to deploy 425 MWac of utility solar projects in Indiana.
Under the agreements, I&M will purchase power output from Sculpin Solar (180 MWac) in DeKalb County, Ind., under a 30-year power purchase agreement.  The utility will acquire 100% of the equity interests in Lake Trout Solar (245 MWac) in Blackford County, Ind., following the completion of construction of the facility, the developer said.  Both projects are anticipated to be put into service in late 2025 at the earliest.
“Indiana and its farmers are taking the lead to decarbonize the energy sector, while also revitalizing the local economy with jobs, vendor contracts, taxes, and lease payments,” said Eric Spigelman, senior director, origination & power marketing, EDF. “We are excited to bring EDF Renewables first solar projects to Indiana and to support I&M as it delivers long-term price stability, stimulates economic growth, and reduces emissions.” 
The Sculpin and Lake Trout solar projects are expected to generate 880,000 MWh of clean energy each year, the equivalent to avoiding over 624,000 metric tons of carbon (CO₂) emissions each year from fossil fuel generating facilities.
According to the American Clean Power IQ database, Indiana generates about 1.6 GW or 39% of its 4.18 GW of renewable energy generation mix from solar resources. The Solar Energy Industries Association ranks the state 18th in the nation for solar generation, where it fares within the top five U.S. states with a robust 8.24 GW development pipeline over the next five years.
Indiana’s solar market has been restricted to utility-scale projects in recent years, as May 2017 saw the reversal of a net metering mechanism destroy the value of rooftop solar for its 6.8 million residents.
Indiana’s Clean Energy Portfolio Standard (CPS) is significantly lower than comparable states. Known as the Comprehensive Hoosier Option to Incentivize Cleaner Energy (CHOICE) program, the utility program was enacted in May 2011 by Senate Bill 251 and sets a voluntary goal of generating 10% renewable energy off the grid by 2025.
Once completed, the 245 MW Lake Trout Solar project could become the second largest solar facility in Indiana after NextEra Energy’s Petersburg Solar project, a 250 MW solar plus 180 MWh battery storage project in development in Pike County, Indiana. The Petersburg project is on track for construction by May 2024.

It seeks to understand the anticipated quantity, quality, and accessibility of solar manufacturing roles, the potential challenges for filling the jobs and training the people. Ultimately, SETO is looking to gather potential solutions for overcoming these barriers.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) delivers the supportive policy needed to increase domestic manufacturing by way of an advanced manufacturing tax credit, known as Section 45X, which provides tax incentives for specific manufactured goods produced and sold in the United States. The credit lasts through 2029 and then begins to phase down.
Other incentives in the IRA include a tax credit for manufacturers of U.S.-made solar equipment, and the domestic content requirement, which incentivizes developers to install U.S.-made equipment. These incentives have effectively stimulated plans for 25 U.S. solar manufacturing facilities across the solar supply chain, according to SETO, representing more than 105 GW of manufacturing capacity.
“With the passage of the IRA, solar energy is poised for significant growth in domestic manufacturing,” said Alejandro Moreno, acting assistant secretary, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. “DOE wants to ensure the workforce that will support this growth is an equitable one, with long-term career paths that will revitalize communities across the United States, including underrepresented and historically underserved communities—in line with President Biden’s Justice40 goals.”
The Justice40 Initiative calls for 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities and this includes workforce development.
The RFI will solicit feedback from unions, industry, academia, research laboratories, government agencies, and other stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities associated with the unprecedented expansion of the U.S. solar manufacturing workforce. SETO is specifically interested in gaining insight from manufacturers, suppliers, education and training providers, community-based organizations, and workers’ rights organizations, including labor unions.
This RFI pertains to job roles associated with operating U.S.-based manufacturing facilities involved in the production of:
SETO is also particularly interested in ways in which SETO and other government agencies can help promote an employee-centered, diverse, and inclusive solar manufacturing workforce with access to quality jobs, defined career pathways, and a free and fair chance to join a union. Information received as part of this RFI is expected to inform future strategic programming and is part of a holistic approach across DOE to ensure an equitable clean energy workforce.
The RFI notice includes the questions and instructions for how to respond. Responses are due by 5:00 p.m. ET on June 2, 2023.
