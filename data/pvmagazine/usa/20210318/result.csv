The DOE is offering up to $20 million for R&D projects focusing on flow battery systems. These electrochemical batteries use externally stored electrolytes, making them cost less, safer, and more flexible and adaptable. Although lithium-ion batteries are commonly used in electric vehicles and portable devices for various applications, the DOE said flow batteries are particularly well-suited for grid-scale energy storage.
With this funding opportunity, DOE will partner with industry to address technical and manufacturing challenges that have prevented flow battery systems from achieving cost targets and commercial viability. The department is seeking proposals for collaborative, multi-stage R&D projects that improve manufacturing processes for individual flow battery components and integrate those new or improved components into a prototype system with a mid-sized capacity for grid, industrial, or transportation applications.
In addition, the DOE is offering up to $4.5 million for the Conductivity-enhanced materials for Affordable, Breakthrough Leapfrog Electric applications (CABLE) Conductor Manufacturing Prize. The department said conductivity-enhanced materials can help address the climate emergency by easing the addition of renewable resources and electric cars to the grid, maximizing new energy storage technologies, and supporting efficiency in electricity-intensive sectors like transportation and manufacturing.
CABLE is a three-stage, three-year prize that will award up to $4.5 million in cash and vouchers to competitors. Stage one, which focuses on materials and manufacturing concepts for enhanced electrical conductivity, is now open.
Funding is through the DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office. More information about the opportunities is available here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/18/hydrogen-test-locomotive-wins-4-million-from-california-energy-commission/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 18, 2021",Hydrogen test locomotive wins $4 million from California Energy Commission,"The California Energy Commission awarded Sierra Northern Railway and GTI nearly $4 million to fund the design, integration, and demonstration of a hydrogen fuel cell switching locomotive.
The funds will be used to retire a Tier 0 diesel locomotive and to replace it with a zero-emission switching locomotive using hydrogen technology. The project involves integrating hydrogen fuel cell, storage, battery, and systems control technologies.
Testing this technology is expected to establish a platform for future commercialization. Most switcher locomotives in California use an average of 50,000 gallons of diesel per year per switcher, potentially leading to a reduction of more than 12 million gallons of fuel per year. This is equal to the amount of fuel used each year by 20,000 light-duty vehicles.
Sierra Northern Railway is the technical lead and has partnered with GTI as the formal applicant. Other partners are Railpower Tech LLC, Ballard Power Systems, Optifuel Systems LLC, UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies, Valley Vision, Velocity Strategies, Southern California Gas Co., and the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District.
Sierra Northern Railway is the freight division of privately-owned, Sierra Railroad, which also owns Sierra Energy Corp., developer of a waste-to-hydrogen gasification technology.
In early January, BNSF Railway Company and Wabtec began testing a battery-electric locomotive in revenue service on a 350-mile run between Barstow and Stockton, California.
As part of the test, the lithium-ion battery equipped locomotive is placed between two Tier 4 locomotives, creating a battery-electric hybrid “consist.” When running on the mainline, both the battery-electric and diesel locomotives will power the train.

In the path of the storm sat 174 Power Global’s 178 MW Midway Solar Project, bolted to the ground and pointed to the sky on 1,500 acres near Midland.
Once  the storm had passed, the industry learned that it had left behind the largest weather-related single-project loss in its history. More than 400,000 of the plant’s 685,000 Hanwha Q cell modules were damaged or destroyed; insurance losses totaled $70 million, and most everyone involved endured at least a few sleepless nights.

The event served as a wake-up call to the industry. It completely reshaped how weather risks are modeled, how project owners and operators mitigate against potential damages, and how underwriters insure projects against natural disasters.
How was it that the solar industry didn’t see this coming? The answer may be simpler than you might think. Although hailstorms are not new to the wide open spaces of West Texas, solar projects are, especially solar fields on a massive scale like Midway Solar.
It’s more common for solar projects to suffer catastrophic damage from wildfires. After all, much of the early solar market was focused in California, a state with a high annual wildfire risk. Once development began to expand to the Southeast, hurricanes, high wind events, and flooding became of more concern.
In short, the rapidly growing industry wasn’t properly prepared for catastrophic hail because it had never before dealt with it.
Now that hail is a known danger, one step to mitigating it as a threat is to know now only where these storms happen but how often. The hail modeling sector has grown rapidly in the two years since Midway. And to better understand the evolution, pv magazine sat down with Peter Bostock and John Sedgwick of VDE Americas. The company provides technical due diligence and engineering services for solar power and energy storage systems.
The two said that historic hail threat prediction models were both general and minimal in nature, with developers relying on basic heat maps to locate what areas had severe hail potential. The two quickly realized that this approach would not be nearly enough, and that modeling needed to be done on a granular, site-specific basis.

“Even at a given location, there’s a size distribution,” said Bostock. “And if you map larger locations, there’s a broader spread to that location.”
To better understand what a future hail event could look like in a specific area, VDE has developed a tool that blends data from human storm spotters as well as from doppler radar.
Spotter data is useful because it can provide tangible context as to the size of the hail as well as its concentration and distribution. Spotter data are typically limited to high-population areas and common travel routes. Neither case applied to the Midway solar project in the expanses of West Texas.
Doppler radar also is used as it scans and tracks weather data constantly, typically at an 11 degree angle towards the sky. This means that the scanning elevation is higher as distance increases from the radar center. This is better for tracking hail, which forms high in thunderstorms. The radar scans storm conditions and can offer rough predictions of hail size, but even these predictions are not always accurate.

But by overlaying spotter data with radar feedback data and finding correlations between the two, Bostock said that the radar data an be corrected for the likely size and concentration of the hail in real-time, providing a more accurate risk evaluation.
VDE used this approach to develop a tool that can predict the return interval, the likelihood of a certain type of hail occurring, and the expected size of  hail across different locations.
As a result, Sedgwick came to the conclusion that preventing another Midway may be easier than first thought.
“When we initially started looking at it,” he said, “we certainly said ‘Oh my God, this situation is horrible.'”
VDE started by looking at how insurance companies addressed the problem from a top-down basis. That meant insurers looked at their actual losses and then used that dollar amount to calculate insurance rates, Sedgwick said. Instead, VDE elected to look at the issue from a different angle, using physics, trigonometry, and impact energy.
Sedgwick and Bostock said that by applying appropriate mitigation elements, operational elements, and equipment installed with appropriate stow management, the effects of hail can be significantly mitigated.
“What that tells me is that the issue is not as horrible as when we first started looking at it,” Sedgwick said.
Some 70% of solar insurance losses in the last 10 years have occurred since 2017, according to a report released by insurer GCube in early March. That reality that has caused the insurance market to harden significantly over the past 18 months, with premiums increasing by as much as 400%.
The Midway catastrophe was an “eye-opening” event for the industry.

GCube asserted that the insurance sector hardening is a sign that the market is in a stronger position to provide coverage for the long haul for the solar energy sector.

For example, some insurers have begun to offer specific hail insurance programs, called parametric insurance. These programs trigger coverage when a measurable hailstorm event occurs that exceeds a predefined threshold. The trigger for coverage and payout is determined by the size of the largest hail that falls on the solar project site.
These policies are defined by their fast payout times, a factor that  has long been a hindrance of natural disaster insurance for solar projects. The new policy designs mean that payments can occur anywhere from a week and 10 days after a storm, and without a traditional on-site claims adjustments.
In a blog post for insurance broker Marsh, Michael Kolodner, U.S. power and renewables industry practice leader, outlined three criteria for insurers and PV developers to consider when trying to minimize hail risk.
First is modeling, as Kolodner stressed the importance of understanding each location’s relative exposures as well as the need to assess the frequency and severity of hailstorms to generate credible loss scenarios.
Second, he outlined the value of understanding what hardware should be used in hail-prone regions, specifically the value of trackers. While more expensive upfront, he said that trackers can mitigate a significant amount of hail damage, leading to overall lower losses in an extreme event and a lower long-term levelized cost of energy.
Third, Kolonder said that the market is quickly changing and and with it the need for stakeholder communication.
While modules have been the focus of PV hail damage and take the brunt of collisions with the icy projectiles, mitigating damage to a system does not start with the module, but with the tracker.
For industry NEXTracker, this mitigation comes in the form of NX Navigator, a software and smart control system that includes a hail function. This function moves the entire solar array to a safer, 60-degree stow angle.
Kent Whitfield, VP of quality at NEXTracker has found that there is a generally negative correlation between hail size and wind speed, which may seem counterintuitive when thinking about a big storm. However, in severe hail storms with particularly large ice balls, those balls fall more vertically. By stowing the solar panel, it becomes easier to stop the hail from striking the module face straight on.
When it comes to smaller hail balls in higher wind events, the industry is better prepared, due to its experience with hurricanes. That means solar systems and their trackers, have been designed to mitigate damage due to gale-force winds. As a result, they are, already well suited to handle the winds that can accompany small-ball hail storms.
As might be expected, the issue for modules has always been with repeated, large impacts. For individual impacts, many module faces can withstand a single stroke from an ice ball upwards of 40 millimeters (mm) in diameter, or around the size of  golf ball, according to Whitfield, as well as up to 11 strikes of 25 mm hail. By stowing modules, not only is the risk of module face-strikes reduced, but the system is not further compromised by the increased wind speed.
On the hardware side of things, solar modules are designed to meet IEC 61215 and IEC 61646 standards, both of which test a module’s resistance to lab-produced, 25 mm hail. While this may show that the module can survive a pelting with up to 11 individual strikes, Bostock and Sedgwick said that the return interval for such a storm is once every year or two in West Texas.
What’s more, storms in Texas can generate hail much larger than the 25mm testing standard. That brings modules into a realm beyond their tested parameters.

Bostock and Sedgwick also have found that natural hail forms differently than hail generated in a lab. Natural hail generally forms as oblate spheroids, with some variety in shape from ball to ball. More uniform spherical balls are routinely used in laboratory test settings. Natural hail also typically has a lower density (especially when it comes to large hail) than lab-made ice balls of the same diameter. This results in lower energy upon impact than lab-made hail of same diameter.
The difference between natural and lab-made hail is not necessarily a bad thing. If the hail used for testing proves to be more  destructive on impact and the module still survives, then developers may have greater confidence when it comes to using the product in the field.
It’s all about finding the right size and conditions for testing extreme hail impacts. “There’s a need for module manufacturers to assess what happens in real life when hail meets module and to do that in a much more thorough way than to just simply pass the necessary IEC tests,” said Bostock.
The reason that lab tests required for PV modules do not reflect the reality of hail in the Texas and other states is simple: the tests weren’t developed with those areas in mind.
In an interview with pv magazine, NEXTracker’s Kent Whitfield  said that the tests were designed when PV largely was  economically viable only in California. As far back as 1977, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab recommended that developers looking to bring PV projects to the Great Plains states should prepare for hail up to 38mm in diameter or larger–50% or more larger than today’s testing standards–occurring every six to eight years.
“Accepting the way that PV modules are tested today for hail might not be the right thing to do going forward,” said Whitfield. “What we as an industry need to consider is some sort of a differentiation.”
Whitfield said he expects the industry to take an “all-in” approach, in which it takes a collective look at existing testing standards and modify the severity thresholds in a way that does not penalize all modules.
One last aspect that current testing doesn’t adequately account for is the non-visible damage that modules can suffer during a hail storm. A row of modules may appear unaffected for days or even weeks after the event, but the storm could have caused damage and microcracks at the cell level. Such damage wouldn’t initially be visible, but  result in a host of performance issues.
To Whitfield, the solution is ensuring a proper stow strategy which redirects and reduces a hail stone’s kinetic energy.

In the end, cell-level damage mitigation comes down to monitoring in the weeks or months after a storm. And keep in mind that the mere presence of a microcrack doesn’t necessarily mean anything; it’s how that crack respond to natural heat fluxes and movements during operation that may manifest into a potentially harmful problem.
To Whitfield, the continued expansion of solar energy arrays into extreme hail-prone regions opens possibilities for the module industry. For example, module manufacturers could produce hail-resistant modules specifically for hail-prone areas. Those panels could undergo even more rigorous testing, qualifying them for a special tag or specification that that the panels are suited for hail-prone regions.
As solar projects continue to be deployed in hail-prone regions of the U.S., then manufacturers may adjust their manufacturing processes to produce more resilient, that can survive a storm and then get back to the business of generating clean energy from the sun.
In the second installment of this series, pv magazine talks with Michael Kolodner of Marsh to learn about the evolution of hail risk management and how insuring a solar project is about more than just the policy. Read Part 2 here.

In his recent opinion piece, he notes that there is sufficient polysilicon manufacturing capacity outside the Xinjiang region of China to service the U.S. and EU solar markets. The focus on Xinjiang reflects significant sustainability concerns with the industry there – heavy reliance on coal-fired electricity in this energy-intensive sector and the alleged use of forced labor.
He also argues that a major realignment of the global solar supply chain to entirely avoid Xinjiang polysilicon, which currently represents almost one-half of the world’s total, “will be no cakewalk.”
I agree. But there is more to the story for the global solar industry and solar buyers.
Bernreuter cites my comments to pv magazine USA about the goals of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance to decarbonize the solar supply chain and the availability of low-carbon polysilicon in the U.S. and EU. The point I made, which he noted himself, was that this cleaner polysilicon capacity (as well as hydro-powered polysilicon plants in eastern China) was sufficient to provide the U.S. and EU markets with ultra low-carbon solar modules made without Xinjiang polysilicon.
More importantly, I expressed the view that this is merely a first step and if we stop there, we have missed an important opportunity to decarbonize the solar industry.
Solar manufacturing is slated to grow dramatically in the coming decades, to the tune of 10x by 2050 according to DNV GL. If we merely redistribute existing solar production and this growth continues to be concentrated in Xinjiang, carbon pollution associated with solar manufacturing will skyrocket. This would be a deeply ironic prospect for “clean energy.”
Combating climate change and decarbonizing any major industrial sector is indeed no cakewalk, but it is a critical component of achieving a net zero carbon economy. In fact, we have seen global industries like steel, cement and glass take major steps in this direction. Major investors like Blackrock are urging companies to assess their Scope 3 supply chain emissions as part of their carbon reduction goals.
Solar is a more compact industry with fewer tier 1 suppliers than many heavy industries, making it an easier prospect for decarbonizing.

It won’t happen overnight and carbon-sensitive developed economies will surely go first. We believe, however, that by making ultra low-carbon solar a global standard over time, solar buyers and policy makers can send a clear message to the industry that the next major tranche of growth in solar manufacturing must be much cleaner.
Making this transition means locating polysilicon and ingot plants in hydro- and other renewables-rich regions rather than coal-intensive regions. It means higher levels of energy efficiency in those plants. It means a widespread, intentional focus on reducing the carbon footprint of solar manufacturing.
We believe that market demand is a very important element of driving that focus. Companies produce what customers want to buy, and if companies only buy solar modules made with lower carbon footprints, whether directly or in PPAs, that is what the solar industry will produce.
For the solar PV industry and the polysilicon segment in particular, we should stop relying on predominantly coal-fired manufacturing. We must transform the global solar supply chain to become truly sustainable.

The project would supply power for the Rialto, California, wastewater treatment plant.
The first stage of the microgrid project, a feasibility study by Veolia’s energy consulting firm, SourceOne Inc., was recently completed.
Veolia already operates and maintains the treatment plant through a contract with the city and Rialto Water Services. Once the microgrid is in place, officials expect the plant to be less vulnerable to power outages that could cause it to shut down and lead to potential spills into nearby waterways.
The microgrid could be completed in 2024 with funding as part of an existing 30-year concession pact with Veolia. The concession agreement’s early funding allowed the city to invest in capital upgrades and also set aside money for deferred utility system lease payments and strategic reserves. With most of those initial efforts now complete, the microgrid project is the first of a series of planned projects aimed at supporting the city’s interest in innovation and sustainability.
The microgrid project is expected to save the city around $350,000 a year in energy costs, with an average return on investment in about eight years.
Kansas City-based engineering firm Black & Veatch won a contract to conduct feasibility studies central to the development of a $5.4 billion green hydrogen plant. If built, Enegix Energy’s Base One facility in Brazil would use 3.4 GW of solar and onshore wind energy to produce more than 600 million kilograms of hydrogen annually.
The facility would be one of the largest in the world and would have access to a deep-sea port for exports to global markets.
Under terms of the memorandum of understanding, Black & Veatch will deliver analysis from partners with expertise in hydrogen, renewable energy generation, and the interfaces between them.
PPL Corp. said it will sell its U.K. utility business, Western Power Distribution, to National Grid for £7.8 billion ($10.87 billion) and, in a separate deal, buy National Grid’s Rhode Island utility business, Narragansett Electric, for $3.8 billion.
The moves will transform PPL into a purely U.S.-focused energy company, and also are expected to strengthen the utility’s credit,
improve its long-term earnings growth and predictability, and provide greater financial flexibility to invest in sustainable energy projects.
Under terms of the deals, PPL will sell its U.K. utility unit to National Grid in an all-cash transaction valued at £14.4 billion ($20.6 billion), including roughly £6.6 billion ($9.19 billion) of debt. The sale is expected to result in net cash proceeds of around $10.2 billion.
Separately, PPL will buy Narragansett Electric from National Grid for $5.3 billion, including $1.5 billion of Narragansett Electric debt. PPL said it plans to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Western Power to finance its U.S. acquisition.

At $72 a month for a 4 kw Equinox home solar system, the electricity savings could equal the monthly cost of the 25-year loan, said Norm Taffe, executive vice president at SunPower. Under the loan program, a 13 kWh SunVault energy storage system would cost an extra $61 a month, he said. Individual dealer pricing might vary.
The loans are available to applicants who have a FICO score of 640 or higher in 17 states.
As SunPower’s loan platform provider, TCU makes money charging interest to the borrower and through a fee charged to SunPower. SunPower does not charge additional fees to borrowers.
According to Taffe, the declining cost of solar, the solar investment tax credit, the current low interest rate environment, and the demand for solar across the U.S. led SunPower to create the loan offerings.
“The recent blackouts in Texas are making it even more evident to consumers everywhere that solar can help ensure energy continuity,” he said.
With the increased demand for solar nationally, there has also been a shift in how consumers finance their systems. In 2014, about 70% of residential solar installations were financed via leases. Since 2017, however, cash and loan financing have dominated. According to Wood Mackenzie, in the first three quarters of 2020, nearly three-quarters of solar installations were purchased through cash or loans.
