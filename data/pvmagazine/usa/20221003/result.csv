The trackers were supplied to owner-operator Summit Ridge Energy.
The fourteen solar projects supported by the trackers were developed under Illinois Shines, a state-run program that supplies incentives for the development of new PV projects. Once complete, small businesses and homeowners can sign up to access the energy provided by the system while saving up to 10% on their energy bills.
“Having completed hundreds of cold weather challenged projects in Canada and the Northeastern U.S. over the past decade, we look forward to further utilizing our expertise and tracker technology in these impactful projects,” said Greg Lewis, director of sales, Solar FlexRack.
The Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), signed into law in 2021, established the new 42 MW project portfolio. CEJA builds on the success of the Illinois Shines Adjustable Block Program, which authorizes the purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs) from solar asset owners.
Over 250 MW of community solar projects have already been approved through the new program. Once complete, the projects will supply power to an estimated 35,000 families, allowing them to access clean energy and bill savings without having to install solar on their homes. Illinois has had a record year in solar in 2022, installing over 8,400 rooftop arrays and increasing its solar workforce by 50% by the end of the year.
Solar FlexRack is a division of Northern States Metals, an integrated solar company that offers custom-designed, fixed tilt ground mount and single-axis solar tracking systems in the commercial and utility-scale solar mounting industries. The company also offers full services, including engineering, geotechnical, pullout testing, field, and layout design services to address the actual site conditions of a project site. Solar FlexRack has completed over 3 GW of solar racking installations in over 40 U.S. states and across the globe.
The company has proven its racking and trackers solutions are desirable in hot climates, as well. This June, Solar FlexRack was chosen for an Arizona-based community solar project. The 15 MW Raptor Ridge solar array featured 35,500 bifacial modules housed on Solar FlexRack single-axis trackers.
The project was commissioned at a 100-acre site in Tucson, Arizona and will supply power for the TEP GoSolar Home program.
“We selected Solar FlexRack from many solar racking options because of their engineering expertise and solar tracker architecture with minimal backside shading design, well suited for bifacial modules,” said Jeff Krauss, TEP’s manager of community scale renewable resources. “In a challenging market environment where supply chain issues have delayed other large solar projects, Solar FlexRack demonstrated their commitment to customer service by honoring agreements and delivering product on time. We are excited to bring this community-scale solar project online and Solar FlexRack is a big part of TEP’s success at Raptor Ridge.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/03/a-100-solar-community-in-florida-suffered-no-power-losses-from-hurricane-ian/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 3, 2022",A 100% solar community in Florida suffered no power losses from Hurricane Ian,"Hurricane Ian was a near-category five storm when it made landfall in the Naples/Fort Meyers area of Florida’s gulf coast. Babcock Ranch, a community just 12 miles from Fort Meyers, found itself directly in the path of the storm, suffering heavy rainfalls and flooding, uprooted trees and destroyed structures from high winds. 
The storm brought record-breaking storm surges and sustained winds above 100 mph. Over 2.6 million Florida customers were left without power. 
Despite the widespread destruction, Babcock Ranch, a planned community of over 2,000 homes, retained powered throughout the entire storm, reports CNN. It is often a given conclusion that power will be lost during extreme weather events, but Babcock Ranch has a model that bucks the centralized natural gas-burning energy model that serves much of the Sunshine State. The community is 100% powered by solar. 
A 75 MW solar facility powers the planned community, with 700,000 panels delivering clean energy to its residents. It is connected by a small distribution system of wires buried beneath the ground, thereby avoiding outages from downed wires. The ranch also designed streets as floodways, planted native species to control flooding, and exceeded robust Florida building codes when it was planned and built in 2018. 
Many residents also installed their own rooftop solar panels and batteries for increased resiliency and extended backup power. Electric vehicles are driven by many of its residents, and sustainability and climate resilience are core to Babcock Ranch’s identity. 
“We have proof of the case now because [the hurricane] came right over us,” Nancy Chorpenning, a 68-year-old Babcock Ranch resident, told CNN. “We have water, electricity, internet — and we may be the only people in Southwest Florida who are that fortunate.” 
The Babcock Neighborhood School was designated by the state as an official shelter area. These designated shelters typically are equipped with a mandated gas generator, but this was not the case for Babcock. Instead, the solar array kept the shelter powered continuously throughout the storm. 
“It’s a great case study to show that it can be done right, if you build in the right place and do it the right way,” said Lisa Hall, a spokesperson for the founder of Babcock Ranch. “Throughout all this, there’s just so many people saying, ‘it worked, that this was the vision, this is the reason we moved here,’” Hall told CNN.
The American Red Cross is accepting donations for victims of Hurricane Ian, bringing critical supplies and support to survivors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/03/new-jersey-considers-regional-clean-energy-market-in-pjm-footprint-to-speed-renewables/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW JERSEY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 3, 2022","New Jersey considers regional clean energy market in PJM footprint, to speed renewables","New Jersey regulatory staff have recommended that the state develop plans for a regional clean energy market, in case a similar market being developed by regional grid operator PJM is slow to materialize.
The goal of the staff proposal is to help New Jersey meet its renewables targets “at substantially lower costs” by participating in a regional clean energy “buying pool.” Such a market could be a “potential driver of substantial clean energy deployment,” the proposal says.
Staff made the proposal to the state’s utility regulator, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU).
The proposal says that New Jersey should continue participating in current efforts by regional grid operator PJM to develop a similar market known as Integrated Clean Capacity Market (ICCM), but cautions that “the certainty and timeframe for success of these efforts remains unclear.”
As a backup plan, the staff report says New Jersey should develop the blueprint for a forward clean energy market “within the PJM footprint” that other states could join, which could be implemented “significantly” more quickly than the proposed PJM market, although it would be “slightly less economically efficient.”
Noting that New Jersey and 10 other states in the PJM region have renewable energy targets, and that New Jersey and 11 other states jointly administer a regional emissions pricing market known as RGGI, the report says “a group of states could band together to form a market” comparable to RGGI, for clean energy.
Energy and capacity
The staff’s proposed forward clean energy market would grant credits to solar, wind and other qualified clean energy generators, and require New Jersey utilities to purchase credits “sufficient to meet the state’s clean energy demand.”
Regulatory staff also proposed that the BPU direct New Jersey utilities to purchase capacity from certified clean resources, through a market in clean capacity credits. This would help shift the reserve capacity that utilities secure to ensure reliability, in case of generator outages, from fossil capacity to clean capacity. Reserve capacity is also known as resource adequacy.
The idea for a forward clean energy market was evaluated in a 2021 report by BPU staff that was supported by The Brattle Group, a consultancy.
PJM process
PJM has launched a “good-faith investigation” into how to “most efficiently incorporate clean energy demand,” into its capacity market, the report says, after repealing “the most egregious aspects” of its 2019 minimum offer price rule (MOPR).
That rule would have excluded large-scale solar from earning revenue in the PJM capacity market. It was projected to increase consumer costs by “hundreds of millions of dollars” a year and delay achievement of state clean energy policies, says the BPU staff report.
On the basis of PJM’s new stance, BPU staff recommended that New Jersey not exit the PJM capacity market “at this time,” but advised the BPU to monitor ongoing litigation over the MOPR, as the matter “will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court over the next several years.”
New Jersey has renewables targets of 35% by 2025 and 50% by 2030. Currently NJ has 7% solar generation and an offshore wind goal of 7.5 GW by 2035.
The BPU staff report is titled “2022 progress report on New Jersey’s resource adequacy alternatives.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/03/8minute-solar-energy-changes-name-expands-its-vision/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 3, 2022","8minute Solar Energy changes name, expands its vision","8Minute Solar Energy was launched back in 2009 when Tom Buttgenbach had the vision to fight climate change by developing renewable energy at scale. The company was named 8Minute because it takes eight minutes for the sun’s light to reach the earth.
Today the company is expanding that vision to include what it calls an “advanced ecosystem” of clean energy products and services. With the expanded vision comes the new name—Avantus and the plan to bring to life one of the largest clean energy development pipelines in the country, while deploying the company’s proprietary power plant technologies and digitally connected delivery systems at the gigawatt scale.
“We built 8minute Solar Energy to deliver on goals central to the fight against climate change – making renewable energy lower cost and more reliable than fossil fuels. Now, with more than a decade of experience behind us, we have accomplished that and more: we’ve proven we are a category-defining company on track to become one of the first pure play clean energy majors…,” said Dr. Tom Buttgenbach, CEO and founder of Avantus.
“As Avantus, we have the scale, track record and expertise to transform our country’s energy generation to be as networked and responsive as the digital tools driving the rest of the world. We will do this by continuing to develop our industry-leading pipeline, while also creating advanced technologies that will take clean energy to the next level – smarter, cheaper, faster, and more reliable than ever before,” said Buttgenbach.
Avantus will focus on “smart power plants,” using its proprietary technologies and design optimization tools that offer grid stabilization (like frequency regulation and ancillary services), and the ability to bring a plant online instantaneously, reacting to outages in milliseconds. The company said its smart power plants also guarantee 99% availability, versus 80% to 85% for gas-fired power plants, further solidifying next generation clean energy technology as the backbone of a modern electric grid.
The Avantus Baseload class of power plants offer high-capacity factors, upwards of 60% in the summer, to deliver a consistent, baseload power supply at record-low prices, matching customers’ needs in the most economical way. The company’s Super Peaker replaces low-efficiency gas peakers with highly flexible clean energy during periods of peak demand at a significantly lower cost. For the emerging green hydrogen market, the Avantus Hydrogen class offers an integrated plant design to optimize green hydrogen production capable of meeting multiple end uses, from long-duration electricity storage to transportation.
“Energy systems must evolve to match the complex, data-driven world we live in,” said Kip Larson, chief technology officer of Avantus. “That’s why Avantus has created a new ecosystem of renewable energy generation and storage that outperform conventional and simple designs. We deploy digital tools like large scale simulations and predictive analytics to create highly specific and optimized system architecture, power plant designs, and machine learning-powered operational systems to address our customers’ increasingly complex energy needs.”
In the past 10 years, the company has executed over two dozen energy offtake agreements, including multiple projects with the largest utilities in California and Nevada. Its portfolio features several historic milestones, including the largest solar cluster in the United States, the first operating solar plant to beat fossil fuel prices, and a groundbreaking project to deliver solar with storage at record-low prices.
Now, as Avantus, the company’s development pipeline exceeds 50 GW, effectively doubled over the last two years. With 42 GW of solar and 78 GWh of energy storage, the pipeline spans more than 90 utility-scale projects throughout California, Texas and the Southwestern United States, and represents over $70 billion in investments.
“As Avantus, we plan to continue breaking records on both cost and reliability,” said Stephanie Perry, chief operating officer of Avantus. “Our expanding development pipeline of over 70 utility-scale projects will provide low-cost, zero-emission energy to more than 20 million Americans. Avantus will build on our legacy of success and play a pivotal role in helping the United States meet its clean energy goals.”
In January, 8minute Solar Energy announced it closed $400 million in financing from EIG, an institutional investor in the global energy and infrastructure sectors. 
“Avantus is a clear industry leader with a proven track record of developing groundbreaking solar plants with integrated storage that have spurred the industry’s rapid growth,” said R. Blair Thomas, chairman and CEO of EIG. “This expanded pipeline is a testament to the company’s ability to turn big ideas into pivotal moments and impactful solutions for the clean energy industry and aligned with our commitment to laying the groundwork for a low carbon future. We’re proud to support Avantus as the company enters this next phase of growth and are committed to helping the company execute on its key initiatives.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/03/grid-operator-miso-is-making-progress-on-renewables-interconnection-says-trade-group-leader/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 3, 2022","Grid operator MISO is making progress on renewables interconnection, says trade group leader","Lack of transmission is “at the heart” of interconnection problems for large-scale renewables in the Midwest’s MISO grid region, said Beth Soholt, executive director of the Clean Grid Alliance, which represents about 50 industry members. She spoke on a webinar hosted by the nonprofit Clean Energy States Alliance.
Following the MISO board’s approval in July of six transmission lines across nine states, there remains “a lot of work to get all these lines through” each state’s regulatory process, Soholt said. She expects the lines to enter service in the 2028 to 2030 timeframe.
The newly approved lines will support interconnection of 53 GW of renewables, and although they will cost $10.3 billion, they will reduce other costs by $37 to $68 billion, said Johannes Pfeifenberger, a principal with The Brattle Group, in June. Soholt expects MISO to approve a second stage of transmission investments next year, while MISO also considers a third and fourth stage of transmission investments.
Besides adding transmission, MISO has improved interconnection by reforming its interconnection process five times over 20 years, Soholt said, and by informing developers about locations that have transmission capacity available to accept new renewable generation. Another trend in MISO, she said, is using the infrastructure freed up by coal plant retirements to interconnect new renewables.
Solar outpacing wind
“Solar is coming on strong,” Soholt said, in the latest round of interconnection requests announced by MISO in mid-September. Of the 171 GW of interconnection requests newly added to MISO’s interconnection queue, solar projects took the lead at 84 GW of proposed capacity, followed by storage, hybrid, and wind projects. Developers are proposing solar, Soholt said, because with abundant wind generation in MISO, “people are looking to round out their portfolios,” and also because solar can earn a higher capacity credit, as solar has a better profile for meeting resource adequacy needs. Projects in MISO’s queue now total 289 GW, of which 96% are renewables or storage. For comparison, MISO’s peak demand is about 120 GW.
Recommendations
Given that the first stage of MISO’s new transmission won’t be completed for six to eight years, Soholt called for “stopgap measures” such as grid enhancing technologies, which can increase the utilization of existing transmission lines, “to be able to continue to deploy renewables and storage.”
Regarding interconnection studies, Soholt called for “some kind of reconciliation” when a grid operator misses interconnection study deadlines.
Another key challenge, she said, “is the operating assumptions that MISO has been using” when conducting an interconnection study for storage resources. She called for MISO to “look at how storage is going to operate” and recognize that storage can “be a solution.”
Another factor that is really slowing down interconnection is the slow pace of affected system studies, according to Soholt. She explained that neighboring grid operators SPP and PJM need to study impacts to their systems for MISO-located new generators, especially along the seams, or grid region boundaries. “They have been even slower than MISO,” she said. “There are some efforts underway to try to fix that,” she added, with SPP and MISO conducting a joint targeted interconnection study, in which cost allocation will be a major factor. “We’ve got to get something going on the PJM side.” Cost allocation within MISO is also a “major challenge,” she said.
With MISO’s currently constrained transmission, the “sheer number of megawatts” in the interconnection study groups “require very large transmission solutions to solve,” Soholt said. As a result, “the models can run for days trying to search for an answer.”
