The guide is a quick access tool with high level descriptions of the many incentives found in the act, and links to the official documents.
The document is arranged in thematic chapters. Each program gets a one-page summary of uses, potential beneficiaries, and other information. The White House webpage also features a collapsible chart that shows the same 102 programs that are in the guidebook. The accompanying spreadsheet lists each program, along with its estimated dollar amount.

A White House press release notes that future versions of this document, as well as other clean energy related information, will be shared on www.cleanenergy.gov. 
While searching the spreadsheet for the term “solar”, we found a $25 million solar canal program that will “fund the design, study, and implementation of projects (including pilot and demonstration projects) to cover water conveyance facilities with solar panels to generate renewable energy.” pv magazine usa covered Project Nexus, a solar on canal study, due to be complete over the next year.

The Department of Agriculture is overseeing a $1 billion loan and loan forgiveness program called the Rural Utilities Service, which is available for the construction of renewable technologies to provide electric solutions to rural customers.
The document also notes that more than $2 billion was set aside for the rural land focused REAP program, which offers loans for solar projects on farms.
The DOA document makes it clear that most programs end on December 31, 2031.

The renewable index fund is a modified floated-adjusted market cap weighted index comprised of public wind, solar and energy storage companies, as well as related companies, which stand to benefit from the energy transition toward carbon-free energy.
As of September 30, the index fund was heavily weighted by renewable power producer companies (32%), clean-energy focused utilities (26%), project developers (19%), solar and wind energy YieldCo’s (14%), and biomass and other infrastructure technologies (9%).
By region, the fund is weighted by company geography of the U.S. (38%), Europe (32%), Canada (18%), Australia and the Asia-Pacific region (12%).
The Renewable Infrastructure fund’s top five U.S. and Canadian holdings, as of September 30, are NextEra Energy, Clearway Energy Group, AES Corporation, TransAlta and Brookfield Renewable Partners, with these companies representing 22.3% of the new ETF’s holdings.
Kayne Anderson first began investing in renewable energy in 2013 and has $1.5 billion in renewable energy infrastructure assets under management since launching a renewables-focused infrastructure fund in 2017.
“Renewable infrastructure is one of the most attractive investment opportunities in the global infrastructure sector and this index helps define the universe of publicly traded companies,” said J.C. Frey, co-head of Kayne Anderson’s renewable infrastructure group. “The energy transition is a global megatrend that will benefit the renewable infrastructure sector for the next several decades.”
“While it is clear investors are interested in renewable energy, until now there has not been a transparent index to define the opportunity set for listed renewable infrastructure companies,” said Jim Baker, co-head of Kayne Anderson’s energy infrastructure group. “Just like Kayne Anderson helped establish the MLP sector, Kayne is proud to collaborate with S&P Dow Jones to launch what we believe will be the index that helps define the sector as an asset class.”
Other index funds that measure and follow the performance of public renewable energy companies include Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund (QCLN), and S&P North America and Europe Clean Energy Index.
Companies that are followed on most of the indices include Enphase Energy, First Solar, SolarEdge Technologies, Sunrun, JinkoSolar and Canadian Solar, among others, including global utilities with renewable energy developments.
Over the last year the pv magazine USA editorial team has published quarterly earnings reviews that provide the latest financial and operational metrics of many of the key North American solar and energy storage technology suppliers found on these indices, such as FTC Solar, REC Silicon and Canadian Solar, as well as others engaged in rooftop solar and commercial solar development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/19/air-source-heat-pump-for-cold-climates/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"DECEMBER 19, 2022",Air-source heat pump for cold climates,"From pv magazine global
Johnson Controls is developing residential heat pumps for cold climates, under the U.S. Department of Energy’s Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge.
The heating tech manufacturer currently offers two residential heat pumps that meet the U.S. Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pump specification – the York YZV and York HMH7. The cold climate heat pumps operate at temperatures up to 5 F and have a heating season performance factor (HSPF) of up to 10.5 and a coefficient of performance (COP) at 5 F above “2.”
“In the coming years, we’ll have heat pumps that maintain full heating capacity at 5 F and efficiently heat spaces down into negative temperature territory,” a Johnson Controls’ spokesperson told pv magazine. “This level of performance will be critical to maintaining a clean, resilient grid during winter peak periods.”
Under the Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge, the company will develop and commercialize heat pumps for temperatures equal to or below -20 F. While the York YZV and York HMH7 use R-410A refrigerant, the next-generation heat pumps will use R-454B. The spokesperson claimed that this “will cut the global warming potential (GWP) of the refrigerant by nearly 80%.”
The company said it hopes the cold-climate heat pumps will be certified to AHRI Standard 1380. The spokesperson said that this “will enable utilities and aggregators to ask connected heat pumps to reduce power consumption to 70%, 40%, and shut-off, depending on the level of curtailment needed.” Heat pumps that successfully pass the challenge will have to provide such grid-interaction services.
Carrier, Lennox, and Ireland-based Trane Technologies have also developed prototypes for the field-testing phase of the challenge.

Rooftop wind energy innovation claims 50% more energy than solar at same cost
Image: Aeromine
A new bladeless wind energy unit, patented by Aeromine Technologies, is tackling the challenge of competing with rooftop solar as a local source of clean energy that can be integrated with the built environment. The scalable, “motionless” wind energy unit can produce 50% more energy than rooftop solar at the same cost, said the company. The technology was validated through joint research with Sandia National Laboratories and Texas Tech University, and the wind harvesting system is currently being piloted by BASF at a manufacturing plant in Wyandotte, Michigan.
Solar investment tax credit to be extended 10 years at 30%

A few weeks prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), it was revealed that one of the provisions in the IRA would be the long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit. The bill calls for a 10-year extension at 30% of the cost of installed solar equipment, which steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. The credit may be applied retroactively for those who installed their system after Jan. 1, 2022.
Anti-rooftop solar net metering bill passes in Florida

In March the Florida legislature passed House Bill 741, which phases down the value of net metering, and opens the door for utilities to add fixed charges to solar customer bills. Advocacy organizations FLASEIA, Vote Solar, and environmental groups in the state called on Governor Ron DeSantis to veto the bill, which he did in April. DeSantis wrote in his veto letter that while “consumers have seen steep increases it the price of gas and groceries… the state of Florida should not contribute to the financial crunch that our citizens are experiencing.”
Electric vehicle battery capable of 98% charge in less than ten minutes

Fremont, California-based Enovix announced in June that it demonstrated in electric vehicle (EV) battery cells the ability to charge from 0% to 80% state-of-charge in as little as 5.2 minutes and to achieve a greater than 98% charge capacity in under 10 minutes. The cells also surpassed 1,000 cycles while retaining 93% of their capacity. The achievement is especially impressive because but it shattered the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) goal of achieving 80% charge in 15 minutes.
California pulls the plug on rooftop solar

On December 15, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted unanimously to approve Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM), slashing payments by 75% for excess solar production sent to the grid. As exported power loses its value, Californians are now forced to adopt batteries with their solar installations if they want a reasonable return on investment, which are now estimated to move from an average of about 4.5 years to 6.5 years to 14.5 years. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said the decision is “too abrupt” and will slow rooftop solar deployment in the state. “The failure to adopt a more gradual transition to net billing risks putting solar out of reach for millions of residents across the state,” said SEIA.
Battery storage operation under net billing provides “virtually no grid value”: Berkeley Lab study

Net billing, which is replacing net metering in many states, incentivizes the use of battery storage with rooftop solar to maximize solar self-consumption. The way it works is that a rooftop solar owner is compensated for electricity sent to the grid at an export rate below the retail price of electricity, “often tied to the utility’s avoided costs,” says a Berkeley Lab study. The Berkeley study researchers found that net billing is inefficient, whereas incentivizing battery owners to discharge power during peak hours would provide greater value.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/19/fintech-meets-solar-raise-green-revolutionizes-local-impact-investment-and-development/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",BRIAN SAVAGE,"DECEMBER 19, 2022",Fintech meets solar: Raise Green revolutionizes local impact investment and development,"Sustainable investing has gone mainstream. A 2021 Morgan Stanley survey found that among individual investors, an astonishing 99% of millennials and 79% of the general population were interested in sustainable investing. Despite this, only 59% of millennials and 53% of the general population reported being currently invested in companies or investment funds that seek to make a positive social or environmental impact. While opportunities exist, barriers remain to adoption. About 71% of respondents had concerns about authenticity or greenwashing, and 58% reported there was a lack of available financial products which fit their portfolio.
The Raise Green platform combines this desire for action on sustainability with easy access for investors and developers, while still retaining authenticity that projects have verifiable impacts on clean energy and other climate solutions. Franz Hochstrasser, co-founder and chief executive officer of Raise Green, was part of the team that successfully negotiated the Paris Agreement. While he has experience in government, he developed Raise Green to enable anyone to directly respond to climate change.
Recent Raise Green initiatives include solar farms in the Pacific Islands from Mana Pacific, decarbonized plastic from Applied Bioplastics, solar panels for a school in Vermont, and an investment in Brooklyn-based building HVAC retrofit start-up company BlocPower.
This business model is made possible by U.S. Securities Exchange Commission changes that allow private equity investment through crowdfunding. Unlike other crowdfunding platforms, green projects can issue debt notes or equity stakes. This democratizes the financing of community-scale solar, and other climate solutions that often struggle to finance themselves through traditional banks and lenders.
Raise Green’s Originator Engine goes beyond financing by providing simple and accessible institutional knowledge on community solar project development. This software solution developed in partnership with IBM provides entrepreneurs with tools and resources from start to finish. During the creation stage, the project developer is guided through legal obstacles to turn their idea into a real business. During the funding stage, the project is vetted through Raise Green’s crowd investment platform to procure financing.  The platform allows individuals to invest in projects for as little as $100 up front. With solar installers being among the top growing job groups, Raise Green provides employment and training tools for project development.
The future looks bright for Raise Green. In the two years since its founding, the organization has brought together investors of all types with 18 climate solutions including community solar, electric vehicle charging, sustainable manufacturing and batteries. The company also recently announced the close of a $1.2 million seed round financing in partnership with Onyx Renewable Partners, and won the Environmental Finance’s Impact Investing Platform of the Year award.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/19/a-year-of-solar-industry-proposals-to-clear-interconnection-queue-logjams/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"DECEMBER 19, 2022",A year of solar industry proposals to clear interconnection queue logjams,"One of the greatest challenges for large-scale solar and storage this year has been interconnection, with the solar industry responding vigorously.
Solar developers first sounded the alarm, with nearly 90% of survey respondents saying interconnection delays and costs pose the biggest barrier to utility-scale renewables.
Interconnection studies “could be completed in months instead of years,” said trade groups SEIA, AEE and ACP, in comments submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Pointing to interconnection queue “logjams” and “exploding” network upgrade costs, the groups asked FERC to open an accelerated interconnection rulemaking. They proposed 20 reforms, including requiring a “first-ready, first-served” cluster study approach, in which multiple interconnection requests would be studied at once.
SEIA and allies subsequently urged FERC to speed up interconnection studies by setting enforceable timelines, and allowing developers to use third-party consultants to prepare interconnection studies. To speed interconnection on both the transmission and distribution grids, SEIA also proposed extensive reforms for both federal and state regulators.
Processing pace
Texas grid operator the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) completed facilities studies for 6 GW of solar interconnection requests in 2021, which compares favorably to 17 GWdc of utility-scale solar deployed nationwide in 2021.

Johannes Pfeifenberger, a principal of the Brattle Group, attributed ERCOT’s success to its approach to interconnection, which is similar to the UK’s approach. Unlike the “invest and connect” approach common in the United States, under the UK’s “connect and manage” approach, any network constraints or congestion following interconnection are dealt with through congestion management, curtailment, or regional network upgrades, Pfeifenberger said, in a webinar hosted by the Energy Systems Integration Group.
Grid operators the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Los Angeles utility LADWP also disclosed their pace of processing solar interconnection requests in 2021, clocking in at 5 GW, 6 GW and 800 MW for the year, respectively. The other four regional system operators, as well as 19 of the 20 largest utilities in the Southeast and West Coast regions not served by grid operators, did not disclose that information. The seven grid regions are shown in the nearby map from the Sustainable FERC project.

Applauding MISO for adding transmission to resolve interconnection problems, Beth Soholt, executive director of Clean Grid Alliance, said that “a lot of work” remains to obtain state approvals for six new transmission lines proposed by MISO across nine states. Soholt also made several recommendations for MISO in a webinar hosted by the Clean Energy States Alliance.
The opportunity
Overall, 1400 GW of “untapped” large-scale renewables and storage projects are waiting in interconnection queues, said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, citing data from Berkeley Lab, saying that amount “is about what we need to reach 80% clean electricity by 2030.” Granholm made the comment in announcing the U.S. Department of Energy’s “i2X” initiative to speed interconnection, which has recruited hundreds of participants, including representatives of renewables developers and trade groups, to work in collaboration with U.S. national laboratories.
An estimated 1.7 million jobs could be created across the PJM grid region alone, by building the 300 GW of renewables and storage projects in PJM’s interconnection queue, or waiting list, said trade group AEE in a web post.
Proposed solutions
FERC proposed an interconnection rule in June that would require transmission providers to adopt a first-ready, first-served cluster study process. Transmission providers would face firm deadlines for completing interconnection studies, backed by penalties for missed deadlines, while project developers would face readiness requirements to enter and remain in the interconnection queue. These proposed measures were among those requested by SEIA and allies.
Artificial intelligence can enable faster and more accurate modeling for interconnection studies, said Xing Wang, an executive with Amazon Web Services, at a conference hosted by renewables trade group  American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). The trade association has been discussing such improvements with grid operator the Southwest Power Pool (SPP).
Saying Tesla could estimate a project’s interconnection costs in two weeks if it had access to grid models, the company said developers should be allowed to perform such studies, in its comments on FERC’s proposed interconnection rule.
All 13 states plus the District of Columbia in the PJM Interconnection region called for PJM to speed up its processing of interconnection requests, and its transition to a cluster study process, in comments on FERC’s proposed rule. Brattle’s Pfeifenberger said it was “striking” that only 2 GW of renewables capacity was interconnected in PJM in 2021, compared to 6 GW in ERCOT, even though PJM is more than twice as large as ERCOT.   
Bringing a perspective from outside the industry, Shelley Welton, a professor of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Carey Law and Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, said to speed interconnection, “maybe we want somebody running the show that has more of an interest in getting all these resources in the grid.” Welton proposed public control of grid operators, and noted that grid operator CAISO is publicly controlled, in a webinar hosted by the Clean Energy States Alliance.
Engineers, data
In light of comments by CAISO and MISO reporting a shortage of qualified engineers to conduct interconnection studies, Kalyan Chilukuri, a vice president of Electric Power Engineers, discussed industry staffing challenges and measures that might help, in an interview.
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, CAISO and grid operator SPP shared their insights on the education of new power system engineers, and the demand for these engineers, in interviews.
Two solar groups called on the U.S. Energy Information Administration to collect and report more data on interconnection, they said in a statement. The government agency denied the request, saying it would be “burdensome,” said David Gahl, executive director of the Solar and Storage Industries Institute, in an update.
