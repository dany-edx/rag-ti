The team, Drs. Steven R. Miller and William Knudson, assumed that the program would enable the installation of 150 MW of capacity per year for six years. The program’s final 900 MW of capacity would be spread out over 30 installations per year, each with a capacity of 5 MW, typical for such installations.
The analysis also assumes the installations would be distributed statewide rather than centralized to a few counties, and that the lifespan of a facility would be 25 years. The study did not consider other value-creating resources, such as energy storage.
The benefits were calculated as additions to Michigan’s gross state product, meaning what they would add to the state’s total annual value of goods produced and services provided. All figures were calculated in current dollars, rather than projected for the future.
Project installation alone was determined to generate $474.84 million in cumulative gross state product. Lifetime operations and maintenance (O&M) expenditures were expected to generate $952.01 million in gross state product. Over the life of the program, the combined discounted contributions to gross state product were estimated to be $1.47 billion.
Breaking the numbers down into annual terms, the report outlined that the industry-wide construction contribution to gross state product would be $79.14 million for the six years of installation. The annual contributions from O&M averaged to around $30.71 million over the 31-year projections.
The report also projected contributions to Michigan labor income and employment. It calculated an estimated 900 new Michigan jobs per year, with a total of $318.56 million in labor income over the six years of installations.
Aside from construction, the team estimated that 423 annual jobs would be created and linked to O&M operations over the 31-year span. The projected labor income, discounted to current values over this same period, was expected to be $412.36 million.
The current value of expected labor income (both installation and O&M) over the 31-year analysis was $730.92 million. And the current value of future stream of contributions to gross state product exceeded $1.426 billion over the same timespan.
On a per-project basis, a single 5 MW community solar project would directly employ about 15 Michigan workers and support about 30 jobs with a total payroll of just under $2 million. In addition, the analysis estimated that a single 5 MW community solar project would contribute nearly $3 million in annual gross domestic project during the installation phase.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/20/highway-side-solar-could-produce-36-twh-annually/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 20, 2021",Highway-side solar could produce 36 TWh annually,"Research published by the Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin and nonprofit group The Ray has led to a partnership with geographic information system (GIS) mapping company Esri to create a highway right-of-way (ROW) solar evaluation tool.
The study found that installing solar panels at highway exits could generate up to 36 TWh per year. That is enough to power 12 million passenger electric vehicles, and has an estimated value of energy of $4 billion per year, said Esri.
Installing solar arrays at interchanges, exits, rest areas, visitor centers, which are maintained by state governments, can be challenging due to safety, environmental, and future land-use concerns. To address this, The Ray partnered with Esri to configure a solar mapping tool that analyzes how suitable and economically valuable a given ROW location might be.
The tool uses Esri’s ArcGIS software suite, and includes 3D modeling, solar radiation calculations based of elevation and surface, and viewshed analysis. The tool reduces what used to be a weeks- or months-long process into a fraction of the time, and does it more precisely.
The Ray has a solar test bed west of Georgia’s I-85, which the group said functions as a proving ground for solar, EV charging, and smart landscape architecture. The Ray now works in 15 states and over two dozen transportation agencies to replicate the results of the Georgia test bed.
(Read: “Solar in uncommon spaces”)
In addition to modeling the value of the solar array, the Esri model enables department of transportation developers to anticipate unintended consequences, such as the interruption of a scenic viewshed. It allows for preliminary site planning exercises, including altering shape, size, and scope of the project to evaluate different levels of impact to the surrounding community.
GIS continues to play a growing role in solar development. Some providers offer free, open-source resources , as well.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/20/a-solar-array-is-headed-to-a-new-york-landfill/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MICHIGAN,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES,UTAH",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 20, 2021",A solar array is headed to a New York landfill,"Outside of Buffalo, NY, a 7 MW solar array is slated to be built on an abandoned landfill.
The brownfield development contract was closed by New Energy Equity, and community solar developer National Energy Development (NED) was selected to engineer and construct the project.
Dubbed the Broadway solar project, the landfill-topping array will sell power to local community solar subscribers, including homeowners, schools, local businesses, and municipalities.
The project will be installed on a ballasted fixed-tilt mounting system, which offers stability to the array without making deep punctures into the sensitive landfill grounds.

Landfills continue to play host to solar arrays around the nation, turning otherwise useless land into productive clean energy centers.  The Environmental Protection Agency reports an 80% rise in such projects over the last five years. Often, these projects are built as community solar projects.
In Ann Arbor, Michigan, utility DTE Energy will build a 20 MW facility as part of its MIGreenPower program, one of many it plans to bring online by 2025. The utility is currently issuing a request for proposal for the engineering, procurement, and construction firm on the project.
Farther west, in Utah, a 4.7 MW community solar project entered service earlier this year just south of Provo. The array was mounted on Solar FlexRack’s cast-in-place ballast mounting system, protecting the sensitive surface of the landfill while maintaining stability and resilience.
These projects, along with others in uncommon spaces, help fight energy sprawl, or the development of land for energy infrastructure. A study by Clemson University estimated that utility-scale solar, including spacing requirements, could require a land area the size of Texas by 2040 to meet the nation’s energy needs.

According to StoreDot, employees at the innovation hub will work alongside StoreDot’s Israel-based R&D headquarters, with the goal of enabling mass production of the company’s XFC automotive battery technologies by 2024. It will also commence research into next-generation extreme energy density (XED) solid-state capabilities and materials, with the aim of scaling-up these advanced technologies for mass production by 2028.
“Our new US team will work in tandem with our rapidly expanding global network bringing new skills and ideas in order that we can execute our clear technology roadmap, enabling automotive manufacturers to develop vehicles that overcome range and charging anxiety,” said StoreDot CEO, Dr. Doron Myersdorf.
In January, StoreDot released the first production batch of its XFC sample cells, which were used to demonstrate the full charge of a two-wheeled EV in five minutes. This breakthrough was made possible by replacing the graphite in the battery cell’s anode with metalloid nano-particles.
StoreDot said its battery chemistry breakthrough drastically improves battery safety, cycle life and swelling.
In September, StoreDot revealed another of its fast charging cells: a Lithium-ion silicon-dominant 4680 cylindrical cell prototype. The company shares that this specific cell can be fully charged in 10 minutes.
The 4680 form factor has emerged as the preferred format among EV manufacturers. StoreDot targeted that format for innovation, as it gives the company technical and commercial flexibility to integrate with various Electric Vehicle OEMs.
Once the California innovation hub is open and operational, it will assist StoreDot’s other facilities in ensuring that both the XFC metalloid pouch battery product and the Lithium-ion silicon-dominant 4680 cylindrical cell are ready to be produced at scale by 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/20/polysilicons-upward-price-ride-is-not-over-analyst-says/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"OCTOBER 20, 2021","Polysilicon’s upward price ride is not over, analyst says","Prices within China for polysilicon–and by extension for wafers and modules–are likely to remain high into 2022 as a series of factors buffet the sector.
Electric power restrictions that are in place across China due to shortages of both coal and hydro power resources are largely to blame.
“It’s been a very crazy year,” said Sakura Yamasaki, director of the Singapore Solar Exchange during a webinar hosted by Roth Capital Partners. She said that even a three-month price forecast is difficult to give, but suggested that polysilicon prices could stabilize in the second quarter of 2022 as springtime temperatures ease power demand across China. She said that a price pegged at $41/kg excluding value added taxes (VATs) is possible through the end of the year, but could go higher.

“The ride up is not over,” she said.
In response to the price uncertainty, some module vendors have begun to shift away from fixed prices and toward an indexed price model. Yamasaki said that a consensus is emerging that a price increase of 10 RMB/kg would equal a $0.005/Watt increase in price.
Turning to freight costs, Yamasaki said that the market has “calmed down a bit” even as congestion remains at U.S. ports along the West Coast. She said that the outlook for 2022 remains “chaotic” with containers likely to remain in short supply.
“There will be no relief in 2022,” she said, with the outlook “as crazy as this year.”
Recent indications suggest that widespread constraints on electric power use could ease in some parts of China and for solar producers in particular. Solar energy analyst Frank Haugwitz with AECEA said that solar manufacturing could be exempted due to its strategic nature, both as an export commodity as well as for internal Chinese use to meet the nation’s emission reduction targets.

He said that as long as provinces are on track to meet their emission targets, they may be allowed to exempt certain industries. He did not rule out the possibility of future electricity restrictions, especially since Beijing has not forwarded long-term structural changes to the power sector. “You basically turn off and turn on” industries to meet power consumption and emission goals. Without structural reform, each time the power is turned back on “you go back to square one.”
Alex Barrows, research director at Exawatt, said his firm expects some pressure on polysilicon prices to ease as capacity expansions come online in China. He forecasts 2021 capacity at around 184 GW. That capacity would grow to 235-240 GW in 2022 on expected demand of 211 GW. By 2024, capacity within China could reach 500 GW.
He also said he expected recent consolidation in wafer production to reverse as a handful of companies enter the market. He expected market concentration among the 10 largest producers to fall from 93% this year to around 88% in 2023.
