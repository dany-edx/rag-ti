VPPs allow for virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources. Consumer-owned devices like solar-plus-batteries, electric vehicles, appliances, and backup generators can be aggregated to participate in the wholesale electricity market.
By enabling these coordinated resources to participate in powering the grid, VPPs can improve grid reliability and balance the grid. VPPs can support a Texas grid that has struggled operate reliably under extreme weather events.
“Small energy resources found in homes and businesses across Texas have incredible potential to continue improving grid reliability and resiliency by selling the excess power they generate to the ERCOT system,” said PUCT commissioner Will McAdams. “It’s a win-win for Texas. Home and business owners get paid for power they supply and consumers in ERCOT get more reliability.”
PUCT said there are currently 2.3 GW of distributed resources of less than 1 MW each across the state. Over 300 MW was added in 2023 alone.
The VPP rollout is part of the Aggregate Distributed Energy (ADER) pilot project series run in the ERCOT region. ADERs are formed and operated by retail electric providers or utilities that sell electricity to homes and businesses. In this pilot project, compensation terms and participation requirements will vary depending on the provider operating the ADER.
To qualify for the pilot project, an ADER must be able to produce at least 100 kW, and each individual device in the ADER must be less than 1 MW. The average residential battery is about 5 kW. The pilot project is currently capped at 80 MW of total participation to ensure a safe and controlled rollout. Customer participation in the program is voluntary.
There are currently eight ADERs totaling 7.2 MW in the pilot project. Six have completed the initial registration steps and are in the commissioning process.
Two ADERs are approved involve Tesla customers with Powerwall energy storage systems. One is an aggregation of Houston-area CenterPoint Energy customers and Dallas-area Oncor customers. Additional information on the projects can be found here.
“As generation and distribution technology continues to improve, we expect to see more Texans taking advantage of these small energy resources in the future,” said ERCOT president and chief executive officer Pablo Vegas. “This pilot project is an opportunity for us, the electric industry, and participants to learn how to harness these resources to support reliability in the ERCOT market.”

Ranked at the top of the charts in the Solar Means Business 2022 report that analyzes commercial solar adoption. The report tracked 47,000 corporate solar installations and names Meta, Amazon, Apple, Walmart and Microsoft as the top five corporate solar users in the country.
The Panola II Solar Farm is Microsoft’s most recent solar investment, and it is one of three new solar projects launched by Clearloop in collaboration with the Tallahatchie Valley Electric Power Association (TVEPA). TVEPA is working with Clearloop and parent company, Silicon Ranch, to bring the renewable energy to the county. Silicon Ranch will be the developer, owner and operator of all three Panola solar projects.
Clearloop helps fund solar projects for organizations of all sizes. By taking emissions measurements, the company can compare the impact of renewable energy projects on driving down emissions, to determine where new solar generation can displace the most carbon.
“Decarbonizing the electricity grid is key to combatting climate change,” said Danielle Decatur, director of environmental justice at Microsoft. “Adding new solar projects where they can displace the most emissions will help achieve this outcome as quickly as possible, and it’s important that we do so while also supporting local communities.”
Clearloop is working with Microsoft to purchase all of the environmental attributes associated with the life of the Panola II project and using those funds to commission the project. Microsoft provided Clearloop with upfront payment for renewable energy credits (RECs), which Clearloop said helps with the funding of the project, and it also helps deploy new solar projects where they can drive down the most emissions.
The first of the three Panola projects in April, and they are expected to be complete in 2024. The projects are located in Batesville, Mississippi (Panola County), which is at the cross-section of the Mississippi Delta and the Appalachian Foothills. The land footprint for this project is approximately 80 acres.
The 6.6 MW(dc) Panola II project will use Nextracker’s Horizon XTR trackers, which are terrain-following trackers that enable the project to follow the natural contours of the land. Just over 14,000 First Solar 6+ bifacial modules will be installed on the trackers, Clearloop reports.
Electricity generated from Panola II will serve over 27,000 of TVEPA’s residential, commercial and industrial customers in nine North Mississippi Counties.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/24/arizona-to-vote-on-37-slash-to-solar-net-metering/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,ARIZONA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 24, 2023",Arizona to vote on 37% slash to solar net metering,"The Arizona Corporation Commission is set to vote on August 24, 2023 on an amendment that would rapidly reduce the payments made to solar customers for exporting local rooftop solar production to the electricity grid.
Arizona Corporation Commissioner Nick Myers filed an amendment that would cut net energy metering (NEM) rates to $0.053 per kWh, a reduction of 37%, which would take place suddenly in September. This would supersede the legal foundation that set a 10% NEM rate reduction per year, which would have led to a rate of $0.076 per kWh.
The proposed amendment was justified based on “cost-shift issues,” a utility-backed argument that non-solar customers were cross-subsidizing rooftop solar customers by increasing utility system costs. Utility Arizona Public Service (APS) provided data to the Corporation Commission claiming, “the magnitude of cost shift within the residential ratepayer class is within the range of $800 to $1000 per year.” This would amount to an $18 million cross-subsidization.
However, numerous studies by national labs and state groups have debunked utility claims of such a significant cost-shift. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that at current levels of rooftop solar adoption, the cost shift is negligible. At solar adoption rates of 10% of electricity generation mix or more, the cost shift was found to be a miniscule $0.005 per kWh.
If the 37% cut is approved, APS will essentially buy local solar generation for $0.053 per kWh, and then sell it to neighboring Arizonans for nearly triple that price, as APS customers often pay retail rates ranging $0.12 per kWh to $0.17 per kWh.
The Corporation Commission deemed that the valuation of solar exports should be based on the “avoided cost” methodology. It further notes that only utility costs should be considered when designing the rates, ignoring any kind of societal or environmental externality associated with the technology, be it a benefit or a harm.
The Commission determined, “use of utility-scale solar obligations represents the most reliable and objective avoided cost proxy for rooftop solar and diminishes concerns for the inclusion of societal and environmental factors and other externalities in valuing solar DG exports, which are speculative and inappropriate for ratemaking purposes.”

Health and environmental benefits, significant cost savings and stability for ratepayers, and resilience to extreme weather or national security events are benefits to Arizonans that adopt solar but are not relevant factors in the Arizona Corporation Commission’s evaluation of ratemaking and the technologies it wishes to support. Utility costs and profits take precedence over these significant externalities.
If approved in the vote, the NEM rate cuts will take place immediately on September 1, 2023. The move is expected to cause damage to the residential solar industry. After California passed a similar net metering rate cut, demand in the subsequent quarter fell by 38%, according to Wood Mackenzie.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/24/solaredge-joins-xcel-energys-virtual-power-plant-incentive-program-in-colorado/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,COLORADO",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 24, 2023",SolarEdge joins Xcel Energy’s virtual power plant incentive program in Colorado,"Customers in Colorado who own a SolarEdge Technologies’ home battery system can now participate in a new virtual power plant (VPP) incentive program run by Xcel Energy.
The initiative – called the Renewable Battery Connect program – will call on home battery owners to discharge power to the home or the grid when electricity demand is especially high, and provide them with financial incentives in return. SolarEdge software will automatically handle the charging and discharging of the battery when called upon to do so. 
VPPs are aggregations of distributed energy resources, and offer many benefits. In an article on the barriers to VPPs, Jigar Shah, director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, touted their virtues. “By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants,” Shah wrote.
SolarEdge worked closely with Xcel Energy to design a program that meets Colorado’s specific energy requirements, Peter Mathews, the company’s North America general manager, said.
“The combination of our highly efficient DC-coupled technology and innovative software lays the groundwork for future VPP growth, as we continue to move towards a net-zero economy,” Mathews added. 
Xcel Energy’s Renewable Battery Connect program began in June. Customers who generate clean electricity from their own rooftop solar systems, store it with at-home batteries and participate in grid-management events can play an important role in supporting the electrical grid and generation needs, especially on very hot days when air conditioning units are running, the utility told pv magazine USA. Xcel Energy invests nearly $5.2 million each year in customer rebates for renewable programs such as this one.
Customers who enroll in Xcel Energy’s Renewable Battery Connect program will be given a $500 per KW upfront incentive, working out to $2,500 for one SolarEdge home battery, and an additional $100 for each year that they are part of the program. Customers who meet certain income thresholds or come from disproportionately impacted communities could receive a higher $800 per kW incentive. The program’s enrollment period is five years, and customers could be called upon to discharge power to the home or the grid up to 60 times annually. 
VPPs present the electricity sector with a host of potential benefits. They can reduce reliance on fossil fuel resources, and play a role in electrifying different sectors of the economy. In the report Virtual Power Plants, Real Benefits, RMI estimates that VPPs will reduce peak demand in the country by 60 GW by 2030, and potentially 200 GW by 2050. Moreover, VPPs can reduce yearly power industry costs by $17 billion by the end of the decade, since they can avert the need to build out generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. 
“Over the next decade, VPPs could play a central role in meeting grid and societal needs,” the report stated. 
However, the report also identified three potential obstacles to the growth of the VPP market – whether regional transmission organizations craft wholesale market rules that fairly compensate VPPs; whether utilities provide retail programs and rates that promote VPPs in areas that are not served by wholesale electricity markets; and the low awareness among customers and policymakers regarding the benefits offered by VPPs. 
In July, SolarEdge announced it had entered a multi-year capacity reservation agreement with global semiconductor company Infineon Technologies, under which Infineon would supply it with components for multiple SolarEdge products. The two companies also plan to work together on developing solar products and other future technologies. 
SolarEdge reported record revenue of $991.3 million in its Q2 earnings report on Aug. 1, 5% higher than the previous quarter and 36% higher than the second quarter of 2022. Solar segment revenues totalled $947.4 million, 38% than the same quarter last year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/24/new-york-provides-pre-development-support-for-solar-and-storage-for-lmi-housing/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 24, 2023",New York provides pre-development support for solar and storage for LMI housing,"A New York State program is helping owners of low- and moderate-income housing to launch community solar projects.
The program provides grant funding and technical support at the pre-development stage, which includes site identification, establishment of site control, initial interconnection screening, structural analysis, site feasibility, financial analysis, and securing of project financing or credit enhancement for the project.
The program has supported the New York City nonprofit Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), which supports affordable housing cooperatives in New York City, along with its nonprofit partner Solar One, to help add solar to 22 co-op buildings. UHAB conducts outreach to co-op residents, while Solar One designs projects, prepares cost estimates, and selects solar and/or storage construction firms.
The nonprofit affordable housing provider Fifth Avenue Committee (FAC) in New York City relied on the program’s support to install 255 kW of solar at seven of its buildings, yielding monthly energy savings of about $25 per subscribing household. FAC, which owns and operates its buildings, formed FAC Solar LLC to develop the community solar projects. The two entities plan to explore solar and storage projects for their other 40 properties.
Case studies of the two efforts are provided in a report from the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA), which says that the New York State program “can serve as a model” for such programs in other states.
The program contributes to New York’s goal of reaching 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030. It has supported 43 projects to date with project grants of up to $200,000, with the grant size based on the scope of the proposed project.
Without the program’s support, says CESA’s case study, nonprofit affordable housing providers “can have difficulty overcoming the lack of financial resources, market experience, or staff capacity to bring a solar and/or storage project from the concept stage to operation.”
CESA says that lenders are reluctant to provide loans for pre-development costs for solar or solar-plus-storage projects to benefit low- and moderate-income residents “because these projects are considered risky by many commercial financing institutions.”
CESA is offering a webinar on the New York State program on September 19.
CESA’s Solar with Justice Initiative has produced several reports on collaborative work between states and communities that aims to “ensure that the benefits of solar are equitably shared.”
