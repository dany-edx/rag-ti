Tigo Energy Inc., a California-based provider of solar module-level power electronics (MLPE) solutions, announced a new version of its TS4-A-O optimizer with an increased rated module power of up to 700 W.
Tigo said the IEC-certified optimizer has one of the highest per-module wattages among commercially available optimizers on the market, enabling it to work with the newest PV solutions, including high-efficiency and bifacial modules. The company said that the product retains the same form factor as the previous-generation TS4-A-O, and works with the same equipment that installers are familiar with. More info available here.
Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Taiwan University have developed a new manufacturing process for mini perovskite solar modules that is claimed to overcome key bottlenecks in large-scale production.
“The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from a solar module includes power conversion efficiency, module lifetime, and the production cost,” research co-author Leeyih Wang told pv magazine. “We think our study has provided a solution for all three factors, as the high-efficiency demonstration and greatly extended lifetime from our module can contribute to lower the LCOE.” More info available here.
APsmart announced a new Photovoltaic Rapid Shutdown System (PVRSS) certification to the UL 1741 standard with several new inverters from Growatt.
Altogether, six Growatt inverter models, ranging from 3 kW to 6 kW, were tested by CSA and certified for use with APsmart’s photovoltaic rapid shutdown equipment. Among them is Growatt’s new single-phase hybrid inverter for both new and retrofit solar. Currently, the APsmart rapid shutdown solution is compatible with more than 120 inverter models from 11 brands. More info available here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/26/senate-bill-would-give-clean-energy-companies-direct-access-to-tax-credits/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 26, 2021",Senate bill would give clean energy companies direct access to tax credits,"Three senators, Tom Carper (D-Del.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), introduced a bill that would allow for temporary refundability of section 45, 45Q, and 48 investment and production tax credits.
The credits provide incentives for the private development of projects such as solar, wind, fuel cells, and carbon capture and sequestration.
Carper, who is chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee and is senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, said that investment, along with the production tax credits, have been “indispensable tools” in driving clean energy and economic growth.
He said the Covid-19 economic crisis created an “immediate crisis” in clean energy financing, “stalling current and future clean energy projects and leaving over 400,000 Americans” in the clean energy sector unemployed.
The bill would allow clean energy companies to bypass frozen tax-equity markets and access tax credits directly. Doing so, in turn, is expected to help get stalled projects going and create jobs in a sector that has been hit especially hard by the pandemic.
This type of legislation has been pushed for by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) as a necessity for the solar industry to recover from economic effects of the pandemic.
News of the legislation was met with approval across the clean energy space, with SEIA, American Clean Power Association, American Council on Renewable Energy, National Wildlife Federation, Advanced Energy Economy, Clean Air Task Force, Consumer Energy Alliance, Sunnova, Intersect Power, Clearway Energy Group, and SunPower all voicing their support.
Backers said the legislation addresses an obstacle facing deployment of new energy technologies in the wake of the pandemic and associated challenges in the tax equity market. They said that providing a direct payment option would put capital into the hands of clean energy companies, spurring development and job growth.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/26/sunpower-ceo-tom-werner-steps-down-reveals-successor/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 26, 2021","SunPower CEO Tom Werner steps down, reveals successor","Major U.S. solar provider SunPower announced that long-time CEO Tom Werner is retiring from the company.
SunPower named Peter Faricy as Werner’s successor, effective April 19. Faricy most recently served as CEO of Global Direct-to-Consumer for Discovery Inc., overseeing businesses including Discovery+, Food Network Kitchen, Magnolia, Eurosport Player, and GOLFTV.
Prior to Discovery, Faricy spent 13 years at Amazon, most recently as vice president leading the Amazon Marketplace. He has also served on the board of Blue Apron and the University of Michigan Ross School of Business Advisory Board.
Werner will stay on as chairman of the board of directors for six months. The board then intends to recombine the positions of chairman and CEO.
During Werner’s 18-year tenure, SunPower became a publicly listed company in November 2005 and secured a “transformational” buyout investment from French oil giant Total in 2011. The company grew into a leading vertically integrated solar panel manufacturer and installer.
In 2020, SunPower officially split off its manufacturing business into a new company, Maxeon Solar Technologies. It also sold its operations and maintenance business in an effort to focus on its “core strength” of distributed solar installation.
In announcing his decision to step down, Werner said, “The time is right for a new leader to take the reins and set the course for SunPower.”
Looking ahead, Werner said he plans to pursue strategic investing in purpose-driven start-ups and participate in efforts to work toward a “more diverse and equitable future.”
He added, “Peter’s deep experience creating disruptive sales channels, delivering incredible customer experiences, and building iconic brands make him the right person to lead SunPower’s next chapter.”
Incoming CEO Faricy said, “SunPower is a company known for its innovative spirit and track record as a leader in solar and now storage. The opportunity to help the company maximize its potential in a new era of energy is exciting and incredibly meaningful.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/26/youtube-a-proven-marketing-platform-for-growing-your-solar-business/,"GUEST POST,MARKETING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 26, 2021",YouTube: A proven marketing platform for growing your solar business,"The solar industry has seen unprecedented development as one of the top two renewable energy sources with continued growth in 2021. The future of solar technology remains bright, but as a solar business owner you may be left wondering how to tap into the expanding market in order to grow your solar business.
YouTube videos are becoming a vital part of consumers’ solar buying journey, providing a unique opportunity for solar marketers. The platform can be used to keep your solar business relevant by creating exclusive content and informational videos that establish yourself as an expert in your field.
Videos can then be used to direct potential clients to your other social channels, website, or both. Consumers are turning to YouTube to understand the process of going solar, and when they are ready to buy they will turn to the expert they have come to trust – you.
My research into the ins and outs of solar marketing comes through years of placing my focus exclusively on solar, testing strategies for reaching quality leads, and investing time and money as I grew my marketing company.
There was a time when platforms such as Facebook provided multiple leads for very little cost. But, as time went on, my team and I found both the cost for solar ads and competition on social media was increasing. In 2019, a dramatic shift began to occur as thousands of solar companies began advertising on Facebook in all of the same markets.
Solar firms in California, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona were all directly competing to get leads on Facebook. The cost per acquisition began to steadily increase and at any given time there could be up to 150,000 solar ads competing for the same client base. In addition, Facebook began to increase their prices.
You might have found some success by following a marketing plan founded in Facebook advertising, but we aren’t here to discuss staying stagnant. You are looking to expand your business, and to do so you need to think outside the box. That’s exactly what we did, and our own solar company made the switch to YouTube. Our retention rate grew from 35% to 93%.
We switched our solar marketing clients over to YouTube as well, where their businesses began to grow while other companies were still relying on Facebook for cheap clickbait.
But why exactly is YouTube so successful for solar marketers?
The platform has more than 1.9 billion monthly users, and those considering solar projects are turning to YouTube for research. YouTube ads create an optimal balance for high-quality leads and appointments at cost-effective price points. When we switched our marketing clients, we began to see lead costs similar to five years ago because the majority of solar companies are not marketing their brand on YouTube.
YouTube is your chance to make your business stand out. The digital market is flooded with many solar companies in any given market, but few are taking the time to educate their consumer base on the ins and outs of solar energy.
Separate yourself from the competition, whose only concern seems to be catching the eye with gimmicks and slogans, by explaining the value of investing in solar. In doing so, you will find high-quality clients ready and capable of spending money. This results in your business growing and profit margin increasing.
A few points that you may want to address with potential customers through your videos include:
There are numerous topics within those categories that provide a foundation for you to generate content. The possibilities are endless: financing options, how panels protect a roof, the effects of solar panels on a home’s value, or whatever your heart desires.
Don’t stop at just a few videos. Make use of YouTube to clearly communicate your expertise and stay on trend with a series of videos. Consumers are seeking bite-sized segments they can watch quickly and understand easily. Create videos separately in subcategories that keep viewers engaged and wanting more.
A series of videos also will help your company take advantage of how YouTube works. Its recommendation algorithms are set up to promote your other videos after a viewer has watched the first one. By creating a series of videos, you are more likely to hold the attention of the viewer once they discover your first video.
After creating captivating and educational content, you are ready to start driving highly qualified clients to your social media and website. Making use of all platforms is important, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google listings, a website, e-mail, blog, and even podcasts.
Ask your audience to continue interacting with your video channel, otherwise known as a call to action.

However, it is important to take it a step further and ask your audience to continue interacting with your video channel, otherwise known as a call to action.
There are several ways you can do this, from asking your audience to click on your video to suggesting they post any comments or questions they may have. Other calls to action may include:
It is hard to know which call to action will work best until you give a few of them a try.
Investing in the right marketing plan can pay dividends in the long run. Marketing is the key to every successful brand, business, and organization. If done correctly, it addresses the value of your product in a compelling way. And educating your clients on the benefits of solar energy through YouTube offers a great base for a valuable solar marketing plan.
The time is ripe for those of us in solar energy to break away from door-to-door marketing and embrace YouTube strategies. Before you know it, your business will be thriving through high-quality leads that result in growth for your company.
Rich Feola is the Founder of  Solar Exclusive, an 8-figure advertising company that generates unique, qualified leads and appointments for solar companies primarily from YouTube and Google. Solar Exclusive works with solar companies in over 39 states. His work has been featured in Digital Journal, Yahoo Finance, NBC, and Fox, among other outlets.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/26/sunrise-brief-doe-sets-a-goal-to-cut-solar-costs-by-60-in-10-years/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 26, 2021",Sunrise brief: DOE sets a goal to cut solar costs by 60% in 10 years,"The U.S. Department of Energy announced a goal to cut the cost of solar energy by 60% within the next 10 years. It also announced nearly $128 million in funding to lower costs, improve performance, and speed the deployment of solar energy technologies.
Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said that solar is already cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels in many parts of the country. “With more innovation we can cut the cost again by more than half within the decade.”
DOE set a new goal of cutting the current cost of 4.6 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to 3 cents/kWh by 2025 and 2 cents/kWh by 2030. DOE said that by 2035, solar PV could represent between 30% and 50% of electricity supply.

The $128 million funding initiatives are through DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) and aim to support advancements in perovskites and cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin films. The awards include:
$40 million for perovskite R&D: Perovskites are a family of emerging solar materials that have potential to make highly efficient thin-film solar cells with low production costs. DOE awarded $40 million to 22 projects that will advance perovskite PV device and manufacturing research and development as well as performance.

Projects that received funding included $2 million for work to design and prototype 1-meter by 2-meter tandem perovskite modules and investigate encapsulation and backsheets to enhance module durability in the field, and $500,000 to develop a new low-bandgap perovskite for perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells. A full list of funded projects is here.
$3 million Perovskite Startup Prize: This new prize competition is intended to speed entrepreneurs’ path to commercializing perovskite technologies by providing seed capital for newly formed companies.
$20 million for CdTe thin films: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will set up a consortium to advance less expensive CdTe thin-film solar technologies. The goal is to advance low-cost manufacturing techniques and domestic research to increase opportunities for U.S. firms to capture a larger portion of the $60 billion global solar manufacturing sector.

In addition, DOE announced $7 million for projects to increase the lifetime of silicon-based PV systems from about 30 years to 50 years to lower the cost of energy and reduce waste. The aim is to improve PV system components, such as inverters, connectors, cables, racks, and trackers.
The announcement also supports several concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP) projects.
$33 million for CSP advances: The new funding includes funding for improvements to the reliability and performance of CSP plants, which can dispatch solar energy whenever it is needed; identifies new solar applications for industrial processes, which contribute 20% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions; and advances long-duration thermal-energy storage devices. DOE said that long-duration energy storage is critical to decarbonizing the electricity sector and couples well with CSP plants, but the cost must fall by a factor of two to unlock deployment.
$25 million to demonstrate a next-generation CSP power plant: Sandia National Laboratories will receive funding to build a facility where researchers, developers, and manufacturers can test next-generation CSP components and systems and advance toward DOE’s 2030 cost target of 5 cents/kWh for CSP plants.
Sandia also received $9 million as part of funding to establish a testing center to validate the performance of new perovskite devices.  The New Mexico-based lab will join with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in setting up the lab. NREL received $5 million in funding for its role in the initiative.
The center will be responsible for the following:
