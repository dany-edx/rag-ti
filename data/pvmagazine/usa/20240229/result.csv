The move continues a company-wide retreat from renewables investment under chief executive officer Wael Sawan.
Investment bank Jefferies is operating the sale of up to 10.6 GW of solar and energy storage assets currently in development. Reuters said it gleaned this information from a document it received that was sent to potential investors.
Savion is developing over 39 GW of solar and energy storage projects and has more than 2.3 GW of operational assets. The company was acquired by Shell in late 2021.
Shell in October 2021 announced it wants to halve its CO2 emissions – compared to its 2016 performance – this decade, including the removal of emissions from all its owned or controlled assets and from electricity it purchases.
However, this June, Sawan said the company will focus on selling and trading “low-carbon power” rather than owning generation assets, which may offer a lower rate of return. Reuters said Shell now focuses on higher-margin projects, oil output and boosting natural gas production.
Shell recently underwent staff reductions, including in its low-carbon solutions division, to save up to $3 billion.
In September 2023, Shell announced it would place PV home storage provider Sonnen for sale. Shell acquired Sonnen in 2019 for €500 million ($536.8 million). In September, German news outlet Handelsblatt values Sonnen at €1.35 billion to €1.8 billion ($1.45 billion to $1.94 billion).

Researchers from the University of Toledo in the United States have developed a flexible cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cell based on an indium gallium oxide (IGO) emitter layer and a cadmium stannate (CTO) transparent conductor as the front electrode.
“A sputtered cadmium selenide (CdSe) layer was employed to incorporate Se into a CdTe absorber that was deposited by close-space sublimation, and copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) was used as a hole transport layer between the CdTe and the back metal electrode,” the research’s corresponding author, Manoj Kumar Jamarkattel, told pv magazine. “This device configuration offers great promise for building integrated photovoltaics, space applications, and higher-rate manufacturing.”
The scientists built the cell with a superstrate based on Corning Willow Glass, which is a flexible, ultra-thin glass manufactured by multinational technology company Corning with its own proprietary fusion draw process. They produced the CTO transparent conductor by sputtering in conjunction with a proximity anneal with CdS. The front buffer layer was comprised of an IGO alloy, prepared by co-sputtering.
Furthermore, they prepared the cell absorber by first depositing CdSe by sputtering followed by CdTe deposited by close-space sublimation. CuSCN was used as a Cu doping source and a hole-transporting back-buffer layer. The cell also relies and a gold (Au) metal contact and an anti-reflecting (AR) coating.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 861 mV, a short-circuit density of 27.8 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 71.7%. Under air mass zero (AM0) illumination for space applications, these values dropped to 14.6%, 861 mV, 32.3 mA/cm2, and 71.2% respectively.
“We used IGO and CuSCN as front emitter and back contact buffer, respectively,” the scientists explained. “This helped to further improve the open-circuit voltage. IGO has favorable band alignment with the absorber, which minimizes carrier recombination at the front, and CuSCN helps to minimize recombination at the back interface.”
The research group added the cell achieved the highest reported device efficiency for flexible CdTe solar cells to date.
The device was presented in the paper “17.2% Efficient CdSexTe1−x solar cell with (InxGa1−x)2O3 emitter on lightweight and flexible glass,” published in Applied Physics Letters.
The University of Toledo developed several types of CdTe solar cells over the past years. The devices include, among others, a 20%-efficient cell based on a commercial tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer and a 17.4%-efficient device using a layer of copper-aluminum oxide to the rear side of the CdTe thin film.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/29/solar-generated-5-5-of-u-s-electricity-in-2023-a-17-5-increase/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-02-29,"Solar generated 5.5% of U.S. electricity in 2023, a 17.5% increase","In 2023, solar photovoltaics accounted for 5.5% of total U.S. electricity generation, which amounted to 4,251 TWh. Utility-scale solar (1 MWac and larger) contributed 3.8% to the total electricity generation, while the remaining 1.7% was generated by small-scale solar. Overall, solar’s share of total generation increased by 17.5% from 2022’s 4.7%.
However, the growth rate of solar power declined somewhat over the previous year. In 2022, solar output increased by 40.6 TWh, while in 2023, it increased by only 33.2 TWh, even less than the 33.9 TWh increase in 2021.

The growth in 2023 was primarily based on the 20.2 GW of solar capacity deployed in 2022, which was a decrease from the 23.6 GW deployed in 2021. The slowdown in 2022 can be attributed to various factors affecting the supply chain, including COVID-19, fluctuations in module demand and polysilicon availability, and discussions around U.S. import tariffs.
With an expected deployment of 35 GW in 2023, a nearly 25% increase in total capacity, the share of solar in the generation mix is also expected to grow by about 25%.
If electricity demand remains flat in 2024, and growth is 25%, then solar could account for 6.7% of all electricity generated this year.
With a record 53 GWdc of new capacity expected to be deployed in 2024, growing the nation’s physical solar fleet by over 30%, solar could reach 8.4% of all electricity generated in 2025. This means solar is on track to generate more than 10% of all electricity in 2026.

The data was released by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) in their Electric Power Monthly report for December. PV Intel processed the data, and supplied it to pv magazine USA via its 50 States of Solar series.
For the year, solar’s monthly share of electricity ranged from a peak of 7.2% in May to a low of 3.4% in January. Solar thermal electricity contributed 0.07% of all electricity generated, showing a slight decrease.
The EIA reported that total electricity demand for the year decreased by just under 1% from 2022’s 4,291 TWh generation. This year’s total generation is the second highest ever recorded in the U.S., second only to 2022.
Emission-free electricity, which includes nuclear, wind, hydroelectric, solar PV, geothermal, and solar thermal, met 39.9% of all U.S. electricity demand for the year. Nuclear accounted for 18.2%, wind for 10%, hydroelectricity for 5.6%, geothermal for 0.4%, and solar thermal for 0.07%. Hydroelectricity continued its decline from a recent high of 7.4% in 2017.
April saw the highest monthly share of emission-free electricity for the year at just over 45%, although it was slightly lower than the previous April. On April 2, at 1 p.m., according to the EIA’s Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, the lower 48 states reached 56.3% of their power grids being driven by emission-free sources.
Wind and solar together met 15.5% of all generation over the last twelve months, a 4.7% increase from 2022. All of this growth came from solar power, as wind power actually decreased in 2023. The peak month for wind and solar was April, coinciding with the peak month of emission-free electricity.

The highest absolute generation month for solar is generally July, while wind peaks in March or April. The wind and solar values peak in the “shoulder seasons” of spring and fall, during periods of lower electricity demand.
The EIA also released its final power plant map and count for 2023. In total, the EIA tracked 6,197 solar power photovoltaic plants in the nation at the end of year, out of 25,889 total power plants. The Solar Energy Industries of America suggests we’re nearly at, and potentially have already surpassed, 4 million total solar power plants, including all small-scale residential and commercial facilities.
Of the solar facilities tracked by the EIA, the total capacity reached 89,451 GWac as of the end of 2023. In 2023 alone, 399 facilities with a combined capacity of 17.675 GWac were brought online. Among these, the largest were the 500 MWac Aktina Solar and Roseland Solar Project, constructed by Hecate and Enel, respectively, in Texas.
In fact, four of the top five largest new solar power plants built in the U.S. in 2023 were located in Texas.

At the state level, California was the national leader, generating 27% of their electricity from solar. Nevada and Massachusetts followed closely, each producing over 20% of their electricity from solar. Notably, in Massachusetts, more than 15% of its electricity came specifically from small-scale solar. Other states, including Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, and even Washington D.C., also made significant contributions, with each generating nearly or just above 10% of their electricity from small-scale solar.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/29/calculating-potential-impact-of-epas-7-billion-solar-for-all-program/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-29,Calculating potential impact of EPA’s $7 billion Solar for All program,"Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA) published a report summarizing trends and calculating the potential impact of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar for All competition.
Solar for All is a funding opportunity announced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in June 2023. The goal of the program is to enable millions of low-income households access to affordable, resilient, and clean solar energy. The program was intended to up to 60 grants to states, territories, tribal governments, municipalities and nonprofits, and the CESA report looks at the range of proposals submitted for awards.
The CESA report, Empowering Tomorrow: A Preview of States’ Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Solar for All Programs, looks at 35 Solar for All applications submitted in 33 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The overall finding is that if all 35 of the applications were funded, the projects would deploy 2.9 GW of solar capacity, providing $2 billion in savings for 711,068 low-income households over the next five years.
“The Solar for All competition represents an investment in solar for disadvantaged communities, the scope and scale of which has not been seen before,” explains CESA Senior Project Director Vero Bourg-Meyer. “For some states, this is an acceleration of work they have supported, with much more modest resources and variable levels of success, for years. For others, it is an entirely new endeavor, now enabled by the IRA.”
The deadline for receipt of applications was October 12, 2023. The EPA plans to notify applicants of its decisions in March 2024. Once award decisions are announced, award recipients and the EPA will negotiate cooperative agreements, with the EPA making final awards in July 2024. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) requires that all funds are awarded by September 30, 2024.
EPA restricted the maximum amount of funding that applicants could request, based on the total population of disadvantaged census tracts identified by the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST).

Of the 35 states included in the report, two were eligible for a large program (>$250M to $400M), 16 were eligible for a medium program (>$100M to $250M), and 17 were eligible for a small program ($25M and up to $100M). All but nine states requested the maximum amount of funding available in the size category.

The types of solar in the applications includes community, single-family residential, multi-family residential and other. Not all applications indicated the planned capacity, but of those that did, the report estimates that 63% of applications are for community solar, which would total about 1.75 GW of new capacity. An estimated 20% applied for single-family residential, for approximately 575 MW of new capacity. About 17% applied for multi-family residential, for an estimated 479 MW.
With an estimated 6.2 GW of community solar installed across the United States the nation as of Q4 2023 according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the country has a long way to go toward achieving the Department of Energy’s target of 20 GW installed. The 1.75 GW of new community solar capacity proposed in applications for Solar for All state programs would help to move the needle toward the goal, while also supporting low- to middle-income (LMI) and disadvantaged communities (DAC).
Among the states that applied, all but five intend to add battery storage amounting to 1.2 GWh across all programs. While not a primary goal of the Solar for All program, the CESA report notes that this amount of storage that would serve DACs and low-income households over the next five years is significant.
Five key takeaways from the CESA report include:
The CESA report points out that the Solar for All program aims to address known market barriers to transforming state markets for LMI customers. CESA sees the program as “an incredible opportunity for states to collaborate, exchange and grow markets together, faster than they would on their own, building economic opportunity, alleviating poverty, and working to meet their clean energy goals”.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/29/mit-research-provides-roadmap-to-perovskite-passivation/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-29,MIT research provides roadmap to perovskite passivation,"With perovskite efficiency at converting sunlight to electricity edging up on that of silicon, the main challenges now are optimizing that efficiency and controlling degradation. A team of researchers at MIT in Cambridge, Mass. reveal a new way to engineer perovskites on the nanoscale.
The work is described in a paper published in Nature Energy by Dane deQuilettes, a recent MIT postdoc who is now co-founder and chief science officer of the MIT spinout Optigon, along with MIT professors Vladimir Bulovic and Moungi Bawendi, and 10 others at MIT and in Washington state, the U.K., and Korea.
The researchers describe their unique combination of nanoscale characterization techniques that enabled them to find a tunable passivation strategy in perovskite solar devices. They report that by using these techniques they were the first to reach the >25% PCE milestone.
The researchers explained that treatment with hexylammonium bromide forms an iodide-rich 2D layer along with a Br halide gradient that extends from defective surfaces and grain boundaries into the bulk three-dimensional layer. They report that the interface can be optimized to extend the charge carrier lifetime to record values >30 μs and to reduce interfacial recombination velocities to values as low as <7 cm s−1.
“Ten years ago, if you had asked us what would be the ultimate solution to the rapid development of solar technologies, the answer would have been something that works as well as silicon but whose manufacturing is much simpler,” Bulovic says. “And before we knew it, the field of perovskite photovoltaics appeared. They were as efficient as silicon, and they were as easy to paint on as it is to paint on a piece of paper. The result was tremendous excitement in the field.”
Nonetheless, “there are some significant technical challenges of handling and managing this material in ways we’ve never done before,” he said. These challenges are what has driven researchers to study perovskites, and this work shows how to passivate the material’s surface so that the perovskite no longer degrades so rapidly or loses efficiency.
In previous work, research teams developed methods for passivation, but there wasn’t clear understanding of how the process works. The new MIT study provides a clearer roadmap. The team observed the interfaces between the perovskite layer and other materials, and how they develop, which resulted in “the clearest roadmap as of yet of what we can do to fine-tune the energy alignment at the interfaces of perovskites and neighboring materials,” and thus improve their overall performance, Bulovic says.
“The key is identifying the chemistry of the interfaces, the place where the perovskite meets other materials,” Bulovic says, referring to the places where different materials are stacked next to perovskite in order to facilitate the flow of current through the device.
The new study “addressed the ability to passivate those interfaces and elucidate the physics and science behind why this passivation works as well as it does,” Bulovic says.
“This paper is essentially revealing a guidebook for how to tune surfaces, where a lot of these defects are, to make sure that energy is not lost at surfaces,” deQuilettes says. “It’s a really big discovery for the field,” he says. “This is the first paper that demonstrates how to systematically control and engineer surface fields in perovskites.”
The new work builds on a common passivation method developed at MIT, which led to new world-record efficiencies. The recent efficiency records for a single perovskite layer range from about 24% to 26%, while the maximum theoretical efficiency that could be reached is about 30%, according to deQuilettes.
An increase of a few percent may not sound like much, but in the solar industry incremental advances are important.
“In the silicon photovoltaic industry, if you’re gaining half of a percent in efficiency, that’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars on the global market,” he said.

Worksport, a Canadian company with manufacturing in New York and China, announced a protective solar cover and kit for pickup trucks. The kit includes a battery and an inverter and is meant to be a portable power source for leisure activities, such as camping, or as a temporary backup to recharge electronics or small appliances during power outages.
Conceived for vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV), the solar tonneau cover, Solis, will be sold in a kit with a Worksport inverter, Hub, and a 2000 W, 120 V AC 60 Hz rechargeable battery, dubbed Cor.
The kit is intended as an off-grid energy solution for consumers. “We will begin sales with the North American market and will eventually expand to global markets,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The initial Solis truck bed cover is designed for the Ford-F150 Lightning. The solar modules contain M10 cells with 22% efficiency provided by an undisclosed supplier. “We will use flexible mono-crystalline cells that provide 170 W/m2, after conversion. The weight will be between 10 kg and 11 kg per m2,” they added. The performance figures are considered under 1000 W/m² solar irradiance.

The company will be marketing the product in a kit that includes truckbed mounting brackets and cables.
The battery is a 2000 W, unit with 1534 kWh, 120 V AC, 60 Hz capacity. It has a lithium nickel, cobalt and manganese (Li-NCM) battery cell. The rated voltage is 48 V and the minimum voltage is 40.3 V. The battery’s maximum discharge current is 60 A, and the maximum charge current is 20 A. The discharge temperature is -20 C to 65 C while the battery charging temperature range is 0 C to 55 C.
The inverter unit has an output frequency of 60 Hz, and maximum output power of 3 kW. It has a 200 Wh hot swap capacity, overload protection, 4 DC outlets, plus ports for USB and cigarette lighter connector charging.
Solis is not yet available for purchase. Worksport said in a statement that products are in the testing phase. The final prices are not confirmed. Estimated price for the battery is $1,499, including the inverter, one external battery, and charging cables. Bundled with Solis, the price is estimated to be $3,499.
Some of the scenarios seen by Worksport besides camping, include charging devices, such as cellphones, tablets, or other electronics, during power outages in the home or office. It is not meant for charging electric vehicle (EV) charging systems. The company said it may develop such technology in the future as its internal estimates suggested that the PV cover could provide enough charging to provide a potential additional range of up to 10 miles a day.
The solar cover will also be available on standard internal combustion engine trucks, according to the company.

Project developers are awaiting interconnection studies to identify the transmission facility upgrades needed for their respective projects, so they may sign interconnection agreements for construction of the upgrades.
“As is widely recognized, and this scorecard confirms, the progress towards completing those interconnections is slow and puts system reliability at risk,” says the report, published by the trade group Advanced Energy United, which backs carbon-free electricity.
Grades were based on a survey of interconnection customers and analysis of the recent results of each grid operator’s interconnection process.
The ERCOT grid operator in Texas has a “relatively fast and consistent interconnection process, with reasonable costs,” says the report, while noting “challenges” to transmission network upgrade construction that can “slow the process towards the end and result in curtailment of projects that do get built.”
ERCOT uses a “connect and manage” approach to generator interconnection, which a former Cypress Creek Renewables executive has reasoned could also be used in the rest of the U.S.
Executives from Clearway Energy Group and Enel North America have called for combining the connect-and-manage approach with comprehensive regional transmission planning to efficiently interconnect large-scale renewables and storage.
California’s grid operator CAISO “also had a relatively fast and consistent process” for projects submitted before 2020, but since then, CAISO’s process has been “unable to efficiently process applications” due to the large increase in the number of new generator interconnection applications, the report says.
ERCOT and CAISO completed interconnection agreements for more capacity of new generators by the end of 2022 for applications submitted in 2018-2022 than the other five grid regions, as shown in the nearby graph. The graph provides an apples-to-apples comparison because it shows the interconnection agreement capacity executed in each region as a percentage of system peak load.

Most of the grid operators “are undergoing significant efforts” to reform their interconnection practices and policies, the report says, “in response to stakeholder concerns and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 2023.”
While the report used generator interconnection process results as the primary scoring factor, the grades were also based on five other factors:
The report, titled Generator Interconnection Scorecard, is the first-ever attempt to evaluate the grid operators, and may be repeated in future years to assess their progress, the authors said.
