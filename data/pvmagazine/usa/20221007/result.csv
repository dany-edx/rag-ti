In addition to generation, such hybrid projects facilitate energy shifting applications with rising renewable capacity and changing energy consumption patterns creating opportunities for price arbitrage, allowing developers to shift dispatch to times of higher prices and firming-up capacity commitments sold to the grid.
During the 2021 winter storms, electricity prices in Texas spiked to approximately 300x the median price for 96 consecutive hours, as severe weather and cold temperatures led to restricted access to gas fuel and unavailability of certain conventional and renewable energy sources. For some organizations this resulted in utility bills equivalent to months or years of normal electricity statements in just one month.
Even for companies and organizations with onsite generation assets such as stand-alone solar PV the impacts would have been similar. When combined with on-site generation assets, battery storage systems can be used to ride out the worst of the price volatility – discharging during high prices and absorbing excess energy from generation.
For utility-scale developments, in addition to improving grid flexibility and reliability, co-location can unlock greater value as higher volumes of zero marginal cost renewables are connected to the grid, allowing developers some mitigation of periods of zero or negative prices, depending on the market.
But co-location, either in front or behind the meter, is not the simple proposition it first seems. To successfully unlock the value of both assets requires analysis, interpretation and forecasting of a series of different metrics including utility rates, wholesale energy prices, weather and climate data, site consumption and generation and state of charge and state of health of the battery.
There are a range of grid-balancing services that provide opportunities to earn revenue by supplying stored energy to grid operators. There are also opportunities in some markets to trade energy from battery storage on the wholesale market to capitalize on fluctuating prices. But with multiple markets on which to trade, the investment landscape for battery storage is a complex arena.
Most battery storage owners and operators already know that value stacking is the key to profitability. Batteries are expensive assets, but they can recoup their costs in more ways than one – and using a battery system for multiple applications can greatly improve the asset’s return on investment. Dispatching batteries and then charging them to provide multiple, stacked services creates additional value for all electricity system stakeholders.
With appropriate valuation of those services, such battery business models can also provide net benefit to the system while unlocking multiple revenue streams for the asset owner through the provision of a range of services. But the combined profit potential from participating in ancillary service programs, demand response, or wholesale markets and the non-monetary value in providing backup power also need to be carefully weighed.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/07/proposed-fema-building-code-may-hamper-solar-deployment/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 7, 2022",Proposed FEMA building code may hamper solar deployment,"In its 2024 International Building Code, FEMA has proposed to raise the “structural risk” ranking of solar to the maximum level. This would place ground mounted solar arrays and energy storage on par with hospitals and fire stations in terms of structural building requirements for natural disaster resilience.
While increased structural resilience requirements might seem like a positive, solar industry proponents say the proposal is an “overreach” that could slow solar deployment.
“There is no extended record of irreparable damage to solar arrays from higher seismic, wind or snow loads, and there is no justification for these overly burdensome codes,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Solar projects are currently permitted and inspected through local building departments through International Building Code. There are already strict requirements in place for solar panels to resist high winds and snow loads, said Ross Hopper. SEIA said the proposal’s requirements are both poorly defined and technically unworkable.
Today, about 95% of solar projects are ranked risk category 1, and this proposal would bring it to risk category 4, placing a burden of increased costs on project construction. SEIA said this damage to project economics would lead to a slowing of solar deployment, which in turn would weaken the grid, thereby accomplishing the opposite of FEMA’s S76-22 proposal. Additionally, increased demand for steel and concrete to reinforce impacted equipment can lead to higher embedded carbon in projects and supply chain issues, said SEIA.
Solar recently took the national spotlight, proving its resilience in the face of extreme weather. Recently, a 100% solar community in Florida suffered no power losses when Hurricane Ian made landfall. Just 12 miles from Fort Meyers, Babcock Ranch was built with climate resiliency in mind.
A 75 MW solar facility powers the planned community, with 700,000 panels delivering clean energy to its residents. It is connected by a small distribution system of wires buried beneath the ground, thereby avoiding outages from downed wires. CNN reports the 2,000 home community experienced no loss of power throughout the storm, despite the town suffering uprooted trees and downed structures.
“It’s a great case study to show that it can be done right, if you build in the right place and do it the right way,” said Lisa Hall, a spokesperson for the founder of Babcock Ranch.
Over 200 of America’s leading clean energy developers have signed a letter requesting the International Code Council’s voting members to reject the proposal and approve a set of compromise solutions — S79-22 and S81-22. The alternative proposal would elevate solar to risk category 2, raising it one rank instead of maximizing it.
“S76-22 attempts to respond to symptoms of climate change, but harms efforts to establish a clean energy economy to counteract the causes of climate change,” said SEIA.

FirstLight Power signed the agreement with Energy New England (ENE) for more than 100 GWh of hydroelectric power produced by Shepaug Generating Station in Southbury, Conn. and Stevenson Generating Station in Monroe, Conn.
“We are pleased to build on our successful collaboration with Energy New England by expanding our power purchase agreements with Massachusetts municipal utilities. These thirteen communities are showing tremendous climate leadership by choosing locally produced, cost-competitive, and clean hydropower to advance their own clean energy goals,” said Alicia Barton, president and CEO of FirstLight Power. “Long-term clean power commitments such as these agreements not only bolster our region’s ability to decarbonize the electric grid, but they also lock in affordable energy supply for Massachusetts homes and businesses at a time when fossil fuel prices are driving customer bills up.”
FirstLight Power is a clean power producer, developer, and energy storage company with a portfolio that includes over 1.4 GW of operating renewable energy that include hybrid solutions that pair hydroelectric, pumped-hydro storage, utility-scale solar, large-scale battery, and offshore wind assets. Headquartered in Burlington, Mass., FirstLight is a steward of more than 14,000 acres and hundreds of miles of shoreline along rivers and lakes in the Northeast.
ENE is a wholesale risk management and energy trading organization that serves the needs of municipal utilities in New England. ENE reports that it helps promote the principles of conservation, efficiency, and environmental stewardship, and offers sustainability planning including home energy audit programs, electric vehicle programs, wholesale energy procurement and risk management programs, regulatory and lobbying services.
This is the second such PPA between First Light and ENE, bringing the total number of municipal utilities served to 34. Working in collaboration with ENE, the new power purchase agreement will run from 2024 through 2030.
“We are excited to expand our collaboration with FirstLight Power, and we are incredibly proud that our members continue to lead the way by aggressively procuring new sources of clean energy to meet Massachusetts’ 2030 requirements for municipal utilities,” said John Tzimorangas, president and CEO of Energy New England. “Not only have our members made major strides in meeting the state’s goals; they have also shown that these long-term procurements help deliver safe, reliable, and cost-competitive electricity to ratepayers across the Commonwealth.”
The public power entities participating in the most recent PPA include: Belmont Municipal Light Department, Braintree Electric Light Department, Concord Municipal Light Plant, Danvers Electric Division, Groveland Municipal Light Department, Hingham Municipal Lighting Plant, Mass Development Finance Agency (MDFA)/Devens Utilities, Merrimac Municipal Light Department, Norwood Municipal Light Department, Reading Municipal Light Department, Rowley Municipal Lighting Plant, Wellesley Municipal Light Plant, and Westfield Gas & Electric.

TC Energy is investing $146 million in the project, which is planned to be large enough to power the equivalent of 20,000 homes annually.
The facility is designed with bifacial solar panels, which are advantageous in snowy regions that have high ground albedo (reflectivity). The system will also incorporate a Lockheed Martin GridStar Flow energy storage system. The redox flow battery has an output capacity of up to 6.5 MW and duration of up to eight hours.
TC Energy said it has obtained all necessary regulatory approvals and permits to commence. Construction is expected to be completed in 2023. During the construction phase, about 140 workers are expected to support the project, and, once in operation, two full-time TC Energy employees will work at the facility.
The solar and storage project is supported in part by $10 million from Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA). Since 2009, ERA has committed $830 million to 230 projects worth over $6.6 billion. ERA acts on climate change and supports economic growth by investing in the pilot, demonstration and deployment of clean technology solutions that reduce emissions, lower costs, attract investment, and create jobs in Alberta.
“The High River Chamber is excited to see the introduction of diversified energy solutions to our area and the potential for stronger business relationships, contract opportunities and employment possibilities,” said Lisa Szabon-Smith, executive director of High River & District Chamber of Commerce. “To see the Saddlebrook area become the home of such a project is exciting for our community.”
The company has acquired more than 400 MW of renewable power purchase agreements in Alberta in the past two years. In April, TC Energy announced plans to explore development of a 60-tonnes-per-day hydrogen production hub near Crossfield, Alberta. The company employs over 7,000 people working in renewables, natural gas, hydrogen, and carbon capture.
“This investment bolsters our ability to deliver low-carbon solutions for our customers and underscores our commitment to add renewable energy to the local electricity grid,” said Corey Hessen, an executive at TC Energy.

The notices are a first step in the formal process of implementing the landmark legislation, which $370 billion for support of a renewable energy buildout and climate resilience. The spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes on ultra-wealthy Americans and corporations, and it is intended to put the U.S. within reach of President Biden’s climate goals.
Nearly three-quarters of the Inflation Reduction Act’s climate change investment – $270 billion – is delivered through tax incentives, putting Treasury at the forefront of this critical legislation.
“The Inflation Reduction Act tackles the climate crisis head on and strengthens President Biden’s historic effort to incentivize the energy sector to drive investment and dynamic economic growth while lowering costs for American families,” said Janet L. Yellen, secretary of the Treasury. “The Treasury Department stands ready to meet the responsibility that comes with implementing this legislation and looks forward to engaging with stakeholders and the public who will benefit from the law’s provisions.”
The public will have further opportunities to provide input as the implementation process unfolds, but the notices provide an early way for stakeholders to submit information that can help inform Treasury and the IRS’s work.  Soliciting extra input at this early stage will help accelerate the process of providing clarity and certainty to taxpayers. In implementing the historic climate and clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, Treasury will be guided by three core principles:
Treasury has released a fact sheet that includes additional information about the Notices and Treasury and the IRS’s implementation process. Those interested in commenting should reply as soon as possible, ideally by November 4, 2022.
