from the magazine
The old adage “one man’s trash is another’s treasure” is being applied to brownfield and landfill sites across the United States as PV projects and electric vehicle charging hubs are beginning to top sites that were once deemed irremediable.
A study by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in 2021 showed that landfills in the United States could host more than 63 GW of solar capacity, generating 83 TWh of electricity each year. This would equate to $6.6 billion in annual electricity revenues, according to RMI. There are more than 10,000 closed and inactive landfills across the nation. These sites often offer good sun exposure and little opportunity for other uses. Moreover, landfills and other hazardous sites are often located in Environmental Justice communities – low-income areas disproportionately affected by pollutants and other negative externalities from industry.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) aids the redevelopment of “superfund” sites, plots of land that were contaminated and are repurposed for productive means. As of the end of last year, the EPA reported 106 completed superfund projects, combining for a sizeable 512 MW of generation capacity. Solar makes up most of the portfolio, contributing 372 MW across 86 projects. Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are home to 73% of US utility-scale landfill solar projects. Approximately 60% of the sites to receive funding for new cleanup projects are in historically under-served communities, according to the EPA.
The federal agency has evaluated the revitalization potential more than 190,000 formerly contaminated lands, landfill sites, and mine areas covering nearly 44 million acres across the United States. These sites are included in the EPA’s RE-Powering Mapper, which locates such areas and provides information about them, and their potential for supporting renewable energy generation.
Phoenix rising
FirstEnergy Corp, a utility serving West Virginia in the heart of US coal country, has announced it will permanently retire a coal ash facility. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, a solar project will take its place. The utility is planning a 6 MW site as part of a larger, 50 MW solar portfolio.Coal ash, the byproduct of burning coal for electricity, is the second largest waste stream in the US, behind household trash. It contains toxic substances including arsenic and lead and is generally buried in a processing landfill. The FirstEnergy facility had been using the ash to produce cement and the utility buried toxic materials in a landfill.
The US Inflation Reduction Act, which sets aside $369 billion for climate and energy spending, targets environmental justice communities as an important focus for the energy transition. Included in the act is a $27 billion clean energy technology accelerator program that will support the deployment of technology to reduce emissions in disadvantaged communities. Funded at $3 billion, Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants are allocated for investment in community-led projects that address disproportionate environmental and public health harms related to pollution and climate change. A further $3 billion will be used to fund Neighborhood Access and Equity Grants. The awards are designed to support neighborhood equity, safety, and affordable transportation access. Four competitive grants aim to reconnect communities divided by existing infrastructure barriers. These will seek to mitigate the negative impacts of transportation facilities or construction projects on disadvantaged or under-served communities, support equitable transportation planning and community engagement activities.
FirstEnergy subsidiary Mon Power will construct the solar project on the 27-acre site and another solar farm will be installed on a 44-acre reclaimed coal strip mine property. Mon Power and utility Potomac Edison are accepting applications to subscribe to a utility-run community solar program. The scheme would enable customers to purchase renewable energy credits representing the production of the solar facilities. The credits are then used to offset utility bill costs.
East Bay Community Energy (EBCE) is a California Bay Area not-for-profit public agency that procures renewable energy to be delivered, via utility Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E) lines, as a “community choice energy service.” The group was awarded an EPA National Notable Achievement Award last year for going beyond power procurement and performing a successful pilot demonstration of the revitalization of brownfield sites as EV charging hubs.
In May 2021, East Bay Community Energy was awarded a $300,000 grant by the EPA to develop an inventory of brownfield sites throughout its service area that could be a good fit for redevelopment as fast charging hubs for light, medium, and heavy-duty electric vehicles.
The EPA’s Land Revitalization Program provided East Bay Community Energy with contractor technical assistance to help determine the environmental and economic feasibility of redeveloping brownfield sites along Interstate 880 into EBCE fast charging hubs. The analysis involved the development of a financial pro-forma model that anticipated redevelopment costs and benefits under best-, moderate- and worst-case scenarios.
Source: US Environmental Protection Agency.
The model evaluated environmental cleanup and EV equipment costs, station utilization rates, electricity pricing, low-carbon fuel credits, and options involving the co-location of solar panels and battery energy storage. The analysis outlined the key variables that EBCE needed to understand to make the fast-charging hubs viable.
The pro-forma analysis concluded that utilization rates of EV charging hubs are critical; the greater the utilization, the more financially viable an EV charging station will be. It also found that co-locating battery energy storage increases the community benefit of these sites and that engaging in time-dependent pricing can improve payback periods for these facilities.
“This project brings the potential for many local wins,” says Elisa Marquez, Hayward City Council member and a member of EBCE’s board of directors. “It addresses several dire environmental issues, including redeveloping contaminated brownfields, bringing economic prosperity to dormant urban land, and creating opportunities to expand the adoption of clean, electric transportation.”
Oil to solar
One success story shared by the EPA was that of the Pacific Coast Pipeline project in Fillmore, California. Since 1928, oil giant Texaco (now Chevron) has run a refinery at the site. Negligent disposal practices contaminated the soil and groundwater and Texaco closed the operation in 1950.
The EPA added the site to a national priority list of superfund locations in 1989. From 1992 to 2002, the EPA began revitalization efforts through a pump and treat process. Chevron dug up and disposed of 42,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and placed it in a capped area. By 2014, the EPA deemed the site to be ready for commercial and recreational use.
In 2016, developer Cenergy Power leased the site property and developed a 3 MW solar project. The 11,000-module facility began operations in September 2021, delivering electricity to Ventura County end-users.
The solar site reduces the county’s emissions by roughly 5% and is expected to save up to $4.5 million over its 25-year planned lifetime. “The solar field didn’t require any investment on the part of the county but will save the county approximately $100,000 per year while providing a significant portion of our electricity in the form of clean solar power,” said David Sasek, director of Ventura County General Services Agency. “This really was a win-win solution.”

The Enphase Energy Systems platform offers homeowners even greater power resilience than ever before. The company’s strategic relationship with Lumio will amplify the impact and distribution of Enphase Energy Systems, providing homeowners more access to reliable, sustainable, and grid-independent power sources.
Currently there are no sizing restrictions on pairing Enphase IQ Batteries with IQ8 Microinverters for homeowners who want battery backup. The Sunlight Jump Start feature can restart a home energy system—switching to sunlight-only after prolonged grid outages that may result in a fully depleted battery. This eliminates the need for a manual restart of the system and gives homeowners greater energy resilience.
Enphase IQ8 solar microinverters are built to last and come with a 25-year limited warranty.
“We are excited about Enphase’s full suite of products including microinverters, batteries, and EV chargers that can provide customers best-in-class home energy management solutions,” said Greg Butterfield, chief executive officer at Lumio. “Additionally, the Enphase digital platform from lead generation to permitting to ongoing operations and maintenance services offers a unique ability for Lumio to increase efficiencies and reduce costs.”
Lumio is a Lehi, Utah-based full-stack residential solar installation company founded in December 2020 by Greg Butterfield, former chief executive officer of Vivint Solar, a residential solar company acquired in 2020 by Sunrun.
In a recent Roth Capital Partners webinar, Enphase chief executive officer Badri Kothandaraman said the company will be adding four to six microinverter manufacturing lines in the U.S. this year. The new lines are expected to add between 4.8 GW to 7.2 GW of new capacity, producing up to 18 million microinverters annually. 
Kothandaraman said his firm believes it will be able to keep a majority of the $0.11 per Watt production tax credit (PTC) released under the Inflation Reduction Act, though uncertainty remains on how these credits will be paid out. He said that Enphase will not make a significant investment in U.S. manufacturing unless Enphase can secure a significant return on investment and retain 50% or more of the PTC value. 
Enphase said it plans to work with three contract manufacturers on the new capacity, two of which are current partners. Kothandaraman said his company will commit to at least three lines regardless of the PTC credit results to meet expected growth. 
Enphase expects steady growth in the U.S. residential sector, while the EU region has “hyper growth.” He expects that 2022 EU growth will more than double year-over-year, after already doubling in 2021. Roth Capital said there remains potential for another doubling in 2023, though Enphase’s management has set more conservative guidance. 
Enphase will be attending Intersolar North America and Energy Storage 2023, held Feb. 14 – 16 in Long Beach, Calif.
Q4 2022 Results
On February 7, Enphase reported Q4 2022 revenue of $724.7 million, a 14% increase over Q3 2022, shipping 4.87 million microinverters, or about 1.95 GW DC, and 122.1 MWh of Enphase IQ Batteries.
The company provided guidance of generating $700 million to $740 million of Q1 2023 revenue, which includes shipments of 100 to 120 MWh of IQ Batteries.
In addition to expanding capacity in the U.S., Enphase started manufacturing electric vehicle (EV) chargers at a contract manufacturing facility in Mexico. The company expects to introduce IQ smart EV chargers in the U.S. in the first half of 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/13/sunnova-to-incorporate-franklin-home-power-system-in-home-solution/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 13, 2023",Sunnova to incorporate Franklin Home Power system in home solution,"FranklinWH Energy Storage Inc., a specialist in whole-home energy management, announced an agreement with Sunnova Energy International, Inc., an Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) provider.
Sunnova will offer the Franklin Home Power system, an AC-coupled storage solution, as an option for the Sunnova Adaptive Home, which integrates the use of solar, battery storage, energy control and management technologies. The solution will be available to existing solar customers as well as to developers of new homes as a whole-home solution.
“FranklinWH and Sunnova offer consumers the ability to create an optimized ecosystem for their home with a platform that can seamlessly monitor and control energy from the grid, home solar and battery storage system, and generator power,” said Ke Bi, chief operating office at FranklinWH Energy Storage.
The Franklin Whole Home system debuted at Intersolar North America just over a year ago. The company is based in San Francisco, Calif. with the energy storage system manufactured in Shenzhen, China. The energy storage solution integrates a 13.6 kWh lithium iron phosphate “aPower” battery with adaptive learning, which is part of the included aGate smart control system. Franklin Whole Home reports that the battery is compatible with any PV inverter technology, and it can connect with existing solar systems while scaling up to 15 units for a total of 204 kWh of capacity. In the event of a power failure, its “black start” feature creates a micro-grid for the home.
“We see the FHP storage solution as a strong addition to our EaaS offerings, and one that in The FHP is an AC-coupled solution with lithium iron phosphate chemistry and can be applied with any solar inverter,” said Michael Grasso, executive vice president, chief marketing and growth officer, Sunnova Energy.
The Franklin Home Power (FHP) system to be offered by Sunnova comes with the aPower, which is the AC battery with a built-in advanced inverter, and the aGate, which is the energy management device that connects to the grid, home loads and the solar system. The storage solution provides self-consumption, time of use (TOU), and back-up modes for great flexibility for homeowners.
In September Sunnova announced that it had applied with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to develop a “micro-utility.” The company seeks to develop largely self-sustaining micro utilities by equipping new home communities with solar and storage. Newly constructed homes will be the focus so that Sunnova can work closely with developers to design and implement distributed solar microgrids backed with resilient energy storage.
Microgrids and the newly conceived micro utility are a new concept for the power grid, which recognizes the strengths of the input (solar energy), and helps to build the grid in a decentralized, distributed fashion.
FranklinWH Energy Storage is exhibiting at booth #723 at Intersolar North America and Energy Storage North America 2023, held Feb. 14 to 16 in Long Beach, Calif.

With the divisions present in U.S. politics, people were caught off guard in August 2022 when the largest piece of climate legislation in the nation’s history was signed into law by President Joe Biden. A culmination of the thwarted Build Back Better Act, which floundered thanks to opposition from the Democrat duo of Senator Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, and senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, the IRA proposes a $369 billion injection into the U.S. clean energy economy.
For the second time in the country’s clean power history – the first being the Obama administration’s extension of the solar investment tax credit (ITC) and wind production tax credit – the distributed generation market has a sense of permanence that has instilled hope and a long-term investment horizon.
“The sense was that energy storage is the industry that is going to finally take off this year,” says Andrew Tang, VP of energy storage and optimization for Finnish energy technology company Wärtsilä Energy. Voicing a common refrain, Tang adds, “Previously, the storage space was seen as the red-headed stepchild, next to the automotive EV [electric vehicle] space.” For much of the prior decade in the US, energy storage seemed to always lose out, whether for federal subsidy, investment, or a steady battery supply.
With 80% of batteries going into electric vehicles, it’s still hard to see how stationary energy storage development might escape its troubled past, but commercial and utility scale development is at a turning point. On top of the 30% standalone storage ITC, the IRA offers tax credit “adders” for projects in low-to-moderate income communities, including on tribal land, for projects featuring American components and labor, and for batteries installed into repurposed fossil fuel power plants.
Developers tell pv magazine USA if a Tribal authority deploys an American-assembled storage project in a microgrid, the total cost savings can reach 60% to 70%. That incentive is shared by developer, off-take counter party, investors, and battery and parts distributors.
The IRA’s energy community clause, offering a 10% ITC adder, provides a mechanism for deploying batteries at shuttered fossil fuel facilities, which require none of the additional costs of electricity transmission system upgrades that greenfield projects do. The clause gives the Department of Energy authority to extend $5 billion in credit subsidies to support $250 billion of loans to battery energy storage projects that “retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure,” such as decommissioned coal-fired power plants.

“All over the US there’s fossil fuel power plants near urban centers which have important capacity needs right now, to ensure the lights stay on,” says Jeff Bishop, CEO of Key Capture Energy, a grid-scale storage developer in Texas and New York. “I’m excited to read ESG [environmental, social, and corporate governance] reports of rapid coal retirements in the MISO region,” Bishop said of the large Midcontinent System Operator grid, which stretches from upper Minnesota to the Mississippi Delta of Louisiana.
After the Electric Reliability Council of Texas grid – which analyst Helen Kou of BloombergNEF expects to install 8.9 GW/35.6 GWh of storage through 2030 – the MISO grid is not far behind, with 1.7 GW/6.8 GWh anticipated. Historic coal areas such as the MISO and PJM Interconnection regions are forecast to install 1.7 GW and 2.1 GW/8.4 GWh, respectively, of storage capacity.
Key Capture has a joint venture agreement with independent power producer Talen Energy for a 20 MW battery at Talen’s 600 MW HA Wagner coal plant, in Baltimore. While Bishop is quick to admit the developer “starts small for projects,” the coal plant presents an expansion opportunity for Key Capture to deploy more batteries at the site, and the developer will be eligible for IRA energy community incentives.
Outside lucrative storage markets in California, Texas, and New York, Bishop says fossil fuel repurposing in markets such as MISO and PJM represent a great opportunity for developers under the IRA package.
Low-to-moderate income (LMI) communities, Native-American tribal authorities, and other disadvantaged groups may be eligible for a 10% ITC adder under an innovative aspect of the IRA. Some $7 billion worth of grants can be awarded from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for facilities such as solar-plus-storage projects of 5 MW or less on recognized tribal land.
Matt Harper, co-founder and chief commercial officer of UK-based vanadium redox battery supplier Invinity Energy Systems, says Tribal authorities can recover 50% to 70% of costs in some cases, with the storage ITC of 30% plus 10% adders for domestic battery content and labor, and the environmental justice adder. Hugh McDermott, senior VP for sales & business development at saltwater brine flow battery distributor ESS Inc, agreed with that estimate.
In November 2022, Invinity Energy and zinc-ion battery supplier Eos Energy Enterprises were selected to provide 3.75 MW/15 MWh and 8.75 MW/35 MWh, respectively, of battery systems for a solar-plus-storage microgrid developed by Indian Energy LLC, an energy company of the Viejas Tribe of Kumeyaay Native Americans from Southern California.
Indian Energy topped its IRA incentives with a $31 million grant from the California Energy Commission, to develop long-duration storage in its microgrid portfolio, which includes a 3.75 MW/15 MWh solar array. The tribal business is deploying two near-term microgrids, at the Viejas Casino & Resort, east of San Diego, and a nearby naval base. Indian Energy’s project development pipeline includes 4 GW of solar and wind projects, and 6 GWh of energy storage.
Rob Ritchie, director for energy storage at renewables developer Nexamp, stresses large projects aren’t always necessary to unlock resiliency and smoothly integrate intermittent renewables in the grid. Often the best use cases for distributed generation resources, such as community solar-plus-storage, will remedy exhausted sub-zones of the grid in rural locations, without wires.
Electric company National Grid turned to Nexamp after a 2019 tender document revealed the utility’s western New York service territory had overloaded transmission and distribution infrastructure such that, without a power sub-station upgrade, blackouts could occur.
Nexamp’s Watertown, New York DG project provides up to 5.7 MW/29 MWh up to 25 times per year for National Grid, by combining an 8.4 MW community solar array with 10 Tesla Megapack batteries with a total 31 MWh of storage. Additional capacity from the solar system was procured for use under a local community solar subscription program.
Nexamp’s Ritchie told pv magazine USA that additional LMI solar-plus-storage projects in Hawaii, and other states with active community solar programs, may also qualify for the solar ITC, storage ITC, and adders. The company is working with utility Hawaiian Electric to install seven community solar-plus-storage projects on the islands of Hawaii (12.8 MWdc/41.1 MWh storage), Maui, (11.2 MWdc/35.5 MWh) and Oahu (7.8 MWdc of solar).
Ritchie says that portfolio also enables a “black start” function which, during an outage, can step in to help restore service without having to wait for traditional transmission and distribution system operators.
Sara Kayal, global head of PV integrated solutions at clean energy developer Lightsource bp, says that 2020 was the second phase in the maturation of the U.S. solar-plus-storage market. After pilot projects started to appear in 2016, Kayal agrees the IRA’s storage credit and the solar ITC will drastically increase the number of solar-plus-storage facilities from half of the current PV mix.
While 50 MWh would have been seen as a big storage component until now, Kayal reckons 100 MWh and larger will be the new norm as solar capacities rise to typically top 450 MW. Lightsource bp wants half of its 2025 development pipeline – 12.5 GW – to feature lithium-ion batteries, though Kayal said the developer could pilot long-duration storage such as sodium-ion, hydrogen-nickel, or vanadium redox systems.
Amid supply chain constraints and EV thirst for batteries, Justin Johnson, chief operating officer of renewables company Arevon Energy, says his business continues to see rising battery costs of 30% to 40%. Arevon uses U.S.-made solar modules from companies including First Solar, and batteries from Tesla, Powin Energy, and Fluence Energy, Johnson says. He expects to source products from U.S. battery gigafactories from around 2025, thanks to IRA production incentives keeping prices down.

Matt Walz, VP for business development at Invinity, said his company’s vanadium redox batteries qualify for production credits worth $45 per kilowatt-hour of capacity. Other cell components and electrolytes are eligible for a 10% credit and Invinity’s U.S.-sourced vanadium brings another 10%.
For storage projects, offering more than four-hour discharge, new markets and utility off-takers include the Orlando Utilities Commission in Florida, NV Energy in Nevada, Georgia Power, and Minnesota’s Great River Energy, according to Julia Souder, executive director of non-profit the Long Duration Energy Storage Council. Corporates including Google, Microsoft, and Compass Datacenters are also deploying non lithium-ion storage, she adds.
Wood Mackenzie grid-storage analyst Vanessa Witte recently forecast 65 GW of energy storage projects will be necessary through 2026 to meet U.S .federal and state net zero goals in the next two decades. Bloomberg NEF’s Helen Kou says 54 GW of IRA-driven storage will lift the U.S. to 112 GW/396 GWh this decade.
Four-hour energy storage systems cost around $589 per kilowatt-hour of capacity in 2019 and federal body the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) pegged a four-hour, 60 MW/240 MWh lithium-ion battery at $369/kWh two years ago. NREL expects costs of $143/kW to $248/kW in 2030.
Kou says four-hour storage systems cost around $256/kWh in 2021, $324/kWh last year, and will stay higher again this year thanks to supply constraints. She and Witte agree the biggest volume of new storage will arrive in 2024-26.
BloombergNEF expects a 41% rise in storage projects next year, to 12.8 GW/42.8 GWh, and a 27% annual rise in 2026, to 12.3 GW/47.3 GWh. After that, double digit increases are expected to continue, to hit 14.1 GW/54 GWh in 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/13/californias-new-net-metering-policy-brings-batteries-into-the-forefront/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,NET METERING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",,"FEBRUARY 13, 2023",California’s new net metering policy brings batteries into the forefront,"California’s net energy metering (NEM) policy has been a key driver of the state’s solar deployment, incentivizing adoption by allowing utility customers to sell excess power generated from rooftop solar back to the grid for a profit. With approximately 1.5 million homes and businesses participating, policies like this have made California a clean energy leader in the United States, and even the world. However, the California Public Utilities Commission recently changed the solar-friendly policy.
The approved new framework (known as NEM 3.0) is expected to slash the rate paid for solar energy sold back to the grid by 75%. This revision significantly lengthens the five- to seven-year average payoff period for installing solar and puts the growth of solar power at risk. Californians must embrace an additional clean energy technology in order to shorten payoff periods and continue the momentum behind solar: batteries.
Under the new NEM 3.0 rate structure, the value of excess solar generated during the day is diminished. But, there is a strategically designed loophole –  homeowners and businesses can maintain the value of solar power generated by incorporating a battery into their system. The battery can store excess energy for later use, including hours of the day when energy demand and prices are at their highest.
This new structure will benefit the California power grid by reducing dependence on fossil fuels during peak demand periods. As a state that commonly experiences electricity supply shortages and rolling blackouts, California has the opportunity to mitigate these issues by leveraging batteries and renewables as distributed energy resources. Further, battery systems will enable California businesses to accelerate their paths to decarbonization, which regulation will mandate in the coming years.
As demand for solar-plus-storage grows, lithium-ion battery manufacturers are racing to keep pace. However, despite the urgent need for storage as electricity prices skyrocket and grid reliability nosedives, many home and business owners remain hesitant. Lithium-ion batteries have their own risks, including rising costs and fire hazards.
In 2022, the average lithium-ion battery pack price reversed its downward trend and rose 7% to $151/kWh. As of 2021, first costs (including cost of all hardware and cost of full installation) for a 10 kWh to 14 kWh residential battery system were in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 before state-specific incentives, which is cost prohibitive for the average homeowner. Lithium is also an inherently flammable material that can make batteries a liability rather than an asset.
Lithium battery fires burn hot and fast, and are difficult and dangerous to extinguish. Burning batteries also release a range of toxic gasses harmful to humans and the environment. While it’s true California needs battery storage, it will require innovation beyond lithium for mass adoption to meet the scale needed.
The next wave of clean technology adoption must take advantage of batteries that are inherently safe and affordable. Non-lithium energy storage alternatives exist, and many more are currently being developed. These new battery technologies can help California ensure that NEM 3.0 has no adverse effects on the clean energy transition, and instead kick it into high gear.
Once deployed at scale, these new battery chemistries will serve as invaluable assets to help shape the clean and resilient power grid of the future. Much like solar panels once were under previous NEM policy, batteries will respond to and be rewarded for giving energy back to the grid when it’s most needed.
