Unico Solar Investors is the owner/operator of the project.
The installation encompasses three locations across two campuses: the new Alaska Airlines Atrium in front of the arena, an adjacent parking garage, and a training facility in another part of the city. Panels at the atrium site are flush mounted on the roof, the parking garage features canopy solar at its rooftop level, and the training facility site utilizes a ballasted installation with panels at a 10-degree tilt.
The install was done by McKinstry, and inverters were supplied by Chint Power Systems.
While this project is not the only source of power for the stadium, all the other power sources that feed the Kraken are 100% renewable energy. The stadium features an 11 MW electric load, while the off-site facility hosting the third leg of the installation has a separate load of around 2 MW.
Unico said the stadium is currently in the process of obtaining certification from the International Living Future Institute (ILFI) as the first net-zero-carbon stadium in the world. Climate Pledge Arena has also implemented water conservation measures and zero-waste goals, including eliminating single-use plastic within the arena by 2024.
Climate Pledge Arena’s YouTube channel has also uploaded a video outlining the installation:
Though the installation features 1.2 MW of nameplate capacity, it is expected to generate 535 MWh in its first year, due in part to Seattle’s stormy and cloudy climate. The developers said that Seattle’s decidedly rainy climate will help wash the solar panels, which will help to combat soiling-created degradation and drops in generation.
Project financing was made available through Excelsior’s $500 million Renewable Energy Investment Fund I LP. The Kraken organization will retire applicable renewable energy credits, and the developers plan to use a Washington State program that allows 50% recovery of related sales and use taxes in the near future, now that the project is complete.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/25/watch-solar-panels-blasted-with-sound-to-better-understand-microcracking/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 25, 2021",Watch: Solar panels blasted with sound to better understand microcracking,"A team of researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Electric Power Research Institute are testing solar panels by blasting sound waves at them. 
The team said it is working to understand the effect of small cracks in a solar module, and how they may cause power losses over time. On windy days, modules can bend and flex, which can help to wear down cracked modules.  
Prevailing reliability tests were evaluated by computer modeling, and it was found that current methods for simulating wind-related bending were too aggressive to match real-world scenarios. The researchers needed a new model for testing wind-related bend, and turned to subwoofers as a research tool. 
The team strapped panels into wooden frames and blasted loud bass rhythms at the modules. This caused them to bend and flex as if they were being pushed by high winds. The bass was played at infrasonic levels, which are frequencies that the human ear is not able to detect. As a result, years of vibration and flexing may be tested in a few hours or days. 


The test was supported by DuraMAT, short for Durable Module Materials, a consortium that seeks to develop, de-risk, and enable commercialization of new materials and designs for PV modules.

The IQ8 microinverter line represents a technological advancement for the company’s microinverter technology, as each is capable of forming a microgrid during a power outage using only sunlight, providing backup power without a battery.
The IQ8product line includes five models of software-defined microinverters: IQ8, IQ8+, IQ8M, IQ8A and IQ8H, with peak output AC power of 245VA, 300VA, 330VA, 366VA and 384VA, respectively.
With the IQ8’s microgrid-forming capability, Enphase has expanded the number of possible configurations of the Enphase Energy System from three to four:
“Many homeowners often assume their solar systems will function if the sun is shining, even during a power outage,” said Badri Kothandaraman, president and CEO of Enphase. “This has unfortunately not been true until today. Now, with IQ8, homeowners can realize the true promise of solar — to make and use their own power.”
The last three configurations all require an Enphase System Controller, called Enpower smart switch, to island the home during an outage. For homeowners seeking to retrofit a battery to their home solar system, IQ8 eases the commitment, allowing for any size Enphase battery to be paired with a solar system.
IQ8 pilot installations began in Q3 with select installer partners. Distributor and installer partners in North America can pre-order IQ8 starting today, with production shipments expected in December.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/25/plastic-for-solar-panels/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,NORTH AMERICA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 25, 2021",Plastic for solar panels?,"Three manufacturers, Merlin Solar, Solarge, and LG, are making a move away from the standard aluminum and glass solar panel in a bid to lower weight, emissions, and cost.
The product from Merlin Solar has been found recently on yachts in pv magazine USA. Its value is that, first, it isn’t a standard framed product and so can be attached directly to a flat surface. Second, due to its unique busbar technology, the product is able to be walked on without damage.
Merlin Solar’s main goal, however, is to place its product on top of commercial structures whose limited available collateral load — the amount of weight that can be added to a structure’s roof and meet local building code regulations — doesn’t allow for the pounds per square foot (3-7 psf) that a standard solar installation requires.
The company recently installed 550 kWdc of its product on an oil storage tank in Rensselaer, New York. Merlin Solar said this site could neither take on the additional weight, nor gain owner approval for an attachment technique that might puncture the structure’s outer roofing layer.
Merlin Solar also markets its product in a framed format where a stronger structural attachment is required, or where a more rigid solar panel is desired. Even so, the product weighs considerably less than a standard solar panel because it does not use a glass front shield.
Solarge has released a product that replaces the glass of a solar panel with a plastic product. Currently, the company is manufacturing the panel on a pilot line which it said it hopes to scale up by the end of 2022. The company’s panel can be bought on its own, or as part of their custom designed east-west facing rooftop racking product.
The solar panel weighs just under 32 pounds (14.5 kg). For comparison’s sake, a Q Cell product made in Georgia weighs 43.8 pounds (19.9 kg). In the east-west configuration and including the racking hardware, the Solarge DUO will weigh 1.35 psf (6.6 kg/m2). And keep in mind that the lowest allowable collateral load often is around 3 psf.
 One point emphasized by the manufacturer is the product’s apparent strong emissions and recyclability credibility:
The product will have a CO2 footprint which is 80% lower than conventional solar panels and the panel is completely circular in design and uses no Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) materials, unlike all other solar panels that use a polymeric film instead of glass.
LG Chem — part of the conglomerate that also sells the successful LG solar panel line with a manufacturing facility in Alabama — has announced that it is exploring turning the frames of solar panels from aluminum into plastics.
LG Chem said the product is as strong as aluminum, but cheaper and, of course, lightweight. Although no specific numbers were available, an LG Chem press release said its product can be manufactured with post-consumer recycled polycarbonate which will  lower the emissions of the frame.

The compound, called LUPOY EU5201, is an engineering plastic composed of ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) resins with polycarbonate as a base, and reinforced with glass fibers. High rooftop temperatures are well tolerated by the compound, which incorporates a flame retardant. It can maintain its shape across a range of temperature due to its low coefficient of thermal expansion. And LG Chem claimed the new compound is highly resistant to corrosion, resistant to impacts, and extremely resistant to UV.
The company said it began selling products in the third quarter, indicating that it could already be headed toward solar panel factories for final manufacturing.
A shift to more plastics in solar panels will gain the attention of those who are considering the environmental credibility of solar power. While aluminum and glass manufacturing use an immense amount of energy, plastics are a major contributor to global trash pollution. They also are manufactured from hydrocarbons (oil).
However, the actual manufacturing of plastics from hydrocarbons — a process called cracking — doesn’t release emissions. It is the energy used to generate the heat — usually from fossil gas — that results in greenhouse gas emissions.
From this author’s experience building rooftop solar power, access to products that would lower the psf by greater than 50% of what is often our lowest allowable collateral load of 3 psf would open up a large amount of rooftop space for development.
