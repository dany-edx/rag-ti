DOE announced funding for a new consortium to advance research on the technology.
As fossil generators are phased out, grid-forming inverters will need to be phased in so that the grid can be restarted after any blackout.
(Read “Inertia, frequency regulation and the grid.”)
Providing a more technical explanation, a Science journal article on terawatt-scale PV noted that at higher levels of PV deployment, the resource will need to provide grid services; and at very high levels as fossil-fueled synchronous generators are retired, “PV systems will need to generate their own voltage reference waveforms and synchronize together.”
Already, grid-forming technology has advanced far enough that an Australian project announced in August will deploy a 250 MW/ 250 MWh grid-forming battery.
DOE’s $25 million grant will support a consortium led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the University of Washington, and the Electric Power Research Institute, with participation from other national labs, universities, manufacturers, utilities, and grid operators.
The consortium’s research, said DOE, will focus on integrating grid-forming inverters into electric grids “at any scale, to enable high penetration of inverter-based resources, like solar and wind.”
The consortium will conduct and coordinate research, development, and demonstration, and create educational and workforce‐training materials regarding planning, designing, and operating grids with a high level of inverter‐based resources. It will also develop “universal guidelines” for seamless integration of grid-forming technologies.
The consortium’s name—the Universal Interoperability for Grid‐Forming Inverters (UNIFI) Consortium—aims to make clear that its goal is universal interoperability of inverter-based resources.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/26/opening-salvos-are-fired-as-the-battle-over-solar-safeguards-heats-up/,"BUSINESS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 26, 2021",Opening salvos are fired as the battle over solar safeguards heats up,"The governments of Mexico, Malaysia, and Turkey, along with the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), NextEra Energy Resources, REC Americas, and others, are chiming in to have a say in the recently reignited debate over extending import tariffs for solar equipment destined to U.S. markets.
In a filing earlier in August, the SEIA, the American Clean Power Association, NextEra Energy, and REC Americas said they opposed extending the safeguard measures. They urged the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to reject a handful of petitions asking the body to extend the provisions beyond their current expiration date of February 2022.
The filing challenged petitions from Suniva, Auxin Solar, Hanwha Q CELLS USA, LG Electronics USA, and Mission Solar Energy seeking to have the tariff safeguards extended. The SEIA-led group challenged the claim that the five companies represented the views of the domestic U.S. solar industry. The group also pointed out that Suniva filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2017 and is currently not operating any production.

The request to reject the petitions also said that Auxin Solar does not produce cells, only modules, in a San Jose, California facility that has an annual production capacity of 150 MW.
“Extending this safeguard is essential for America to reclaim its lead in solar energy manufacturing and development,” said Auxin Solar’s CEO.

“Extending this safeguard is essential for America to reclaim its lead in solar energy manufacturing and development, and it represents a critical step to achieve the broader goal of American renewable energy independence,” said Mamun Rashid, co-founder and chief executive officer at Auxin Solar at the time his company asked for the extension. Rashid said that Auxin “is committed to re-shoring the solar supply chain” and filed the petition hoping that policymakers are “committed to the promise of green energy independence and the good-paying manufacturing jobs that will result.”
Auxin said that its extension petition would prompt the ITC to determine whether the safeguard remedy continues to be necessary and whether evidence exists that the industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition. The ITC is expected to report its determination to President Biden by December 8.
The SEIA-led filing asking that the petitions be thrown out said that Suniva has not produced CSPV cells in the U.S. since early 2017, and Auxin Solar has only ever assembled modules in the United States. As a result, the filing said that neither petitioner can file on behalf of the domestic industry with regard to cells “because they are not domestic producers of cells and are not currently members of the domestic cell industry.”

In addition, the filing said that Hanwha is a wholly owned unit of Hanwha Chemical Corp. in Korea, and that the firm originally opposed the safeguard measure. In September 2019—around 18 months after the safeguard action was imposed—Hanwha opened a 1.7 GW module production facility in Dalton, Georgia. It imports CSPV cells for assembly into modules and is related to U.S. importers and leading foreign producers in China, Korea, and Malaysia.
The SEIA-led request said that like Hanwha, LGEUSA originally opposed the safeguard measure, but in February 2019 commercial production in a new module facility in Huntsville, Alabama with an annual production capacity of 500 MW. LGEUSA imports CSPV cells and modules from Korea. And the filing said that Mission Solar is a unit of Korea-based OCI Ltd.
Domestic module producers disagree on the safeguard measure.

The filing said that with respect to modules, Hanwha and LGEUSA began domestic production of CSPV modules in 2019, “in the middle of the safeguard period.” It said the companies opposed the original petition and “continued to import significant quantities of cells to feed their domestic module production.” As a result, it said that Hanwha and LGEUSA are not eligible to file a petition on behalf of the industry because they were not part of the domestic module industry at the time of the original investigation.
Turning to Mission Solar, the filing said that company has the capacity to produce around 200 MW of modules in the United States per year. Based on 2,021 MW of total domestic module capacity, Mission Solar represents roughly 9.9% of total domestic module capacity. In context of the market, the filing said that Mission Solar represents at most around 1.0% of the 19.2 GW of total U.S. solar installations in 2020. “This is not adequate to establish standing, especially given the fact that domestic module producers disagree on the safeguard measure.”

Chinese PV module manufacturer JinkoSolar began production of its TOPCon n-type bifacial monocrystalline panels at the beginning of this year.
After few months of operations of its 1 GW manufacturing lines, the company has disclosed a few more details about the new product – the Tiger Neo solar module, which it is planning to launch on the market soon. “Having expanded the economies of scale makes it easier to compete with p-type PERC product,” JinkoSolar CTO, Hao Jin, told pv magazine.
The panel is made with 182mm wafers, half-cut cells, and has a power output ranging from 590 to 620 W. It measures 2465×1134×30mm and has a weight of 34.8 kg. Its power conversion efficiency ranges from 21.11% and 22.18% and its temperature coefficient is -0.30% per Celsius degree.
The operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 to 85 degrees Celsius, said the manufacturer, and maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has an anodized aluminum frame and 2mm of tempered glass with an anti-reflection coating. Its junction box has an IP 68 rating.
Jinko offers a 15-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. Annual linear degradation over 30 years is indicated at 0.40% while degradation for the first year of the panel’s lifetime is capped at less than 1%.
“The module is manufactured with a circular solder strip to obtain better optical gain,” Jin went on to say. “Its bifaciality of 80-85% is about 5%-15% higher than that of conventional p-type bifacial products.” According to the manufacturer, the combination of advantages such as a low-temperature coefficient, a low degradation rate, and the high bifaciality ensure that the energy yield is 3% higher than that of mainstream p-type bifacial modules.
The module is recommended for utility-scale projects, but JinkoSolar said that, given its efficiency and reliability, it could also be used for rooftop projects of any size.
JinkoSolar had announced in mid-July it achieved a 23.53% conversion efficiency for an n-type monocrystalline solar PV module based on its TOPCon mono cell technology. “The module’s breakthrough performance was the result of adopting JinkoSolar’s cutting-edge TOPCon cell technology fused with a new-type of welding and packaging technology,” the manufacturer said in a statement released at the time. “The module design not only reduces the internal resistance loss of the module, but improves power efficiency and module appearance.”

Senate Bill 760 requires solar power facility agreements to provide that the owner or “assignee” is responsible for removing its facilities from the landowner’s property. The bill cleared both the state’s House and Senate with near-unanimous support. It was signed by Gov. Greg Abbott on June 14.
Analysts said the law applies to solar power facility agreements, which are defined as a lease between a grantee and a landowner that authorizes the grantee to operate a solar power facility on the leased property. The bill defines the term “solar power facility” as including a solar energy device, such as solar panels, and any facilities or equipment used to support the operation of that device.
The bill also extends to easement agreements, but stops short of applying to ancillary agreements set up solely for transmission, energy storage, access, or collection line purposes. Even so, facilities and equipment such as battery storage facilities that are “used to support” a solar project will be subject to the decommissioning requirements.
The bill does not appear to apply to solar power facility agreements executed prior to September 1, or amendments to solar power facility agreements executed before or after the law’s effective date. Even so, leases that are amended after September 1 may be subject to the new requirements.
The bill only applies to a solar power facility that is a “generation asset.” The state’s Utilities Code defines those as assets associated with the production of electricity, including generation plants, electrical interconnections of the generation plant to the transmission system, fuel contracts, fuel transportation contracts, water contracts, lands, surface or subsurface water rights, emissions-related allowances, and gas pipeline interconnections.
The bill requires solar power facility agreements to include specific provisions describing the solar owner’s responsibility to remove project facilities from the landowner’s property. The scope includes not only solar equipment, transformers, substations, and overhead lines, but also foundations and buried cables, roads, and rock removal and surface restoration.
Solar power facility agreements will also need to include provisions indicating that the solar owner will be financially able to complete its restoration obligations. In the event of an asset sale, the obligation stays with the seller until the buyer provides replacement financial assurance to the landowner at or prior to closing.

The energy and RECs will be used to fill power agreements with PepsiCo, McCormick & Co., Best Buy and two Viacom-owned TV stations. Each customer signed an equivalent long-term agreement with Constellation to receive energy and RECs from the project as part of their retail electric supply contract.
The supply agreements were carried out through the Constellation Offsite Renewables (CORe) retail power product. The mechanism was developed to increase business’ access to renewable energy purchases, without forcing the businesses themselves to go through the PPA process. The supply agreements for each company have a 10-year term, obviously starting once Big Star begins to deliver power.
Big Star Solar is expected to reach commercial operation in the second quarter of 2022. RWE Renewables is building the project, which will also come partnered with an 80 MW/120 MWh hour battery energy storage system. Hardware specifics on the project have not yet been publicized, nor have any specifics about the manufacturer or battery chemistry.
Energy generated from the Big Star solar project will allow McCormick to fully power both its Dallas manufacturing plant and distribution center with renewable electricity. It also will represent significant steps towards the other three companies’ renewable energy and emission reduction objectives.
Both PepsiCo and Best Buy have made commitments to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040;  Pepsi has an interim goal of achieving a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030.
