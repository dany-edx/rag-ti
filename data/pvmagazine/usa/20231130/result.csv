The installations, which are installed, owned and operated by Solar Landscape, are on Heitman Capital Management warehouse rooftops in Monroe Township and South Brunswick.
With 11,000 Znshine modules mounted on PanelClaw racks, the combined rooftop projects provide 8.8 MWdc of clean, discounted solar energy to more than 1,400 nearby homes. The projects also promote clean energy equity, as more than half of those homes will be low- or moderate-income households.
The spread of commercial rooftop community solar has contributed to New Jersey-based Solar Landscape’s growth, which the company reports has tripled over the last two years. The company currently employs over 150 people and has more than 250 MW of solar projects built, and over 150 MW operating and under construction.
Solar Landscape recently announced that Public Storage, owner of self-storage facilities across the U.S., signed a contract to install solar on more than 130 of its rooftops in Maryland, New Jersey and Illinois. The solar generated on the self-storage rooftops, enough to power 10,000 homes, will be available to local residents on a subscription basis. Subscribers will receive discounted electricity, and Solar Landscape reports that the clean energy will offer additional savings for many LMI households.
Due to the company’s growth, it moved into a new 10,000-square foot office space in the spring of 2023, and recently announced plans to hire over 100 new employees in 2024. The new jobs will span all functions, including engineering, business development, finance, legal, community engagement, and project management.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/30/new-hampshire-seeks-70-million-to-expand-low-income-community-solar/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW HAMPSHIRE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 30, 2023",New Hampshire seeks $70 million to expand low-income community solar,"The New Hampshire Department of Energy has submitted a request for a $70 million federal grant to expand community solar for low-income residents in the state.
The grant request was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Solar For All competitive grant program. The program set aside $7 billion to increase solar access for people living in low-income communities across the U.S. Up to 60 grants will be rewarded under the program.
Community solar involves customers subscribing to a portion of an on-site or off-site solar facility’s generating capacity, receiving credit on their traditional utility bills for the electricity produced by the system. The Department of Energy said community solar customers can expect to see an average of 10% to 20% savings on their utility bill. It offers customers who do are not able to install solar on their rooftop another pathway toward adopting solar.
New Hampshire created regulatory pathways for community solar in 2013, but project size limits and limited economic viability have prevented the market from taking off. The Solar For All grant funds are expected to improve the economic benefits while assisting with customer acquisition.
Under the proposal, the program would fund a portion of the solar project if most of the power generated benefits low-income households. It would also set aside funds for the development of low-income housing, administered by New Hampshire Housing.
The grant proposal addresses an issue in solar adoption for renters called the “split incentive.” Landlords have little motivation to put up capital for solar panel installations if their tenants pay their own electricity bills. New Hampshire’s proposal would change this structure by having landlords take over tenant utility bills, roll the costs into rent, and make discounts for tenants based on the solar savings.
“The Solar for All proposal takes a huge step in moving things in a more positive direction,” said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy New Hampshire. “It’s giving landlords a carrot to figure this out.”
EPA is expected to announce grant recipients in March 2024, with funds beginning to roll out in 2025.

The 1.3 GW of projects are among the first to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) domestic content tax credit adder. The projects are also located in qualified Energy Communities, making them eligible for a further tax credit adder under the IRA.
To qualify for the domestic content adder, SB Energy is utilizing 1.1 million domestic content solar modules manufactured in Ohio by First Solar. The project also uses U.S.-made Nextracker tracking, and structural steel from Texas and Georgia.
Projects that achieve prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are offered a 30% base Investment Tax Credit under the IRA. The domestic content adder and the Energy Community adder include another 10% bonus each, meaning the SB Energy project portfolio may receive a 50% tax credit for the installed system costs of its project portfolio.
The four projects are expected to support over 3,600 new direct and supply chain jobs. They are located in energy communities that have seen higher than average unemployment rates due to recent coal closures or fossil fuel retirements.
“The IRA’s domestic content and energy community incentives were designed to expand America’s manufacturing base and create good-paying jobs in communities that need them,” said Rich Hossfeld, co-chief executive officer, SB Energy.
SB Energy worked with J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley Renewables Inc., and Truist Bank to close approximately $800 million in tax equity. It collaborated with MUFG, Mizuho Americas, ING, SMBC, CIBC, Fifth Third Bank, and Société Générale to raise $450 million in term debt and $1.4 billion in construction debt to build the four projects.
Google is purchasing roughly 75% of the electricity generated by the 1.3 GW of projects to support its growing energy needs at data operations in Texas. The company recently announced it will invest $330 million in the state to open a new datacenter.
J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley Renewables Inc., and Truist Bank provided the tax equity for the Orion I, Eiffel, Orion II, and Orion III projects, respectively. MUFG is the lead lender on the Eiffel and Orion II projects, while Mizuho Americas is the lead lender on Orion I and III. Other lenders for the projects are ING, SMBC, CIBC, Fifth Third Bank, and Société Générale.
“By partnering with leading tax equity investors and lenders on these latest financings, we are extending our track record of deploying renewable generation at scale. Moreover, by utilizing the IRA’s domestic content and energy community adders, we have created a blueprint for deploying clean infrastructure that advances America’s prosperity and wellbeing,” said Gianluca Signorelli, SB Energy head of capital markets.
SB Energy has 2 GW of solar in operation, 1 GW in construction, and over 15 GW of solar and 12 GW of storage under development.

Belgian research center Imec is working with research and industrial partners to integrate silicon heterojunction solar cells into curved glass to create solar products that could be used for vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV), as well as for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) systems.
Solar roofs in cars currently generate limited output due to space constraints, typically adding only a few kilometers of extra range.
Imec researchers designed glass solar modules with a proprietary ‘multi-wire’ connection technology, utilizing silicon heterojunction-based solar cells and a low-temperature process up to 180 C. This innovative architecture provides flexibility in the electrical design, maximizing space usage with minimal additional materials and lower costs.
The Imec researchers used a multi-wire configuration, connecting solar cell circuits in parallel to maximize energy production on curved surfaces. This innovative interconnection, along with optical coatings, increased efficiency and minimized heating of solar cells and vehicle cabins.
In addition, they automated the previously manual production process of the multi-wire connecting films, enabling the cost-effective transfer of innovations to glass solar modules.
“Further upscaling is absolutely necessary,” said Jonathan Govaerts, project coordinator and lead researcher at Imec. “But what makes this project so unique is its proof of concept for a wide range of applications. The flexibility of the multi-wire connection for integrating solar cells on different surfaces and in different configurations is impressive.”
The Flemish Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship is financially backing the SNRoof project. The consortium consisted of the industrial partners AGP eGlass, IPTE Factory Automation, Arkema France Sa and Michiels Group.

A group of scientists have tested the use of special solar cells to monitor the behavior of seals during spring migration. They said this is the first long-term deployment of submerged solar cells in a realistic oceanic environment.
“Our work presents the first longitudinal study of photovoltaic cell performance in the marine environment that spans location, time, and depth,” researcher Collin A. Krawczyk told pv magazine. “We highlight novel methods of data collection in the marine environment, using animal hosts as vehicles for water column profile measurements. Based on our power results and energy predictions, solar power could feasibly provide all, or a significant portion, of the daily energy required by many marine wildlife telemetry modules.”
The academics said the electricity requirements of microelectronics applied in marine data loggers and other devices have fallen sharply in recent years, which makes PV a feasible power supply option.
To test their approach, the team attached special monocrystalline mini solar modules to four adult female northern elephant seals. The mammals make an ideal sensor platform for subsurface water profiling, as they average 2.9 dives per hour to depths of more than 400 meters and have migration patterns ranging from southern California to the North Pacific Ocean.
The scientists connected the mini PV panel to a device that measured and recorded the current-voltage relationship, in addition to a SPLASH10 tag that recorded the seal’s location, orientation, temperature, and depth. Unique names were given to each device: Kilo, November, Oscar, and Lima.
“The deployment of these devices began in late February of 2018, and both November and Oscar returned to the initial deployment location in early May of 2018. Kilo performed a much longer deployment, returning in early June of 2018,” the researchers said. “During this extended deployment, Kilo filled its on-board memory. Lima’s results were corrupted by a device malfunction during deployment.”
After recovering the modules, the academics had to perform extensive post-processing on them. They had to calibrate a time lag between the tags and the current–voltage devices and perform a curve fitting process for the latter. They also had to use a method that estimates the short-circuit current of a flat panel based on their tilted observed results. That is the module that was mounted to the head of a diving animal, and their panel-tilt angles were typically non-zero.
They found that maximum power averages as a function of depth are presented at up to 22 meters deep.
“Past 22 meters, our data became reliant on our low irradiance curve estimations, and the data here had very little medium/high irradiance curves,” they said. “At 5 meters depth, results show a 70% to 85% reduction in surface relative power, depending on the tag. While Kilo saw a higher reduction in power than November and Oscar, the reduction in power for November and Oscar at 15 and 20 meters was of roughly 84% and 90% reduction, respectively. At 15 meters, we found that there was an 85% to 95% reduction in available power, which increases to a 90% to 98% reduction at 20 meters.”
The researchers described their experiment in “Trans-oceanic subsurface photovoltaic performance,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. They come from Northern Arizona University and the University of California, Santa Cruz.

British oil and gas company BP announced today in a press release that it had come to an agreement with UK-based PV producer Lightsource BP to purchase the remaining 50.03% of Lightsource BP’s shares it does not already own.
Once the deal closes, which is expected for mid-2024, BP will control all of Lightsource BP. The company paid £254 million ($321 million) for the stake, according to the announcement.
BP said it will scale up Lightsource BP’s PV operations with the acquisition and will “target double digit equity returns.”
“BP intends to use Lightsource BP’s world-class capabilities as a developer of cost-competitive utility-scale onshore renewable power to help meet its own demand for low carbon power,” the company said.
“This integration is expected to underpin and de-risk delivery of BP’s targets for its transition growth engines – in hydrogen, EV charging and biofuels as well as in power trading.”
BP executive vice president for gas and low-carbon energy Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath said the purchase will allow for BP to meet the increasing demand for low-carbon power from “transition growth engines.”
BP first invested $200 million in Lightsource – subsequently named Lightsource BP – in 2017 for a 43% stake in the company. In 2022 BP bumped up its share to 50%.
Lightsource BP completed its first utility-scale solar installation in 2016. Since then, the company has launched more than 16 renewable energy projects in the United States alone, with Lightsource BP announcing last year it wanted to pursue a project in New Zealand.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/30/enervenue-energy-rack-includes-pre-assembled-energy-storage-vessels/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 30, 2023",EnerVenue Energy Rack includes pre-assembled Energy Storage Vessels,"EnerVenue, manufacturer of metal-hydrogen batteries capable of cycling up to three times per day, at two to 12-hour discharge rates, is launching of the EnerVenue Energy Rack. Each rack consists of integrated Energy Storage Vessels (ESVs) in 150 kWh and 102 kWh configurations.
“Our customers get complete flexibility to install and connect as many fully assembled Energy Racks as their energy storage use cases require—simple as that,” said Randall Selesky, CRO, EnerVenue.
The company reports that the solution includes EnerVenue’s next-generation ESV battery technology, custom battery management system (BMS) hardware, and the wiring and connections required for integration into customized containers or buildings. The next-generation ESV battery, announced in September, is designed for large-scale renewables and storage applications. It reportedly has a 30-year, 30,000-cycle lifespan, with the manufacturer offering a 20-year/20,000-cycle warranty that guarantees at least 88% battery capacity remaining after that period.
EnerVenue claims its nickel-hydrogen battery technology can operate at temperatures between -104 F and 140 F, and that it can provide the promised cycles without degradation and at varying rates. The battery has an efficiency ranging from 80% to 90%, depending on the cycle rate, and its energy density per square foot is equal to, or better than lithium-ion batteries, according to the company.
The Energy Rack solution is designed for use in both 1000 VDC and 1500 VDC systems in either indoor structures or outdoor-rated enclosures. The Racks can serve as interlocking modules that can be connected inline or stacked up to three levels high.
EnerVenue notes that its nickel-hydrogen ESV technology does not have the thermal runaway risk of lithium-ion batteries. Another benefit is that the storage solutions are serviceable at a component level, which can lower maintenance costs, the company reports.
In March EnerVenue announced that it will open a one million square foot gigafactory on a 73-acre site in Shelby County, Kentucky, where it will design, manufacture and test its nickel-hydrogen ESVs. The first phase of the project will provide 450 full-time jobs and is aiming for 1 GWh of annual production. EnerVenue says it expects to invest in excess of $1 billion to expand to more than 20 GWh per year across its domestic manufacturing sites in subsequent phases. The company currently has manufacturing facilities in Fremont, Calif.
EnerVenue Energy Racks are now available to order and will begin shipping in 2024.
