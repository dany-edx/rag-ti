https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/05/gibraltar-talks-terrasmart-acquisition-u-s-solar-market-optimism/,"ACQUISITIONS,BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,INSTALLATIONS,INTERVIEW,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,RACKING,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 5, 2021","Gibraltar talks TerraSmart acquisition, U.S. solar market optimism","“The solar coaster is going up,” said Bill Vietas, president of the renewable energy group at Gibraltar Industries. With the company’s latest acquisitions, Gibraltar plans to enjoy the ride.
In early January, New York-based Gibraltar acquired both solar racking company TerraSmart and software provider Sunfig in separate deals totaling nearly $225 million.
Vietas and Ryan Reid, president of TerraSmart, spoke with pv magazine USA to discuss the recent acquisitions and offer insights into the U.S. market.
Gibraltar first entered the solar space in 2015 when it acquired RBI Solar, a mounting solutions provider for commercial, utility-scale, and carport solar projects. Gibraltar grew its portfolio in 2018 with SolarBOS, an electrical balance-of-systems company.
Now, Gibraltar has welcomed TerraSmart and Sunfig to what Vietas called its “renewables family.” He said Gibraltar chose the two companies because of previous teamwork, shared cultures, and their technologies.
Gibraltar bought Sunfig earlier this year in a deal worth $3.75 million. The software firm’s solutions help optimize solar energy investments through upstream design, performance, and financial modeling to meet customers’ needs at different stages of project development.
In the larger of the two acquisitions, Gibraltar paid $220 million for TerraSmart, which provides screw-based, ground-mount solar racking technology. Reid joked that his company’s price tag wasn’t expensive, but “good value.” Vietas agreed.
Both Sunfig and TerraSmart are slated to become product brands under the Gibraltar umbrella, with all current employees joining the team. “There’s a lot of opportunity for us hiring, as well as people growing within the company and taking on more roles,” Reid said.  “The idea is expansion.”
Reid said he saw this deal as an opportunity to boost TerraSmart’s products, integrated services, and innovation.
Similarly, Gibraltar viewed these acquisitions as a way to expand its footprint in the U.S. market and become an end-to-end, turnkey provider of ground-mount infrastructure, tracker tech, and design software.
“Putting that all together and having a good one-stop shop for customers to go to is really important to us,” said Vietas.
Gibraltar already offered ground-mount racking solutions. However, Vietas said TerraSmart’s ground-screw technology was designed for tough soil and hilly terrain, which are a challenge for developers.
According to Reid, solar developers sometimes run into “land refusal” when trying to install ground-mount systems, leading to delays, pile deformations, or other issues. He said TerraSmart’s ground-screw technology can help eliminate such problems and open project development for more difficult sites.
As the name suggests, the ground-screw solution has a spiral thread, which is designed to help minimize embedment depth and make it easier to install. The product’s forged tip helps pinpoint the screw for accuracy and ensure foundation plumbness. (For a photo of the ground screw, see this story’s main image.)
“Years into this renewables revolution, a lot of ‘the good dirt,’ as we call it, may have been picked over,” Reid said. “You’re seeing more and more sites that are encountering issues.”
Examples of so-called “bad dirt,” which some developers might typically avoid, include undesirable farmland, rocky spots in the Northeast, areas along the Appalachian Mountains, and volcanic or other hard soils in the West.

Reid and Vietas suggested that developing projects on sites with bad dirt will only lead to more solar, overall.
Nonetheless, there is still good dirt out there waiting to host projects.
Reid said that the fact that Gibraltar is a larger, end-to-end organization with different design software, technologies, and resources will allow the company to “truly take an agnostic view of any site” and choose the best solution for a customer.
With Gibraltar’s two latest acquisitions complete, Vietas said it’s an “exciting time” and that Gibraltar plans to keep learning and growing in the U.S. solar market.
That includes organic growth through in-house improvements, as well as longer-term inorganic growth through other potential acquisitions.
“There’s certainly lots to do and lots of opportunity out there,” said Vietas. He said that Gibraltar is focused more on meeting customer demands and offering value, rather than on meeting any “specific number of acquisitions.”
As for whether the industry should expect new product announcements anytime soon, Reid declined to answer and quipped, “We don’t want to give too much away just yet.”
The partners did say they plan to place major attention on the growing utility-scale solar tracker market, a familiar space for TerraSmart.
Over the past 10 years, TerraSmart has helped build more than 3 GW of ground-mounted, utility-scale solar projects across the U.S. In addition to fixed-tilt racking, the company’s current products include the single-axis tracker under the TerraTrak brand.
“We’ll continue to have relevant solutions that make an impact to our clients’ bottom line and bring a different business model and level of experience that very few others have,” said Reid. “We feel that’s the growth strategy that will prevail.”
With these deals, Gibraltar said it expects its solar energy platform within its Renewable Energy and Conservation segment to pass $700 million in organic revenue by 2025 from a pro forma fiscal 2020 revenue base of around $400 million.
Vietas and Reid were both optimistic about the U.S. solar industry and expressed little concern for unforeseen challenges, whether financial or political.
“It’s a large market, and renewables are here to stay,” said Vietas. “Ten years ago, it was so up and down. Of course, nothing is going to be exactly straight, linear, and perfect. You’ll have the solar coaster–that’s not going to go away. But the solar coaster is going up.”
Even after a contentious U.S. election and enduring political divides across the country, Reid said, “No matter what side of the aisle you’re on, there’s been a lot of interest to continue the renewable path that’s been forged over the past decade. We don’t really see too many disruptions ahead.”
Gibraltar and TerraSmart are among many U.S. solar companies that have joined forces over the years. Vietas said such mergers and acquisitions are a positive sign.
“I think it signals a healthy, growing market,” he said. “It also signals the fact that more investment wants to come into renewables. You could look at it as consolidation, I suppose, but I look at it as being able to provide value to customers at a deeper level.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/05/total-adds-to-its-u-s-utility-scale-solar-and-storage-portfolio/,"ACQUISITIONS,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 5, 2021",Total adds to its U.S. utility-scale solar and storage portfolio,"French energy giant Total said it acquired a development pipeline of 2.2 GW of solar projects and 600 MW of battery storage assets, all in Texas.
Total acquired the project pipeline from developer SunChase Power and private energy investment firm MAP RE/ES.  The portfolio consists of four planned large-scale solar projects, each with co-located battery energy storage systems, in industrial areas close to Houston that have high demand for electricity.
The acquisition comes less than a month after Total announced a joint venture with 174 Power Global, a unit of Hanwha Group, to develop 1.6 GW of solar and storage across the country.
The most recent acquisition means that Total is now developing close to 4 GW of renewable power capacity in the U.S.,  contributing to its objective to reach close to 35 GW of renewable generation capacity globally by 2025, said Patrick Pouyanné, chairman and CEO.
The oil and gas major had close to 7 GW of renewable generation capacity worldwide at the end of 2020.
Construction of the first two projects is expected to start later this year, with all projects slated to come online between 2023 and 2024.
The remuneration paid by Total to SunChase and MAP RE/ES will be staged as the projects advance.
Total also said it will commit to a 1 GW corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) sourced from this solar-plus-storage portfolio to cover all electricity consumption at its industrial sites in the U.S., including its Port Arthur refining and petrochemicals platform and La Porte and Carville petrochemical sites.
Pouyanné called the PPA “concrete proof” of the company’s ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. He said that Total looks forward to “taking advantage of the many growth opportunities in the U.S. market to address the challenges of the energy transition.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/05/sunrise-brief-norfolk-naval-shipyard-adds-battery-storage-and-chp/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 5, 2021",Sunrise brief: Norfolk Naval Shipyard adds battery storage and CHP,"The U.S. Navy and the Ameresco Federal Solutions are expanding on-site generation at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia.
This $173 million project includes a 19 MW combined heat and power plant, a 3 MW battery energy storage system, and a microgrid control system that will help reduce the amount of electricity imported from the grid by 68%.
Over the course of the 22-year performance period following construction, the project is guaranteed to generate more than $411 million in cost savings.
As part of the project scope, Ameresco will refurbish existing backup power assets, integrate them into the microgrid, and upgrade the electric distribution system to provide redundant sources of supply.
The project also features a new industrial wastewater treatment plant. After construction is completed in 2022, Ameresco will operate and maintain the CHP plant, water treatment plant, and microgrid until January 2044. Each measure is designed to operate in compliance with relevant Department of Defense and Navy cybersecurity requirements.
Researchers from Northern Arizona University report finding what they said is a systematic under-reporting of urban emissions by cities. The under-reporting is important as cities take a range of steps to reduce their emissions.
The researchers said that urban areas produce almost 70% of greenhouse gas emissions, and that many cities currently produce their own inventories detailing those emissions.

As part of their work, the researchers, who are from the university’s School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems, compared 48 self-reported inventories from cities–including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Denver, and Philadelphia–against a standardized system for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions known as Vulcan.
They found large differences that varied widely from one city to the next. When averaged, the self-reported emissions were almost 20% below the emissions estimated by the standardized Vulcan system. At the extremes, for example, Cleveland, Ohio, reported emissions 90.1% below the Vulcan estimate. Palo Alto, Calif., reported emissions 41.7% greater than the Vulcan estimate.
The researchers said that in order to prioritize and track emission reductions, cities will need an unbiased understanding of their emissions.
They said that Indianapolis aims to make a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from buildings by 2025 relative to 2016 values. But with the greater than 25% underestimate reported in the study, the researchers said it will be hard to track progress toward this target, or know when and if it has been achieved.
The approach taken by the research team used a consistent method across all cities and combined federal, state, and local data systematically. Data from the Vulcan project are available on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Data Archive.
A research team recently observed what they described as the internal evolution of materials inside solid-state lithium batteries. They watched as the li-ion batteries were charged and discharged.
The researchers said the detailed 3D information that resulted may help improve battery reliability and performance by replacing flammable liquid electrolytes in existing lithium-ion batteries with solid materials.

Despite worldwide use of lithium batteries, the exact dynamics of their operation has been elusive. Using a small (roughly two millimeters wide) cylindrical battery, researchers working at Argonne National Laboratory captured 3D images of structural changes during the battery charge and discharge cycles.
The images showed how the changes of electrode materials at lithium/solid-electrolyte interfaces determine the behavior of solid-state batteries. The researchers found that battery operation caused tiny voids — resolved up to 1-2 microns in size, about 50 times smaller than the width of a human hair — to form at the interface. This action created a loss of contact that was the primary cause of cell failure.
Lithium-ion batteries currently rely on a liquid electrolyte to carry ions back and forth between electrodes within the battery during charge and discharge cycles. The liquid coats the electrodes, allowing free movement of the ions.
Rapidly evolving solid state battery technology uses a solid electrolyte instead of a liquid one. The switch to a solid electrolyte could boost energy density and improve safety. But removing lithium from electrodes can create voids at interfaces and cause reliability issues that limit how long the batteries can operate.
To counter this, the researchers suggest creating structured interfaces through different deposition processes to try to maintain contact through the cycling process. Their research was reported in the journal Nature Materials.
