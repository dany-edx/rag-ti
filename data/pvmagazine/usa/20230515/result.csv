The Calgary, Alberta-based company announced it will launch an 800 ton-per-day solar glass facility, expanding beyond its original plans to add 550 tons-per-day. This equates to about 6 GW per year of solar glass production, driven largely by strong demand for U.S. solar manufacturing.
The facility will be capable of producing a range of patterned solar glass specifications, including standard 3.2 mm thick front-glass for the residential and commercial rooftop market as well as 2.0 mm thick glass required for the bifacial utility market.
The company has entered into a preliminary construction agreement for the production site that places a maximum cost of $880 million. The offtake agreements combine for a minimum of 62% of the company’s planned output capacity, with the option to expand to about 77% of planned output capacity.
“With strong revenue visibility through binding commercial off-take agreements and a high degree of certainty with capital costs and operational performance through our EPC agreement we are confident in our ability to commercialize this high return project, supporting the global energy transition,” said Glenn Leroux, president and chief executive officer, Canadian Premium Sand.
The company expects the project to provide $300 million to $330 million of annual revenues, $170 million to $190 million of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and over 18% unlevered before-tax internal rate of return.
On May 3, 2023, the province of Manitoba issued the company an Environmental Act license to construct and operate its proposed patterned solar glass manufacturing facility on the site secured in the city of Selkirk, Manitoba. The receipt of this license secures a regulatory requirement and removes a path item from the development schedule.
The new facility being built by CPS uses the high-purity, low-iron silica sand from its wholly owned Wanipigow quarry leases. CPS said it intends to power the facility with renewable energy, which reduces the carbon footprint of producing the glass. The company also said it plans to use recycled water in the manufacturing process along with waste heat recovery.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/15/bipartisan-bill-to-promote-use-of-industrial-heat-pumps-in-rural-areas/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 15, 2023",Bipartisan bill to promote use of industrial heat pumps in rural areas,"Senator Peter Welch (D-VT) and Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) introduced the Heat Pump Energy Assistance and Training (HEAT) Act to support the increased use of industrial heat pumps in rural areas. The HEAT Act would create a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) program to support the deployment.
Funding would come from the USDA’s Rural Energy for America (REAP) program, which received an increase of $1.2 million under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The HEAT Act is designed to help the USDA provide technical assistance and guidance on heat pump installation and usage, thereby facilitating the electrification of on-farm energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
“This bill will help our rural businesses, farms, and ranches access heat pumps with support from USDA—that’s good for the planet and for farms’ and businesses’ bottom lines,” said Senator Welch. “I’m proud to join Sen. Marshall to introduce this important bipartisan bill.”
“Farmers and ranchers are constantly looking for ways to decrease volatility in input costs and the use of industrial heat pumps could help on farm resiliency, especially when cold weather drives up the cost of propane,” said Senator Marshall. “The HEAT Act would direct the USDA to ensure they have the appropriate materials to help educate and train folks on the availability and use of on-farm industrial heat pumps.”
Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said commercial scale heat pumps small businesses in rural areas reduce volatile energy costs and cut carbon emissions.
This Act follows the recent Department of Energy announcement that it is committing $250 million to domestic heat pump manufacturing. Governed by the Inflation Reduction Act, the funding is to be used to build a clean energy economy, create new manufacturing jobs and helping families save money on their energy bills.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/15/major-u-s-solar-asset-owner-agrees-to-panel-recycling-pilot/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 15, 2023",Major U.S. solar asset owner agrees to panel recycling pilot,"Major solar asset owner AES Corporation signed a recycling services agreement with Solarcycle, a tech-driven PV recycler. The pilot agreement will involve a construction breakage and end-of-life solar panel waste evaluation across the company’s entire asset portfolio.
Under the agreement, AES will send damaged or retired panels to Solarcycle’s Odessa, Texas facility to be recycled and repurposed. Valuable materials like glass, silicon, and metals such as silver, copper, and aluminum will be reclaimed at the site.
“To strengthen U.S. energy security, we must continue to support domestic supply chains,” said Leo Moreno, president, AES Clean Energy. “As one of the world’s leading energy solution providers, AES is committed to sustainable business practices that accelerate these goals. This agreement is an important step in building a vibrant secondary market for end-of-life solar materials and getting us closer to a true domestic circular solar economy.”
AES announced its long-term growth strategy includes plans to triple its renewables portfolio to 25 GW 30 GW of solar, wind and storage assets by 2027 and fully exit investment in coal by 2025. This increased commitment to renewables places increased importance on responsible end-of-life practices for the company’s assets.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory projects that by 2040, recycled panels and materials could help meet 25% to 30% of U.S. domestic solar manufacturing needs.
What’s more, without changes to the current structure of solar panel retirements, the world could witness some 78 million tons of solar trash disposed in landfills and other waste facilities by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). It predicts the U.S. will contribute 10 million metric tons of trash to that 2050 total. To put into context, the U.S. dumps almost 140 million tons of waste each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
A 2021 report by Harvard Business Review said it costs an estimated $20-$30 to recycle one panel but sending it to a landfill costs around $1 to $2. With poor market signals to recycle panels, more work is needed to be done to establish a circular economy.
Solarcycle said its technology can extract more than 95% of the value in a solar panel. The company was awarded a Department of Energy $1.5 million research grant to further assess refinement processes and maximize recovered material value.
“Solarcycle is excited to be working with AES – one of the largest solar asset owners in America – on this pilot program to assess their existing and future recycling needs. As demand for solar energy grows rapidly in the United States, it is critical to have proactive leaders like AES who are committed to developing a more sustainable and domestic supply chain for the solar industry,” said Suvi Sharma, chief executive officer and co-founder of Solarcycle.
In July 2022, the Department of Energy announced a funding opportunity that made available $29 million to support projects that increase the reuse and recycling of solar technologies, develop PV module designs that reduce manufacturing costs, and advance the manufacturing of PV cells made from perovskites. Of the $29 million, $10 million in spending launched by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will be directed toward PV recycling.
Rystad estimates peak solar energy implementation in 2035 of 1.4 TW, by which time the recycling industry should be able to supply 8% of the polysilicon, 11% of the aluminum, 2% of the copper, and 21% of the silver needed by recycling solar panels installed in 2020 to meet the material demand. The result will be increased ROI for the solar industry, an enhanced supply chain for materials, as well as a reduction in the need for carbon intensive mining and refinery processes.

The new funding commitment will provide expansion into additional markets nationwide for PosiGen, with a direct focus on serving households with high energy burdens who stand to benefit the most from transitioning to clean energy. PosiGen said the funding will be put to use in new states and communities prioritized by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with an emphasis on Energy Communities and Low-Income Communities.
Based in Metaire, Louisiana, PosiGen works to close the clean energy affordability gap by making solar and energy efficiency available to all homeowners regardless of income. To date, the company has deployed solar and residential energy efficiency solutions to more than 25,000 customers in 10 U.S. states.
“Deploying clean energy is no longer enough,” said Thomas Neyhart, chief executive officer of PosiGen. “It’s clear that for us to meet our climate goals as a nation and create an inclusive economy, we need to focus our efforts on clean energy jobs and equitable access to these technologies that provide savings to those who need it most.”
In conjunction with the Brookfield credit facility, PosiGen is renewing its long-term credit structure with the Connecticut Green Bank.
“Our partnership with PosiGen began in 2015 when an RFP to support low- and moderate-income homeowners was launched, bringing PosiGen to Connecticut,” said Bryan Garcia, president and chief executive officer of the Connecticut Green Bank. “The successful public-private partnership Solar for All helped increase solar deployment in LMI communities by 320% between 2015 and 2020. PosiGen continues to run campaigns in underserved communities helping those with the highest energy burden access solar and energy efficiency to reduce their costs.”
On April 4, the Internal Revenue Services issued guidance on energy communities, a section of the IRA that affords an additional 10% tax credit to the existing 30% solar investment tax credit for projects that are installed in designated energy communities. These include:
Formed in 2011, PosiGen has raised over $223 million in equity and debt to date from investors that include Magnetar Capital, Emerson Collective, Irradiant Partners, Activate Capital, The Builders Fund, SJF Ventures and the Kresge Foundation. The company has historically deployed solar and energy efficiency solutions such as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) upgrades for black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/15/enel-green-power-moves-one-step-closer-to-solar-cell-and-module-factory-in-oklahoma/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OKLAHOMA",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 15, 2023",Enel Green Power moves one step closer to solar cell and module factory in Oklahoma,"Last month Enel North America identified Oklahoma as the leading candidate for its new solar cell and module manufacturing facility, and that plan moved one step closer to fruition with a package voted on by the Oklahoma senate.
In a meeting of the joint appropriations committee, a package received initial approval that could give up to $180 million worth of taxpayer incentives. According to an article in The Oklahoman newspaper, the money would come out of leftover cash from its 2022 budget.
The facility, first announced in November 2022, will be operated through the company’s affiliate, 3Sun USA. Initial capacity of the solar cell and module factory is expected to be 3 GW, and Enel stated plans of doubling that capacity to 6 GW at the site. The facility is expected to bring millions of dollars of investment to the state and create more than 1,500 jobs, with production anticipated by late 2024. A stipulation in the bill is that at least 1,400 jobs must be created in order to receive the full amount of incentives.
The solar module factory would reportedly be built in the Tulsa Port of Catoosa, near the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation system. The port encompasses an area of 2,500 acres and is home to over 70 companies in its industrial park.
Enel Green Power North America is no newcomer to the state of Oklahoma. The company has twelve operating wind farms in the state, representing over 2 GW of operating capacity and $3 billion in investment in the state to date. Enel currently has a thirteenth wind farm, the Seven Cowboy Wind Project, under construction. Located in Washita and Kiowa counties, the wind project will have 107 wind turbines that will generate approximately 1.3 TWh of energy annually, equivalent to the electricity needs of over 120,000 U.S. households, and will avoid more than 758,000 tons of C02 emissions a year. The company also built a state-of-the-art training center in Oklahoma to train a workforce for the wind industry.
Senate Bill 1177 and two companion bills, reportedly in support of Enel’s solar factory, head next to the House and Senate floors for a final vote.
If approved, the proposed U.S. factory will be Enel’s second solar manufacturing facility, as it previously announced the expansion of its 3Sun Gigafactory in Catania, Sicily, increasing its production capacity from 200 MW to 3 GW. The U.S. factory will also be one of the few in the country manufacturing cells as well as modules.
Enel Green Power also manages more than 1,200 power plants on five continents with over 59 GW of installed renewable capacity from a mix of wind, solar, hydroelectric and geothermal.

That is soon to change for one electric cooperative located 60 miles east of Louisville, Ky. that procured solar for its 21,000 customers.
The Frankfort Plant Board (FPB) in western Kentucky, an electric company formed in 1943, has deployed six Level 2 ChargePoint EV charging sites in recent years and has provided LED lighting solutions to residents.
Starting on May 1, the electric cooperative began construction of a community solar project f0r use by local residents, small businesses and municipal entities. To that end, FPB retained the services of Solar Energy Solutions, a residential and commercial solar and EV charging station installer in Illinois and Kentucky, to install a 187 kW community solar garden for the city’s inhabitants.
The project will provide 235,000 kWh per year of clean energy to the city, enough power to offset the electric usage of 890 homes per year. Over a 30-year energy output warranty with the installer, the community project will avoid 4,595 metric tons of CO2 emissions from entering the environment.
Solar Energy Solutions provided design work and will complete site work for future phases to be added to FPB’s ground-mounted solar site, including vegetation clearing and fencing.  According to the developer’s website, the company has installed modules of Qcells, SunPower, Longi, Panasonic, Boviet and Silfab Solar for years.
FPB is pursuing this multi-phase solar PV project to offer customers an alternative to rooftop solar installation and reduce costs and barriers to entry for solar ownership. The system will also include low- and moderate-income (LMI) customers to access clean energy as well.
The project contributes to the community and FPB’s progress towards sustaining renewable energy goals and supporting local solar businesses, creating clean energy jobs and workforce.
“The Frankfort Plant Board is working to make renewable energy options more accessible to all of our customers through numerous efforts,” said Gary Zheng, general manager of FPB. “From our net metering policy and value of solar tariff to offering renewable energy credits and investing in a large-scale solar facility in Lyon County, (this) local community solar project with Solar Energy Solutions is special because it is tangible to our customers. They can see it right here in our community and can choose to be a part of it.”
Ashwood Solar I, an 86 MW utility solar facility developed by RWE Renewables America and the Kentucky Municipal Energy Agency, had entered commercial operations in December 2022 on 800 acres in western Kentucky.
Formed in 2006, Solar Energy Solutions is a solar design, engineering and construction company that has deployed more than 2,500 PV and battery systems in Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and serves the residential, commercial, industrial, utility and agriculture markets.
