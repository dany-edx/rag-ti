https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/01/guide-for-understanding-solar-production-losses/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 1, 2023",Guide for understanding solar production losses,"When investing in solar, maximizing production is a common goal. Aurora Solar, a leading solar design and performance software provider, released a guide for understanding the leading causes of energy loss in PV systems, and how to avoid them. 
KWh Analytics, a climate insurance and renewable energy risk management firm, released its 2022 Solar Generation Index and reports that solar assets are broadly performing below expectations. Systems installed since 2015 have broadly underperformed expectations by 7% to 15%, with some regional difference. How can this underperformance be avoided?
Aurora Solar’s Ultimate Guide to PV System Losses includes basic solar performance concepts like the effect of tilt, orientation, and shade on production metrics. The guide walks through how mismatched equipment can cause losses and surveys the effects of incident angle modifiers, module nameplate rating losses, and more.
Tilt and orientation
The angle of panels affects the amount of solar irradiance the system receives over the course of a year. Tilting the array towards the equator will maximize incident irradiance, boosting production, the Aurora report notes.
Making the most of the solar incidence angle is important for production, too. Incidence angle refers to the angle of the panel’s surface compared to the sun’s rays. Incidence angles affect the amount of sunlight that gets through the glass on the front of the panel.
Aurora said that these losses, measured as the incident angle modifier, typically range between 3% to 4.5%. The DeSoto model is used to understand incidence angle modifier effects.
Obstruction
Soiling, or the buildup of dust and other debris on the surface of the panel, is a leading cause of energy loss in some regions. In areas with long dry seasons, it can lead to 5% losses. In regions with frequent dust deposits, it can add 1% to 2% to that figure, and locations near major traffic areas typically have another 1% in losses. In regions with year-round rain, soiling losses typically hover around 2%, Aurora said.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) performance parameters suggests a 5% typical soiling loss in the U.S. is common.
An NREL model found that having one annual cleaning on a system with 1.9% soiling loss would decrease the loss to around 1.5%. Two cleanings per year could drop the average loss to 1.3%, and three cleanings per year would reduce it further to a 1.2% average annual loss. An NREL locational analysis on soiling effects can be found here.
Birds and bird droppings are another production concern. Bird droppings substantially block one or two cells and may not wash away with rain. In modules without bypass diodes, one or two cells being entirely blocked could lead to the entire module losing operation. Aurora advises quick manual cleaning of bird droppings.
Snow loads are another mitigating factor. An NREL study calculated losses ranging from 10-30% for fixed-tilt systems. Snow factors can be difficult to model accurately on an annualized basis, so Aurora recommends measuring on a monthly format. A locational study on snow loss estimates based on various panel tilts can be found here.
Shading is another critically important aspect of system performance. Aurora likens a shaded solar cell to a clog in a pipe. When a cell is shaded, the current through the entire string of cells is reduced. Panels integrate bypass diodes, which allow the array to “skip over” the shaded cell, but at the expense of foregoing any production that could have been harvested from that cell. A Stanford University analysis of shading effects can be found here.
Aurora suggests using module-level power electronics (MLPE) or microinverters to avoid losses from shading.
Environmental losses
Temperature coefficients are another factor to consider in performance. A temperature coefficient is measured as the percentage energy output decreases for every 1-degree Celsius increase above the reference point of 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit).
Certain roofing materials will absorb more heat than others, affecting performance. Panel angles can alter temperature, and Aurora said flat mounted panels typically get hotter. Panel type makes a difference, too. Thin-film panels typically have a lower temperature coefficient than monocrystalline or polycrystalline solar panels.
Modules
Modules on systems with mismatched or long strings can lose another 0.01% to 3% of total production. Aurora uses an assumption of 2% in its modeling for this loss category. Mismatched modules with tight wattage tolerances can lead to another 1% system loss.
Light-induced degradation occurs when the electrical characteristics of crystalline silicon solar cells change when they’re exposed to light. Losses range from 0.5% to 1.5% and happen within the first few hours of the new panel’s exposure.
Module nameplate rating losses represent the loss due to the difference in the stated power of the module compared with how it actually performs at standard test conditions. Aurora suggests no loss occurs in this category for modern modules, as most accurately reflect standard test results.
However, some providers may list a performance range, referred to as “power tolerance”. It is typically expressed as a plus-or-minus percentage. For example, a 250 W panel with a listed +/- 5% power tolerance may produce between 237.5 W to 262.5 W.
Cables 
Wiring losses typically contribute to another 2% in system losses. If the project uses thicker wires on short runs, those losses may be closer to 1%.
“Several components can cause a voltage drop in circuits, including connections, fuses, and resistors. Differences in cable length or size among the parallel strings can also introduce a voltage drop,” according to Aurora.
An NREL study modeled connection losses can contribute to another 0.5% loss. Wiring connectors and bypass diodes have physical imperfections that cause resistance, leading to small voltage drops.
Inverters
Inverter efficiency measures how efficiently DC energy is converted to AC energy. Inverter manufacturers provide both a maximum efficiency rating for performance in ideal conditions, and a weighted efficiency rating for its performance over a range of conditions.
“It’s important to look at the weighted efficiency because an inverter’s efficiency will change based on the capacity it’s carrying. Most inverters peak around 20% load and fall slightly as the load reaches the maximum input rating,” said the Aurora report.
Inverter clipping often occurs in systems at the height of sunny days. When DC output from the panels is greater than the amount of DC power the inverter can convert, clipping loss occurs. Aurora’s NEC Validation Report can help properly size inverters.
Miscellaneous
Publicly available system performance model PVWatts uses a default value of a 3% system availability loss. Aurora said that systems with operations and maintenance or fault alert systems set up may experience availability losses of only 0.5%. Availability includes inverter shutdowns or failures, grid outages, and other events that disconnect the PV system.
Thermal expansion and contraction, UV light, and damage from windblown particles will reduce production over time. Solar panel manufacturer production guarantees provide conservative estimate for production under panel degradation over time.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/01/nabcep-recognition-a-catalyst-for-solar-developer-growth/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSURANCE,MARKETING,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH CAROLINA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 1, 2023",NABCEP recognition a catalyst for solar developer’s growth,"Yes Solar Solutions, a Cary, N.C. residential and commercial solar installer around the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, recently received recertification by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) as an accredited solar installer, and remains the only NABCEP-recognized installer in the state.
Kathy Miller, chief executive officer of the company, touched base with pv magazine USA to discuss the company’s aspirations as it grows and the opportunities presented from NABCEP.
“NABCEP is a gold standard for electrical installers and the only accreditation for solar installation companies,” said Miller, who runs Yes Solar with her husband Stew Miller, who serves as president. “Yes, there are other kinds ‘approvals’ for companies to attain. This was technically our NABCEP recertification this past week, after first accreditation was back in 2013.”
Operating in Duke Energy’s service territory, Yes Solar supplied a vast amount of paperwork, electrical license, and then became a Duke trade ally. The utility is a source of leads for us as well as EnergySage and SolarReviews, Miller said.
“If you put in an inquiry for rooftop solar in the (Research) Triangle area, we’ll come up as a preferred installer via Duke. EnergySage also provides their own gold, silver standard system for preferred installers and also for buying leads, while SolarReviews does essentially the same thing,” Miller said. “Submit lots of paperwork, get a lot of customer site reviews from installations, which effects your score. So it’s kind of a game.”
Being NABCEP-accredited, leads are not necessarily cheaper to the residential and commercial rooftop developer, but the recognition puts Yes Solar’s name higher up on the list of preferred installers, so there is no shortage of opportunities, she said. If a single lead is $150 to buy for an installation, SolarReviews gives the company exclusive leads for jobs, whereas a job offered to three installers may be available for $98, for instance, she said.
Yes Solar generates leads organically straight from its own website, from the utility, EnergySage, SolarReviews and the Solarize the Triangle system. Solarize the Triangle 2022 is a collaboration between the Triangle Council of Governments and the 11 participating communities that put together a request for proposal (RFP) for the bid.
In 2022, Yes Solar won the bid exclusively and is the only installer authorized to contact leads Solarize provides, execute contracts and install the systems, Miller explained.
A low to moderate income (LMI) component of Solarize 2022 uses grant money and negotiates lower prices via group purchasing to install solar on homes that might not have access to solar otherwise, and is expected to roll out in June, Miller said.
Solarize the Triangle 2022, with a contract deadline of March 31, has pushed Solarize into tier 6 of the residential pricing echelon, with more than 1,200 kW enrolled in Tier 6 and fast approaching Tier 7. Customers get a further discount for each tier of enrolled rooftop solar capacity,” Miller said, with the residential platform starting at $3.02 per kW for an averaged sized system, and will go as low as  $2.65 per kW if the company reaches Tier 8.  Customers are already eligible for tens of thousands of dollars in rebates, depending what tier the company finishes, Miller said.
Yes Solar Solutions
Yes Solar installs Hanwha QCells brand modules, Enphase IQ8 microinverters, SnapNRack rack systems with accompanying Tesla Powerwall batteries in select systems participating in the residential Solarize program. The commercial platform uses QCells modules, ReadyRack or EcoFoot2+ racking hardware and SolarEdge inverters.
The company has participated in other Solarize programs across the state of North Carolina since 2014, while the program is ultimately run by SolarCrowdSource, Miller said.
Solarize the Triangle 2023 is holding a workshop and open house on March 16, 2023.
IRA certainty and apprenticeship
Since forming the solar business in 2009, Miller said federal policy under the Inflation Reduction Act has for the first time created a long-term business horizon via the 30% solar investment tax credit, and other mechanisms to enhance solar procurement in Yes Solar’s region.
“Previously by June or July we’d get booked completely on jobs for the year to get done by December for the calendar year,” based on the year to year ITC credit elapsing, “but now we don’t have to get in a frenzy and can complete projects throughout the year,” said Miller.
Yes Solar has grown to 36 employees from 24 employees a year ago, and with federal and a statewide apprenticeship program included, Miller said the company expects to have 45 employees by early 2024.
Miller is part of a workforce development group engaged with local companies and North Carolina State University’s Clean Energy Technology Center, which has a 2023 solar apprenticeship program for college graduates, veterans and other citizens seeking a career transition move, she said.
Yes Solar Solutions
Under North Carolina’s STEPs4GROWTH clean energy workforce training program, participants can earn certificates and build skills to earn a bachelor’s degree.  The system is arranged by sectored partnerships in Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Clean Vehicles and Grid and Storage. At least six universities and high schools are participating in the program.
The NCSU Clean Energy program is holding a March 15 webinar session at 1:30 pm ET to provide a solar workforce development open session for interested candidates seeking a solar career.
The apprenticeship requirement of the IRA requires that any U.S. taxpayer who employs four or more people must also employ at least one qualified apprentice. And, depending on when construction begins on a project, a certain journeyman to apprenticeship ratio must be met.
NABCEP accreditation
NABCEP accreditation is among the most prestigious accreditations that a solar installer can earn. Accreditation provides a way for residential renewable energy installation companies to distinguish themselves by adhering to a set of industry-recognized best practices.
Yes Solar’s NABCEP recertification is a solid marketing tool that gives the company’s founders a source of pride as a North Carolina residential and commercial rooftop installer, of which 75% of its business is residential projects, Miller said.
As the only North Carolina installer to achieve NABCEP accreditation, the company is well positioned to take on its clip rate of about 300 jobs per year, she said. The company reasons that some years vary based on rebates or in-state credits, while its commercial business will see about 30 jobs per year going forward, with about 3 MW of total installed capacity across both businesses, Miller said.  Surety from the federal IRA’s investment tax credit and statewide rebates as a certified Duke Energy ally provide additional incentives that will support the company’s annual clip.
NABCEP is the only objective national accreditation as a solar installer, while installers seeking this recognition should expect to spend up to three months during a rigorous certification process.
Items to consider for PV installers seeking NABCEP accreditation:
Other companies may not qualify for all the credentials necessary for NABCEP, or installers may not have enough qualified and certified professionals, Miller said. “And it’s a lot of work and it feels like only an owner could do it,” she said.
Miller said the NABCEP the approvals are “rigorous and detailed, not just the raw goods.” From an installer’s standpoint, she said the management team took a month of gathering and filing documents and summaries, and NABCEP issued an approval within two months, while the whole process takes three months. One accredited, installers will have to renew their NABCEP certification every three years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/01/oya-renewables-closes-financing-for-new-york-community-solar-pipeline/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 1, 2023",OYA Renewables closes financing for New York community solar pipeline,"OYA Renewables, a energy transition solutions platform, secured a total of $216 million in financial backing for the construction of a slate of 15 community solar development projects throughout New York State, part of its 2023 pipeline.
Of the total financing, $145 million is a construction-to-term loan, with CIT Power and Energy acting as lead on the loan. It was coordinated by a group of participating banks including Amalgamated Bank, Siemens Financial Services, Comerica Bank and Cadence Bank.
OYA secured an additional $71 million in project funding with Monarch Private Capital (MPC) in the form of a tax equity investment. MPC participate in the funding of OYA’s slate of 2023 projects through their ESG-oriented impact funds, and its investors can receive a federal tax credit through its funds when the solar projects are up and running. Several of the projects located within low-income communities will qualify for additional Inflation Reduction Act tax credits of up to 20%, bringing the potential credits to as high as 50%. 
“The level of financial backing we’ve secured via these commitments is another major milestone for OYA. Not only does it significantly increase our asset base, it also advances our transition from being a developer to an independent power producer,” said Manish Nayar, chairman and founder of OYA Renewables. “These types of investments from highly progressive banking partners are critical to the financing of renewable energy projects. Without them, we wouldn’t be the major force we are in the NY community solar market and the US energy transition could not have generated the incredible momentum it’s seeing now.”
The slate of projects being funded are located throughout New York State and are expected to generate almost 100 MWdc of renewable energy per year once complete. Subsequent pipeline projects that OYA has planned for 2024 are currently in preconstruction or late stage permitting.
OYA Renewables is a solar developer with offices in Toronto, Boston and India. Founded in 2009, the company has developed over 1.4 GW  of solar currently deployed in community solar and utility markets and has a pipeline of 9 GW of distributed and utility-scale solar projects across North America. OYA has been certified by both the Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council and the New York & New Jersey Minority Supplier Development Council as a diverse supplier.
OYA has made a significant community solar development push in New York in recent years. Last year the company closed on an exclusive co-development agreement with Omni Navitas to develop, construct, and own 600 MW of community solar projects across the Northeast U.S., at least 240 MW of which will be located in New York.
New York remains one of the major markets for community solar in the United States, passing 1 GW of installed capacity in March 2022. The state has a goal of reaching 70 % of electricity generation from renewable resources by 2030. New York also targets 10 GW of solar by the 2030 deadline.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/01/first-solar-inks-10-1-gw-of-sales-across-four-deals/,"BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 1, 2023",First Solar inks 10.1 GW of sales across four deals,"First Solar, a provider of U.S.-made thin-film solar modules, is having a banner week, booking multiple GW master supply deals out into 2028. The Ohio-based manufacturer announced 10.1 GW of module sales across four deals with leading developers in the utility-scale space, finding buyers for as much as 22 million solar panels in a matter of a few days. 
The orders are for First Solar Series 6, Series 6 Plus, and Series 7 module lines, made with cadmium telluride thin-film technology, a technology that has a lower carbon intensity to manufacture than traditional polysilicon solar cells. 
Image: First Solar
First Solar’s Series 7 modules build on the company’s thin-film cadmium telluride technology with a larger form factor and a new back rail mounting system to deliver increased efficiency, faster installations, and improved lifetime performance. 
Silicon Ranch, a Nashville-based independent power producer, has procured 1.5 GW of advanced U.S.-made thin film solar modules from First Solar, Inc. The deal expands upon the master supply agreement between the two solar businesses that includes a 4 GW transaction announced in April 2022 and, more recently, a 700 MW commitment announced in October 2022, bringing the total supply agreement between the two to 6.2 GW. 
Lightsource bp has signed on to purchase 4 GW of the U.S.-made thin-film modules. Delivery is expected to take place between 2026 and 2028. The order adds on to a 4.3 GW purchase made in 2021, bringing the total supply relationship to 8.3 GW. 
Kansas City, Mo.-based based Savion LLC announced a purchase of 2.6 GW of Series 7 modules. Delivery is pegged for 2025 to 2027. The order is expected to support Savion’s growing pipeline of over 23 GW. The company said it is transitioning to an Independent Power Producer model.
Origis Energy, headquartered in Miami, ordered 2 GW of modules to be delivered in 2026 and 2027. The agreement adds to previous orders and caps a five-year collaboration with 3.4 GW of capacity planned through 2027.
Supply chain transparency and integrity is integral to both parties, said Origis. The developer has signed the Solar Industry Forced Labor Prevention Pledge led by the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA) to comply with standards on forced labor prevention.
First Solar is the only company among the ten largest global solar module manufacturers to be a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the world’s largest industry coalition dedicated to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities in the global supply chain.
The module producer’s $1.1 billion Alabama factory and $185 million expansion of its existing facilities in Ohio are expected to bring its total investment in American manufacturing to over $4 billion. The company’s annual U.S. nameplate manufacturing capacity is forecast to expand to 10.6 GW by 2026. It expects to add at least 850 new manufacturing jobs and over 100 new R&D jobs, taking its total number of direct jobs in the US to over 3,000 people in four states by 2025.
Earnings Highlights
Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar (Nasdaq:FSLR) generated $1 billion of revenue in Q4 2022, representing a 10% increase from $900 million in revenue from Q4 2021, as the solar module producer ended 2022 with a surge of 48.3 GW (DC) of net booking, representing a 2.76x increase over 17.5 GW (DC) net bookings in 2021.
“This momentum is driven by our points of differentiation, including our unique CdTe (Cadmium telluride) technology, vertically integrated manufacturing process, domestic production, and commitment to responsible solar,” said Mark Widmer, chief executive officer. “We enter this year in a significantly stronger commercial, operational, and financial position, with increased R&D investment, new domestic and international capacity coming online, and a new Series 7 product.”
“In addition, we expect to begin benefiting from the advanced manufacturing production tax credits provided for under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act,” Widmer said during a conference call session, though he said the company is awaiting Internal Revenue System and U.S. Treasury guidance regarding implementation of the IRA.  During the call, Widmer said 45X credits recognized are expected to increase in Q2 2023, driven by timing of module volumes sold and overcoming inventory lag.
In 2022, First Solar exited the Japanese project development and operations and maintenance market by selling its Japan business, including a 665 MW (DC) portfolio of solar development assets, to PAG Real Assets for about $496 million.
First Solar’s common stock traded  up 13.3% today, to $191.59 per share, from closing at $169.14 per share on February 28, before releasing its Q4 2022 earnings results.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/01/50-states-of-solar-incentives-minnesota/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MINNESOTA",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 1, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Minnesota,"Minnesota, known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes, has long been ahead of the curve when it comes to clean energy. Earlier this month Governor Walz signed into law a new climate bill that aims for 100% clean energy by 2040. An ambitious goal, but in keeping with some of the state’s other milestones. For example, the state enacted its first net metering law in 1983. In 2013 it became the first state to establish a community solar law. In 2007 it set its renewable portfolio standard (RPS).
The new climate bill establishes a standard for utilities to supply Minnesota customers with electricity generated or procured from clean energy resources, and it gives them time to ramp up. Beginning at an amount equal to 80% of retail sales for public utility customers in Minnesota is the goal for 2030, and that is expected to increase every 5 years to reach 100% for all electric utilities by 2040. However, investor-owned corporate utilities are trying to block local solar from the process, according to the Institute for Local Self Reliance (ILSR).
“Local solar is crucial to unlocking the maximum benefits of our clean energy transition — resilience, equity, jobs, and energy savings. We can’t let big utilities control the market by blocking rooftop and community solar,” said John Farrell, co-director, ILSR.
Utility challenges aside, Minnesotans are already procuring more of their electricity from renewable resources than from fossil fuels. In 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) renewables accounted for 29% of total in-state electricity net generation, coal fueled 26%, nuclear power supplied 24%, and natural gas contributed 21%. Up until 2020, coal was the dominant source, but the tide turned in 2022 when coal supplied less power than renewable sources.

In terms of solar, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that Minnesota has 1.7 GW of capacity installed, making it 16th in the nation, which is up from 29th in 2021. The state procures 3.6% of the state’s electricity from solar.
State incentives
Minnesota’s RPS, established 16 years ago, requires that the state’s electricity providers, with the exception of the state’s largest utility, generate or procure at least 25% of their electricity retail sales from eligible renewable sources by 2025. The largest utility, which also operates the state’s nuclear power plants, has to meet a higher standard. There is also a goal that solar energy account for 10% of statewide electricity retail sales by 2030. In 2018, the state’s utilities already met the 25% requirement.
Net metering
Net metering is a policy that enables electric utility customers with grid-connected solar to get a credit on their electric bill for the energy they produce from their system. Minnesota electricity customers may net meter, however, the rules vary depending on the utility. With public utilities, the maximum eligible system is 1 MW, and for municipal utility customers it’s 40 kW or less. For investor-owned utilities, systems greater than 40 kW in capacity may be limited to generating a maximum of 120% of annual electric consumption. While there isn’t a cap on net metering, a public utility may request ta limit one generation reaches 4% of the utility’s annual electricity sales. Municipal utilities and electric coops may charge net metered customers additional fees to recover associated fixed costs. Getting compensated for net metering in Minnesota also depends on the customer’s utility.
Compensation is at the average annual retail electricity rate for systems 40 kW in capacity or below. For systems between 40 kW and 1 MW, compensation is at the public utility’s avoided cost rate. Alternatively, any customer can request to be compensated in the form of a per-kilowatt-hour credit, which carries over month to month. At the end of the year, customers of public utilities will be compensated at the avoided-cost rate and customers of municipal utilities and electric coops will have their credits expire.
Community solar
Minnesota’s community solar garden (CSG) program has created over 860 MW of solar in the state and thousands of jobs. According to the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association (MnSEIA), the state ranked first in the nation for the largest community solar program for years, but due to outdated rules and gridlocked negotiations, Minnesota has fallen behind and now is second behind New York. Nevertheless, there are over 860 MW of community solar installed in the state as of 2022. MnSEIA notes that “updates to the program are needed to keep Minnesota a leader and create more jobs, economic opportunities, and clean energy across our state”. MnSEIA is working with Xcel Energy, the PUC, and at the Minnesota Legislature to remove the contiguous county restriction, working on community access projects, and much more.
Energy justice
The new climate bill encourages utilities to locate new energy generating facilities in communities where fossil-fuel-generating plants have been retired or are scheduled for retirement and prioritize projects that maximize local employment, including employment of workers from communities where generation has been retired. Additionally, ILSR notes that Minnesota’s community solar program “lacks consideration” for low-income residential subscribers and frontline communities. ILSR recommends that the state address these disparities, suggesting that one option, which can be found in the Illinois community solar policy, is to carve out a portion of program capacity for environmental justice communities.
Landmark solar installation
The North Star Solar Project in Chisago County, Minn. was developed by D.E. Shaw Renewables Investments and came online in 2016. The 100 MW project produces enough electricity to power 19,329 homes and contributes to Xcel Energy’s goal to be 63% carbon free by 2030.
Community Energy
The North Star Project is collaborating with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to develop a vegetation plan that incorporates a mix of grasses and flowers on project land that will be beneficial to wildlife and pollinators.

This report tracks quarterly and annual volumes of orders, wafer material shipments and customer allocations.
Daqo New Energy
In Q4 2022, Daqo New Energy  (NYSE:DQ) sold 23,400 metric tons (MT) of polysilicon, or double its sales volume of 11,642 MT sold in Q4 2021.  The average production cost dropped to $7.69 per kg in the quarter, compared to $14.11 per kg a year ago. Overall, Daqo produced 33,702 metric tonnes of polysilicon, a 47.2% increase over 23,616 metric tons produced in Q4 2021.
Revenue for Q4 2022 was $864.3 million in Q4 2022,  a 118% increase compared to  $395.5 million in Q4 2021
‘We are very pleased to report record results for the year 2022. Our annual polysilicon production volume was 133,812 MT in 2022, exceeding our guidance of 130,000 to 132,000, and 54.5% higher than 86,567 MT produced in 2021,” said Longgen Zhang, chief executive officer of Daqo New Energy.
The Shanghai-based polysilicon producer entered 2023 with plans for construction of phase 5A of its 100,000 MT polysilicon capacity expansion project in inner Mongolia, with construction to be completed and the start of pilot production in April 2023, and full capacity expected by June 30, 2023.  With the expansion, Daqo said it expects to produce 190,000 to 195,000 MT of polysilicon in 2023.
First Solar
Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar (Nasdaq:FSLR) generated $1 billion of revenue in Q4 2022, representing a 10% increase from $900 million in revenue from Q4 2021, as the solar module producer ended 2022 with a surge of 48.3 GW (DC) of net booking, representing a 2.76x increase over 17.5 GW (DC) net bookings in 2021.
“This momentum is driven by our points of differentiation, including our unique CdTe (Cadmium telluride) technology, vertically integrated manufacturing process, domestic production, and commitment to responsible solar,” said Mark Widmer, chief executive officer. “We enter this year in a significantly stronger commercial, operational, and financial position, with increased R&D investment, new domestic and international capacity coming online, and a new Series 7 product.”
“In addition, we expect to begin benefiting from the advanced manufacturing production tax credits provided for under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act,” Widmer said during a conference call session, though he said the company is awaiting Internal Revenue System and U.S. Treasury guidance regarding implementation of the IRA.
During the call, Widmer said 45X credits recognized are expected to increase in Q2 2023, driven by timing of module volumes sold and overcoming inventory lag.
In 2022, First Solar exited the Japanese project development and operations and maintenance market by selling its Japan business, including a 665 MW (DC) portfolio of solar development assets, to PAG Real Assets for about $496 million.
FTC Solar
Solar tracker FTC Solar (Nasdaq:FTCI) posted $26.2 million in Q4 2022 revenue, down 74% from $101.7 million of revenue in Q4 2021, driven by near-term challenges due to Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) module constraints.  The company continued to execute by adding $240 million in bookings and “expects continued momentum in the second half of 2023.”
For Q1 2023, the Austin, Texas-based company provided $36 million – $40 million of revenue guidance, with sequential improvement throughout the year based on easing of UFLPA trade constraints.
In February 2023, FTC signed a JV with steel fabricator Taihua New Energy to build a new U.S. steel facility in Sealy, Texas, called Alpha Steel LLC, which is expected to begin commercial operations in mid-2023. The JV agreement bolsters FTC’s domestic supply chain and achieves domestic content adder benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act provisions for sourcing of U.S.-made content for solar systems.
Contracted and awarded orders as Feb. 28 were $1.2 billion, and FTC’s pipeline has grown to a record high of 110 GW. The majority of its new additions this period were not impacted by UFLPA, the company noted. Its current backlog now includes $400 million of non-UFLPA impacted projects as FTC continues to diversify its sales efforts.
