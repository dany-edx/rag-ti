The project is expected to generate enough electricity to power 21,000 homes.
The project was developed, financed, and constructed by Lightsource bp, which will remain as operator of the asset. The project represents a $125 million private capital investment in new energy infrastructure for Arkansas. Over 300 construction jobs were generated by the project.
The Arkansas project is comprised of 295,000 First Solar modules, smart trackers from Array Technology, and steel from Attala Steel in Mississippi.
Conway Corp is the city-owned utility system in Conway, Arkansas. It was created in 1929 when city leaders organized the corporation to operate the city’s electric light plant to raise revenue to help maintain Hendrix College and Central Baptist College in Conway.
“Work on this project began in 2019 and it is one of the most significant projects for Conway Corp since our incorporation in 1929. I’m proud of the team that worked on this project and the way it fulfills key parts of our mission by providing reliable and environmentally sound electricity to our community,” said Bret Carroll, chief executive officer, Conway Corp.
The project includes a five-acre pollinator garden, providing a critical habitat for monarch butterflies and over 46 species of native plants. Read a case study about the pollinator habitat here.
Conway Corp is expected to abate 162,800 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually as a result of the project, equivalent to taking 35,400 fuel-burning cars off the road for healthier air.
“Our partners at Conway Corp are bringing a host of benefits to their community, from affordable energy to ecosystem health, economic development and beyond,” said Emilie Wangerman, interim chief executive officer, Lightsource bp USA.
Since 2019, the Lightsource bp team has brought into operation or initiated construction on 3.2 GW of U.S solar projects with capital costs of nearly $4 billion across 11 states in the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/19/who-supports-the-clean-energy-transition/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 19, 2023",Who supports the clean energy transition?,"The U.S. Energy Reputation Report, 2023, based on a survey conducted by Caliber that polled 5,600 people, finds several divides in the way U.S. residents perceive the transition to clean energy.
The report finds that two camps have formed; one seeking to reduce carbon emissions despite potentially higher costs, while the other just wants to reduce energy prices. However, the majority (73%) of American’s, regardless of political affiliation, age or other demographic, support the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.
Where age comes into play, however, the younger group (age 18 to 44) overwhelmingly (80%) support the transition, while only 58% of older people (64 and up) support the move from fossil fuels to renewables.
The report also finds disparity in views from low-income to high-income Americans, with 64% of low-income people supporting the transition because of a greater concern about stable energy bills as opposed to the importance of moving to clean energy. The report finds that 86% of high-income Americans support the transition.

The report found a similar disparity along party lines, with 87% of Democrats supporting the transition, while just 62% of Republicans are on board. In addition, Democrats appear to be better informed on the topic, with only 5% being “not sure” about their position on the topic, while 17% of Republicans and 24% of Libertarians say they are “not sure.”
President Biden’s Clean Energy Plan calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50% to 52% below 2005 levels in 2030, reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and delivering 40% of the benefits from federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. The Caliber study found that 70% of U.S. respondents have heard of the plan, but younger people (age 25 to 44) have higher awareness than those over 44 year of age.
Those who support the plan do so out of concern for insufficient energy supply (49%), rising energy costs (48%) and higher taxes (36%). Of those who do not support the plan, 58% do so because of rising energy costs, 53% because of concern for insufficient power supply, and 53% see rising taxes as a deterrent.
As far as those who support the plan, several demographic disparities were noted. For example, men (3/4) have a more favorable view of the plan than women (2/3).
Looking at support on the basis of political affiliation, 80% of Democrats polled have heard of the plan and of those, 88% like it, with 12% against. Of Republicans polled, 62% have heard of the plan, and 51% of those like it, and 49% against.
While more than half of the people polled like the President’s clean energy plan, there is disagreement about the ambition of the plan. A third of those disliking the plan believe it is too ambitious, but of those who like the plan, one in five still think it is too ambitious. The report authors postulate that the difference in these opinions may be because some are willing to “endure the hardship of the necessary change.”
Taking action
Another interesting finding in the study is that 60% of Americans cannot name the exact source of energy that heats or powers their homes, pointing out the importance of basic energy education. Beyond that, the report authors point to the importance that energy companies recognize the issues brought up in this study so that they can shape clear and consistent messaging that addresses concerns.
While most Americans have heard of the country’s energy plan, the authors note that there is a “knowledge gap” between different demographics, most notably among women and Republicans. It is up to energy companies, the authors contend, to be proactive by shaping messaging to raise awareness and educate about the energy plan, while also sharing information on initiatives that can mitigate financial stress.

This fell short of Wall Street expectations of $24.26 billion and $0.73 per share. Share prices have dropped nearly 10% following the quarterly report.
While the electric vehicle division makes up most of Tesla’s earnings, it is also a major player in residential solar and energy storage. The company deployed 49 MW of solar in Q3, 2023, peeling back from 66 MW in the previous quarter, and falling 48% from last year’s Q3 total.
Tesla is not immune to the heavy headwinds of regulatory changes and increased interest rates that are dealing damage to the U.S. residential solar sector.
Despite the pullback in solar deployment, the company’s energy storage business sustained significant growth to make up for the dip in solar sales. Storage deployments increased 90% year-over-year in Q3 to 4 GWh. The company deploys both Powerwall home energy storage and Megapack grid-scale batteries and is increasingly becoming involved in lucrative battery aggregation and grid services businesses, including the rollout of virtual power plants (VPP) in emerging markets like Texas.
“And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business. Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit,” said chief executive officer Elon Musk on the earnings call.
The company debuted its Powerwall 3 battery in September, which is set to have its first commercial deployments in 2024. The unit will be DC-coupled with Tesla’s solar inverter, utilizing the inverter for grid connectivity. The combined solar and battery inverter can deliver up to 11.5 kWac of power.
Looking ahead, Tesla sees a huge runway for growth for solar, including rooftop solar. Its Master Plan 3 report proposes a need for 3 TW of solar generation in the U.S., including 15 million rooftops. There are less than 3 million single-family rooftops with solar installed across the U.S. today.
In addition to generation resources, the Master Plan estimates a need for 6.5 TWh of 8-hour lithium-ion batteries, 6.9 TWh of industrial thermal storage, and 418 GW of electrolyzers providing 107 TWh of hydrogen storage facilities in the United States. The plan also considers an additional 1.2 TWh of distributed stationary batteries as replacements for over 200 GW of existing backup generator capacity.
As for the macro financial environment, Musk issued warnings that heightened interest rates may lead to a bumpy road ahead. High rates have prevented Tesla from going “full tilt” on ramping up its new Mexico gigafactory.
“I’m not saying things will be bad. I’m just saying they might be,” said Musk. “And I think Tesla is an incredibly capable ship, but we need to make sure as — if the macroeconomic conditions are stormy, even if the best ship is still going to have tough times, the weaker ships will sink. We’re not going to sink. But even a great ship in a storm has challenges. Now that storm will apply to everyone, not just to us and not just to auto industry.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/19/downward-trend-for-pv-module-prices-losing-momentum/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 19, 2023",Downward trend for PV module prices losing momentum,"From pv magazine Germany
The downward trend in module prices across the board could not be stopped this month, but it is clearly losing momentum. Manufacturers and dealers of solar modules are still reducing their prices, but only in small steps, and seek to slowly approach the price level accepted by the market. For a long time now, nothing has been earned from products at this price level.
In China too, it’s all about minimizing damage, because unsold stocks generate avoidable costs and the risk of progressive depreciation is always present. In order not to have to pay extra for transport costs, export quantities to Europe have been drastically reduced by Asian producers in recent weeks.
Interestingly, module prices on continents other than Europe and Asia are not as affected by the price decline. The price gap is sometimes drastically different – in the United States, it is up to 100% compared to the European prices for modules with comparatively low efficiency, which means with monocrystalline PERC cells.
However, products produced in China cannot easily be redirected to America because there are strict import restrictions there. This keeps prices there high and market volume low. We will be curious to see whether the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) really has the desired and needed impact on local PV production capacity. At least with the currently very high purchase and installation costs in the United States, it is rather unlikely.
Transferring this model to other markets is risky, although some non-Chinese manufacturers are already celebrating and shifting their sales focus and scope of operations to the United States. An industry cannot be kept alive permanently through subsidies, we should all have learned that by now.
Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers cannot endure a sustained period of low prices for long and are already trying to stabilize prices again through artificial shortages. If demand picks up again towards the end of the year due to the current price situation, the downward trend could soon be stopped. There is hardly a market participant who is happy with the current situation.
Overview of the price points differentiated by technology in October 2023, including the changes compared to the previous month (as of Oct. 15):

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/19/how-to-stop-grading-the-land-for-solar-and-learn-to-love-natures-curves/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",,"OCTOBER 19, 2023",How to stop grading the land for solar and learn to love nature’s curves,"Few solar development sites are flat, because the world is not flat. And that poses a problem for conventional solar mounting systems, which weren’t designed to handle the undulations and hills that project developers routinely encounter.  
Solar’s astounding growth means that more projects are being sited on ‘topographically challenging’ ground. But the mounting systems that literally support the solar industry grew up on flatter land, with at least some grading assumed.  
For one recent 170-MW project on rolling terrain in Virginia, grading the site flat would have meant moving the equivalent of 123 Olympic swimming pools’ worth of dirt and adding roughly $10 million in construction cost. 
All that grading stirs up dust clouds and runoff, sacrifices topsoil, and sends dump trucks through towns, driving up community concerns along with project budgets. These terrain challenges are only getting more acute as the industry grows. So today, a more holistic approach is required when siting solar. 
The toll of grading for conventional trackers 
Conventional solar trackers use a single torque tube that spans an entire row. This design works well for flat sites, and less so in almost every other case. 
For starters, hardly any site is truly flat. Suppose you were to build a solar array on an American football field. That field may look flat, but it actually has a one-foot rise in the middle so that water runs off — which you’d have to account for with your foundations. 
To compensate for the rigidity of conventional tracker systems in a non-flat world, solar developers typically have brought in earthmoving equipment to grade a site level enough to handle a traditional tracker system. All that grading adds to project development costs and leads to other serious problems.  
Dust clouds raised by site grading have been so bad as to close a nearby interstate highway, forcing developers to bust their budgets on measures to suppress and mitigate the dust. Trucks constantly prowl these earthmoving operations, spraying thousands of gallons of water to keep dust from rising. 
In Colorado, a solar construction firm spent more than $3 million and hired six full-time people just to implement dust control measures at the site of a 200-MW solar project. The efforts still fell short and local officials slapped more than $220,000 in fines on the developer. Those officials found that dust from the site affected the health and wellbeing of local residents. 
And in Virginia, grading at two solar projects affected local farmers and led not only to financial penalties on the asset owners, but also contributed to long-term regulatory measures. One poorly graded site led to so much sediment runoff that a local creek turned brown. In that instance, the asset owner was fined $245,000 for the environmental mess created.  
These issues don’t just affect individual projects. In 2022, Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality issued more restrictive stormwater and permitting requirements for solar projects in response to concerns over water quality, deeming solar panels to be impervious surfaces. Community concerns have also spurred individual counties in the state to enact regulations and solar moratoria to restrict project development. 
To be sure, site grading can fuel local opposition that can scuttle an otherwise beneficial project.  
And these surprises can come up throughout the life of a project, so getting construction permitting doesn’t mean a developer is in the clear. 
The industry is still talking about one farmer who learned that his land would be graded flat. He not only turned down a revenue-producing solar lease, but helped organize other farmers to oppose the project’s permit.  
Grading—and the environmental damage that comes from forcing a site to conform to rigid tracker specs—is solar’s dirty little secret. The best way to mitigate this risk is to just stop grading. 
Learning to love nature’s curves 
It’s a given that rolling terrain isn’t going away. So it makes sense to deploy tracker technology that works with the land rather than fighting it, by using designs that offer highly flexible bearings, non-continuous torque tubes, and standardized short piles that reduce the steel requirement. 
All-terrain trackers from Nevados, the first manufacturer to develop them for the industry, can accept angle changes of up to 15 degrees (26%) between posts, and all bearings can handle maximum slopes of up to 20 degrees (37%), although standard piles are typically limited to installation on maximum slopes of 11 degrees (20%). 
Nevados offers three separate bearing options to allow the torque tubes to angle up and down with the terrain within a ‘cradle,’ for a structure that is highly adaptable to naturally variable topography. Bearing types are mixed and matched throughout a project site to maximize available land for solar deployment, using custom design software that comes bundled with controls and engineering services for more complex sites. 
Data gathered as part of the planning and construction of one 50 MW solar facility in Louisiana, which tested all-terrain trackers on an ungraded portion of the site, found they could reduce grading requirements and disturbed land acreage by at least 95% if not more.  
Elsewhere, this seemingly simple technology has opened up potential greenfield sites that had previously been deemed non-viable for utility-scale installation. Older sites that used fixed-tilt racking could potentially be upgraded to increase energy yield.  
A robust American supply chain can also help a project qualify for domestic content adders to the solar Investment Tax Credit under the Inflation Reduction Act.  
The inherent risks and harms due to excessive site grading are easily avoided with such more flexible trackers, which experience has shown can also improve a project’s chances of winning community acceptance. 

Yezin Taha is founder of Nevados Engineering and innovator of the first all-terrain solar trackers for uneven terrain.  
pv magazine will host a webinar with Nevados on all-terrain trackers on October 30, at 12 p.m. EDT.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/19/peak-energy-moves-toward-establishing-a-domestic-market-for-sodium-ion-energy-storage-systems/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"OCTOBER 19, 2023",Peak Energy moves toward establishing a domestic market for sodium-ion energy storage systems,"Peak Energy has set out to use cheaper and more abundant raw materials to design sodium-ion battery energy storage systems (BESS). While a sodium-ion BESS is 30% less energy dense than those made from lithium-ion chemistries, they are also about 20% to 40% cheaper, says Landon Mossburg, who co-owns Peak Energy with Cameron Dales. Moreover, the U.S. has 19% of the world’s soda ash, from which sodium is derived. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, six companies in Wyoming and California comprise the U.S. soda ash industry. which is the largest in the world. 
Peak Energy sees the ability to scale as another bottleneck. To overcome this challenge, the company is leveraging partnerships with international and domestic sodium cell manufacturers to introduce this technology to the U.S., while generating enough income to establish a local engineering site and gigafactory. 
“We’ll do this in three phases,” Mossburg said. 
Currently ongoing, Phase I involves importing the sodium-ion battery cells from manufacturers based in Asia, Europe and North America while producing packs in the U.S. The company plans to launch small-scale demonstration systems early next year with an expected energy capacity and duration of 3MW/h. 
“When stacked together, they can create a larger scale utility system,” Mossburg said. The company will scale these systems to several 100MW/h commercial projects throughout 2026. 
Peak Energy is currently testing cells from potential partners to decipher the best technology for U.S. markets. However, Dales suggests their systems will likely consist of a hard carbon anode and a layered oxide, Prussian white or polyanion cathode. 

During Phase II, Peak Energy will begin manufacturing both cells and packs domestically, “That will likely be late 2027, early 2028,” Mossburg said. The company will continue to license cell technology from a third party for its BESS’ during this time.
In 2028, Peak Energy aims to open an engineering site in the Denver or Boulder, Colo., area to design the chemistry and technology of sodium-ion cells. These would be manufactured into storage systems at a gigafactory, likely based in the U.S. Midwest or Southeast region. When fully operational, the facility is expected to produce up to 5GW/h of battery cells per year. Moreover, Peak Energy plans to incorporate improvements into its licensed technology to optimize the cost and performance benefits of its storage systems. 
Peak Energy states it’s exploring partnerships with businesses owning intellectual property or exhibiting a deep understanding of sodium-ion battery technology. The feedback that Peak has received indicates that the companies are also profoundly interested in deploying their product domestically by leveraging Peak Energy’s ability to scale manufacturing.scale manufacturing capabilities. This includes businesses based in China, as the country offers less stringent off-take agreements enabling Peak Energy to scale sodium-ion storage without hard evidence of committed customers, which can be a common requirement of European and North American partners. 
“You need around a billion dollars for a small-scale GW factory, think less than 10 GW,” Mossburg said. “So, the fastest way to get to market is to build a system with cells available from a third party, and China is the only place building capacity to ship enough cells.” 
Peak Energy also understands the value of creating an alternative supply chain down the road. This will help to maintain green grid resiliency if China’s supply chain experiences challenges. 
Investors
To date, Peak Energy has received $10 million in equity investments. California-based capital market company Eclipse Ventures provided $5 million in a seed round, followed by Japanese electronics conglomerate TDK Ventures’ $5 million investment. The latter owns Amperex Technology Limited, which produced Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world’s largest lithium-ion producer. In 2021, CATL announced launching lithium-free, sodium-ion batteries for commercial use. Dales suggests this partnership brings Peak Energy’s strategic global relationships to help enhance its supply chain. 
Incentives
Peak Energy is expected to qualify for model production and domestic content credits from the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax provisions to incentivize clean energy security. This should happen once the company starts producing cells and packs in the country. 
“We expect to qualify for the domestically produced battery cells at $25 kW/h and another $10 kW/h for domestic module production. On top of that, our customers would receive a 10% tax credit when they deploy projects based on our technology because it’s domestically produced,” Dales said. Potential Peak Energy customers include utility providers, independent power producers and industrial companies. 
The company is also in the early stages of a conversation with the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office, which finances domestic projects that advance the deployment of clean energy infrastructure. “We haven’t yet decided the best category for us to go under. That’ll probably happen a year from now,” Dales said. 
Peak Energy states that its gigafactory and engineering site will generate over 1,000 full-time jobs once running. The location for the Denver, Boulder, Colo., engineering facility was selected due to its proximity to talent and big solar markets (Texas and California). Peak Energy’s gigafactory will likely be in the Midwest or Southeast region due to the number of new automotive plants in the area, Dales said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/19/california-sets-first-appliance-standards-to-balance-renewables/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 19, 2023",California sets first appliance standards to balance renewables,"The California Energy Commission (CEC) has issued flexible demand standards for swimming pool controls. Starting in September 2025, pool controls sold in the state must default to operating pool equipment when electricity prices and greenhouse gas emissions are low. Both conditions are met at times of high renewable generation.
The commission has set a goal to achieve 7 GW of load flexibility by 2030, to complement 38 GW of new clean generation capacity the state projects to need by that year. Load flexibility can shift some consumption to times of high renewable generation, reducing renewables curtailment.
The pool control standards will help meet the 7 GW load flexibility goal, the commission said, delivering nearly 400 MW of flexible demand by 2030. The commission estimates that consumers on a time-of-use rate plan can save $1,131 over the life of the pool control, through operation when electricity costs are lowest.
To lay the groundwork for improved time-of-use rates, the commission set a requirement last year for the state’s large utilities and large community choice aggregators to develop retail electric rates that change at least hourly to reflect grid costs, and post those rates to a state database.
Working in coordination, another California agency, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), had previously decided to institute a rulemaking to advance demand flexibility through electric rates, a practice sometimes called “sending prices to devices.” That decision was informed by a CPUC staff white paper on opt-in dynamic pricing.
The CEC was granted authority to adopt flexible demand appliance standards in 2019 by California Senate Bill 49. Pool controls are “the first of many devices” expected to be “upgraded,” the CEC said.
A Pacific Northwest National Laboratory study found that allowing customers to opt for real-time pricing, and to shift some consumption to lower-priced periods, would lower customer bills 10% to 17%, including savings for those who don’t opt in, and could save $33 billion per year nationwide.
Pilot studies in California have demonstrated that real-time pricing works, and the CPUC has noted that “several jurisdictions currently offer real-time pricing rates.”
The California Community Choice Association has called on the CPUC to expand statewide a pilot program for opt-in dynamic pricing for farmers using automated agricultural pumping equipment.
California’s new pool control standards include cybersecurity standards to protect consumers using flexible demand appliances connected to the internet. User consent is required for the device to send and receive information, including data on changing electricity prices.
The CEC said the new standards complement the agency’s “historical role in adopting world-leading standards for appliance efficiency, building energy efficiency, and load management.”
