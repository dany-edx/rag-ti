According to the initial Roth note, the detained shipment is being withheld until the vendor provides documentation showing the source of the quartzite, the raw material for making polysilicon, though the vendor at the time was not named.
pv magazine has reached out to Jinko for comment on the detained shipment reports, and will provide said comment once it is received.
If the reports are confirmed, the result could be a much more dire situation than was initially regarded when the Department of Homeland Security Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans released its June 17 strategy for preventing the importation of goods mined or produced using forced labor under the UFLPA.
Under that plan, only a handful of polysilicon suppliers with operations in Xinjiang were listed, along with MGS supplier Hoshine Silicon, and the action was seen as a best-case scenario for the solar industry, with other companies thought to be at-risk left off the list of banned imports.
It was also believed by ROTH at the time that companies which have already gone through the Hoshine WRO enforcement process would not be a focus of initial UFLPA enforcement, though the reported detention of Jinko product would prove this belief inaccurate.
The issue of quartzite documentation is an especially tricky one, as ROTH shares that, to its knowledge, none of the module vendors have quartzite documentation, and that two of the leading suppliers, Wacker and Hemlock semiconductor, would currently find it difficult to provide this information. It is possible that this is information the companies could provide, but doing so would take time. If the reports are confirmed, untold capacity of U.S.-bound product shipments could now be in jeopardy.
The same sources who provided reports on potentially detained Jinko shipments also believe that Trina Solar has had product detained, and pv magazine has reached out to Trina for comment on these additional reports.

According to the note, the detained shipment is being withheld until the vendor provides documentation showing the source of the quartzite, the raw material for making polysilicon, though details outside of the material seized and confirmation of the seizure are sparse, as is typical with CBP trade enforcement. The product was seized as part of the enforcement of the recently-enacted Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
The issue of quartzite documentation is an especially tricky one, as ROTH shares that, to its knowledge, none of the module vendors have quartzite documentation, and that two of the leading suppliers, Wacker and Hemlock Semiconductor, would currently find it difficult to provide this information. It is possible that this is information the companies could provide, but doing so would take time and put other shipments to the U.S. in jeopardy.
In response to the seizure, Hemlock Semiconductor released the following statement:
“To ensure our long-standing commitment to a resilient and environmentally sustainable solar supply chain, Hemlock Semiconductor sources all metallurgical-grade silicon from suppliers using quartz mined from North and South American sources. Materials from ethical and traceable suppliers are critical to the production of our hyper-pure polysilicon. We are in compliance with CBP’s requirements, and are working closely with our partners to provide material manifest and proof of supply chain security documentation.”
Passed in Dec. 2021, UFLPA seeks to ban the imports of all products from Xinjiang unless the products are determined to not be connected to forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. Xinjiang is home to 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, an essential material in conventional solar modules, and there has been concern that implementation of UFLPA would severely disrupt what has already become a strained solar supply chain.
While roughly half of the world’s polysilicon does not come from Xinjiang, it is difficult to trace where every single manufacturer gets all of their polysilicon from, and there could be potential for entire factories to be “contaminated” by a relatively small mix of Chinese polysilicon in an otherwise non-Chinese mix.
While the Department of Homeland Security Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans’ June 30 strategy for preventing the importation of goods mined or produced using forced labor under the UFLPA was initially seen as a best-case scenario for the solar industry, with other companies thought to be at-risk left off the list of banned imports, this detention casts a shadow on that notion.

SolarAPP+, launched in July 2021, is a free, DOE-developed web-based platform that allows local governments to instantly approve residential solar installation permits. There is a cost of $25 per approved permit, but in many early trials, jurisdictions have subsequently lowered their permit fees due to the benefit of saved time, leading to an average of $6 in savings per project. 
SolarApp+ can handle about 90% of solar permits in most jurisdictions, tackling simpler projects, and freeing up time for jurisdictions to focus on more complex building permits that are already clogging their pipelines. According to Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, the platform allows a user to fill out a permit application in as little as 15 minutes, and approvals come instantly; a big change from an average of roughly 20 business days for approval.
In an effort to increase adoption of SolarAPP+ among the state’s municipalities, CalAPP provides grants and assistance, designed as an incentive and to cover the staff time and other resources spent on adoption. The maximum grant sizes range between $40,000 and $100,000 depending on population. The grants are non-competitive and the application is simple.
“CalAPP is a quadruple win,” said Jeanine Cotter, president and CEO of Luminalt, a solar installation company in the Bay Area. “Everyday, we devote a ton of resources to obtaining permits for our clients to go solar. By encouraging cities to adopt the best practice of automating permitting, CalAPP will slash costs for building departments, installers, and customers, leading to solar on more roofs, which in turn will reduce global warming emissions.”

Polar Developments, a Spanish startup specializing in portable solar energy solutions, presented its PolarGreen Tow system at the Next Generation festival in Madrid last week.
Mónica Sánchez García, head of communications for Polar Development, told pv magazine that the company is part of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program of the Science Park of the Carlos III University of Madrid. She said the PolarGreen Tow trailer can be transformed into “an authentic removable solar micro farm” in less than an hour.
The compact vehicle houses 12 solar panels, totaling 4.4 kW. Its folding system was inspired by the masts of space satellites.
“PolarGreen Tow is the first portable system to recharge an electric car,” said Sánchez García.
The system is scalable and can reach a capacity of up to 6.5 kW. It can be used to provide energy for cars, scooters or electric bikes. It can also provide energy support to homes during power outages, among other uses.
In March, Polar Developments launched a portable PV system for low-consumption applications. The device can recharge mobile phones, tablets and computers, as well as small appliances or electric tools, by simply unfolding the solar panels and connecting them.

The JuiceBox is a WiFi-enabled, Alexa and Google-integrated charger with 40 A / 9.6 kW output. Its design is built on the universal J1772 charging standard and is classified as a Level 2 charger. The JuiceBox weights 15 lbs, and comes with a 25-foot charging cable and storage rack. The device comes with a three-year manufacturer’s warranty. Enel said the equivalent of 1.3 million gas-powered passenger vehicle miles have been abated since JuiceBox’s launch in 2014.
“The future is electric, and decarbonizing our energy and transportation systems will require smart infrastructure solutions to be the bedrock of this transition,” said Elisabetta Ripa, CEO of Enel X Way. 
Bloomberg NEF said EV sales in North America were up 88% in the fourth quarter of 2021, reaching nearly 7% of all new car sales that quarter. Enel said EV drivers plug their vehicles into Enel chargers once every 2.6 seconds in North America. 
Under the new business line, the company said it will expand its portfolio of products and services to include more commercial charging stations, leveraging hundreds of millions of available incentive dollars across the United States and Canada as part of state, local, and utility programs to build out its business. 
“Across North America, major automakers are doubling down on their electric vehicle plans, large corporations are electrifying their fleets, and new policies and incentives are accelerating more EV adoption,” said Chris Baker, head of Enel X Way North America. 
The company said it intends to build out an ‘interoperable system’ by participating in roaming agreements and joint ventures to ensure that customers have access to charging throughout North America, South America, Europe and Asia.
Enel X also developed the Electric Pan-American Charging Corridor of EV chargers, which allowed actors Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman to cover over 13,000 miles, 16 border crossings and 13 countries, from northern Mexico to the southern tip of Argentina. The journey was documented in an 11-part series called “Long Way Up,” featured on Apple TV+.
