https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/20/arizona-tribal-community-to-cut-irrigation-canal-water-losses-with-solar-canopy/,"SUSTAINABILITY,ARIZONA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 20, 2023",Arizona Tribal community to cut irrigation canal water losses with solar canopy,"Gila River Indian Community announced that it signed an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to install solar panels over irrigation canals on its land south of Phoenix, Arizona.
The first phase of the project will cover approximately 1,000 feet of canal, cutting down on water losses from evaporation. The project is expected to demonstrate the feasibility of solar-topped canals, potentially leading to additional miles of solar canals for the community in subsequent phases. The Army Corps is expected to complete the first phase of the project in 2025.
The cost of the first phase of the project is $6.744 million, adding 1 MW of solar capacity while reducing evaporation in the canal. The project is supported by a $517,000 grant from the Bureau of Reclamation. Funding for the second phase of the project is also expected to come from the Bureau of Reclamation, which is implementing a grant program established by Congress to pilot solar canals.
“This first pilot will break new ground and further the Community’s role as stewards of our shudag (water) and in keeping with the Community’s tradition of bringing innovation to irrigation systems throughout their lands,” said Gila River Indian Community governor Stephen Roe Lewis.
Earlier this year, a coalition of over 125 groups urged the U.S. Interior Department and the Bureau of Reclamation to evaluate the efficacy of solar canals. The request, signed by many leading climate and environmental groups, highlighted the opportunity to cover 8,000 miles of open-air canals with solar capacity. An estimated 25 GW of renewable energy, enough to power nearly 20 million homes, could be installed on these locations, the group said.
“The Bureau of Reclamation and the states dependent on the Colorado River are already considering unprecedented water cuts to protect the water supplies for 40 million people who rely on the river,” said the letter. “In a study examining similar action on water canals within California, scientists estimated that shade provided from solar panels could reduce the water loss due to evaporation by 63 billion gallons of water per year, an amount equivalent to annual water consumption of roughly 2 million people per year.”
The solar canal project implemented by the Gila River community is among the first in the U.S. to break ground. It is expected to serve as an example for other regions challenged by water conservation and clean energy goals.
For example, California’s Central Valley Project, a large canal system, alone uses approximately 1 billion kWh of electricity annually to pump water. Bringing solar power closer to these systems would offer an efficient system for moving water, displacing the diesel generators used today.
“Given the Bureau of Reclamation’s long history of creating hydroelectric power, the generation of gigawatts of solar power on its canals would be a purely additive benefit, and could even help address shortfalls in electricity generation as when hydroelectric facilities are unable to operate due to low water levels,” said the letter.
Installing solar on canals is gaining popularity worldwide. Projects in California, India, Spain, and France are underway, with many packing in large utility-scale capacities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/20/fortescue-continues-u-s-expansion-with-new-clean-energy-manufacturing-plant/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 20, 2023",Fortescue continues U.S. expansion with new clean energy manufacturing plant,"From pv magazine Australia
Fortescue has announced it will invest almost AUD 54 million ($35 million) to kickstart a major manufacturing facility in the United States that is expected to serve as a hub for the production of automotive and heavy industry batteries, hydrogen generators, electric vehicle fast chargers and electrolyzers.
Fortescue said the manufacturing facility is being developed in the state of Michigan as part of the company’s plan to rapidly expand its US presence as a direct result of the IRA.
The IRA, which is aimed at ramping up onshore production of renewable energy, electrification and the development of clean energy industries such as green hydrogen, offers subsidies, grants and tax breaks to businesses to establish clean energy projects in the United States.
Fortescue’s new manufacturing center is expected to benefit directly from IRA tax credits for battery modules, offering approximately $10 USD per kWh.
Fortescue Executive Chairman and founder Andrew Forrest said the IRA has changed the US from a laggard to a world leader in clean energy, demonstrating that countries which incentivize green energy place an “economic engine” firmly inside their economies.
“The IRA makes the United States the most attractive place in the world for green energy and green manufacturing projects,” he said.
“Fortescue is putting the United States at the forefront of our global strategy, with the incentives on offer, a win for both the US and the wider Asia-Pacific region.”
The company said the Michigan facility, projected to employ up to 600 people in its initial phase, will serve as a major hub for Fortescue’s production of batteries, fast chargers, and hydrogen generators and electrolyzers.
“Michigan and the United States are extremely attractive places to manufacture, given the skilled workforce, existing supply chain and incentives from state and federal governments, including the Inflation Reduction Act,” Fortescue Energy Chief Executive Officer Mark Hutchinson said.
The new manufacturing facility is one of three clean energy projects Fortescue has planned in the US.
Fortescue is targeting a final investment decision this year for the Phoenix Hydrogen Hub, an electrolyzer and liquefaction facility in Arizona. Stage one of the project is planned to include an 80 MW electrolyzer and liquefaction facility capable of producing up to 12,000 tons of liquified green hydrogen annually.
Fortescue is also planning to construct a large-scale green hydrogen production plant near in the state of Washington. The Centralia project has been selected as part of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub to receive funding from the US Department of Energy. The project is currently in the design stage with a final investment decision yet to be taken by the Fortescue board.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/20/new-mppt-approach-for-multi-string-pv-systems-under-partial-shading/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 20, 2023",New MPPT approach for multi-string PV systems under partial shading,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at Egypt’s South Valley University have developed a novel control strategy to deal with partial shading in PV systems. The new approach uses a multi-string PV system with a converter control strategy that utilizes a direct duty cycle to track the maximum power point (MPP) under shade.
“This study proposes a reconfiguration of the PV system to suppress the negative impact of partial shading on the PV-system performance by dividing the PV system into multiple parallel strings,” the scientists explained. “In this work, the proposed system comprises four strings, with each string comprising three paralleled sub-strings.”
The proposed multi-maximum power point tracking (MMPPT) approach involves connecting each string to a DC-DC converter, optimizing power extraction from individual strings of PV solar panels. This differs from the tested single-MPPT (SMPPT) arrangement in a PV system, where a single converter is connected to parallel strings of solar panels.
The MMPPT approach uses a direct duty‑cycle control strategy to find the duty cycles of desired converters. Then, using direct duty-cycle control (DDCC), it adapts the duty-cycle of the DC-DC converter to the calculated results, regulating the produced power.

Calculating the desired duty cycle involves using the PV system’s existing sensors to estimate radiation, derived from changes in PV cell current and voltage.
“The proposed technique minimizes the overall system cost by reducing the number of the required sensors by utilizing a radiation estimation strategy,” the researchers said. “The DDCC technique boosts the overall system efficiency by the steady-state oscillations elimination, hardware simplification, and ease of implementation. Additionally, the DDCC has a fast-tracking speed for global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) extraction during partial shading conditions.”
The researchers presented the results of the comparison between the MMPPT and the SMPPT system in “Investigation of single and multiple MPPT structures of solar PV‑system under partial shading conditions considering direct duty‑cycle controller,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. The systems were simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK software, under three shade conditions.
All four PV strings were subjected to uniform irradiance of 1,000 W/m2 in the first shading pattern. In the second pattern, however, the first two strings had a constant irradiation profile of 1,000 W/m2, while the other two had a uniform irradiance profile of 1,000 W/m2 for half a second, and then stepped down to 500 W/m2 for another half a second.
In the third pattern, the first two strings were again under a uniform irradiance profile of 1,000 W/m2, while the remaining two started with 1000 W/m2 for 0.3 seconds, changed to 500 W/m2 for another 0.3 seconds and decreased to 250 w/m2 for 0.4 seconds.
“Under these conditions, the average efficiency of the SMPPT system is found to be 98.98%, while the MMPPT system achieves an efficiency of 99.81%. These findings validate the proposed approach,” the researchers concluded. “A real radiation dataset from Benban, a location in southern Egypt, is used in MMPPT configuration. The results demonstrate that the proposed control system enhances overall system effectiveness while reducing installation costs.”

The method involves the modification of a PV panel into a hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module and can be used for both industrial and residential applications.
“This study introduces a novel approach by harnessing the exhaust air from air conditioning (AC) systems to act as a natural coolant, gently flowing over the rear surface of PV panels,” the researcher said. “It eliminates the need for supplementary fans or added power consumption. Its dual functionality not only contributes to a noteworthy reduction in both the carbon footprint, but also yields cost savings on electricity bills.”
The researchers used polycrystalline BP350 panels from UK-based manufacturer BP Solar and modified them so the rear metal contact (RMC) layer was omitted, creating an air channel between the RMC and an added layer of fiberglass. Consequently, the exhausted air from the AC system is directed below the RMC and confined between the RMC and a layer of fiberglass. The air flows from the front of the module to its back.
“The exhausted air from the AC system is utilized to cool the PV panels. This is achieved by directing the air leaving the exhaust grill into a nozzle, which is then connected to the PV panel,” the researchers said. “The air leaving the PV panel becomes hot, presenting an opportunity for its utilization in thermal applications. This hot air is directed to the dishwasher and blown over the wet dishes.”
Using a set of equations and algorithms, the group of scientists calculated the electric efficiency of the cooled PV panel, as well as the efficiency of the recovered thermal energy.
For those calculations, they assumed a residential house with a floor area of 200 m2 in Beirut, Lebanon, and Doha, Qatar, using an AC unit with an air supply temperature of 13 C and maintaining an indoor air temperature of 23 C. The exhaust air entering the nozzle is assumed to have a temperature of 25 C, resulting from heat gain from the ambient air. Using annual average weather data from both cities, the academics have simulated the effect of the novel system on setups ranging from one to ten PV panels.
“Results show that the cooling process substantially enhances the cell efficiency, reaching approximately 10.1% (Doha) to 10.25% (Beirut) for one PV module,” the academics explained. “As the number of PV panels increases, this efficiency decreases but remains higher than the value obtained without cooling. The relative increase in cell electric efficiency ranges from 15% for one PV module to around 3% for ten PV modules.”
Calculating the recovery of the hot air discharged from the back of the PV panel, the researchers found the thermal efficiency reached 98% in Doha and around 80% in Beirut in the case of one PV module. In the case of ten PV panels, that dropped to 55% and 45%, respectively.
“Results show that the time to dry the dishes decreases with increasing numbers of PV from around 7 hours to around 1 hour,” they added. “When the number of PV increases, the air temperature leaving the PV/T system is higher, thus leading to better drying process.”
Concluding the article, the scientists added that future work should encompass real-world testing to validate system performance. Other research, they said, might be regarding “cost reduction efforts, user-friendly integration methods, efficient monitoring and maintenance systems, and collaborative efforts with policymakers to establish incentives and regulations.”
Their findings can be read in the paper “Dual Harnessing of Air Conditioning Exhaust: PV Cooling and Dishwasher Drying,” published in Energy and Built Environment. The team includes researchers from Los Angeles’ Multiphysics Interaction Lab, Lebanon’s American University of Beirut, the Lebanese International University, as well as Kuwait’s Gulf University for Science and Technology.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/20/how-to-meet-the-need-for-certified-ev-infrastructure-maintenance-experts/,"EV,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 20, 2023",How to meet the need for certified EV infrastructure maintenance experts,"From all accounts, the EV market is exploding nationwide. Recent studies show that by 2030, the market is expected to hit $1.58 trillion. This exponential growth has led to the need for maintenance professionals uniquely trained and positioned to service EV cars and charging stations. 
Because the EV market growth has been so significant, the rate of qualified infrastructure maintenance experts being trained and brought into the industry has struggled to keep pace. To meet the rapidly growing demand, there will need to be an increased focus on training maintenance professionals with specialized knowledge and skill sets for the EV market. 
The need for certified experts 
One of the main reasons for the overwhelming need for maintenance experts is the problem with EV charging stations evident across the US. Much like the number of skilled maintenance experts struggling to keep up with EV demand, the number of working and accessible EV charging stations has lagged, causing understandable frustration among EV drivers. 
Many EV aficionados claim the issue of broken EV charging stations goes under-reported, causing rampant “charging anxiety” among EV drivers. They are not concerned with how many miles they can get out of a full charge, but rather if there will be a working charging station available when they need one. 
The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program is aiming high with a goal to fund a large-scale deployment of charging stations to maintain a 97% operational uptime. The problem is that there are simply not enough certified and qualified professionals available to meet that uptime goal. 
This lack of certified experts has created undue stress on the industry. With the market continuing to grow by leaps and bounds year after year, there will need to be a significant push to train and certify EV charging station maintenance specialists. 
How to train 
With the automobile market changing, the maintenance space will also have to shift. Technological advancements are informing the way maintenance specialists are trained and deployed in the industry. 
The EV revolution has created an opportunity for those with electrician or auto maintenance skills to add to their abilities and create new career prospects for themselves. The EV industry has great potential for new job opportunities, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
As of an October 2023 report, there are still too few technicians certified to work with EV vehicles or within EV infrastructure, with only 1.5% of ASE Certified technicians holding a certification for EV work. Those interested in the proliferation of clean energy and the continuation of EV technology will need to press for more training, better training, and greater deployment of trained technicians to keep up with the rate of EV adoption. 
Artificial intelligence and virtual reality tools are emerging as an efficient and effective way to train the next generation of EV maintenance technicians. Through virtual reality training modules, technicians-in-training can learn by doing and practice complex repair approaches and maintenance tasks in a safe and immersive digital environment. 
AI has proven to be a useful tool in evaluating the skills and knowledge base of electric vehicle technicians. Through AI assessments, those tasked with training these specialists can see where upskilling may be required and deploy the right technicians to the right areas of need. 
Gamified training also helps EV technicians train for this new world of work, as gamification makes training and upskilling engaging and even fun. Through gamified training modules, technicians can master new skills and competencies that the EV market desperately needs if the infrastructure hopes to catch up with EV driver adoption.
Data is significant from a training perspective, and those who are training and certifying EV workers will need access to real-time insights, up-to-date knowledge, and the most advanced training materials to keep the skill levels up to speed with the industry’s rapid rate of change.
The future of EV adoption 
Everyone from casual drivers to our nation’s government is taking the EV revolution seriously. The Biden Administration has spearheaded the installation of 500,000 new EV charging stations nationwide to be up and running by 2030. While this adoption of electric vehicles is promising, without trained and certified people to keep the charging infrastructure operational, the revolution may be dead in the water.
While finding a charging station in the United States will become easier as more stations are built on the heels of Biden’s push for better infrastructure, the operability of those stations is what matters. Without access to charging capabilities, people may abandon EVs altogether. 
With emissions from gas-powered vehicles continuing to wreak havoc on the environment, it is important that the momentum of the EV revolution is maintained. Through training and certifying EV infrastructure maintenance experts, all of the good that electric vehicles have brought to the environment can continue.

Advanced conductors, shown at top right in the image above, can carry twice as much power as conventional conductors, the study says. With reconductoring, existing transmission lines are replaced with reconductored lines that are strung along existing transmission towers in existing rights of way, with upgraded terminal equipment as needed, as shown in the bottom portion of the image.
By avoiding the need for new rights-of-way, reconductoring avoids time-consuming and costly processes for land acquisition and permitting.
Reconductoring can meet over 80% of the transmission needed to reach 90% clean power by 2035, the authors found.
With reconductoring at scale, solar, wind and storage projects near the existing transmission network could be interconnected more easily. The study includes several maps of specific sites with “cost-effective, high-quality” renewable resources located near the existing transmission network, obtained from the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDs) model.
Researchers from UC Berkeley and the consultancy GridLab used the ReEDS model to conduct the study. Under their base case with high electrification and allowing reconductoring, co-optimizing generation and transmission expansion would lower wholesale electricity costs by 3-4%, compared to not allowing reconductoring. By 2050, system cost savings from large-scale reconductoring would total $180 billion.
In both of the two scenarios modeled, which considered restricted or unrestricted transmission buildout, reconductored capacity accounted for the majority of capacity installed before 2030. The authors say reconductoring presents an opportunity for expanding transmission capacity in the next few years while new transmission lines are planned and permitted.
The study projected that the optimal added transmission capacity by 2050, allowing for reconductoring, would be about 90,000 GW-miles with restricted buildout or about 190,000 GW-miles with unrestricted buildout. The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that 54,500 GW-miles of additional within-region transmission capacity are needed for a clean grid.
The study says that previous work “has established that it is cost-effective and time-efficient” to expand transmission capacity by reconductoring existing lines, and there is “robust global deployment” of advanced conductors, yet the technology has seen “only limited uptake” in the US. A study appendix describes reconductoring deployments in five countries and in Texas.
To “spur uptake” of reconductoring, the authors proposed policy measures that could be undertaken by:
The study is titled “Accelerating transmission expansion by using advanced conductors in existing right-of-way.” The authors say they plan to investigate the potential for large-scale reconductoring in other global regions.
