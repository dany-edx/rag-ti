Named the O’Brien Solar Fields, the project has contracts with the state of Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the city of Fitchburg and local businesses all of which are set to buy a portion of the generation capacity for roughly 6 to 7 cents per kWh.
The project is expected to help Fitchburg meet 40% of its operational electricity needs through solar. That would easily pass the city’s goal of becoming 25% solar-powered by 2025. In addition, the capacity purchased by one of the businesses will allow it to meet 100% of its energy usage with solar.
While O’Brien currently stands as the largest project in Dane County and among the largest completed solar installations in the state, Wisconsin regulators are now evaluating a proposal to build a 300 MW project on 2,400 acres spread across the nearby towns of Christiana and Deerfield. This project, Koshkonong Solar, would include a 165 MW battery energy storage system. This would be the largest such system known to pv magazine in Wisconsin and among the largest in the country.
The Koshkonong project would be developed by Invenergy. Madison Gas and Electric and WEC Energy Group are seeking to buy the project for $649 million. If the sale goes through and the project is built, WEC would own 90% and MGE the other 10%. And, if approved, the project would begin construction in 2022 and achieve commercial operation in 2024.

Greg Abbott signed Senate Bills 2 and 3 into law on June 8. The laws are intended to change how parts of the state’s power grid must prepare for extreme weather and how the Electric Reliability Corporation of Texas (ERCOT) is governed.
The legislation was sparked by a mid-February winter storm that lasted for days and crippled much of the state’s electric power grid. Power plants that had not been winterized were particularly hard hit in a near carbon-copy of a power outage that hit the state in February 2011.
Calls a decade ago to winterize the state’s vulnerable natural gas delivery system and power plants went largely unheeded.
As signed by Abbott, Senate Bill 3 requires upgrades for power generators and transmission lines to make them better able to withstand extreme weather. The Texas Railroad Commission and ERCOT will conduct inspections of the facilities. Failure to weatherize may result in penalties of up to $1 million.

Winter resource capability will now include onsite fuel storage, dual-fuel capability, or fuel supply arrangements to ensure winter performance for several days. Summer requirement include facilities or procedures to ensure that power plants can operate during drought conditions.
(Read “3 graphs that shed light on the ERCOT power crisis.”)
The Public Utilities Commission will prepare a winter emergency preparedness report to be submitted to the legislature every two years starting in September 2022. The report will assess the ability of the Texas grid to withstand extreme weather events and make recommendations on improving emergency operations plans and procedures.
The bill will only require natural gas distribution companies to weatherize if they are deemed “critical” by regulators. It also stopped short of requiring better protection of homes and pipes, which some experts have called an oversight.
The state likely won’t require companies to weatherize until 2022 at the earliest, and plans to help them pay for the upgrades were struck from the legislation during negotiations between members of the Senate and House.
The state likely won’t require companies to weatherize until 2022 at the earliest.

The new legislation also aims to stabilize the state’s energy market by allowing $6.5 billion in ratepayer-backed bonds for natural gas utilities and electric cooperatives. The plan would cover the companies’ financial losses due to the February storm, and likely will raise charges on most Texans’ power bills for perhaps the next two decades. The bill included no measure of direct relief to consumers, some of whom were left with huge electricity bills in the aftermath of the winter storm.
Senate Bill 2 changes the governance of ERCOT. It shrinks the number of seats on ERCOT’s board of directors from 16 to 11, and gives the state’s top politicians more influence over the board. A selection committee would appoint eight of the 11 board members. The selection committee would be made up of three people — one appointed by the governor, one by the lieutenant governor, and one by the speaker of the House. The committee would use an “outside consulting firm” to select the eight members.
Nine of the 11 ERCOT board seats would be voting members. The governor also appoints the members of the Public Utility Commission, which oversees ERCOT.

If approved and built, the Cider Solar Farm would be one of the largest solar projects built in New York State.
Hecate Energy said the proposed project would interconnect on-site to the New York Power Authority Dysinger – New Rochester 345kV  transmission line to deliver power to the New York State electricity grid. The project would be built between 2022 and 2023, with a planned in-service date of late 2023.
The project would be located on more than 65 parcels of land comprising 4,650 acres of leased private land owned by 31 landowners. The project’s total footprint would be a little more than half of that total. The proposed project would use ground-mounted, single-axis tracking.
New York State’s Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act created the new ORES and rules for the permitting of large-scale renewable energy projects. It is intended to enhance the siting and construction of projects with input from local communities. Hecate’s Cider Solar 94-c application is one of the first new applications submitted to ORES.

BNEF’s latest edition of the annual Electric Vehicle Outlook said that accelerating electric car adoption, expanding charging networks, the ongoing push for battery recycling, and emerging new regulations on heavy trucks, as well as encouraging active modes of transport, like cycling and walking, all will be critical to achieve a net-zero by 2050 future.
Assuming that none of these policy measures are enacted, BNEF’s Economic Transition Scenario forecasts global sales of zero-emission cars to grow from 4% of the market in 2020 to 70% by 2040. Regions like China, the U.S., and certain European countries are anticipated to see much higher sales than the global average.

As for non-passenger vehicles, BNEF forecasts that sales of zero-emission busses will hit 83% of the global market by 2040. Light commercial vehicle sales are expected to grow from 1% of their today to 60% over the same time, and medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle sales will grow to just over 30%, up from almost zero now.
Even at this rate of adoption, however, the global economy will fail to achieve a Net Zero Scenario by 2050, the report said. To achieve net-zero, sales of zero-emission passenger cars would have to hit almost 60% of sales in their segment globally by 2030, not 34% as in the Economic Transition Scenario. This equates to a raw sales increase to 55 million EVs sold by 2030, as opposed to the projected 32 million.
BNEF said that two/three wheel vehicles–which are heavily used in developing and densely populated countries–and buses are close to being on track to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. Meanwhile, cars and light commercial vehicles are shown as being on a “positive trajectory” because, even without further policy measures, current trends are close to the sales volumes that are needed to hit the net-zero by 2050 benchmark.
BNEF’s Economic Transition Scenario also considers the needs for charging network expansion and battery supply chain component increases.
Image: Marc A. Hermann/MTA
By 2040, the global EV charging network needs to grow to over 309 million chargers across all locations, with specific need projections of 270 million home chargers, 24 million public chargers, 12 million workplace chargers, and 4 million bus and truck chargers. This buildout would lead to a 9% increase in global electricity demand by 2040 and would require an investment of $589 billion, an increase that BNEF called modest considering the period of time, over the current cumulative global renewable energy investment, which hit $300 billion in 2020.
These numbers still do not meet the net-zero scenario and would have to rise to $939 billion in investment by 2040 to achieve the necessary 504 million units. For electricity demand, that scenario would raise the megawatt-hours needed to 14% by 2040 and to just over 25% by 2050.
As for battery and component demand, the need for Lithium-ion batteries is set to experience a sharp increase from the current 269 gigawatt-hours in 2021 to 2.6 terawatt-hours per year by 2030 and 4.5 TWh by 2035. And while more investment in mining and refining will be needed, supply of metals is projected to be adequate to meet demand projections.
For battery supply to satiate the net-zero by 2050 scenario, battery metals recycling will be important, BNEF said. Without it, cumulative lithium demand would exceed currently known reserves by 2050. With universal battery recycling, however, not only would primary lithium demand remain below known reserves, but the prospect of a fully circular battery industry would emergy, with supply of recycled lithium exceeding total annual demand by mid-century.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/09/solar-for-manufactured-homes-the-next-frontier-for-energy-equity/,"COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 9, 2021",Solar for manufactured homes: the next frontier for energy equity,"There is a growing movement in the clean energy field to bring the benefits of renewable energy to low- and moderate-income communities. A new report by the Clean Energy States Alliance explores the opportunities and challenges of bringing solar to an often-overlooked market that is ripe with potential: manufactured homes.
Manufactured homes, formerly referred to as mobile homes, account for 6.1% of the nation’s housing stock, totaling more than 8,500,000 residences. In some states, the percentage of households in manufactured homes reaches as high as 17%t. Median income in these households is typically half that of people in other housing types. Most manufactured homes are situated in rural areas.
Unlike the broader low- and moderate-income population, most manufactured housing residents are homeowners. This means that they are likely to live in their property longer than renters, they can make physical changes to their property, and they can build home equity through improvements to their property, all good indicators of solar readiness.
Most manufactured homes are located near other manufactured homes. This creates an opportunity for targeted outreach campaigns because the homes are clustered together. It also means that “solar contagiousness” could play a big role in spreading solar in these communities: a recent study by Scientific Reports found that the single greatest predictor of going solar is proximity to other homes with solar, and that this is especially pronounced in lower income areas.
The main benefit for manufactured housing residents in going solar is cost savings. Low-income populations often suffer from a high energy burden, meaning that a larger share of their household income goes towards energy expenses; lessening a household’s energy burden would free up much needed funds for other important expenses. Manufactured homes are generally energy inefficient and have high electric loads, so with the right policies and incentives, the potential for cost savings from solar could be significant.
There are several challenges to solar adoption for manufactured housing residents. Some of these challenges are the same as those that other low-income households face:
Other challenges are specific to the manufactured housing market:
Despite these challenges, there are some successful examples of manufactured housing communities going solar.
The Mascoma Meadows Cooperative Community Solar Array in Lebanon, New Hampshire is a 100-kW solar PV system benefitting 45 households. Mascoma Meadows residents own their own individual homes and share ownership of the land they live on through a cooperative ownership framework. The community solar array is built on a half-acre of land donated by a neighboring church. The solar array is anticipated to save each of the participating households $20-25 in housing lot rent reduction per month.
In New Mexico, a state with a high poverty rate and the highest percentage of manufactured housing residents, the PV on a Pole TM initiative addresses several barriers to going solar. With four solar panels mounted atop a vertical pole, solar is achievable for manufactured housing residents with roofs that cannot support solar panels. The small footprint works well for those who do not have enough land to support a ground-mounted installation. The streamlined setup means that the solar panels can be installed quickly and affordably, and that they can be moved and re-installed without too much additional cost or effort.
Based on an in-depth analysis of the solar and manufactured housing landscape across the country, the Clean Energy States Alliance recommends eight strategies for advancing solar in manufactured homes:
“This is a large market, it’s an important market,” said CESA Executive Director and report lead author Warren Leon in a solar for manufactured homes webinar on May 13. “If we care about solar being a technology that benefits all of society, we cannot ignore this market.”

The projects would replace the coal-fired North Valmy Generation Station, located in Winnemucca, Nevada, by 2025. The projects would be developed by Primergy Solar and would provide 16 permanent jobs once they enter service.
Iron Point Solar Project would be a 250 MW solar PV system paired with 200 MWs of battery storage. The project has an expected in-service date of December 2023. And Hot Pot Solar Project would be a 350 MW solar PV system paired with 280 MW of battery storage. The project has an expected in-service date of December 2024.
NV Energy said it also plans to build three grid-tied battery energy storage systems in northern Nevada. These systems would provide 66 MW of energy storage capacity that can be dispatched during times of highest customer demand.
The projects were part of the utility’s Integrated Resource Plan filed with state regulators. The filing also includes new energy efficiency and demand response options for NV Energy’s residential customers. The utility also is proposing a trial program to bring small-scale solar plus storage systems to customers in low-income and underserved communities.
NV Energy said it anticipates a decision on its filing by the end of the year.
Tesla is about 25% short of its employment target at its Buffalo factory, and is expanding its focus on jobs not linked to its solar energy business, according to local news reports.
The Buffalo News said that Tesla had 1,058 employees at its factory as of the end of May. It need to have 1,460 jobs there by the end of 2021 or else face a $40 million penalty from the state.
Tesla’s solar roof development – which had been expected to be the main product at the Buffalo factory – is lagging due to installation problems. New York State spent more than $950 million to build and equip the factory, in exchange for a promise from Tesla to create 1,460 jobs there. The paper said that employment at the plant is being increased to support Tesla’s electric vehicle business.
In 2017, Tesla began production of solar cells and modules at the 1.2 million square-foot facility. In 2019, it added new production lines to support electrical components for its Supercharger and energy storage products.
The U.S. Department of Energy announced new policies intended to scale up a domestic manufacturing supply chain for advanced battery materials and technologies.
The efforts follow a review to assesses vulnerabilities and opportunities in the current and forecasted battery supply chain, and identifies policy recommendations to address them.
DOE said that the U.S. relies heavily on importing advanced battery components from abroad, “exposing the nation to supply chain vulnerabilities” that threaten to disrupt the availability and cost of these technologies, as well as the workforce that manufactures them. DOE’s battery supply chain assessment found that the U.S. has less than a 10% global market share for manufacturing capacity across all major battery components and cell fabrication.
The new DOE actions include:
In addition, the Departments of Commerce, Defense, and Health and Human Services announced actions to spur domestic supply chains in semiconductors, critical minerals, and pharmaceuticals.
Florida Power & Light said it passed the 40% mark in its plan to install 30 million solar panels by 2030. To date, FPL has installed more than 12 million solar panels in Florida. By the end of June, FPL expects to have 42 solar energy centers in Florida with more than 3 GW of capacity.
The utility said the solar sites are expected to save customers around $421 million over the lifetime of the assets. FPL said it expects to have installed more than 15 million panels by early 2022.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign a bill that would set a goal of deploying 1 GW of energy storage by the end of 2030. The bill, SB 952, passed both houses of the state legislature, and sets interim targets of 300 MW of storage by the end of 2024 and 650 MW by the end of 2027.

The company said it intends to fund construction of its third U.S. manufacturing facility in Ohio with existing cash resources.
The new facility is expected to start operations in the first half of 2023. It is projected to achieve its throughput entitlement (modules produced per day) by the end of 2023 with more than 3 GWdc of nameplate capacity. It is expected to reach full nameplate capacity, based on the company’s module efficiency roadmap, in 2025.
The facility will scale the company’s northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GWdc, which it said represents one of the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complexes outside of China.
The 1.8 million-square-foot facility is projected to create 500 jobs and produce an enhanced thin film PV module for the utility-scale solar market in the U.S. The module is anticipated to have a higher efficiency and wattage in a larger form factor. The additional production capacity is also expected to help ease challenges in the global ocean freight market, by reducing the gap between international supply and domestic demand.
Mark Widmar, CEO, said in a statement that the new plant “will leverage our advantaged position at the intersection of efficiency, energy yield, optimized form factor, and cost competitiveness, while leading our manufacturing fleet in delivering the highest efficiency and wattage, and the lowest cost per watt.”
With the new facility, First Solar will be able to produce an average of one module roughly every 2.75 seconds across its three-factory Ohio footprint. The new facility will include machine-to-machine communication, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things connectivity to produce a high degree of automation, precision, and continuous improvement.
Widmar said the company continues to evaluate opportunities to further expand its global manufacturing footprint. He said that  strong demand for its Series 6 modules along with “a compelling technology roadmap, a strong balance sheet, and a largely fixed operating expense cost structure” are catalysts as the company evaluates the potential for future capacity expansion.
First Solar modules use a layer of Cadmium Telluride (CadTel) semiconductor. It also operates a recycling program that recovers CadTel for use in new modules. In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia.
