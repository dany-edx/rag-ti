The battery technology is increasingly in demand for energy storage and use in electric vehicles (EVs). But its current lifecycle is almost entirely one-way, from manufacture to consumption to disposal, with little thought given to reuse or recycling. Only one U.S. lithium-ion battery recycling facility exists today, the analysts said.
To start to rethink the one-way lifecycle, the NREL team assessed the current state of reuse and recycling of large-format lithium-ion batteries used in EVs and battery energy storage. They found that reusing and recycling the batteries could create U.S. market opportunities, stabilize the supply chain, reduce environmental impacts, and ease resource constraints.
And they found that a circular economy would derive more value from battery energy storage systems. Materials would be reused, recycled, or refurbished for multiple lifetimes rather than one-and-done, which uses up finite resources and creates waste.
The researchers said that technology, infrastructure, and processes are current barriers. For example, lithium-ion battery designs and makeup vary by manufacturer, making it hard to design a standard process to cost-effectively reuse or recover materials.
Regulations also play a critical role, but current codes and standards are unclear, complex, and vary by jurisdiction.

Regulations also play a critical role, but current codes and standards are unclear, complex, and vary by jurisdiction, the researchers said.
Based on their findings, NREL analysts highlighted existing regulations that could impact the installation and grid interconnection of repurposed lithium-ion batteries.
Some states like California or New York are revising their regulations to ensure requirements for connecting to the grid specifically apply to battery energy storage systems, said Taylor Curtis, project lead and NREL analyst. Curtis noted, “This is a big development considering interconnection regulations were not developed with these types of systems in mind.”
A further challenge is that it is unclear how decommissioned lithium-ion batteries are legally defined in terms of waste. As recently as July, no U.S. federal policies directly addressed battery energy storage system decommissioning, or either mandated or incentivized reuse or recovery of lithium-ion batteries.
In general, decommissioned lithium-ion batteries are often considered either hazardous or universal waste, both of which have their own regulations. Regulations also vary by jurisdiction, and non-compliance may lead to fines.
Violating California’s hazardous waste laws can result in a fine of up to $70,000 a day for each violation, the report said.

In some states, the penalties for violating hazardous waste laws or regulations are more stringent than federal penalties. For example, the report said that intentionally or negligently violating a provision of California’s hazardous waste laws or regulations can result in a fine of up to $70,000 a day for each violation.
The report said that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has created alternative regulatory controls for recycling materials, such as lead-acid batteries. The aim of those rules is to encourage collecting and recycling hazardous waste. A similar designation for lithium-ion batteries, the NREL report said, could ease liability concerns and make the economics of recycling more desirable.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/25/floating-pv-comes-to-universal-orlando-resort/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,FLORIDA",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",Floating PV comes to Universal Orlando Resort,"D3 Energy has brought floating solar to Universal Orlando Resort, announcing the completion of a 250 kW system located at the park’s entrance and branded with the logo of Comcast, Universal’s parent company.
The 645-panel installation covers roughly half an acre of the retention pond’s surface and is anchored to the bottom of the pond, which is 35 feet deep.
The installation’s prominent Comcast logo was created using a product called SolarSkin developed by Sistine Solar. According to the Boston-based tech startup, SolarSkin is a customizable graphic overlay that can be imprinted with any artwork and applied to solar arrays without affecting the efficiency of the modules underneath.
The project’s developer, D3 Energy, occupies an interesting and underdeveloped aspect of the U.S. solar industry: floating PV. Three years ago, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated that installing floating solar photovoltaics on the more than 24,000 man-made U.S. reservoirs could generate about 10% of the nation’s annual electricity production.
D3 Energy has also developed floating PV projects at the Altamonte Springs Water Facility in Altamonte Springs, Florida, the Orlando International Airport, the Orlando Utilities Operation Facility, and the Miami International Airport.
In a previous interview with pv magazine USA, Stetson Tchividjian, director of business development at D3Energy, said that he expects the cost gap between land-based solar and floating PV to close soon, citing floating PV’s lower operation and management costs, no land costs, and the increased efficiency of the panels.
“These factors over the system’s lifetime make floating solar as cost-effective–and, in some cases, less expensive–than land-based systems,” said Tchividjian.

The new solar energy centers under construction in the Panhandle are the Cotton Creek Solar Energy Center in Escambia County and the Blue Springs Solar Energy Center in Jackson County, both of which are set to clock in at 74.5 MW. The two projects are each expected to create roughly 500 jobs as they’re being built.
In addition to its solar projects, Gulf Power also recently broke ground on the FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center, which is set to be among the world’s largest integrated solar-powered battery systems, as well as the largest battery installation on the East Coast. This storage system is part of a modernization plan that is expected to accelerate the retirement of aging natural gas units at a neighboring power plant.
Located in Parrish, Florida, the 409 MW behemoth of a battery project is expected to begin serving customers in late 2021. The Manatee center will create 70 new jobs during construction, and it is projected to save FPL customers more than $100 million in avoided fuel costs over the project’s life.
Alongside the projects that have begun construction, Gulf Power also announced an additional five projects in the early phases of development across northwest Florida: the First City Solar Energy Center in North Escambia County, the Blackwater River Solar Energy Center in Santa Rosa County, the Chipola River Solar Energy Center and Flowers Creek Solar Energy Center in Calhoun County, and the Apalachee Solar Energy Center in Jackson County.
While the capacities for these projects in development have not yet been released, it’s safe to assume that most, if not all, will end up being that magic 74.5 MW, as projects larger than that in Florida are subject to additional permitting that the majority of project developers avoid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/25/vermont-utility-building-microgrid-to-provide-backup-power-for-town/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,UTILITY SCALE PV,VERMONT",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",Vermont utility building microgrid to provide backup power for town,"Green Mountain Power (GMP) will break ground this spring on a utility microgrid in Panton, Vermont, offering a new way to keep the power on for residents, farms, and municipal buildings in the town center during power outages.
GMP said Panton is the perfect place for this project because it leverages the utility’s existing 4.9 MW solar facility with utility-scale batteries already up and running in the town. GMP noted it will be among the first utilities in the country to island a distribution circuit using inverter-based sources with no reliance on fossil fuel generation backup.
“It is heartbreaking to see the impacts of extreme weather across the country, and it’s a sad but important reminder that we must innovate to build resiliency to protect from extreme, unpredictable weather,” said Mari McClure, GMP’s president and CEO.
In the event of a prolonged grid outage, the Panton microgrid will enable energy from the batteries and solar panels to flow to a network of customers served by the traditional grid. According to GMP, this islanding effect will work independently from the larger electric system when needed and could provide battery backup power for days.
To start, the project will help keep power on during outages for about 50 customers in Panton, with the planned possible expansion to include another 900 customers on that circuit. The utility noted the batteries are also used to lower costs for all GMP customers during peak energy times.
Resiliency zones like the one created by Panton’s microgrid are a core feature of the GMP Climate Plan, a package of infrastructure initiatives approved by Vermont’s Public Utility Commission (PUC) last year to make communities more resistant to outages and help ensure they can recover more quickly if outages occur.
The PUC approved the microgrid phase of the Panton project in fall 2020. GMP’s solar and energy storage facility in Panton first came online in 2019. Since then, the utility’s engineering teams have been designing the microgrid aspect, which is expected to be fully constructed and working for customers by the end of June.
This year, GMP will be working with three additional towns most affected by weather-related outages to create resiliency zones. Using outage data, GMP outreach is underway to determine interest from possible towns to join the program. GMP said it plans to build on this work, adding more resiliency zones in more towns every year.
GMP also continues to deploy batteries in customers’ homes and businesses. According to the utility, there are about 3,000 home battery systems in its service area that provide power to customers during outages, as well as help save money for all utility customers by driving down cost on peak energy days.
GMP offers two home battery programs: the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and Powerwall programs developed in partnership with local solar companies. GMP’s BYOD for Business program also recently helped Vermont’s statehouse become one of the first in the country to have battery backup.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/25/jennifer-granholm-confirmed-as-energy-secretary/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",Jennifer Granholm confirmed as Energy Secretary,"The United States officially has its next Energy Secretary, as the Senate voted 64-35 to confirm former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm to the position.
Secretary Granholm took to Twitter to express her gratitude toward the Senate for her confirmation and to share her excitement in getting to work.
My sincere thanks to the Senate for your confidence in me. I’m obsessed with creating good-paying clean energy jobs in all corners of America in service of addressing our climate crisis. I’m impatient for results. Now let’s get to work!
— Jennifer Granholm (@JenGranholm) February 25, 2021

During her confirmation hearing, Granholm continually hit on the point of creating jobs in a transformative clean energy economy without leaving behind workers and communities that have historically been reliant on fossil fuels.
The solar industry response to Granholm’s confirmation has been overwhelmingly positive.
“Secretary Granholm is a long-time clean energy champion and a tremendous leader who is ready to tackle our nation’s energy and climate challenges on day one,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “The Department of Energy will be at the forefront of the fight against climate change and building a clean, affordable, and equitable electricity system for all Americans, and Secretary Granholm is the right leader for that critical work.”
“American Clean Power congratulates Secretary Granholm on taking the helm of the Department of Energy,” said American Clean Power CEO Heather Zichal. She added that the clean power industry looks forward to working closely with the new secretary and her team to accelerate clean energy research, development, and deployment, while creating jobs for American workers and investing in communities.
All 48 Democrats voted in favor of her nomination as did the two independent senators who caucus with the Democrats. Fourteen Republicans also voted to confirm Granholm. One senator, Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, did not vote.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/25/nyc-installing-solar-at-nearly-50-public-schools-other-facilities/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021","NYC installing solar at nearly 50 public schools, other facilities","New York City and state officials selected two developers to install rooftop solar at nearly 50 public schools and build solar projects at four city-owned water treatment facilities. The solar arrays will total about 22 MW, and several of the projects are expected to include energy storage systems.
Following a competitive bidding process announced last June, the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) and the New York Power Authority (NYPA) tapped Houston-based ENGIE North America and Massachusetts-based Ameresco as project developers.
The rooftop solar installations are currently planned for 47 NYC Department of Education (DOE) buildings across all five boroughs; the city will buy the on-site energy. The projects are expected to enter service through 2022.
ENGIE will design, construct, own, and operate the solar PV systems at the school sites; Ameresco will perform the same tasks at the water treatment sites. NYPA, acting as clean energy advisor, will administer the 20-year power purchase agreements for the city and manage the installation process to ensure the projects stay on budget and on time.
Carbon emissions from public schools account for nearly one-third of emissions from the city government’s building portfolio. Adding solar to schools is expected to help cut emissions, and provide opportunities for students to learn about sustainability and climate action.
Lisette Camilo, commissioner of the DCAS, said, “Our schools are not only tackling climate change in the classroom, but also on the rooftop.”
At the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) Wards Island water treatment plant (considered part of Manhattan Island), a combination of ground-mounted, carport, rooftop, and elevated canopy solar PV systems totaling more than 7 MW will be installed across the eight-building complex. Solar power generated will serve the plant’s load, and a battery energy storage system will reduce peak energy demand.
An additional 1.5 MW of solar capacity is expected to be installed at three other city-owned water treatment plants in Westchester, Delaware, and Ulster counties. DEP Commissioner Vincent Sapienza called the department’s campus-style facilities “unique and prime real estate” for large-scale solar.
The initiatives will help meet New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s goal of having 70% of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2030, and achieving an 85% reduction in statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It will also help drive NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio’s goal of installing 100 MW of solar power on public buildings by 2025 and reducing citywide emissions 80% by 2050.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/25/sunrise-brief-xcel-colorado-aims-to-add-5-6-gw-of-renewables-and-storage-capacity/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",Sunrise brief: Xcel Colorado aims to add 5.6 GW of renewables and storage capacity,"Xcel Energy released details on an $8 billion Clean Energy Plan, which it will deliver to Colorado state utility regulators in March.
The plan calls for cutting the utility’s carbon dioxide emissions 85% below 2005 levels by 2030. To reach that goal, Xcel said it plans to double its renewable energy portfolio in the state and stop using coal-fired generation by 2040.
The plan is in response to a 2019 Colorado state law that required regulated utilities to cut carbon emissions by 80% in the next 10 years.
Xcel’s plan calls for adding around 5,600 MW of new renewable and energy storage capacity. The mix includes 1,600 MW of large-scale solar projects, 400 MW of battery storage, and 2,300 MW of wind power. Another 1,300 MW of distributed solar, such as community solar gardens, would also be added.
By 2030, 80% of the electricity Xcel generates in Colorado would come from renewable sources, the company said.
The plan also calls for adding 1,300 MW of “dispatchable” resources, primarily natural gas and battery storage to balance the wind and solar generation.
For example, the new plan proposes converting the 505 MW Pawnee Generating Station to natural gas in 2028. And, Xcel earlier had planned to run the newest unit of its coal-fired Comanche Generating Station until 2070. The utility said it now plans to retire that unit by 2040. Two older units at the plant are slated to close by 2025.
The Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign recently gave Xcel a grade of C in assessing its progress toward achieving clean energy goals. The grade was based in part on the utility’s plan to operate Pawnee and Comanche past 2030.
Altus Power America said it will build a 4.5 MW ground-mounted solar energy project in Kapolei, Hawai’i on the island of O’ahu. It will be the one of the largest community-based renewable energy projects in Hawai’i. Altus Power acquired the project from Tritium Enterprises, which led the development effort and will support construction, community engagement, and ongoing operations.
The project is expected to be online in the fourth quarter of 2021 and will generate more than 6,500 MWh of electricity during its first year of operation. This will be Altus Power’s third investment in Hawai’i and the first to specifically provide energy savings through solar credits to residential customers in addition to commercial and municipal entities.
Wells Fargo Renewable Energy & Environmental Finance said it recently passed the $10 billion mark in tax-equity investments in the solar, wind, and fuel cell industries. It said its investments include more than 500 projects, representing around 12% of all solar and wind energy capacity in the U.S. over the past 10 years. Wells Fargo said it wrote around $2.4 billion in financing for renewables in 2020, up $1 billion from 2019.
Enphase Energy said it is planning to issue $1 billion of senior notes. The California-based microinverter company said it would issue $500 million of convertible senior notes due to mature on March 1, 2026. A similar tranche of notes would be settled in 2028. Enphase said the proceeds would finance a hedge against possible dilution of stock value due to the issuance; a repurchase program related to the company’s 1%-interest-bearing 2024 notes and 0.25%, 2025 instruments; and general expenses.
