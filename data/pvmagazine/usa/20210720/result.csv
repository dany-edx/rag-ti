That year-end figure includes a bit of late-year recovery, as, at the height of the pandemic, the energy sector saw a peak job loss of 1.4 million.
Under the larger umbrella of energy, the USEER covers five major sub-sectors: electric power generation, transmission, distribution, and storage, fuels, energy efficiency, and motor vehicles. The combination of electric power generation; transmission, distribution, and storage; and fuels is the largest employer with 3.1 million workers. That number was a 9.8% decline from 2019. Second largest was motor vehicles with 2.3 million jobs, a 9.0% decline, and energy efficiency with 2.1 million, an 11.4% decline.
Electric power generation lost 63,300 jobs from 2019 to 2020 for a total of 833,600 jobs, but not each generation source was hit equally hard. For example, wind added 2,000 jobs, an increase of 1.8%, while solar (which includes both concentrated solar and PV), was hit especially hard, losing 28,700 jobs, the most of any generating source.
The report said that by the end of 2020, some 520,000 energy jobs had already returned, nearly one-third of the peak losses that occurred in 2020. Additionally, employers that responded to the DOE survey also signaled confidence in the upward employment trend continuing through 2021.

The risk is outlined in GCube’s  ‘Hail or High Water’ report, which analyzed a decade of industry claims data. It found that roughly 50% of all claims for solar asset damage due to extreme weather were caused by wildfire.
GCube estimated that wildfires alone have cost the solar industry tens of millions of dollars in losses over the last decade.
Wildfires are growing in size, severity, and frequency across the Western U.S., driven by high temperatures and drought. In conjunction with insufficient fire risk management and record high temperatures sweeping the nation, it’s more likely than ever that fires will spread out of control and pose a risk to solar assets.

Additionally, given current international trade conditions, shipping difficulties and supply chain reformations, the risk of wildfire damage to solar infrastructure has been compounded. Strained supply networks mean damaged panels could take longer to be repaired or replaced, forcing whole arrays out of commission for months after the initial heatwave.
Not only could asset owners lose time, money, and generation if their project is damaged by wildfire, but they also could face legal responsibility for any resulting property damage to third parties. As a result, many insurance companies have started to put blanket wildfire exclusions in place across policies to mitigate their risk exposure .
This same strategy was instituted by insurers in wake of the 2017 Midway Solar Project, when the 178 MW installation was battered by a severe hail storm that left more than 400,000 of the plant’s 685,000 Hanwha Q cell modules damaged or destroyed and caused insurance losses that totaled $70 million.

In response to this and later hail-related losses, some insurers have began to offer specific hail insurance programs, called “parametric insurance.” These programs trigger coverage when a measurable hailstorm event occurs that exceeds a predefined threshold. The trigger for coverage and payout is determined by the size of the largest hail that falls on the solar project site.
Insurers, however, were no longer going to act as a fail-safe for developers who didn’t take hail risk and mitigation into mind in project planning. Prior to putting in place these policies and the overall hardening of the insurance market, there was little known about the catastrophic damage potential of hail. That meant developers would take out as much project coverage as they could, assuming that whatever losses they suffered from a hail event would be easily covered by insurance.
Midway ended that way of thinking.
And insurers are expanding that same approach when it comes to wildfires, with Fraser McLachlan, CEO of GCube. “Rather than enacting blanket exclusions, we want to work with our insureds to make sure they are taking appropriate action to prevent severe losses over the coming years, so that we can continue to provide them with cover.”
The only solution to this issue is data, McLachlan said. He said that to determine a project’s potential fire risk, developers need to look granularly on a case-by-case, site-by-site basis that is led by data.
This same approach was necessitated by hail after Midway, when data collection cottage industry emerged to help developers determine and mitigate risk. If this level of monitoring and data collection doesn’t ramp up in the coming months and years, the report warns that the solar industry could lose tens of millions of dollars.

The inverters offer what the company said is improved uptime through modularity and independently working units. Due to the modularity of the design, commercial and industrial installers only need a two-person crew to integrate the inverters into their solar array.

A pre-commissioning feature for in-depth visibility allows installers to fully and automatically validate system components from smartphones before connecting to the grid. SolarEdge’s Synergy Manager enables service without the need for opening inverter covers for configuration or maintenance. 
DC oversizing of up to 150% is achievable with this new line of power converters, the company said. The device also uses a built-in nighttime potential induced degradation (PID) rectifier that aids in reducing module performance degradation. Module-level monitoring is also integrated with this system. 
Thermal sensors are installed on terminal blocks for both AC and DC connections. The inverter can withstand surges with Type 2 AC and DC surge protection devices, and provides surge event alerts. Automatic NEC-complaint rapid shutdown also is integrated.

The program pays cash upfront to residential and commercial customers who attach battery energy storage to their existing or new rooftop solar systems.
Participating customers must use or export power during two peak hours, determined by HECO, through Dec. 31, 2023. Expected use/export times will cover two hours, somewhere between 6:00 PM and 8:30 PM, a time period when demand is at its highest and solar production begins to wane.
(Read “Energy storage aggregation unlocks benefits for homeowners, grid operators, and installers”)
The program is capped by the Public Utilities Commission to a total of 50 MW supplied from storage among all participants. Applications will be accepted until June 2023, or until the cap is hit.
Payments are in a tiered structure and are scheduled as follows: $850 per kW for the first 15 MW, $750 per kW for the middle 15 MW, and $500 per kW for the last 20MW.
For example, a 5 kW battery would earn an upfront payment of $4,250. There is no size limit to an individual customer looking to take advantage of this program.
“This is great news for solar customers in HECO, who already feel the pain of some of the highest energy bills in the country,” said Brian Donoho, senior consultant at solar and storage installer Sunrun. Because net metering has been done away with in the state, battery storage “was already a no-brainer to maximize the value of your solar, and to back up your home during outages,” he said. The incentive program now means “the value of solar-plus-storage couldn’t be clearer.” 
AES is retiring a coal-fired power plant in 2022, and demand on the grid will continue to rise as Hawaii sees its population continue to grow. These forces often lead to an increase in energy prices, so locking in a secure price for electricity through solar and storage will be appealing to many.
Many installers offer no-upfront cost solutions to those who cannot afford to buy solar. Typically, under a leased program, the installer will take in the upfront cash incentive themselves. Customers benefit from a reduced per kWh electricity rate.
The Hawaiian Electric program is available to both new and existing solar customers. Retrofitting batteries had been a challenge for installers in the past, but it has become a more widely adopted practice now. 
“This one-time offer is an excellent opportunity for new or existing solar customers to enjoy the added benefits of home energy storage, support the grid that serves all customers, and move us closer to our 100% clean energy for electricity goal by 2045,” said Yoh Kawanami, Hawaiian Electric co-director of Customer Energy Resources.

A group of scientists from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia and Russian heterojunction solar module producer Hevel Solar has developed a novel hydrogenation process that is claimed to have the potential to improve the stabilized efficiency of p-type heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell based on gallium-doped silicon wafers.
The solar industry usually applies n-type phosphorus–doped Czochralski–grown silicon (Cz–Si) wafers in the production of SHJ cells, as these ensure no susceptibility to the boron-oxygen light-induced degradation (B-O LID) that is typical for p-type boron-doped wafers and severely affects SHJ cell performance over time.
N-type wafers offer greater stability, but they are currently more expensive to produce than p-type wafers, which are the mainstream solution for the manufacturing of PERC cells. This means that using p-type wafers may potentially lead to a further cost reduction for the heterojunction technology, as wafer costs still represent 40% of a cell’s total cost.
In order to compete with n-type devices, however, p-type heterojunction cells will have to show improved performance. 
“The same advanced hydrogenation techniques (AHTs) we use in mass production for solving LID and LeTID in p-type PERC solar cells can be used in p-type SHJ solar cells to solve B-O LID when using boron-doped p-type Cz wafers,” research co-author, Brett Hallam, told pv magazine. Even though the gallium-doped and n-type SHJ solar cells were stable in this work and didn’t need the process to improve stability, “we have shown that these same processes can improve the efficiency of gallium-doped and n-type SHJ solar cells by 0.4-0.7% absolute.”
The research group said that the expiration of Shin Etsu‘s gallium doping patent (US6815605B1) has encouraged the solar industry to adopt p-type gallium-doped Cz-Si wafers, which it describes as a potential mainstream solution for the SHJ segment for the next decade. (Read more.)

Longroad acquired the project in February from First Solar, the original developer.
CIBC was the coordinating lead arranger, collateral agent, and issuing bank for the financing. Silicon Valley Bank served as coordinating lead arranger and administrative agent. Helaba participated. PNC Bank was the tax equity investor.
Sun Streams 2 has a 20-year revenue agreement with Microsoft for the project’s energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity, which will support its new datacenter region known as West US 3.
First Solar supplied its Series 6 modules for the project, which was built by McCarthy. Trackers were supplied by Nextracker and inverters by SMA.
Sun Streams 2 is one of four Maricopa County projects that Longroad acquired from First Solar. The PV and storage portfolio totals roughly 900 MW with the potential for 1-2 GWh of battery storage. Sun Streams 3, 4, and 5 are development projects with target operational dates between 2022 and 2024.
Longroad’s affiliate, Longroad Energy Services, is the asset manager and operator, and will provide remote monitoring services to the project.

The support will help fund the San Vicente Energy Storage Facility through initial design, environmental reviews, and the federal licensing process.
The project would provide long-duration stored energy and is seen by backers as an asset that will help avoid rolling blackouts through on-demand energy production. It also could generate revenue to help offset the cost of water purchases, storage, and treatment.
With the state funding, the Water Authority and the city now plan to start federal and state environmental reviews, seek a project license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and issue a Request for Proposals for a partner to help develop the project. Those steps are expected to take at least four years, with construction completion forecast for 2030.
As planned, the San Vicente project would create a small upper reservoir above the existing San Vicente Reservoir, along with a tunnel system and an underground powerhouse to connect the two reservoirs. The powerhouse would contain four reversible pump turbines. The project could store 4,000 MWh per day of energy (500 MW of capacity for eight hours).
During off-peak periods, turbines would pump water to the upper reservoir where it would act as a battery of stored potential energy. During high energy use, the system would discharge water from the upper reservoir downhill through the turbines, producing energy. The exchange between the two reservoirs would not consume water.
San Vicente Reservoir is northeast of San Diego, near major transmission facilities, which would allow it to play a role in integrating energy from across the Southwest for use in San Diego County. The San Vicente project would be a closed-loop system holding mainly imported water and would not rely on runoff that can fluctuate from year to year.
