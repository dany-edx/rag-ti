Dubbed the Parelio for Sammontana, the design is a collaboration between innovation firm Carlo Ratti Associati (CRA), architect Italo Rota, and gelato-maker Sammontana.

The fold-out array is meant to be deployed in the sun, shading beachgoers and generating PV energy that feeds attachable nebulizers and coolers underneath. This provides a way to keep the beachgoer, their drinks, and Italian ice cream cool on a hot summer’s day. 
The project was supported by “transformable design” proponent professor Chuck Hoberman of Harvard, who worked with Italo Rota and MIT professor Carlo Ratti on the design. The modular system means that multiple umbrellas can be strung together, leaving it up to resorts to be creative with how they integrate the technology.  
The umbrella is 8.2 feet high, has a 10.5-foot diameter, and includes panels over the entire top. A prototype is on display in the Porta Nuova district of Milan, Italy from June 12th to August 8th.
The solar umbrella is one of many ways designers are finding ways to integrate pv technology in unlikely spaces, like windows and blinds.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/02/pv-fires-estimated-costs-and-the-road-to-better-data/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,O&M,CALIFORNIA",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 2, 2021",Solar PV fires: Cost estimates and the road to better data,"A fire in June at an Amazon warehouse, reportedly caused by a solar system, served as another reminder that the solar industry’s struggle with fire safety isn’t over.
A deeper dive into available data, developed by Dr. John R. Balfour, president of High Performance PV, and Lawrence Shaw, chief solar systems engineer at Higher Powered, LLC, offers a means to estimate the future costs and impacts from reported PV system- sourced fires. Trending this data forward in time demonstrates that the industry should brace for more instances of fire in the future.
In California, for example, the trend suggests costs exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars, and worse; fires could likely begin injuring people each year starting in 2023. In 2036, the data has led the two researchers to conclude that current practices will lead to loss of life.
The model predicts that by 2025, 64 PV system fires will occur in California, resulting in injury and costs projected to exceed $18 million. In 2030, those number rise to 122 fires, one injury and more than $32 million in damages, and in 2040 the model predicts 238 fires, one death, three injuries, and $68.5 million in damages.
Saying that the best way to solve such a threat is to address it before it becomes one, Shaw and Balfour have worked to compile quantitative data that identifies common failure points in photovoltaic systems.
To date, the majority of data collection efforts have been geared towards understanding issues that may impact system production and, by extension, revenue, and not necessarily failures leading to safety hazards.
Data acquisition systems are hooked up to inverters and are limited in their ability to inform an operator if there is a hotspot in a PV module that has the potential to develop into a thermal event.
To fully understand the risk of fire and the reliability of equipment, the two assert that routine inspections using infrared imaging must occur, and standardized data must be collected by the maintenance workers in the field as part of the O&M plan.
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems typically aren’t hooked up to PV modules. Because of this, systems often lack the ability to automatically flag safety issues like hotspots to the plant operator.
However, every mobilization is an opportunity for service providers to identify safety and environmental concerns. Maintenance workers typically raise the flag if they see something. Even so, if there isn’t a way to input the data into the operator’s work management tool, then recognizing potential problems will often be overlooked by decision makers.
In essence, a handwritten report does not necessarily mean pertinent information will lead to action.
In many cases, third-party maintenance personnel provide the essential information needed to have a feedback loop of information. However, a disconnect may occur when information is not standardized, then entered into a database by the operator. A more effective process may involve standardized nomenclature and digital reporting used by maintenance crews when they are in the field.
Without a means to include field measurements, decision makers often cannot prioritize safety issues or truly understand equipment reliability. Taking field measurements, then ensuring these observations get recorded into a relational database management system may be an effective means to ensure the system operator can dispatch according to priority and optimize the planning of resources.
Balfour and Shaw implemented a three-step process in their research.
Step 1: determine the number of solar systems in California. To begin the estimate, Balfour and Shaw estimated the population of PV systems in California. The state publicly shares data regarding the number of systems installed each year, their type (for example, utility, commercial, residential), and the overall total number of systems installed.
From this information, the two determined the number of solar systems reported for all independently operated utility companies. For instance, in 2015, they found 144,478 newly installed systems and a total of 425,362 installed systems. Once codified, they used the numbers to represent the overall population of photovoltaic solar systems installed in the state.
Then, using the number of systems installed in California from 1996 through 2019, they forecast the number of systems that will likely be installed in the state in years to come.
Step 2: tally the number of fires for California. Balfour and Shaw then requested historical data provided the U.S. Fire Administration and queried the data to determine the number and locations of photovoltaic sourced fires every year. The two filtered the queried results for photovoltaic sourced fires in California for 2015-2019. This provided them with the number of fires per the number of installed systems in California.
Step 3: Forecast the number of PV system-sourced fires in California. The next step assumed that most photovoltaic solar system fires would be caused by aging system components. This is based on a Japanese case study of 100 solar system fires, which indicated a significant number of failures were attributed to components that were at least seven years old.
For their analysis, Balfour and Shaw assumed most fires would occur in systems at least that old, and adjusted the overall population size accordingly (for example, the number of fires in California in 2015 per number of installed systems in California in 2008). They used that adjustment to estimate the number of fires per number of systems seven years old or older.
The process was repeated for each year from 2015-2019 to establish known values for the independent and dependent variables to forecast the number of California based photovoltaic sourced fires anticipated in the future.
The numbers only contemplated fires where a fire department was dispatched. Balfour and Shaw recognizes that PV-sourced fires aren’t always reported as such, so the two anticipate the actual value to be higher.
To better understand the overall impact, Balfour and Shaw combined the forecasted values with additional fire statistics.
Referencing a 2014 report by the National Fire Protection Agency, the two found that there were 3,275 civilian deaths out of 1,298,000 reported fires. As solar fires don’t happen solely at residences, they used the number of deaths per all reported fire types to determine the average number of civilian deaths per fire as follows and arrived at 0.0025 civilian deaths per fire.
When combined with the forecasted number of fires caused by solar systems in California, Balfour and Shaw estimated that PV system fires will lead to loss of life in California every year starting by 2036.
From another report provided by the NFPA, the two found more costs associated with a fire than just property losses. The NFPA report provided an aggregate total and breakdown of costs of fires in the U.S. in 2014. Balfour and Shaw used the figure of $328.5 billion (in 2014 dollars) along with the total number of fires in the U.S. in 2014 to determine the average total cost per fire, which they said equalled $287,782 in 2021 dollars.
Some of the details included have been developed for a book titled, Photovoltaic (PV ) System Delivery as Reliable Energy Infrastructure, under contract with John Wiley & Sons. The book is expected to be available in early 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/02/sunrise-brief-rooftop-solar-in-hawaii-gets-a-boost-from-a-new-incentive-program/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,POLICY,RACKING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 2, 2021",Sunrise brief: Rooftop solar in Hawaii gets a boost from a new incentive program,"Utility regulators in Hawaii approved an incentive program designed to help expand residential rooftop solar systems.
The program will provide money to Oahu homeowners who install battery energy storage systems to new or existing rooftop solar systems. In exchange, local utility Hawaiian Electric will be allowed to use the power stored in the batteries during peak hours, generally between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m.
Thousands of new or expanded solar systems could result.
Isaac Moriwake, an attorney with Earthjustice who represented the Hawaii Solar Energy Association in the regulatory proceeding, told local news outlets the orders will spur renewed investments in solar systems.
“To reach 100% we need all options on the table,” he was quoted as saying. “But what’s clear is to reach 100% we need to cover all rooftop space.”
As designed, the program will allow consumers to get an upfront payment from Hawaiian Electric in exchange for agreeing to sell the utility power from battery for two hours per day, during hours to be determined by Hawaiian Electric, for 10 years. The size of the payment would depend on the size of the battery. For example, a Tesla Powerwall  could generate an upfront payment of $4,250.
If people back out of selling power to the utility before the 10-year term expires, they would have to pay back a pro-rated portion of the incentive.
The new incentive will be in addition to existing incentives. That means customers who already have solar can continue to sell excess energy to Hawaiian Electric under the terms of existing deals.
One concern is the potential flood of building permits for the new solar capacity, which could cause bottlenecks and impact the program’s chances of success.
Centaurus Renewable Energy LLC, developer of the Arroyo Solar & Storage Project in the southeastern part of New Mexico, said it closed a $70 million construction bridge loan facility provided by Voya Investment Management, the asset management business of Voya Financial.
The credit facility will be used to make payments for project equipment and for other development and construction expenses. The transaction was organized by Voya Investment Management’s Direct Infrastructure team led by Tom Emmons and Ed Levin.
The Arroyo Solar & Storage Project is a 300 MW solar generation facility and a 150 MW/600 MWh battery energy storage system. Solar energy and battery storage services are committed under a 20-year power purchase agreement and energy storage agreement to Public Service Company of New Mexico. The project is expected to partially replace the power from the 847 MW San Juan Generating Station, New Mexico’s largest coal-fired plant, which is scheduled to close in 2022.
Houston-based Centaurus Renewable Energy LLC, was founded in 2013 and has developed approximately 20 solar projects totaling over 1.3GW-DC across seven states.
Solar racking and tracker company OMCO Solar said it has shipped 1 GW of products over the past year to projects in 30 states. It said that with 8 GW of contract manufacturing solar products, it now has delivered more than 9 GW to the market. It said it has increased its manufacturing capacity to more than 3 GW a year.
In Florida, the company is working with Moss Solar to complete six utility-scale projects totaling more than 600 MW. Once completed, this will be the largest fixed-tilt portfolio in the company’s history, and one of the largest in the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/02/residential-solar-installers-can-cut-permitting-times-with-nrel-built-automated-app/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 2, 2021",Residential solar installers can cut permitting times with this NREL-built app,"Launching later in July, the SolarAPP+ automated permitting software seeks to cut permit times and create a standardized permit process for residential rooftop solar. 
The Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory produced a paid software service that allows installers to enter project input data and receive an instant approval for their permit application. The tool could lead to a dramatic reduction in project time, as some jurisdictions can take three to four business weeks to approve permits, said NREL. 
The app, which was presented in a webinar hosted by the Solar Energy Industries Association automatically evaluates solar applications for safety and code compliance, and can be integrated into existing solar application software platforms. It also provides an inspection checklist as guidance for the application process. 
Pilot programs led to an average of 17.5 fewer business days for permits, and a range of four to 13.5 fewer business days in total install cycle times, said NREL. 
Currently, only jurisdictions that operate with codes of 2017 NEC or later and 2018 I-code or later can participate, including all of California, and more than 1,200 jurisdictions in 20 states.  
Dr. Jeff Cook, program lead for SolarAPP+ at NREL, said that solar plus energy storage will soon be available through the existing software platform as well.  
The SolarAPP+ charges $25 per approved application and allows for up to three corrected applications for free if mistakes are made. So far, in the pilot tests of Tucson, Arizona; Pima County, Arizona; and Pleasant Hill, California, jurisdictions have reduced their permit fees due to the ease of processing and have resulted in an average of $6 in savings even with the platform’s fee. 
Cook said there will be a learning curve in adopting the platform for permit application technicians, who will have more responsibility in entering single line diagram inputs into the platform. He said that with a spec sheet in hand, the permit application can be completed in as little as 15 minutes. 
Installer representatives from Sunrun, Tesla, and SunPower said that there have been learning curves in implementing the software in a pilot program, but said the benefits were numerous once their workforce got up to speed.  
Pilot program participants said that faster install times led to a smoother customer experience, which in turn led to a higher pull-through rate of projects. The app also freed up bandwidth for permit teams by automatically taking care of simpler projects, allowing teams to work on more complex applications.  
Keeping up with the multitudes of jurisdictional differences has been a heavy lift for national installers. The standardization that this tool is expected to drive eases the task of keeping a database of nuanced jurisdictional intel. 
The platform builds on NREL’s SolarTRACE resource, a database that identifies typical wait times for permits in more than 700 jurisdictions. 
The SolarAPP+ will be formally introduced by U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm on July 15 in an NREL-hosted webinar.
