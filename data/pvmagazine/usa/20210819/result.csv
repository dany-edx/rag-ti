LG Energy Solution supplied the project with 4,500 TR1300 battery racks.
Representatives from Vistra and LG Energy Solution, as well as some from California ISO, Pacific Gas and Electric, Burns & McDonnell, and federal, state, and local elected officials were on-site for the ribbon cutting ceremony.
Potentially even more impressive than the system’s current size is its planned expansion. While we don’t know how many more phases it will take, the final system is expected to clock in at 1,500 MW/6,000 MWh.
The electricity stored in the system at its current size is enough to supply 300,000 households.
“LG Energy Solution’s innovative battery technology and commitment to this project played an important role in successfully building the Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility,” said Claudia Morrow, Vistra’s Senior VP of Development and Strategy.

LG said that the lithium-ion-based TR1300 batteries meet fire safety standards, and racks have been tested to verify compliance with UL9540A (Standard for Safety Test Method for Evaluating Thermal Runaway Fire Propagation in Battery Energy Storage Systems), to ensure any fire event is not propagated to adjacent battery racks.
The TR1300’s rack design also meets the American Society of Civil Engineers’ ASCE 7-16, assuring its stable operation even during external environmental changes such as seismic tremors. The standard is now part of the California Building Code.
LG has been working to improve its battery technology since an April 2019 accident involving one of the company’s utility-scale lithium-ion battery arrays at an Arizona Public Service location. A thermal runaway event there caused an accumulation of gases in the container that housed the batteries. Those gases ignited when first responders opened an access door to investigate reports of smoke coming from the container. Two two firefighters were seriously injured.
LG also recently changed its environmental vision, adopting the mantra “We CHARGE towards a better future” and aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, transitioning all business operations to RE100 by 2030, and establishing virtual circular value chain for resources by 2025.
Also at the Moss Landing site is a 182.5 MW and 730 MWh energy storage system that will be comprised of 256 Tesla Megapack battery units on 33 concrete slabs. That project is nearing completion and full commercial operation is set for later this year.

Inside HQ and prior to the rally, the TVA Board approved an extension of the Pandemic Recovery Credit through fiscal year 2022 and requested a proposal to explore the potential of a further extension through 2023. TVA’s pandemic recovery credit provides a monthly 2.5% wholesale power cost credit to each of the local power companies TVA serves, TVA directly served customers, and large customers served by local power companies.
For fiscal 2021, the credit will be about $200 million and extending the program through fiscal 2022 is expected to provide an additional $220 million.
The Board also extended the Community Care Fund into the new fiscal year, providing up to $5 million to support groups that help those most in need in local communities.
TVA, in its meeting notes, did a bit of back-patting with regards to the company’s reliability during times of high demand this past February and this summer, as well as the company’s emission reduction efforts.
In the notes, TVA reported that through the end of June, nearly 60% of its energy was delivered from carbon-free sources, and that the power provider had achieved carbon emissions 63% below 2005 levels, as of the end of fiscal year 2020.
The same renewable energy and emission reduction efforts that TVA lauded were at the heart of the issues raised by interest groups, ranging from energy justice to racial justice, TVA power customers, and even some of TVA’s member power companies.
The main sentiments expressed during the rally revolved around TVA’s handling of coal ash cleanup work, specifically the more than 50 workers who died, allegedly from complications related to that work, and scores of other health conditions. The protesters also called for TVA to decarbonize more rapidly than current plans envision. And , they called for the company to establish virtual listening sessions and participation while the Board meetings remain virtual due to the pandemic.
According to one source, TVA supervisors told coal ash cleanup workers not to wear masks while cleaning up the spill because they didn’t want to alarm residents.
Recently, a coalition of 80 groups called on the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to release a roadmap detailing how TVA will transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030. While TVA touts 63% emission reductions since 2005 and has recently begun embracing renewables, the federally owned electric utility corporation currently has no plan to achieve emission-free power.
Included in the group’s letter to DOE was a calculation that TVA’s most current resource plan shows that the entity will still be producing more than 34 million tons of CO2 annually in 2038. That level falls short of the Biden Administration’s goal of decarbonizing the U.S. electricity sector by 2035.
TVA recently announced plans to add 1,500 MW of new gas generation to its resource mix to replace coal units that are being retired. That solution has drawn fire both from the groups that petitioned DOE and post-Board meeting rally attendants.
Recently, a number of TVA member power companies asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to break their supply deal with TVA, alleging that the federal entity violated the Federal Power Act.
The companies allege that their supply deal with TVA is discriminatory as long as TVA has a generation portfolio skewed toward fossil fuels and relatively lacking in renewables. They are asking to be freed from their supply deals so they can pursue electricity agreements from renewable resources.
Since February 2020, when TVA moved all of its board meetings virtual in light of the pandemic, the entity hasn’t held a public listening session, though legislative bodies and government agencies across the country adapted.
“This is unacceptable for an entity that is meant to be responsive to the public it serves,” said Knoxville City Councilmember Amelia Parker in a prepared statement. She said that city council has held virtual public comment sessions and called on TVA to “do the same for the public.”
When reached for comment, a TVA spokesperson told pv magazine that the entity has maintained numerous ways for the public to interact. One such conversation took place at the August 18 meeting, when the Board stated its intent to resume in-person public meetings and listening sessions as soon as public health conditions allowed.
The spokesperson directed the public to TVA-specific and Board-specific webpages where public comment can be submitted.
On August 4, several organizations in the Tennessee Valley Energy Democracy Movement hosted “The People’s TVA Hearing,” a virtual public hearing during which Tennessee Valley residents vocalized the issues that would become the foundation for Wednesday’s rally.

The 2021 SunPower Energy Sense Index surveyed 1,500 homeowners in the U.S., to learn what their home energy experience is, what they understand about the energy industry, and what motivates them to buy solar.
One finding is that many Americans live in fear of power outages. About 40% of respondents said that they worry about outages on a monthly basis. One in five said that they were concerned about losing their power every week. And more than half said they had experienced a power outage in the last year that has caused their trust in their utility provider to diminish.
Image: SunPower
One third of this group said they see high-profile outages, such as those   in Texas this past February, as a central reason to shop for backup power sources. Of those considering solar, 70% said they plan to include a battery energy storage system.
Homeowners who said they experienced an outage in the last year are four times more likely to have purchased solar and storage, said the report.
While solar in the past has been adopted by younger Americans, this has begun to shift. About 74% of current solar customers are from the Millennial and Gen Z generations, and are dominated largely by consumers living in the West and South. However, Baby Boomers now represent the majority of those newly considering solar at 55%, a step up from the 11% who already have solar.
Solar has also historically been relegated to those with higher incomes, but this trend, too, may be shifting. Nearly three quarters of homeowners who took part in the survey and are considering solar earned less than $100,000 a year per household, as compared to the 34% in this income bracket that currently have solar.
Location can be indicative of interest in solar with California the clear frontrunner. But respondents revealed the Midwest is now the region with the second highest proportion of people actively considering solar.
Politically, it was found that 68% of current solar owners identify as Democrats, with Independents (30%) and Republicans (29%) following.

Energy bill savings continues to reign supreme as the motivator for going solar. Over 92% of the respondents said this was a top reason.
This was followed by the desire for resiliency in power outages, which 88% of respondents said was a motivating factor. And 73% of solar shoppers said they were interested in reducing their carbon footprint.
Two thirds of respondents who said they would never consider solar cited high cost as the reason, but the survey also found that 60% of homeowners overestimate what solar costs. EnergySage has pegged the average cost at around $20,000. Nearly half of these “never solar” respondents said a significantly lower cost of energy would change their minds.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/19/customs-enforcement-is-jeopardizing-2-1-gw-of-solar-projects/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 19, 2021",Customs enforcement is jeopardizing 2.1 GW of solar projects,"Around 2.1 GW of solar projects representing a total investment of about $2.2 billion on a payroll of 3,000 construction workers is at risk as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforces action to stop the flow of goods that may have been produced using forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region.
Philip Shen, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners, offered those numbers and said that JinkoSolar has had 100 MW of modules detained by customs agents and that the company is “not able to ship from Malaysia to the U.S.”
In addition, Trina Solar had six next-generation test modules detained and Canadian Solar had four modules detained. The Canadian Solar modules may have been headed for the Solar Power International trade show in September in New Orleans.
pv magazine has learned independently that all three companies have had products detained by border agents. Both Trina Solar and Canadian Solar said the detentions directly involved their products.
In remarks given during a webinar hosted by Roth Capital, Elise Shibles, an attorney with Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, said there was a “low likelihood” that any of the detained modules would be released. Affected importers have three months to prove that no forced labor was involved at any stage of the product’s production. But Customs and Border Patrol have set a “high bar” in terms of what documentation must be produced to secure the products’ release. She said that the documentation “is almost never enough” to satisfy release requirements.
The amount of detail that will need to be provided by companies that have product detained by border agents will require “unprecedented cooperation” from upstream suppliers, said Richard Mojica, a lawyer with the firm Miller & Chevalier.
The detentions all stem from a June 24 “Withhold Release Order” issued by the Customs and Border Protection against Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., a company located in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Withhold Release Order instructs personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.

The CBP acted in response to what officials said were credible reports of forced labor being in the solar supply chain in the Xinjiang region of China. Reports have surfaced in recent days that shipments are being detained in what many believe to be the first stage of long-term enforcement action.
As CBP gathers more information, it could target other manufacturers and detain more imports. The action is creating “tension” within the Biden administration, Mojica said.
On the one hand, the president has issued statements opposing forced labor in supply chains. On the other hand, it also is pushing for a rapid expansion of green energy resources, including solar. A White House brief said that solar deployment would need to accelerate at a pace up to four times faster than today in order to meet clean energy targets by 2035.
Trade pressure grew in mid-August after a group of companies asked the U.S. Commerce Department to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed three petitions through the law firm Wiley Rein requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
The group said that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
Shibles, who spent 11 years as a CBP lawyer, said during the webinar that the detention does not prevent the product from being exported away from the U.S. And she said that product can be identified regardless of how it enters the U.S., whether by ship, rail, or air freight. She said that CBP likely will use a wide range of sources to identify potential companies and products, including non-governmental organizations, press reports, the U.S. Department of Labor, as well as international partners.

Nathan Picarsic of Horizon Advisory said that the solar industry is “woefully behind” both the agriculture and apparel industries when it comes to preparing for and responding to WRO enforcement.
Companies in other industries have dedicated teams that monitor for and act to mitigate CBP enforcement risk, he said. By contrast, the solar industry largely has had little recognition of similar risk indicators. “The reality is baked in to the agriculture and apparel” industries, he said.
The solar industry has made some progress since the beginning of the year to improve supply chain traceability, said Andy Klump with Clean Energy Associates. For example, the Solar Energy Industries Association earlier this year published a supply chain traceability protocol.
And, companies can avoid CBP detention by shifting supply chains away from potential conflict regions.
pv magazine reported August 18 that JinkoSolar had signed a five-year, $1.86 billion agreement to buy 70,000 tons of PV module raw material polysilicon from German producer Wacker. The polysilicon manufactured at Wacker sites in Germany and the U.S. will begin to be supplied in September and continue through December 2026.
Mojica said the move by Jinko may be an effective strategy to avoid the CBP dragnet.
“Suppliers who can provide documentation should have no issue” at the border, he said.
This article was updated on August 20 to clarify the source of information obtained from Jinko Solar.

Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
According to the two companies, the acquisition will enable NRS to accelerate the construction and realization of that 3.5 GW pipeline, supporting NRS’ on-the-ground development and origination expertise with BlackRock’s capital markets support and global reach.
While NRS is based in Minneapolis, the company has primarily operated in  in the Western United States, having developed more than 1 GW of projects since its foundation in 2011. Currently, the company’s roughly 3.5 GW solar and wind development pipeline includes projects in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada. It is, however, an expressed part of NRS’ mission as a company to revitalize rural communities via investments in domestic renewable energy resources that benefit local landowners.
In recent years, BlackRock’s support for renewables has grown incrementally, launching Distributed Solar Development, a behind-the-meter company in 2019, acquiring a 10.3% stake in inverter manufacturer SolarEdge, and investing $300 million into Clean Capital.
However, as the world’s largest asset manager, some have called these investments merely incremental, and a 2020 report from the nonprofit Majority Action, “Climate in the Boardroom,” referred to the company’s environmental and renewable ventures to that point as “tinkering at the edges” of real progress.
Since that report, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, said he backed the UK’s move to make reporting corporate risk related to climate change mandatory, and urged the U.S. to follow suit.
“We welcome the UK Chancellor’s announcement yesterday (of) mandatory TCFD reporting,” said Fink. “The United States, for its part, should move faster so we can achieve greater global coordination.”

That rate of growth may well be an underestimate, given current market trends.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration released the third edition of its U.S. Battery Storage Market Trends report, covering a mix of energy storage information from the end of 2019, and 2020, with projections through 2023.
The EIA noted that as of the end of 2020, 74% of the nation’s slightly more than 1 GW/1.8 GWh of energy storage was deployed in five states. California contributed 31% of that total. Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Hawaii accounted for more than 50 MW of capacity each. The report predicted a rapidly growing, evolving market as a result of consecutive reductions in future pricing.
As of the end of 2019, it was clear that market location was driving energy storage installation techniques.
In PJM territory, batteries are most often used for ancillary services, so installations tended to be “power oriented,” delivering a higher instantaneous power output for a shorter duration. Installations in the power grid region had an average power capacity of 10.8 MW, and an average energy capacity of 6.8 MWh, meaning an average duration of 45 minutes.
In California, batteries were being used primarily for stability. The state’s batteries had an average power capacity of 4.7 MW, and an average energy capacity of 14.4 MWh, making for an average duration of just over 3.0 hours.
The longer hour pattern has continued in California, with a recent announcement noting that 2 GW of energy storage power capacity was due online by the end of August. Most of that will be coupled to 4 hours of energy capacity.
Going forward, the volumes are growing with at least a 1,000% capacity growth over 2019 numbers expected.
Project developers had reported to the EIA that they planned to install over 10 GW of large-scale battery storage power capacity between 2021 and 2023. While the EIA doesn’t publish forward-looking energy capacity volumes due to privacy requests by developers, WoodMac Renewables & Power has suggested that around 12 GWh of capacity is on track to be installed in 2021.
The report noted that California accounts for 40% of power capacity planned between 2021 and 2023. These planned additions put California in line to meet its energy storage requirement by 2024.
California will already have 2 GW of energy storage power online by the end of August. Given the state’s power grid challenges, expectations are that the state’s storage capacity will continue to grow very aggressively, blowing past their legal requirements.
The EIA report also said that greater than 70% of the energy storage to be deployed is slated to be coupled with solar power. This would increase the current volume co-located with electricity generation from 30% to 60%.
Current tax law makes it so that coupling solar power and energy storage gets a 26% tax credit and accelerated depreciation (roughly another 17% of project costs) applied to the energy storage if the solar power is used to charge the batteries.
Industry has been pushing for its own energy storage tax credit that would decouple the solar+storage relationship, at least financially. Recent reporting by the National Renewable Energy Lab shows that coupling storage with a standard solar installation produces only modest price savings, if any.

Longgen Zhang, CEO of Chinese polysilicon manufacturer Daqo New Energy, made no mention of potential political roadblocks in the U.S. to the supply of Xinjiang-made poly when he presented his company’s second-quarter reports, stating: “Market conditions remain strong for the polysilicon sector.”
Daqo expects another 180-220,000 metric tons of poly production lines to appear next year – enough to supply 240-250 GW of solar modules and 200-210 GW of generation capacity, the company said – and anticipates the polysilicon price will keep rising. However, that will not be enough to dent soaring global demand for photovoltaics according to the Daqo chief.
With commentators having observed a leveling off in the poly price in recent weeks – and Zhang himself stating the figure had been steady at $26-28/kg in July and this month – the Daqo chief executive added: “We expect the strong price momentum to continue into the second half of this year.”
He put that prediction down to a failure to dent global demand for PV and to solar panel makers passing on the cost of more expensive polysilicon to their customers. The major solar manufacturers could learn a thing or two from Daqo in that respect, it seems, with a polysilicon production cost rise of two cents per kilogram between the first and second quarters of this year translating into an $8.91 hike in average selling prices over the same period, to $20.81/kg in the April-to-June period.
That added up to a revenue rise from the $256 million recorded in the first three months of the year to $441 million in the last quarter and net income for Daqo shareholders of $232 million, up from $83 million in the previous period. The year-on-year figures spell out how much the poly price has leaped, with Daqo posting revenue of $134 million in the second quarter of last year, for net income of just $2.4 million.
In terms of production volume, Daqo said its Xinjiang facilities manufactured 21,102 metric tons (MT) of polysilicon in the last quarter, up from 20,185 in Q1, although sales volume dipped over the same period, from 21,471 MT to 21,060.
Daqo recently raised RMB6.45 billion ($994 million) by floating its main business unit on the Chinese A-share market and said trading on Shanghai’s Sci-Tech Innovation Board began on July 22. That windfall will help fund plans to expand annual production capacity to 270,000 MT by 2025, the company said.

And the new funding follows Nexamp’s recent agreement with Walmart to subscribe to 23 of the solar company’s New York community solar farms. The retailer will receive energy credits, equivalent to approximately 50 MW of the entire portfolio. Walmart has 36 stores and one distribution center participating in the program.

The portfolio covers five states and includes some 100 community solar projects, including energy storage capacity totaling 120 MWh. MUFG Union Bank served as the lead arranger for the syndicated financing, which included a group of lenders. At the time, Nexamp said it has nearly 300 new solar and storage projects in its development pipeline.
The company said it will use the most recent equity investment to expand to more markets. It will also continue to build its workforce to develop additional retail offerings. Nexamp said it has more than 300 employees, tripling its workforce in less than three years.
Nexamp develops, designs, builds, and operates distributed solar and energy storage solutions. It has nearly 1 GW of solar and energy storage assets operating and under construction.
