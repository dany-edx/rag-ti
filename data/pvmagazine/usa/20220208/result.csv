The concept grew out of a 2021 study conducted at the University of California, Merced and UC Santa Cruz, which found many advantages to mounting solar panels over open water canals.
The study showed that covering the approximately 4,000 miles of public water delivery system infrastructure in California with solar panels can generate 13GW of energy annually, equal to about one sixth of the state’s current installed capacity and about half the projected new capacity needed to meet the state’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030.
“Solar canals are an example of an energy-water nexus that offer multiple sustainability benefits. Using water canals for solar infrastructure conserves water while producing renewable electricity and avoids converting large tracts of land to solar development,” said Dr. Brandi L. McKuin, lead author of the study.
The Turlock Irrigation District (TID) is partnering with the Department of Water Resource (DWR), Solar AquaGrid, and the University of California, Merced in the $20 million project funded by the State of California. Groundbreaking on Project Nexus is scheduled for this fall, with the project expected to be complete in 2024 at multiple locations throughout the TID service territory. The project will include energy storage to study how storage facilities can support the local electric grid when solar generation is suboptimal due to cloud cover.
Solar AquaGrid LLC founders recognized the untapped opportunity to put a lid on evaporation by shading California canals, as is done in Europe, where canals are lined with tree cover, and in India, where canals are being covered with solar panels, and began their investigation, forming a unique public/private/academic collaboration to advance California’s Solar Over Canal initiative. The company commissioned the study at the University of Merced through the Sierra Nevada Research Institute and UC Water.
“Research and common sense tell us that in an age of intensifying drought, it’s time to put a lid on evaporation,” said Jordan Harris, CEO of Solar AquaGrid. “Our initial study revealed mounting solar panels over open canals can result in significant water, energy, and cost savings when compared to ground-mounted solar systems, including added efficiency resulting from an exponential shading/cooling effect. Now is the chance to put that learning to the test.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/08/the-relationship-of-pv-and-metal-roofs-mounting-system-methods/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RACKING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 8, 2022",The relationship of PV and metal roofs: Mounting system methods,"S-5!, a manufacturer of metal roof attachment solutions with non-penetrative solutions for attaching solar systems to metal roofs, has released a three-part series of white papers examining the relationship between solar and metal roofs with the Metal Construction Association (MCA). In the first entry of this series, the two explored the advantages metal roofs inherently have in housing solar systems, from the perspective of asset lifespans and overall system lifetime costs.
In the second entry, S-5! and MCA take a deep dive into the common types of mounting systems for metal roofs, and the associated risks, pros, and cons of each.
Before mounting is even considered, installers must recognize and identify a roof’s solar zone, which is the roof area most appropriate for solar, determined by sun angle, roof obstructions, shading effects, etc. Power production efficiencies and overall system value are maximized with slopes closest to the optimal sun angle, which is south-facing for southern-hemisphere installations, and north-facing for northern-hemisphere installations.
For clarity, all hypothetical installations from the paper and referenced in this article will be southern-hemisphere installations.
Once an area has been identified, then it’s time to consider mounting.
The authors outline that the most common mounting layouts are flush or tilted, with both of those configurations leaving a roughly four-inch gap between the module and roof surface for optimal airflow and cell cooling. Adding to this, the authors also outline that falling module prices in the 2010s led to a bit of a revolution in ideal mounting configurations.
When modules were more expensive and less efficient, achieving optimal sun angle with added mounting costs was financially sound within cost recovery calculations. Now that module costs have fallen dramatically, current trends favor low-cost, flush-mounted systems that facilitate additional module installation, resulting in higher power density, in terms of watts/square foot, and less severe structural impact.  
According to the report, flush-mounted systems are commonly used on metal roofs with slopes as low as 2º. And while these “near-flat” modules don’t achieve the energy density of modules positioned at the optimal sun angle, the reduction in energy production may be as little as 5% in southern areas or as high as 12% in northern areas.
these near-flat installation strategy also allows north-facing roof areas to carry arrays with power production only a few percent lower than their south-facing counterparts, making flush-mounted systems a contender for the best life-cycle cost on large, commercial low-slope roofs, particularly in southern areas of the U.S.
Rail mounted vs. direct-attach
Within flush-mounting, the installation can either be installed above the rails or ribs of the metal roof, in a configuration known as rail mounted, or directly to the rails/ribs, in a configuration known as direct-attached.
In a rail mounted configuration, the rail allows neighboring modules to be within an inch or less of each other, sometimes maximizing power density. Because the racking system is above the rails, the gap between the module and roof surface is usually seven to nine inches, allowing for extra space for optimizers and rapid shutdown equipment.
Overheating rapid shutdown equipment has been hypothesized as a cause of some rooftop solar installation fire events in the past, but the data to support such claims is incomplete, so that’s a story for another day.
While such a method generally leads to low wind loads on the system and roof, snow, ice, and debris may accumulate under the module, so periodic inspection and preventative maintenance is advised by the authors. Snow loads can create a whole host of issues, so extra consideration is recommended when planning an installation in snow-prone areas.
In direct-attach installations, since the mounting systems are attached directly to the seams or rails of the roof, the gap between the module and roof surface is usually smaller, at around five inches.
In terms of positives, such an approach can provide a more uniform load distribution to the roof and/or roof structure, with the authors stating that an such an approach could add as little as 15% of the weight that would be added to the roof in a railed approach. This approach can, however, take up more space than rail-mounted, and may not be optimal for those with limited solar zones.
Considerations for tilted modules
Using a tilted mounting system improves or maximizes module-level energy density, at the cost of an increase in the initial materials cost and added collateral dead load of those materials to the roof. Collateral dead load refers to the self-weight of permanently installed materials attached to the roof or supporting structure with the exact location unknown at the time of design.
Tilted systems also increase the wind and snow loads that a system and roof are subject to. Many times these additional loads show up outside of the loads that the roof was designed to withstand at installation, and can put a significant amount of stress on the roof as a result.
Regardless of chosen mounting configuration, PV arrays that are not properly designed and installed can become airborne during a wind event and pose a serious threat of injury, personal and property damage and present a life-safety issue.
In the next installment of the comparison series, S-5! and MCA expound on various metal roof types and code and standard requirements that cover the design, testing, manufacturing, and certifications that accompany the PV mounting system.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/08/novel-energy-solutions-and-mechatron-solar-partner-on-20mw-solar-tracker-project-in-midwest/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 8, 2022",Novel Energy Solutions and Mechatron Solar partner on 20MW solar tracker project in Midwest,"Novel Energy Solutions LLC announced a new strategic partnership with Mechatron Solar to develop C&I and utility scale dual-axis tracker solar installations. The initial installation is a planned 20MW solar project in the Midwest.
Mechatron Solar trackers incorporate gearless, hydraulic motion drives. For the 20MW project, Mechatron Solar will manufacture approximately 515 of its \M18KD trackers at its Stockton, California facility. The company said its M18KD tracker has demonstrated 99.97% uptime over the past decade across 90MW in Europe and North America. The tracking system motion of the M18KD gearless dual-axis tracker is based on the accuracy of the astronomical algorithm, which Mechatron Solar estimates provides up to 40% greater energy production than conventional systems.

Novel Energy Solutions, a family-owned Minnesota-based solar energy company founded in 2012, has developed more than 300MW of community solar garden projects, including the first four in Xcel Energy’s Minnesota territory. While the company initially focused on Minnesota and the Midwest, it now has ongoing and completed projects from coast-to-coast.

Last July, Mechatron received a US patent for its gearless, dual-axis trackers. The platform is one of the largest trackers available, with a 90-panel, 144-cell per-panel mounting table. The M18KD trackers were built with the conditions of harsh, northern climates in mind, as the gearless nature mitigates mechanical failures, and the array can be tilted to 70 degrees to shed snow. When tracking, the azimuthal axis performs a caterpillar-like “Catch-Move-Release-Return” movement, which Mechatron said increases stability and safety. The central braking system makes the system highly durable, said Mechatron.
Also developed by Mechatron is the M16KD model, a solar tracker for agrivoltaic applications. The mount features extra spacing between the vertical panel stacks to permit light to pass through to crops beneath the structure.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/08/renewable-energy-heat-batteries-for-industrial-applications-gain-funding/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 8, 2022",Renewable energy heat batteries for industrial applications gain funding,"Rondo Energy announced the closing of a $22 million Series A funding round to support its technology, a renewable energy heat battery aimed at reducing the carbon impact of industrial processes. The funding round was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Energy Impact Partners. 
It is estimated about one third of global emissions can be attributed to heavy industry. And about 40% of that, or 10% of global emissions, comes from high-temperature industrial products like cement and steel. 
The Rondo heat battery offers a zero emissions source of industrial heat, storing solar and wind energy at temperatures over 1200°C. The company said it plans to begin manufacturing and delivering systems to customers later this year. 
“We believe the Rondo Heat Battery will prove critical to closing stubborn emissions gaps,” said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “The cost of renewable energy has been steadily falling, but it hasn’t been an option for industries that require high temperature process heat since there was no way to efficiently convert renewable electricity to high temperature thermal energy. Rondo enables companies in industries such as cement, fuels, food and water desalination to reduce their emissions while also leveraging the falling costs of renewables.” 
The system is designed to pull energy from solar, wind, and the energy grid, charging the battery intermittently, but delivering continuous heat. Rondo said the battery bricks are made of safe, widely available materials.
The company claims the heat battery stores energy with 98% efficiency, something that Peter Saundry, physicist and environmental technology professor at John Hopkins University, said was “way too optimistic.” Saunders said if the company can achieve efficiencies around 85-90%, then in his view the company has a “really good technology.” 
High-heat industrial processes need decarbonization alongside other sectors. This process of converting intermittent zero-carbon energy into continuous high heat or energy is an example of “indirect electrification.” Another example would be the production of green hydrogen, like the fuel produced in a partnership between Heliogen, a concentrated solar power facility maker, and Bloom Energy, a hydrogen electrolyzer.

On display this year are two solar generators for RVs from Jackery, designed to provide clean energy on the road or while camping.
The generators are lithium batteries with a maximum power point controller (MPPT), AC/DC inverter, and numerous outputs including USB, car outlets, and traditional wall outlets. The devices can be paired with up to four SolarSaga 100W panels, which feature built-in kickstands for quick setup. Altogether, the devices represent a fully off-grid and portable solar PV kit.
The smaller SG1000 model provides 1002Wh, and can be charged in full by two SolarSaga panels in about eight hours, said Jackery. The battery station weighs 22 lbs. and measures 13.1 x 9.2 x 11.1 in (33.3 x 23.3 x 28.3 cm).
The 100W panels are monocrystalline solar cells with up to 23% efficiency, said Jackery. The panel is encased with a laminated, splash-proof casing for durability, and has zippered holsters to store the cables when not in use. Both the battery and panels are backed by a 24 month warranty from Jackery.
The larger SG1500 model on display is a 1534Wh lithium-ion battery with a stated lifecycle of 500 cycles to 80%+ capacity. The 35 lbs. battery is 14 x 10.4 x 12.7 in (35.6 x 26.4 x 32.3 cm). The devices are all CEC, DOE, FCC, QC3.0, ROHS, CA Prop 65 certified.
Jackery said a fully charged SG1000 can power a 60W TV for 13 hours, an iPhone for 100 charges, or a  60W mini fridge for 17 hours.

And one might say that it’s not a winter storm too soon.
OhmConnect’s Texas electricity services offering is a divergence from their California offerings as a flexible demand response company. During California’s August 2020 heat wave, Ohm says its technology saved approximately 1GWh of electricity – paying its customers $1.3 million in electricity savings.
Of course, of all the states, Texas can really make use of load shedding. The 2021 Winter Storm Uri knocked the Texas power grid out for several days and led to the death of hundreds of Texans. And to be blunt, the state has done nothing substantial to fix this ongoing issue.
OhmConnect suggests that participating in their program, which allows a combination of remote software and hardware managed from a central location to scale back demand en masse during power grid events, can save users 10-15% off of their electricity bills annually. The company says it has almost 200,000 customers enrolled.
Customers are offered reward points that can be turned into cash, converted into credits on their electricity bills, entered into prize drawings, or used to buy smart devices that further reduce their energy use when they allow OhmConnect’s technology to manage energy demand.
Interestingly, the state’s Governor was pleading with the population to limit their electricity usage. That plea specifically included reaching out to Bitcoin Miners to shut down their facilities. Sources have suggested that nearly 99% of miners shut down their facilities for the storm.
Ohm
In addition to cash, credits, hardware, donations to the Sierra Club, gift cards, and other benefits — Ohm has also launched the ‘OhmConnect Wheel’! Some lucky OhmConnect customers who ‘spin the wheel’ are entered into a biweekly prize of a trip to Disneyland.
One OhmConnect family who recently won the prize says that they haven’t had to give much thought to their OhmHours, they simply turn off the A/C and double check that they aren’t using any major appliances during the event. And then, apparently, some of them go to Disneyland.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/08/fraunhofer-ise-reaches-legal-settlements-with-seven-inverter-manufacturers-who-infringed-its-patent/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CHINA,GERMANY,TAIWAN",PETRA HANNEN,"FEBRUARY 8, 2022",Fraunhofer ISE reaches legal settlements with seven inverter manufacturers who infringed its patent,"From pv magazine Germany
Highly Efficient and Reliable Inverter Concept (HERIC) is the name of a circuit and the associated process that Heribert Schmidt and his colleagues from Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE invented in 2002 and that is protected by patents in Europe and the USA. According to the research institute, the topology is used in single-phase inverters, for example in photovoltaic roof systems, and enables very high efficiencies of up to 99% with low interference emissions with little additional effort, compared to conventional inverters. In addition to the higher energy yield, the advantages are lower thermal stress for the components, smaller heat sinks, and longer service life.
The Fraunhofer ISE estimates that more than 80% of all single-phase inverters used worldwide are based on its HERIC topology, although in many cases its use is not allowed. “A large number of manufacturers have used the circuitry or the process in its original form or in modified versions that nevertheless infringe the patent without the consent of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. The latter was confirmed by the Munich I Regional Court,” said Fraunhofer ISE in a statement.
The institute said it has secured seven patent infringement settlements against companies from China, Taiwan and Germany, all of them out-of-court. As a result of the settlements, Fraunhofer ISE receives payments for the licensing of its HERIC topology and the companies making the payments are allowed to continue selling their products.
“The infringement of IP rights of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft is, therefore, not worthwhile for infringers. IP from Germany is in many products of the photovoltaic industry and not infrequently the patents on them are infringed. We are prepared to take action against patent infringements,” said Andreas Bett, director of the Fraunhofer ISE. “As the infringement proceedings have shown, it would also have been economically worthwhile for the companies concerned to take care of a license at an early stage.”
