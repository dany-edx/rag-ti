In its petition to the New York Public Service Commission (PSC), National Grid said the company-owned 2 MW/3 MWh battery storage project at its East Pulaksi Substation was installed in 2018 to meet peak load reduction needs during the summer months to mitigate at-risk load. National Grid said the project remains idle during most of the year.
The utility had built the Pulaski project, as well as another battery facility to meet state mandates and help achieve energy storage goals. Now, National Grid is seeking PSC approval to bid energy, capacity, and/or ancillary services available from the Pulaski project into the New York Independent System Operator markets.
According to the petition, National Grid believes this will aid the utility’s understanding of such transactions before the company deploys two larger bulk battery projects–the 20 MW/40 MWh Old Forge and the 10 MW/20 MWh North Lakeville projects — that have expected in-service dates before 2023.
Although the Pulaski project is smaller, it is similar to the bulk projects. That means lessons learned now would benefit the utility when it comes time to bid the bulk units into the NYISO wholesale market.
National Grid also said that the financial gains would ultimately benefit utility customers and allow the company to use the Pulaski project more effectively when it’s not needed for local reliability.

Known as a leading utility-scale developer, EDFR previously bought a 50% stake of EnterSolar as part of a strategic partnership in late 2018.
Now, as a wholly owned subsidiary of EDFR, EnterSolar will operate as a part of the Distributed Solutions Group and benefit from increased financial stability and broader offerings, including energy storage and smart electric vehicle charging.
EnterSolar has a 15-year track record of providing behind-the-meter solar solutions for a range of U.S. corporate clients, with the company installing 59 MW in 2020.
Corporate customers over the years included Amazon, Target, PepsiCo, and Facebook, among others.
EDFR said this latest investment in EnterSolar capitalizes on the accelerating growth in the C&I solar market.
Whether by installing rooftop arrays on-site or signing power purchase agreements, corporations around the world continue to embrace solar.

In 2020, 5,965 new rooftop solar systems were installed across Oahu, Hawaii Island, and Maui County, up from the 3,840 systems in 2019. 2020 was also a landmark year for residential storage, with 4,624 of the the new solar systems (78%) including battery storage.
At the end of 2020, there were a cumulative 87,848 private customer systems connected to Hawaiian Electric’s five island grids, including 9,751 with energy storage. When combined with grid-scale solar installations, the generating capacity of the company’s solar projects totaled 968 MW at the end of 2020, an increase of 7% from 902 MW in 2019. In total, about 3.7 million panels call the islands their home.
With the 2020 figures taken into account, 36% of single-family homes on Oahu, 29% in Maui County, and 21% on Hawaii Island have rooftop solar, among the most per capita in the nation.
These numbers are only set to rise – significantly, in the hopes of Hawaiian Electric – as the company institutes its Quick Connect program, which will allow customers installing new rooftop solar systems to get their systems online faster.
For the next 12 months, utility customers on Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii islands will not need to go through certain steps of standard approvals before activating their systems. Instead, the approval process can now be handled after the system is built and turned on, substantially reducing the wait for many new solar customers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/27/ux-solar-eyes-250-mw-of-community-solar-as-it-builds-its-portfolio/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 27, 2021",UX Solar eyes 250 MW of distributed solar as it builds its portfolio,"UX Solar, a joint venture between Excelsior Energy Capital and Unico Solar Investors LLC, along with co-development partner Namasté Solar, broke ground on four new community solar gardens in the Denver metro area, totaling 8 MW of capacity.
In 2019, Xcel Energy selected Unico Solar and Namasté Solar to develop and build the new community solar gardens.
The development will operate on a mixed subscription-based model, providing access to solar energy for both residential and private commercial customers. Seventy-five percent of the renewable power will be provided to 16 buildings owned by Unico Properties in Boulder and Denver. The remaining 25% will be sold to residential customers.

Seattle-based Unico Properties is a big property owner in the Denver area. But most of the properties are not well suited to solar, said Adam Knoff, director and co-founder of Unico Solar, in an interview with pv magazine USA. Most buildings are either “tall and skinny” or historic structures that didn’t lend themselves to solar, he said.
As a result, UX Solar is leasing a total of 40 acres in suburban Aurora to accommodate the four solar sites. Each site is expected to generate 3.65 million kWh per year, totaling more than 290 million kWh over the 20-year contract term with Xcel Energy. Modules for the projects are from Boviet, Chint is supplying inverters, and racking is by Array Technologies.
The community solar gardens work toward Colorado’s overall goal to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2040, as set forth by HB-1003, the Community Solar Gardens Modernization Act, which makes it easier for the state’s residents to access clean energy.
The new sites are part of a planned three-year, 250 MW portfolio of distributed solar projects being built by Unico Solar and Excelsior across North America.
Project financing is through Excelsior’s Renewable Energy Investment Fund I LP and will include tax equity and debt. The fund has total capital commitments of $504 million and invests equity in middle-market wind and solar power plants across the United States and Canada. To date, the fund has made seven investments covering 27 solar and wind projects across five states, with a combined nameplate capacity of 192 MW.
Knoff said one of the biggest development challenges in Colorado has been the competitive nature of the community solar program.
“The past year’s RFP was hands down the most competitive Xcel Energy had,” he said. The RFP solicited proposals for 75 MW of capacity and garnered more than 350 MW in proposals.
Finding suitable development sites has also proved challenging, Knoff said. Not only is it critical to find substations with sufficient capacity, but also solar developers are competing with real estate developers and oil and gas interests for land owners’ attention.
Unico Solar is working with the City of Denver and its Renewable Denver Initiative to site additional community solar on carports, libraries, and community centers.
For now, at least, Colorado’s rate structure does not lend itself to including energy storage along with community solar. Knoff said that storage technology remains expensive. That, coupled with Colorado’s relatively unfavorable rate structure, is keeping storage off the table.
Editor’s note: The story was updated to correct Adam Knoff’s title and include equipment suppliers for the community solar projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/27/biden-orders-government-wide-approach-to-fight-climate-change/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 27, 2021",Biden orders government-wide approach to fight climate change,"President Joe Biden is taking several new executive actions aimed at battling climate change, protecting the environment, and supporting science, clean energy, and disadvantaged communities.
The actions, which were taken January 27, underscore the Biden administration’s dedication to tackling climate issues. They build on executive orders signed on Biden’s first day in office, including rejoining the Paris climate agreement, blocking the Keystone XL pipeline, and reviewing environmental policy rollbacks issued by the Trump administration.
The actions also help advance Biden’s goals to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net-zero economy by 2050.
According to a White House fact sheet, the executive orders call on federal agencies to lead by example and solidify climate considerations as a critical, government-wide part of U.S. foreign policy and national security.
The orders direct federal agencies to procure carbon-free electricity and zero-emission vehicles, although specific procurement goals are sparse. To help spur job creation, those purchases also must be made in America, following Biden’s recent Buy American executive order.
The climate-focused orders further direct federal agencies to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies as consistent with applicable law and identify ways to make federal operations more resilient to climate-related impacts. All agencies must develop strategies for integrating climate considerations into their international work.

In another effort to create jobs in construction, manufacturing, engineering, and skilled trades, the orders direct every federal infrastructure investment to reduce pollution, and that steps be taken to accelerate clean energy and transmission projects under federal siting and permitting processes in an environmentally sustainable manner.
The orders also establish a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands. That is a stark contrast to pro-drilling policies backed by the Trump administration.
The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) will be tasked with reviewing all existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel development on public lands and waters. DOI is also directed to identify ways to double renewable energy production from offshore wind by 2030.
To further help protect and restore public lands, the orders establish various working groups and set a goal of conserving at least 30% of U.S. lands and oceans by 2030.

Given that the Biden administration aims to transition the country away from fossil fuels, the orders create an interagency working group to coordinate investments and other revitalization efforts to assist U.S. communities reliant on coal, oil and natural gas, and power plants.
Another key aspect of Biden’s climate plans is environmental justice.
According to the White House fact sheet, the orders create new councils and direct federal agencies to develop programs, policies, and activities to address and identify the disproportionate health, environmental, economic, and climate impacts on disadvantaged communities. That includes a government-wide Justice40 Initiative with the goal of delivering 40% of the overall benefits of relevant federal investments to such communities.
To help Biden meet his climate change goals, the executive orders establish a host of new government groups.
The White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, led by the first-ever National Climate Advisor and Deputy National Climate Advisor, will serve as a central office in the White House charged with coordinating and implementing the president’s domestic climate agenda.
The National Climate Task Force will assemble leaders from across 21 federal agencies and departments to enable a whole-of-government approach to combatting the climate crisis.
In an effort to elevate climate in U.S. foreign policy, the president created the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, which will have a seat on the National Security Council.
Biden also made it clear he believes the federal government should embrace the scientific community and make decisions using the best-available data and technology.
To that end, the new Presidential Memorandum on Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking directs agencies to ensure and review “scientific integrity” and designate chief science officers.
The executive orders also re-establish the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, which will be co-chaired by the President’s Science Advisor and will advise Biden on related policies.

KPP is a member-owned public power organization that procures energy and transmission service for community-owned electric utilities across Kansas.
The storage facility is expected to enter service later this year and is designed to deliver a total of 1 MW of power for four hours. The battery system also includes a blackstart capability, which the utility may use if the grid goes offline. In blackstart use, the battery system provides power needed to start backup generators and reestablish the grid.
Kelson Energy is providing project development, market analytics and implementation support to KPP on the project. The battery system operates on FlexGen’s energy management software platform, FlexGen HybridOS.
The Kansas Power Pool is one of two municipal energy agencies in Kansas, and was established in 2004 under state statutes. In 2012, it acquired an ownership share of a natural gas-powered, combined-cycle generating facility. To finance the acquisition,  KPP issued revenue bonds, which it secured with long-term power purchase contracts with 21 member municipalities.

Markets targeted for the first quarter include Tucson, Ariz.; Fresno and the Greater Central Valley, Calif.; and Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Later this year SunPower will launch in Denver; Raleigh, N.C.; and the Washington DC metro area. The company said it plans to hire more than 300 field technicians across these cities in 2021 and to complete twice as many installs year over year.
Denver-based Pivot Energy said it completed 12 new community solar gardens totaling 34 MW of capacity in Illinois. The company was awarded the portfolio in 2019 as part of the Illinois Adjustable Block Program. Nine of the solar gardens are currently operational and producing energy for ComEd and Ameren utility customers. The remaining three gardens will come online in early spring.
Enphase Energy closed its acquisition of Montreal-based Sofdesk Inc. Sofdesk’s Solargraf software provides solar installers with pre-sales engagement design, quoting and work-flow management; and also a software product that enables roofing contractors to generate homeowner proposals using advanced machine learning technology.
Enphase said the acquisition is expected to provide the following benefits:
Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) received a donation of a 1.2 MW solar installation, valued at $1.7 million, from The Conti Group.
The donation is the largest unrestricted charitable contribution that IREC has received. Through a long-term power purchase agreement, the system will generate revenue to help support the organization’s programs for at least 13 years.
The gift was facilitated by donated services from Enertis and Perkins Coie LLP. Enertis provided a pro bono engineering evaluation of the system and Perkins Coie LLP provided pro bono legal services relating to the transfer of ownership.
The solar PV system is located on a Marine Corps base in Barstow, Calif. Upon completion, ownership of the associated limited liability corporation, Sundurance Barstow, LLC—which holds the long-term PPA—was transferred to The Conti Group. Conti then donated the Sundurance entity to IREC, with the transfer of ownership completed at the end of 2020.
IREC develops and advances the regulatory reforms, technical standards, and workforce solutions needed to enable the streamlined integration of clean, distributed energy resources.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory launched a multiyear Storage Futures Study to explore how energy storage technology advancement could impact the deployment of utility-scale storage and adoption of distributed storage, as well as future power system infrastructure investment and operations.
In the first report in the series, The Four Phases of Storage Deployment: A Framework for the Expanding Role of Storage in the U.S. Power System, NREL analysts outline a framework for the possible evolution of the stationary energy storage industry and the power system as a whole.
The framework presents a value proposition of cost-competitive storage deployment in four phases, potentially resulting in hundreds of gigawatts of installed capacity and a significant shift in our electric grid.

Phase One: Short-Duration Storage to Provide Operating Reserves
Assuming the cost of most storage technologies increases with duration, the analysts make a case for deployments following a natural progression from shorter to longer duration over time, particularly aligned with current and anticipated growth in photovoltaics and wind power. Phase one builds on the history of energy storage on the grid that has been primarily supplied by pumped storage hydro.
In phase one, short-duration storage provides operating reserves to the grid, increasing or decreasing output for a short amount of time to help maintain the balance of supply and demand on the grid.
Phase Two: The Rise of Battery Peaking Power Plants
Falling battery prices have introduced the opportunities for the deployment of batteries with 2–6 hours of duration to meet peak demand on hot summer days or in extreme cold.
Batteries’ cost-competitiveness is based on their ability to provide the same level of peaking capacity compared to traditional resources such as gas turbines. NREL analysts found significant opportunities for batteries with 4-hour durations.
Phase Three: The Age of Low-Cost Diurnal Storage
Decreased value of shorter-duration capacity marks the transition to the advent of storage technologies that can provide additional or lower-cost services to meet longer peak periods.
Phase three largely depends on how much storage costs decline and variable renewable energy deployment increases. At higher levels of variable generation deployment, cost-effective storage with up to 12 hours of duration could potentially provide significant amounts of capacity-related services.
Longer-duration storage can provide other services that add flexibility to the grid, like supporting transmission from remote wind generation sites.
Phase Four: Multiday to Seasonal Storage
The final phase introduces seasonal storage, driven by the seasonal mismatch of variable resource supply and demand, particularly in a deep-decarbonization future that relies heavily on renewable resources.
Seasonal storage would mitigate this imbalance by shifting excess renewable energy available in the spring to times of higher demand and/or lower availability of renewable resources.
A variety of technologies that can be built for seasonal or long-duration storage, including compressed air, pumped storage hydropower, as well as hydrogen, methane, or other fuels that can be stored underground for months or years.
