The IQ Battery 5P can deliver 3.84 kW continuous power and 7.68 kW peak power for 3 seconds, the company reports. The battery uses a modular design, which starts at 5 kWh of capacity and can be configured up to 80 kWh. The third generation of Enphase Energy System components includes the IQ Battery 5P, IQSystem Controller 3/3G, and IQ Combiner 5/5C. The Enphase Energy System with the IQ Battery 5P can be configured for self-consumption, savings, or full backup functionality.
The IQ Battery 5P can also be used in a grid-tied configuration without backup capabilities, which means it comes without the IQ System Controller. This is a less expensive configuration, and an IQ System Controller can be added at later time to provide backup functionality.
Enphase reports that using the Storm Guard feature of the Enphase app, homeowners can stay prepared for outages by monitoring the National Weather Service for approaching storms. If bad weather is detected, the batteries will fully charge automatically.
IQ batteries feature lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, which provides a long lifecycle and safer operation with thermal stability. Enphase reports that because the battery operates with low-voltage DC power,  installing the battery is safe, as installers are not exposed to high-voltage current. Enphase reports that its batteries are NEMA 3R rated, which is a designation by the National Electrical Manufacturers’ Association that indicates that the battery enclosure is safe for indoor and outdoor use and is protected from adverse weather conditions. The batteries meet UL 9540A performance criteria, a test for thermal runaway fire propagation protection in residential indoor wall-mounted systems.
The IQ Battery 5P comes with a 15-year limited warranty.
In Q1 2023, Enphase battery sales were down 23% over the previous quarter, as installers focused on rolling out new solar systems. Enphase CEO,Badri Kothandaraman, said he expects this trend to continue in the next quarter. “After that, we see NEM 3.0 as a net positive for California and expect strong demand to resume for solar plus storage.”
NEM 3.0 went into effect on April 15, 2023 after the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved the new net metering scheme which will slash payments for excess solar production sent to the grid by 75%. For customers in California, the Enphase system is optimized to support California’s new NEM 3.0 rules by enabling self-consumption and exporting energy at the appropriate times to create maximum value.
California installers can also use Enphase’s Solargraf platform to design and generate system proposals that optimize for NEM 3.0.
“California continues to be one of our top markets and the new IQ Battery 5P will enable our customers to maximize the value of their home solar systems with the new net metering rules,” said Bryson Solomon, chief executive officer of Infinity Energy, a Rocklin, Calif.-based installer of residential and commercial solar and storage.
The IQ Battery 5P can be ordered now, with shipments expected to begin in the third quarter of 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/25/minnesota-expands-community-solar-program-to-allow-more-lmi-customers-projects-to-5-mw/,"COMMUNITY,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MINNESOTA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 25, 2023","Minnesota expands community solar program to allow more LMI customers, projects to 5 MW","Minnesota’s community solar program has been in effect since 2013, leading to well over 826 MW of solar development across 400 sites and north of 28,000 subscribers. The state’s program has served as a rubric for other states like Illinois that have established a shared-access community solar framework that provides clean energy to residents of all income thresholds as well as small businesses and municipal offices.
However, Minnesota’s 2013 law applied only to community solar gardens (CSG) in utility Xcel Energy’s service territory, a region that amounts to 80% or more of Minnesota ratepayers.
Yesterday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed HF 2310 into law, which opens up the state’s community solar program to more residential subscribers, specifically low-to-moderate income (LMI) households, and expands the project sites from 1 MW to 5 MW community gardens.
The latest framework under the state’s Environment, Natural Resources, Climate and Energy Omnibus Bill (HF 2310) updates the community solar program to require at least half of a solar farm’s generating capacity be made available to residential subscribers.
This is significant increase for the state’s residents, especially LMI households, because previously only about 14% of generation capacity from community solar gardens went to residential subscribers, compared to small businesses and other end users.
CSGs are solar fields where customers can sign up for a subscription for a share of the electricity produced to help both offset their energy use and realize savings on their monthly utility bill.
In Minnesota, consumers faced difficulty signing up for projects due to geographic siting restrictions and developers grew frustrated with limitations long overdue for changes, according to the advocacy group Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).
HF 2310 addresses the limitations posed over recent years under the state’s ten-year old CSG program and ensures all Minnesotans, including renters and LMI customers can participate in the clean energy transition.
The amended community solar policy was authored by state representative Rick Hansen (District 53B, St. Paul), who also serves on committees for State and Local Government Finance, Agriculture Finance and Capital Investment.
“Minnesotans have long supported community solar — and now have full reassurance that we as a state will continue to lead the nation in providing clean energy and local economic opportunities through community solar programs,” said Minnesota Representative Patty Acomb (District 44B, Minnetonka)
Under the existing framework, subscribers were required to subscribe to CSG facilities within their same county or an adjacent one. Issues arose when areas with high demand for subscriptions reached capacity despite consumer demand, leaving many rural counties unable to host projects due to limited access to subscribers. With HF 2310, the arbitrary siting restriction has been removed, creating equal access for all Xcel Energy customers.
Another key aspect of the updated policy is the size increase for projects to 5 MW. Key to ensuring that all Minnesotans can access community solar, the new law prioritizes allocating capacity to LMI households, public interest subscribers, and affordable housing residents. Under the new framework, projects must provide at least 55% of the project’s capacity to LMI, public interest and affordable housing residents.
“Due in large part to community solar detractors, negotiations to modernize Minnesota’s community solar program, and the subsequent benefits it’d bring Minnesotans, have experienced delays year after year. This session proved to be a different story, however, as negotiating led to the passage of this fair, equitable, and sustainable set of updates to the community solar program that both charts the pathway to its success and realigns it with leading community solar markets across the country for years to come,” said Kevin Cray, senior regional director of policy and governmental affairs, CCSA.
Standard Solar operates close to 60 MW of community solar in Minnesota. Trevor Laughlin, policy and regulatory affairs analyst at Standard Solar told pv magazine USA:
This bill represents a significant milestone for the distributed generation solar plus energy storage sector and heralds a transformative era for Minnesota, a state that has consistently led the way in community solar initiatives. As an industry leader with operating assets and projects in development in the state, we are greatly encouraged by the program’s strong focus on public interest groups and its commitment to fostering participation from individuals with low-to-moderate incomes (LMI). We also commend the state’s initiative to incentivize developers to prioritize the inclusion of residential and LMI subscribers, a move that will have a profound impact on expanding renewable energy access.
Georgina Arreola, vice president of policy at Perch Energy told pv magazine USA:
Perch Energy enthusiastically supports the expansion and calibration of Minnesota’s Community Solar Garden program, with a special view to ensuring the benefits of solar energy are carried to income-distressed households as a matter of course. Perch advocates for policies that ensure a frictionless subscriber experience, and this law will make it easier for subscribers in Minnesota to understand the value community solar has on their budget and the environment. We encourage Minnesota to go further and implement utility consolidated billing (UCB) so subscribers see savings directly on their electric bill. Minnesota has been a leader in community solar deployment and the removal of the adjacent county rule will solidify that position, as will expanding the maximum size of gardens from 1 MW to 5 MW. Greater access to solar farms for ratepayers is further magnified by the new size limit, which means that much more investment in the state. Additionally, the law incorporates low- to moderate-income households into the investment structure, making them the preferred subscriber type instead of an afterthought.
SunVest Solar, a Pewaukee, Wisconsin-based developer, has a development portfolio of about 14 projects in Minnesota. Bram Walters, chief executive officer of SunVest told pv magazine USA:
We’re really excited to see the Governor sign this bill. SunVest has been involved in the Minnesota Community Solar market for several years and we’re actively developing several projects now. The changes in the bill will clear a path for more growth in the market and allow customers new avenues to save money with community solar.
Minnesota’s existing CSG program will remain open until the new program starts, so Minnesotans won’t miss out on the ability to sign up for community solar. By shifting implementation to the state Department of Commerce’s purview, the revised CSG program has boosted the state’s ability to access and leverage Greenhouse Gas Reduction funds from the Inflation Reduction Act to bring business opportunities to the local economy.
The Greenhouse Gas Reduction section of the IRA directs the Environmental Protection Agency’s administration of $27 billion in funding toward energy transition project improvements for low-income and disadvantaged communities. The program boosts the requirements of President Biden’s Justice40 initiative, which commits to providing 40% of federal clean energy benefits to disadvantaged communities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/25/u-s-government-eyes-9-billion-liftoff-for-long-duration-energy-storage-by-2030/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 25, 2023",U.S. Government eyes $9 billion liftoff for long duration energy storage by 2030,"The Department of Energy (DOE) released a report titled, “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Long Duration Energy Storage” (LDES). The report analyzes prerequisites for two forms of LDES systems to transition from their nascent, research-based status to a more robust position, attracting up to $530 billion in cumulative investment and significantly influencing the firmness and cleanliness of the power grid by 2050.
DOE states that maintaining this trajectory will require the deployment of six to 10 GW of LDES projects and the allocation of $6 billion to $9 billion in capital investment by 2030. To align with the 2050 goals, it will need to establish a manufacturing capacity of 10 to 15 GW and roll out further deployments by 2035.

The specified objectives for 2050 include the deployment of 225 GW to 460 GW of LDES capacity, which is projected to save $10 billion to $20 billion annually, compared to scenarios without such deployment.
The report explores two specific types of long-duration storage. Inter-day LDES, one of the types, facilitates power shifts spanning 10 to 36 hours, primarily via mechanical batteries such as pumped hydro, gravity-based storage, compressed air, liquid air, and liquid CO2 technologies. The second category, multi-day/week batteries, shifts power over periods extending from 36 to more than 160 hours. Noteworthy multi-day thermal and electrochemical batteries include various heat products, flow, and metal anode products. 
In order to meet pricing goals that DOE believes are necessary for market adoption of these products, DOE emphasizes that technology cost curves must decrease by 45% to 55% by 2030. A corresponding improvement in round-trip project performance is also anticipated.

The report projects that by 2030, inter-day LDES project costs must decrease “from $1,100 to $1,400 per kW to $650 per kW and improve round-trip efficiency from the 69% seen in best-in-class technologies in 2022, to ~75%.” Multi-day products must improve performance “from $1,900 to $2,500 per kW and 45% round trip efficiency today – to $1,100 per kW and 55% to 60% round trip efficiency by 2030.”
DOE projects that these advancements in pricing and technology are necessary for driving sales for these products. DOE currently identifies load management, PPA firming, and microgrid resilience as potentially viable use cases.
ESS has deployed its six to 12 hour energy storage product into a resilience-focused data center microgrid in Pennsylvania.
As 2030 approaches, the LDES products should integrate into utility resource planning, transmission and distribution deferral, and broader energy market participation.

LDES products provide benefits that the current market doesn’t yet fully compensate for. A key potential revenue source could be a predictable resource adequacy financial benefit. DOE posits that around $50 to $75 per kW could directly support LDES investment. 
Attaining the 260 GW to 440 GW deployment goal, which corresponds to many tens of terawatt-hours of product (although not explicitly stated in the document), could necessitate 1.5 million to 2.1 million direct jobs years in engineering and construction.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/25/new-yorks-3-33-gw-solar-output-amounted-to-record-20-of-state-power-demand/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 25, 2023",Solar energy in New York state covered record 20% of state power demand,"New York state may place tenth in the U.S. for solar output, while its 4.65 GW cumulative output may tame in comparison to industry leader California’s solar capacity of close to 35.75 GW. But both states have been seeing a record pace of solar generation represent a fair portion of daily power demand during the time of day when solar irradiance is highest.
During the noon hour on May 18, 2023, the New York Independent System Operator reported that consumer and utility-side solar resources generated a combined 3.33 GW of clean energy output, while the behind-the-meter (BTM) portion of 3.2 GW and utility-operated 130 MW accounted for 20% of the state’s electricity demand for the hour.
The actual peak load on the Empire State’s power system for the entire day of May 18 was 16.166 GW, so the state’s solar resources represented 20.6% at a peak afternoon time of day for the renewable energy asset class.
NYISO estimates BTM production by sampling data from thousands of solar installations across the state. The grid operator’s solar forecasting system uses the samples to estimate the impact of BTM solar at look-ahead periods from 15 minutes to seven days. The solar forecasting system also uses high quality meteorological measurements from the University at Albany’s Mesonet.
The New York State Mesonet is a weather network consisting of 126 weather stations, with at least one station operated in each of the state’s 62 counties. The weather stations report temperature, humidity, wind speeds and also solar irradiance by factoring daily PV watts per square meter of energy output.
At press time for this report, two townships located in the state’s Capital District, Ballston Spa and Glens Falls, N.Y., recorded 604 and 633 w/m of respective solar irradiance, according to the Mesonet database.
In early May, the state passed a law in its 2024 budget that gives the New York Power Authority (NYPA), the state’s largest power authority, the ability to build renewable energy projects to help reach the state’s 2030 climate goals.
The Build Public Renewables Act is the result of about four years of clean energy policy initiatives and looks to solidify the Empire State as not just a leader in community solar deployments but also broader categories like offshore wind and standalone energy storage.
The new law gives the authority power over clean energy directives than the previous 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which set greenhouse gas reduction goals of 70% for its power fleet to come from renewable energy while cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030.
The new law includes several provisions that provide community solar access to low- and middle-income residents (LMI), as well as codified labor and energy justice provisions for workers displaced by fossil fuel projects.
According to the New York Research Development Authority (NYSERDA), the state’s energy development authority, through March 31, 2023 the state had 4.65 GW of solar deployments across 196,130 total projects.  The state enjoys a $1.98 per watt cost to install solar, an increase from $1.81/W in 2022, according to the NY Solar Map.
In the Big Apple, the metropolitan region’s five boroughs generated 345.3 MW of solar resources, with this author’s borough of Queens holding the biggest piece, with 125.4 MW or 36% of the region’s solar output.
At 8:45 am local time today, New York City used 5.02 GW of power, or about 34% of the state’s total grid resources, while solar represents about 6.9% of the city’s power mix.
The New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA) is holding its 2023 NYC Solar + Storage Summit on June 20, 2023 at the John Jay College in west Midtown. The renewable energy conference will hear from speakers at Con Edison, Clean Capital, the Green Institute at We Act for Environmental Justice, NY Green Bank and PowerMarket, a community solar aggregator, among others.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/25/certainteed-modules-shingles-address-homeowner-contractor-and-environmental-needs/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 25, 2023","CertainTeed modules, shingles address homeowner, contractor, and environmental needs","The residential solar market continues to grow as homeowners seek to save on their energy bills, reduce their carbon footprint, and take measures to insulate themselves from increasing utility costs. The Solar Energy Industries Association reported that despite supply chain issues, the residential solar market grew 40% between 2021 and 2022, with a record 700,000 homeowners installing solar panels.
Trends in the industry have also moved away from third-party ownership of solar products, with homeowners opting to purchase systems instead of leasing them.
In developing its portfolio of Solstice solar products – which includes solar shingles as well as panels – CertainTeed considers the needs of homeowners and the needs of the builders and contractors that will be installing them. While up-front costs and long-term savings play a major role in any selection, other considerations include reliability and ease of installation.
With performance and value in mind, CertainTeed offers two different Solstice Panels – one the half-cell monocrystalline 400 W module and the other being the 440 W module, with efficiencies of 20.5% and 20.4% respectively. Both are UL listed (UL 61730-1, UL 61730-2) and feature a black backsheet and black anodized aluminum frame for superior aesthetics.
Solstice Panels allow for rapid installation. When installed by CertainTeed-credentialed solar contractors, CertainTeed’s warranty covers up to 25 years for labor, both for its panels and the rest of the system, including any CertainTeed-installed roof. As the only warranty of its kind, homeowners get peace of mind that their investment is protected.
For homeowners that want to elevate the curb appeal of their homes, CertainTeed Solstice Shingles don’t require racking and are designed for fast installation directly on roof sheathing by shingle roofing crews using standard deck screws. Water channels and raised fastener locations provide added protection against water intrusion through the homeowner’s roof.
In areas where wind is a serious concern, CertainTeed’s Solstice Shingles are rated to be installed in any wind zone – including Florida’s high velocity hurricane zone. High power output sets the CertainTeed solar shingle apart. Whereas most solar shingles yield between 13 W and 63 W, CertainTeed’s solar shingles produce up to 70 W.
Regardless of whether it’s panel- or shingle-based, CertainTeed’s Solstice systems are backed by an industry-leading comprehensive warranty that covers both the product and workmanship for 25 years.
After all, residential solar power systems should not only be good for the planet, but also good for the homeowners’ wallets. The solutions should not only be easy for builders and contractors to install but should also provide a return on the homeowner’s investment, a secure energy supply, and peace of mind for years to come.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/25/u-s-house-fails-to-override-presidents-veto-on-overturning-solar-tariff-moratorium/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 25, 2023",U.S. House fails to override President’s veto on overturning solar tariff moratorium,"Earlier this month, President Biden vetoed the repeal of the two-year moratorium on solar modules made in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, saying it would undermine the efforts to ramp up domestic manufacturing to support a burgeoning solar industry and would create uncertainty for businesses and workers in the U.S. solar industry. Today the U.S. House of Representatives failed to achieve the two-thirds majority needed to override that veto.
The vote is celebrated among leaders in the solar industry, citing job growth and a strengthening supply chain as reasons to keep the moratorium in place.
“Today’s vote underscores just how unpopular it is to threaten American jobs and undermine energy security,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “The American solar and storage industry is creating opportunities in communities across the country, and re-instituting harmful retroactive tariffs at this juncture would harm business certainty and trigger layoffs, delaying the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act.”
Building out the solar infrastructure in the U.S. will take an enormous amount of capacity. According to the Department of Energy’s “Solar Futures Study”, with aggressive cost reduction, supportive policy and large-scale, solar could supply 40% of U.S. electricity in 2035 and 45% in 2050. That would require average annual growth of 30 GW in new solar capacity this year and next, rising to 60 GW extra per year from 2025 to 2030, for a terawatt of new solar capacity by 2035. To support this growth many manufacturers have announced their intent to begin producing modules in the U.S .and some have promised more upstream supplies, such as cells, wafers, ingots and polysilicon.
“This moratorium will serve as an important bridge as we expand domestic manufacturing and strengthen the solar and storage supply chain with more American products,” Hopper said. “Finally, with this business certainty in hand, solar companies can get back to building our country’s clean energy future.”
“We want to thank our champions in the House for protecting thousands of small businesses and more than a quarter-million Americans that have a solar and storage career,” she said.
President Biden stated that he does not intend to extend the tariff suspension past the conclusion of the two-year period, which would end in June 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/25/flexible-demand-through-participation-by-large-customers-in-wholesale-markets/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 25, 2023",Flexible demand through participation by large customers in wholesale markets,"An Energy Systems Integration Group (ESIG) white paper proposes enabling large industrial customers with flexibility in their demand to bid in wholesale markets the day-ahead prices they are willing to pay for various quantities of electricity.
This “elegant approach,” says ESIG, would increase demand flexibility, which could “become more important with the increase in variable renewables, electrification, and new large loads.”
The California Public Utilities Commission agrees on the value of demand flexibility to achieve a high renewables grid, and is considering approaches that would enable demand flexibility by retail customers, community choice aggregators and direct access providers.
The approach proposed by ESIG would enable large customers that could increase consumption of electricity at low prices to bid for and buy more low-cost solar and wind power at times of day of high renewable generation, when wholesale prices can be low or even negative. Such large flexible loads, the paper says, might include overnight electric vehicle charging, and the data center loads of customers with multiple data centers and the ability to shift load among them.
Other large customers, such as cryptocurrency miners or future hydrogen producers, could set an upper bound on their electricity purchase price, says the paper, and thereby reduce load at times of grid stress and higher prices.
The maximum prices that participating large customers would be willing to pay and their associated quantities would form part of the wholesale demand curve that would be matched against the supply curve of generators’ prices by the independent system operator’s market software, to set wholesale market prices in the day-ahead market. The paper also discusses how large customers’ “bid-in demand” could work in the real-time market.
Currently, the wholesale market is based on an assumption that demand is “inelastic,” that is, that demand does not vary by price, ESIG says.
The proposed approach could lower system costs by reducing overbuilding, as it could reduce the system’s peak load and could result in lower resource adequacy requirements.
The opportunity for “bid-in demand” already exists, ESIG says, with most U.S. wholesale markets having options for wholesale demand to bid into the day-ahead market, “although it is not clear” to what extent that happens, and there is “a need to assess how this works” across different independent system operators, “to what extent this capability is used, and whether the participation leads to a physical response.”
Load-serving entities may also want to bid-in their demand, the paper says, if they already engage their customers through demand response programs, distributed energy resource programs, or “advanced pricing.”
Saying that “wider adoption among residential and commercial customers may be necessary to maximize the benefits of bid-in demand,” ESIG says that “if distribution-level locational marginal prices were available,” then distribution system operators might be able to use bid-in demand price curves to clear the market “just as the wholesale system operator can do today.”
But the white paper concludes that “more thought is needed around the way” residential and commercial customers “may consider bids and how that gets aggregated through a third-party aggregator or the load-serving entity.”
ESIG distinguishes its proposed approach from the “Griddy experience during the 2021 Texas winter storm,” in which customers were exposed to days of $9/kWh prices; from “conventional” demand response; from time-of-use pricing; and from real-time retail prices based on “sending prices to devices.”
The ESIG paper is titled “Treating demand equivalent to supply in wholesale markets: an opportunity for customer, market, and social benefits.” The paper is one in a series of ESIG papers on aligning retail pricing with grid needs, including a paper on price-responsive demand to accelerate renewable generation.
ESIG describes itself as “the leading source of global expertise for energy systems integration and operations.”
