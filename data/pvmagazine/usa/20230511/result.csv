The partnered companies received a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program Phase I award from the Air Force to develop a solar-heated crucible to manufacture lightweight, thin-film solar photovoltaics (PV) for on-orbit applications used for Air Force and Space Force flight applications.
“We’re pleased to be partnering with Ascent to develop high efficiency, lightweight solar cells that can be manufactured in space,” says Rhonda Stevenson, chief executive officer of Above: Orbital. “This is the second SBIR contract from the U.S. Air Force and we believe it will lead to a larger, Phase II award. We are advancing robust on-orbit systems for both defense and commercial applications.”
The Air Force has a vital and urgent need to deploy lightweight and affordable solar modules across the globe as well as in space to meet operational power requirements for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), forward operating bases and space-based power beaming.
“Above’s ability to provide tunable, artificial gravity, coupled with our manufacturing equipment cost and operations, create an ideal scenario for producing thin-film solar in space,” said Dr. Joseph Armstrong, chief technology officer, Ascent Solar.
Above: Orbital has already begun to make an impact in multiple commercial sectors with use cases ranging from in space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing to photonics and space tourism. Earlier this year, Above: Orbital received a $1.7 million SBIR award to develop an efficient, lightweight structure to support solar panels, power and communications antenna hardware systems, as well as other space infrastructure functions.
Formerly known as Orbital Assembly, Above: Orbital is a Huntsville, Ala.-based company that designs and operates space stations for on-orbit, lunar missions, and throughout the solar system.
Solar module producer Ascent Solar also expanded its offerings recently to include space mission applications. In April, the company announced a new product line, Space Hardware Development Kits (HDKs), developed previously under collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).
The HDK platform integrates the company’s thin-film solar modules for use in accelerate mission schedules to boost spacecraft performance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/11/utility-scale-solar-installation-goes-automated/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 11, 2023",Utility-scale solar installation goes automated,"Terabase announced it is launching an automated utility-scale solar installation system, dubbed Terafab. The company describes the service as an automated “field factory” that can double installation productivity. 
The installation system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7. 
The company also announced the grand opening of a Woodland, California manufacturing facility; “a factory to make factories.” The facility is currently manufacturing the first gigawatt Terafab assembly line with capacity to make more than 10 GW of Terafabs per year.  
Terabase said its system will double labor productivity when compared to traditional utility-scale installation methods. The system offers high-throughput, 24/7 operation, and modularity to enable rapid ramp-ups and higher solar field construction speeds, significantly reducing project schedules. 
“We successfully field-tested Terafab last year, building 10 MW of a 400 MW site in Texas. Today’s launch is the next step forward to rapid commercial scale-up,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer and co-founder of Terabase. 
Terabase has partnered with developer Intersect Power, engineering, procurement and construction firm Signal Energy, tracking hardware provider NEXtracker, and solar panel manufacturer First Solar to develop the Terafab facility. 
“Not only does our partnership with Terabase bring advanced installation technology to our next-generation Series 7 solar module, but it also enables a closed-loop packaging recycling system consistent with our vision of responsible solar,” said Nick Strevel, vice president of product, First Solar. “The Terafab system is another example of how homegrown American innovation can help accelerate the deployment of solar, enabling our country’s decarbonization ambitions.” 
Terafab is pegged for commercial deployment starting in Q3 2023. 
The company said that the automated installation system reduces the levelized cost of electricity for utility-scale solar projects. It is also scalable, built on a modular design that can be replicated and deployed quickly. 
Terafab reduces the physical safety risk of construction workers by eliminating the need to lift heavy solar panels and steel structures, often in harsh weather conditions, by utilizing automation on a climate-controlled assembly line. 
The system may offer a solution to the solar industry’s need to find more qualified installation technicians. A transition to a carbon-free energy sector is going to take a large, well-trained workforce, and readying that workforce may pose a challenge in the near-term, the company states.
The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) said 89% of solar firms reported in 2021 they’ve had difficulty finding qualified applicants. A recent survey by SolarReviews found that difficulty finding workers was the third-most common concern among survey participants. 
Solar now represents 59% of the clean power capacity in development, gaining 4% in share from 2021 to 2022, said the American Clean Power Association. To reach the federal goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035, the solar workforce will need to more than double from 255,000 to over 538,000, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Automation may offer a solution to the labor shortage as the nation works to rapidly decarbonize. 
In August 2022, Terabase Energy announced a $44 million Series B financing from Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Prelude Ventures, with participation from SJF Ventures and other previous investors, bringing the company’s total funding to date to $52 million.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/11/solar-on-industrial-rooftops-could-meet-35-of-electricity-demand-of-manufacturing-facilities/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 11, 2023",Solar on industrial rooftops could meet 35% of electricity demand of manufacturing facilities,"Powering energy-intensive sectors of the U.S. economy with renewable energy would go a long way toward achieving the Biden Administration’s climate goals of reducing emissions by at least 50% from a 2005 baseline by 2030 and achieving net-zero pollution by 2050.
A recent study conducted at Northeastern University looked at how solar could power U.S. manufacturing. It found that solar mounted on industrial rooftops could meet the electricity demand of 35% of manufacturers.
According to the researchers, the industrial sector accounts for 38% of global energy consumption and 37% of greenhouse gas emissions. And with on-site sources of renewable energy currently supplying less than 0.1% of industrial electricity demand in the U.S., the opportunities for carbon reduction are great.
The study, Environmental Research: Sustainability and Infrastructure, published in IOP Publishing’s journal, looks at the feasibility of meeting these electricity demands through on-site rooftop solar installations for different regions and manufacturing sectors across the United States.
Using the U.S. Department of Energy Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey from the Energy Information Administration, the researchers compared the potential electricity generation of rooftop solar arrays against the electricity demand per unit of floor space for the average manufacturing building.
Monthly solar generation potential per unit area was calculated using the system advisor model (SAM) for on-site roof-mounted panels for the capital of each U.S. state. SAM is a techno-economic analysis and energy simulation model, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories.
The model used 476 W (DC) SunPower solar modules with a 22% nominal efficiency on a fixed-mount solar system. The modeled ABB inverter has a  97.5% California Energy Commission weighted efficiency, maximum power of 20,000 W (AC) and maximum power point tracking of 800 V (DC), with an actual DC to AC ratio of 1.20. They ran the performance model based on hourly timestep simulations to calculate each system’s output by month, and they assumed that 90% of the rooftops were available for solar modules. They also conducted an alternative analysis on with modules that have a 16% nominal efficiency with only 80% of the roof covered with solar.
The researchers compared supply and demand on a net annual basis, under the assumption that facilities will make use of net metering.
The results show that rooftop solar arrays could fulfil the electricity requirement of 5% to 35% of U.S. manufacturing sectors, depending on the season. They found that manufacturers of furniture, textiles, and apparels set to benefit most, representing 2% of U.S. manufacturing electricity use and 6% of floorspace.
 
“Currently, less than 0.1% of the electricity required by the manufacturing sector in the U.S. is generated through renewable, on-site sources,” said Dr. Matthew Eckelman, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern University. “This must change if we are going to meet decarbonization goals, and in many cases rooftop solar panels are now a feasible option for supplying low-carbon energy.”
The alternative rooftop array design model was found to substantially shrink the range of supply intensities, from a high of 411 kWh m−2 yr−1 for the base case to just over 300 kWh m−2 yr−1, which is just within the range of demand intensities for the least electricity-intensive sector of furniture and related products. The researchers determined that the alternative model is not tenable for all of the other sectors in any U.S. location.
The study found that light manufacturing sectors such as furniture and apparel can cover their average net annual electricity demand with rooftop solar on their locations across the country. Other more intensive manufacturing industries can achieve electricity self-sufficiency, but in a smaller subset of U.S. locations.
An added benefit to pursuing on-site PV installations is that it enables manufacturers to maintain limited operations during periods of grid disruption, especially when coupled with on-site energy storage. Seasonally, manufacturing facilities with rooftop solar could fulfill their electrical needs in in nearly 40% of U.S. locations could in the spring and summer..
“Greater policy attention on the feasibility and potential benefits of rooftop solar panel arrays will help industries to achieve renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions goals,” said Eckelman. “Our research provides an indication of the locations and sectors for which rooftop solar arrays could significantly help manufacturing firms to reach these goals.”

While many corporations have turned to the purchase of renewable energy credits or off-site assets, some have moved forward with a more direct approach of powering their operations with on-site solar. 
Black Bear Energy, a Colorado-based company that operates as a buyer’s representative for renewables and energy efficiency services, released an inaugural quarterly report that tracks the nation’s largest procurers of on-site solar in the real estate asset ownership industry. 
Topping the list was Prologis, a real estate and supply chain logistics company. It has procured over 217 MW of on-site solar as of the report date. Prologis also recently released a request for quotes for 1 GW of solar in California. It was followed by Lineage Logistics, procuring 108 MW, and Blackstone, with over 98 MW.

“REITs and managers own large portfolios of buildings, parking garages and parking lots that can host solar in areas where distributed renewables are needed most – the distribution level grid where electricity demand is high,” said Victoria Stulgis, senior vice president of client operations, Black Bear Energy.
Among the different industry types, Prologis ranked first for the industrial sector. Brookfield Properties Retail ranked first among retailers (59.5 MW), Kilroy topped the corporate offices sector (6.1 MW) and Avalon Bay Communities topped the multifamily category (8.3 MW).
The methodology for the report includes recording publicly announced or are accessible through the public domain, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) Solar Means Business 2022 report, and deals facilitated by Black Bear Energy. Qualified projects are hosted on a real estate asset’s roof, parking lot, parking garage or land – regardless of if the electricity is used onsite or offsite. Projects are by the date of publishing of the report and located in the United States.
With the built environment responsible for close to 40% of global carbon emissions, the installation of onsite renewables plays a critical role in reducing emissions and providing clean, local energy to businesses and communities, said Black Bear Energy, a Legence Company.
“It is the real estate owners and managers that are showcased on these leaderboards that have helped set a precedent and can help accelerate the energy transition through onsite solar installations that bring green energy to local communities,” said Jeff Sprau, chief executive officer, Legence.
Other major procurers of on-site solar include Hartz Mountain Industries (50 MW), STAG (25.5 MW), Iron Mountain (14.3 MW), and Simon Property Group (12.5 MW).
When including off-site solar investment, cumulative corporate solar procurement has doubled between 2019 and late 2022. Combined, corporations in the United States have invested in 19 GW of on-site and off-site solar. SEIA said that about 55% of corporate solar investment is on off-site projects.
“The real estate industry has a tremendous opportunity to make an impact in the energy transition,” said Stulgis. “By showcasing these companies, we hope to inspire others to follow suit and accelerate the transition to a decarbonized future.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/11/napa-valley-wine-producer-to-expand-onsite-solar-capacity-to-9-2-mw/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 11, 2023",Napa Valley wine producer to expand onsite solar capacity to 9.2 MW,"The producer of Napa Valley, California wines at Beringer Vineyards may hold the claim of producing 2008 vintage solar energy at one winery, but its public owner Treasury Wine Estates may now set another record for onsite solar generation.
This week, Treasury Americas, the U.S. division of Treasury Wine Estates, announced a substantial expansion of its wineries’ onsite solar generation capacity by adding 6.5 MW of new installations across its U.S. wineries. The new installations will be installed by Shell Energy Solutions and brings the wine grower’s U.S. solar portfolio to 9.2 MW total capacity.
A Shell Energy spokeswoman told pv magazine USA that the expansion of Treasury Americas’ onsite solar generating capacity sets a new record for behind-the-meter onsite solar installations for a winery business, as recognized by an April 2023 study by global testing and advisory firm DNV GL.
With the expansion, Treasury Americas will generate approximately 14.3 million kWh annually of clean energy, while the project expansion is pivotal to Treasury Wine’s goal to transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2024 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.
The 6.5 MW portfolio expansion consists of 13,000 solar panels installed across seven sites with over 15 different solar locations, including ground mount, rooftop and carport systems.  New onsite solar per site averages between 750kW and 1 MW per project, Shell Energy said.
The U.S. solar portfolio will initially provide daily solar energy, though the spokeswoman said the asset owner is also evaluating the addition of energy storage to the portfolio over time. Shell Energy’s approach for commercial decarbonization solutions for the winery includes on-site solar as well as energy efficiency improvements such as LED lighting, compressed air improvements and EV charging stations.
“We also recognize that future storage may be both about electricity and thermal systems, [like] banking heating or cooling, and making sure we flex our demand to match our production,” Shell Energy’s spokeswoman said about the Treasury Americas onsite generation.
When asked about the U.S. winery portfolio’s crossover into newly tested agrivoltaics systems, where vineyards could install solar panels spaced between or directly over grape vines, she said, “A number of the (PV) sites are located on or near the vineyards. While these are not agrivoltaic designs, that may be evaluated in the future,” she added.
Beringer Vineyards, a Treasury Americas winery that dates back to 1876, installed its first solar arrays in 2008 in St. Helena, Calif.  With the solar expansion, Treasury’s Beaulieu Vineyard, Beringer Vineyards, Etude Winery, and Frank Family Vineyards in Napa Valley will also see solar system installations, as well as properties in Paso Robles and the Central Coast.
Wildfire resiliency
Sterling Vineyards, a Treasury Americas winery closed since 2020 due to damage from the Glass Fire, a September 2020 wildfire that lasted 23 days and consumed 67,484 acres in both Napa and Sonoma Counties, is expected to reopen later this year fully powered by the Shell Energy solar systems.
“We have a responsibility to be stewards of the environment and to mitigate the impact of the climate crisis on our wines and communities. The rapid transition to 100% renewable electricity will eliminate the majority of our production emissions in only a few short years,” said Will Drayton, director of sustainability and science, Treasury Americas.
“Furthermore, additionality is key. By maximizing our on-site solar generation, we are greening the California grid and opening the door to future developments such as onsite storage,” Drayton said.
Treasury Wine has 2,600 employees worldwide and operates wine-growing and packaging facilities in Australia, New Zealand, France, Italy, the North and Central Coast regions of California.
In the U.S., one of its properties to see onsite solar systems, Frank Family Vineyards, was acquired by Treasury Wine in November 2021 for $315 million. Frank Family, located in Calistoga, Calif., produces 174,000 cases of wine per year and is known for its Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir.
