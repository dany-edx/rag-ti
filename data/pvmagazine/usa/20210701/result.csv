https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/01/do-engineers-dream-of-solar-panel-efficiency/,"GUEST POST,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORTH AMERICA",,"JULY 1, 2021",Do engineers dream of solar panel efficiency?,"In its last quarterly earnings report, MeyerBurger noted that its 27%+ efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar panel would potentially hit the market in 2023. The solar cell in this panel has already been tested at 29.52%.
In late June, JinkoSolar noted in its quarterly earnings report that it expects to successfully test a laminated perovskite solar cell over 30% efficiency by the end of the year. The company also said it had completed the construction of a “high-efficiency laminated perovskite cell technology platform.”
Also in late June, 1366 Technologies merged with Hunt Perovskite Technologies with a goal of offering a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell whose efficiency is 30% greater than the best solar cells on the market.
A reminder: 1366’s CEO told pv magazine USA just six months ago:
In fact, not only do I believe that multiple gigawatts of tandem will be sold before the end of 2022, I am also confident that in a decade’s time, tandem will command more than 50% of our industry’s market share.
The more tempered members of our industry remind us, though, that historically speaking, scaling up solar panel technology from lab to market takes decades.
One professional wondered what JinkoSolar’s “technology platform” really is, and whether it’s appropriate for investors to consider it seriously yet. And another industry watcher expects the 1366 Technologies’ prediction of multiple gigawatts of tandem cell manufacturing capacity in place before the end of next year to fall flat.
This author won’t let any of that rationality dampen our excitement.
The greatest benefit of increased solar panel efficiency is that on a per-watt and per-kilowatt hour basis, everything is cheaper.
In the image above, created by LONGi Solar, there is a comparison between a 380 Watt solar panel and a 425 Watt unit. The units are the same size, but the 425 Watt model has 11.8% more wattage, due to improvements in efficiency. A 380 Watt model found online – LR6-72HPH-380M – had a 19% efficiency.
Note that in the rate-of-change column, hardware and land savings total 7% when shifting from a 380 Watt to the 425 Watt unit on a 1 MW ground-based power plant.
Now imagine that we have a 30% efficient solar panel: that’s a 57% increase in electricity production over the 380 Watt unit. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll pretend benefits scale linearly with the LONGi comparison above. That means the 7% system savings turns into almost 35% savings.
These construction cost savings generally scale with electricity cost savings. Solar is already being proclaimed king of cheap energy generation. If we knock another 35% off construction costs, exclusively from improvements to solar panel efficiency, that’s some pretty sweet icing on the cake.
Three additional benefits result from breakthroughs in solar panel efficiency. First, local land savings results in a reduction in local pushback. Second, lower carbon footprint results from reduced equipment, transport, and labor needs. And of course, a massive boost to efficiency would certainly reinvigorate the spirit of the entire solar industry, for a third benefit.
The first two benefits are straightforward. For instance, pv magazine USA covered the fight to build what was the largest solar power plant east of the Rockies in 2019.
This fight highlighted that while solar is as popular as apple pie, there has still been a drop in its popularity due partially to agricultural and rural pushback. It also revealed concern about the environmental aspects of manufacturing massive amounts of polysilicon, and the subsequent recycling of those solar panels.
If land use is reduced by one-third and electricity used to manufacture is also reduced by one-third, then it seems logical to assume that the pushback should drop off to some degree as well.
 This image is from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) Best Research-Cell Efficiency Chart. Many readers know this chart not because it is directly applicable to their lives, but because it’s just so darn cool to see the blistering progress that solar technology has achieved in recent years.
Records are cool, lasers that beam energy to specialized solar cells are cool, and even carbon-nanotube solar pipe dreams are cool (even if we never figure out how to manufacture them) because that’s simply how life, and innovation, works.
If – or, more likely when – the solar manufacturers of the world sort out the manufacturing challenges behind tandem perovskite+silicon solar cells, it will open a clear path towards 34-35% efficient solar cells (the current speculative peak efficiency value of this product).
Already multi-layered solar cell products are common in expensive markets – the International Space Station for instance – but it is still too expensive for practical surface-based electricity generation.
We will finally see multijunction high efficiency products for the common person.

Of course, multi-layered products are currently available for purchase. Panasonic’s HIT goes way back, and REC’s Alpha product was released less than two years ago. But these products haven’t yet fulfilled the promises of our efficiency dreams.
Those efficiency dreams, without a doubt, lie deep within the minds of Fraunhofer’s and NREL’s researchers, as we can see from the aforementioned 68.9% solar cell which absorbs laser blasts, or the 47.1% six layer solar cell which is manufactured with surprisingly achievable technologies.
As our planet experiences record heat waves as a result of carbon emissions, killing our most vulnerable, it’s nice to have something to dream about.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/01/solar-101-how-to-goldilocks-your-solar-project-to-make-it-just-the-right-size/,"PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 1, 2021",Solar 101: How to ‘Goldilocks’ your solar project to make it just the right size,"If you’ve been following along with pv magazine USA’s Solar 101 series, you should have a strong handle on how to pick your panels, find a contractor, and determine how much electricity your home might generate.
All this technical knowledge is useful, but we’re  still left with a nagging question: Exactly how much solar power should I install?
The best answer is often the simple one. Review your bills and ask, “How much electricity do I actually use?” Your solar contractor will use this technique to establish a baseline “just right” size for your solar power project.
Matching your panel production to your household’s use might seem like a pretty obvious answer, since offsetting electricity usage is typically the goal of a residential solar system purchase.
But there are several good reasons to choose a larger system, or even a smaller one!
There are a couple of good reasons to choose a solar system that appears undersized in comparison to your estimated electricity usage.
The most obvious reason is that your roof may not be big enough for your solar array to fully cover a home’s electrical needs. If that’s the case, then the decision is already made and you can move on.
A second reason to go smaller is local net metering law.
Image: Sullivan Solar
In some places, full credit is given for daytime-generated, net-metered solar electricity. That means that all the electricity exported to the power grid on a sunny spring day is available for heating on a cold winter night. When the electrical grid works as a “virtual battery,” electricity requirements can often be met with fewer panels.
However, plenty of other places, like Utah, have very low net metering credits. In a situation where net metering credits are low, it can sometimes make economic sense to size your system small enough so that it is not exporting to the grid.
Economics, of course, does not rule everyone’s decision.
Another reason to build a smaller system is that a home might become much more energy efficient in the future. If your house needs more insulation, new windows, LED lights, smart thermostats, or other efficiency upgrades, then this author recommends completing those upgrades first.
The final reason is, of course, money. Solar can have some pretty high upfront costs. If the return on investment isn’t high enough, or if the larger cash outlay just doesn’t make sense, then going a bit smaller might be the best option.
On the other hand, there are times when you might want to intentionally build a solar system larger than your current electricity bill.
The most common reason is the expectation that household electricity demand will increase. This is most common among consumers who wish to buy an electric car, or switch from a fossil-powered HVAC system to more efficient electric heat pumps.
Roughly speaking, if the average electric car gets three miles per kilowatt-hour of electricity, and drives an average of 12,000 miles per year, that car will add about 4,000 kWh to an electricity bill. The exact number of solar panels needed to cover that additional use varies by region and roof angle.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s PVWatt’s solar generation calculator is among the best free tools to estimate your project’s yearly output before you commit.

Another common upgrade, a heat pump, varies depending on how much it is used and where you live. For instance, a recent Vermont heat pump study of well insulated northern homes estimates that cold-climate heat pumps use on average 2,085 kWh per year for heating and 146 kWh per year for cooling. Obviously, in places like Florida, Texas, and other hot southern climates, yearly cooling electricity usage is significantly greater.
Roughly speaking, in order to generate 2,000 kWh (for a heat pump) or 4,000 kWh (for an electric vehicle) in a year, you’ll need an additional 1,500W or 3,500W of solar panels, respectively.
Those of you in hot climates will be pleased to learn that installing solar panels on a roof adds an additional layer of insulation to your attic by preventing the sun’s rays from heating your roof in the first place, as well as absorbing 20% of the sunlight and turning it into electricity instead of allowing it heat your home.
These additional tools can reduce cooling loads and make it easier to meet your home’s electrical needs with fewer panels, or less expensive (and usually less efficient) panels.
In some places, like Massachusetts, you can apply excess electricity generation credits to someone else’s electricity bill if they’re in the same power grid “load zone” or even sell those credit in a “community solar” type model. This is often referred to as remote net metering.
These considerations  can make all the difference as you decide on how to size your rooftop solar array.

Georgia’s net metering program was instituted in December 2019, replacing an old system under which Georgia Power bought solar power from customers at a lower wholesale rate before selling conventional electric power to those customers at the higher retail rate.
Prior to the establishment of the net metering program Georgia was home to around 1,000 behind-the-meter solar systems, a clear sign of the effect that net metering has had on the state’s residential market in such a short time.
At the onset of the program, some renewable energy advocates, including Katie Chiles Ottenweller, southeast director at Vote Solar, expressed discontent over the size of the program. She correctly predicted the program would quickly reach capacity, which would trigger the expansion/revision that is expected to be discussed at today’s PSC meeting.
Earlier this year, Michigan reached its state net metering cap, which was set at 1% average peak load for the past five years for the state’s two utilities. Michigan utilities, DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, both said that they supported raising the net metering cap, but not removing it altogether.
Prior to that, legislation was introduced that would remove the cap altogether, a proposal that was not met eagerly by DTE and Consumers.

Novonix said this phase of growth will support the production of anode materials that can supply lithium-ion battery packs for over 100,000 EVs. 
The expansion plan will bring Novonix’s annual anode material production capacity to 10,000 tons annually by 2023. The company said it has major agreements underway with Sanyo Electric of Japan and Samsung of South Korea, both major international manufacturers of EVs and energy storage systems worldwide.  
The anode material division of the Novonix parent company called Puregraphite has already been operating in Chattanooga since 2019. Puregraphite said it is the only qualified producer in North America of high-grade anode materials suitable for lithium-ion batteries for both electric vehicles and energy storage systems. 
The Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development said the project will create nearly 300 jobs, and the project represents an investment of approximately $160 million in the county.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/01/heres-why-regulators-rejected-duke-energys-irps-in-south-carolina/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,COST AND PRICES,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 1, 2021",Here’s why regulators rejected Duke Energy’s IRPs in South Carolina,"South Carolina regulators offered details on their decision to reject integrated resource plans (IRP) proposed by Duke Energy and direct the utility to modify its existing and future IRPs.
The IRP included measures that would have impacted electricity retail rates, availability of solar-plus-storage power purchase agreements, coal plant retirement, and other energy events in the state.
Now, regulators have directed Duke to make changes to and update its cost assumptions for solar PPAs and storage and solar + storage projects; to modify its natural gas price forecast to reflect real-word supply risks; to reflect the capacity benefits that solar and storage can provide for both summer and winter peak demand based on actual system installation data; to increase the amount of solar than can be connected to the grid each year; and to properly model the cost impacts of the plan on ratepayers.
The South Carolina Public Service Commission’s (PSC) decision noted the impact of Kevin Lucas’ testimony on its decision, and included a number of his recommendations in the final order. Lucas is the Solar Energy Industry Association’s senior director of Utility Regulation & Policy. The weight that the PSC put on his testimony furthers the commitment that South Carolina regulators have made to upholding objectives laid out in the state’s 2019 Energy Freedom Act.
Integrated resource plan reform was one of the major changes made by the 2019 act. The law allows regulators to require all-source solicitations for new generation above 75 MW if they find it to be in the public interest. It also instituted transparency requirements for a utility’s avoided cost calculations, a factor that came into play in its recent decision rejecting the Duke Energy IRP.
In December, the PSC rejected Dominion Energy South Carolina’s proposed IRP, saying that it failed to include a demand-side management resource or power purchasing options. The Dominion IRP also did not model any renewable energy additions prior to 2026, or any coal retirements prior to 2028. It also would have raised solar customers’ basic service charge to $19.50 a month, added a “solar subscription fee” of $5.40/kW a month, and slashed the solar export credit that customers could receive.
In 2019, SEIA’s Director of Government Affairs Maggie Clark referred to non-transparent avoided cost calculations as “a major barrier to large-scale solar procurement” in South Carolina.
Utility Reform Director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy Maggie Shober said that the recent Duke Energy decision was “absolutely a result of the Energy Freedom Act” and regulators holding Duke to “what is called for in that law.”
She said that the rejections of IRPs from Duke Energy and also from Dominion don’t mean that the utilities are purposefully acting against consumer and climate interests. Rather, these were the first IRPs filed under the Energy Freedom Act, and reflect a learning process on the part of the utilities as they seek to understand what will or won’t fly with the commission and the new rules.
“Instead of working hard to be sure they complied with all the new rules, both Duke and Dominion have basically done what they would have absent the Energy Freedom Act and talked about how it complies (when it doesn’t),” said Shober.
Every IRP presented before the PSC since the passing of the Energy Freedom Act has been rejected, with the PSC advocating for ratepayers and the expansion of renewable energy procurement every time.

For example, Vote Solar, said in a statement that Duke Energy’s plans to build out “risky gas-fired power plants” would have violated their own climate commitments and “left ratepayers holding the bag.” Vote Solar said it applauded the South Carolina PSC for “putting the public interest first” by rejecting Duke’s plans and instructing them to develop new ones that put clean energy “on an even playing field.”
When the IRPs were first rejected, a representative for Duke told pv magazine that the utility was evaluating the PSC’s decision and that it would better understand the decision’s implications once the utility received the commission’s order.
“We appreciate there are diverse views on transitioning to a lower carbon future, and we actively engaged stakeholders across South Carolina and North Carolina to solicit input from them to inform the planning process,” the representative told pv magazine.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/01/sunrise-brief-is-the-solar-sector-as-healthy-as-it-seems/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 1, 2021",Sunrise brief: Is the solar sector as healthy as it seems?,"Energy analyst Gordon L. Johnson II offers up a different view of the U.S. solar market, arguing that data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration paints a less rosy picture than what the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie reported in June.
(Read “Supply chain constraints are starting to hit the solar industry, SEIA says.”)
SEIA reported that U.S. solar installations were up 46% year over year during the first quarter of 2021. The U.S. Solar Market Insight Q2 2021 report said the U.S. sector installed just over 5 GW(dc) of solar capacity, a 46% increase over the first quarter of 2020 and the largest first quarter on record.
Johnson, who is CEO of New York City-based GLJ Research, said in an email sent to media outlets that EIA data show that U.S. net-metering installations through April rose just 7.1% on a year-over-year basis. He also said that non-net-metering installations fell 20.4% through April compared to a year earlier, and that small-scale installations were down 3.8%.
“Most importantly,” he said, solar installations were down 0.02% year over year.
To reinforce his view, Johnson pointed to reports from inverter company SolarEdge that said its first quarter U.S. installations were down 38.1% year over year.
Johnson’s main takeaway was that “we see growing evidence” that solar residential demand in the U.S. “could disappoint” in the second quarter and possibly into the third quarter.
Claims that Chinese solar firms are benefiting from forced labor in Xinjiang are unfounded and unfairly stigmatize firms with operations there, the country’s solar association said in a statement quoted by the Reuters news agency.
The Biden administration on June 24 ordered a ban on U.S. imports from Chinese-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. over forced labor allegations. The U.S. Commerce Department separately restricted exports to Hoshine, three other Chinese companies and what it said is the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.
The news agency at the time quoted China’s foreign ministry spokesman as saying China would take “all necessary measures” to protect its companies’ rights and interests.
On July 1, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association said in a statement that it had recently inspected solar industry production facilities in Xinjiang and the U.S. assertions had no factual basis.
It also said the industry had created a large number of jobs, contributing to the region’s economic and social development and added that the rights of employees from all ethnic groups were fully respected.
Southwestern Electric Power Co., a unit of American Electric Power, issued three Requests for Proposals (RFP) for renewable and short-term generating capacity.
The RFPs solicit bids for the purchase of wind resources of up to 3,000 MW; solar resources up to 300 MW, and short-term accredited deliverable capacity up to 250 MW.
Wind resources must be a minimum of 100 MW, interconnect to the Southwest Power Pool and be located in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas or Missouri. Solar resources must be a minimum of 50 MW, interconnect to SWEPCO’s transmission system within SPP and be located in the SWEPCO service territory. Proposals for short-term capacity must be for a minimum of 50 MW from SPP resources.
Proposals are due by August 12. Response and contact information is available online at SWEPCO.com/2021RFPs.
If you can decipher the alphabet soup, then this news item is for you. Arizona-based utility APS is seeking proposals for products that aggregate distributed technologies to provide systemwide capacity resources from 5-40 megawatts and locational resources of 1-5 megawatts.
The RFP is open to all eligible distributed demand-side technologies, including both dispatchable and non-dispatchable resources, which can include products such as energy storage, smart thermostats, managed electric vehicle charging stations and connected water heater and pool pump controls. Proposed projects must begin service no earlier than June 1, 2022, and no later than June 1, 2024.
