https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/09/energy-efficiency-specialist-pivots-to-rooftop-solar-at-connecticut-nursing-home/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",Energy efficiency specialist expands into rooftop solar for Connecticut nursing home,"Budderfly, a commercial energy efficiency service provider, announced the deployment of a 317 kW rooftop solar array at nursing home Mystic Manor Healthcare, a Ryders Health Management property located in Mystic, Conn.
The rooftop solar deployments marks one of the first solar developments for Budderfly, an energy-as-a-service (EaaS) company that traditionally provides bundled energy efficiency solutions such as LED lighting and building improvements such as sensors.
The Mystic Manor solar array will deliver more than 3,400 MWh of energy savings and produce 3,500 MWh of onsite solar energy over the course of Ryders’ 10-year contract with Budderfly. The effect on carbon emissions reduction is the equivalent of taking 1,038 gasoline-powered cars off the roads for a year.
The addition of a rooftop solar system at the Mystic facility will drive further reductions in utility energy consumption and improve sustainability outcomes, enabling Ryders to offset 95% of the facility’s annual energy consumption with emissions-free power. The Mystic solar array is expected to be operational by June 2023.
A Budderfly spokesperson told pv magazine USA that the company has not always offered solar to its customers, but it is now developing behind the meter solar projects across its customer base wherever possible, in addition to reviewing off-site solar.  The Connecticut nursing home location is just one of the first active solar installations for the company, the spokesperson said. Budderfly is pursuing additional solar installations at Sonic Drive-In and Subway restaurant locations, where it is undergoing feasibility studies and site design.
Ryders Health first partnered with Budderfly in 2018 to install LED lighting and HVAC system upgrades at the Mystic center. Over the Covid-19 pandemic, the facility owner noted the “positive impact the bright LED lighting and high efficiency HVAC systems had on the mood and comfort of staff and patients.” This prompted the facility owner to explore energy efficiency solutions at the remainder of Ryders Health’s seven nursing home facilities, starting with the Lord Chamberlain and Cheshire House facilities in Stratford and Waterbury, Conn.
“We’re in the business of keeping people healthy, and that extends to being better stewards of the environment,” said Martin Sbriglio, chief executive officer of Ryder’s Health Management. “Partnering with Budderfly allows us to conserve capital expenditures and operating costs so that more funds can be invested in providing the best level of care for our patients.”
Like many energy efficiency solutions providers, Budderfly installs efficiency products at no upfront cost to the customer, allowing Budderfly to be paid back under an EaaS subscription model over a multiple-year contractual term.
“Ryders Health is one of our longest-standing customers and serves as a premier example of the sustainability, cost, and patient experience benefits that outsourced energy management can offer small- to medium-sized businesses,” said Al Subbloie, chief executive officer of Budderfly.
Founded in 2007 and based in Shelton, Conn., Budderfly was acquired in July 2022 by Partners Group in a $500 million majority acquisition transaction. As of December 31, 2022, the company managed 3,000 customer sites across 49 states and is branching out from its core franchise markets into retail, healthcare, fitness, and commercial real estate investment trusts (REITs).
In June 2022, the Connecticut Green Bank provided a $5 million loan to the company to support market expansion. During the year the company has brought on nearly 900 new locations, expanding brand partnerships with Burger King, Wendy’s, McDonald’s, KFC, Subway, Jersey Mike’s, Jack-in-the-Box, O’Charley’s, 99 Restaurants and YMCA, among others.
According to a January Wall Street Journal article, private equity deals have grown in the energy efficiency market over the last few years with private capital investors attracted to the steady rate of return profile from the clean energy service providers.  Private equity firms invested $31.8 billion globally across 280 deals in the energy efficiency market for the year through November 2022, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, with companies like Budderfly, Calibrant Energy and Metrus Energy seeing new equity owners.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/09/snapnrack-introduces-solar-mount-that-attaches-to-module-before-roof/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,RACKING,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",SnapNrack introduces solar mount that attaches to module before roof,"Solar racking and mounting supplier SnapNrack announced an innovative new solar panel mount called TopSpeed, which is designed to be attached to the panel on the ground before being hoisted to the rooftop for installation.
The new product is aimed at reducing installation times and limiting time spent on the rooftop. SnapNrack said duration of time spent on the rooftop can be cut by over 50% when compared to traditional racking solutions. This is a boon to the safety of installation workers.
The mounts are attached to the roof, leveled and aligned on SnapNrack’s universal skirt. The process helps simplify materials staging and racking assembly.
The installation process involves three steps. First, TopSpeed mounts are attached to the solar modules. Next, wire management is performed, with Smart Clips and module level power electronics (MLPE) frame kits set in place. These first two steps are performed on the ground, while the universal skirt is laid out on the roof. Finally, the modules are quickly affixed to the skirt.
The product is UL certified and is rated to perform under 90 mph to 180 mph wind loads and up to 90 pounds per square foot of snow load.
All mounts are secured with a proprietary half-inch head wood screw and roof sealant. The design allows for single-tool installation. The mounting system includes new features like retained fasteners and deck mounts.
The product is made of alloy aluminum and 300 series stainless steel. It is finished on the top with a black oxide bolt and bonding clip and a black anodized clamp, while the bottom has a mill finish. It is approved for installations between zero-degree and 90-degree roof pitches.
The product will be displayed at Intersolar North America 2023 in Long Beach, California from Feb. 14-16, 2023 at the SnapNrack booth #1461.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/09/watch-west-texas-community-comes-together-for-solar-project/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",Watch: West Texas community comes together for solar project,"Texas is the nation’s leader in energy production, though its profile is rapidly switching from one dominated by oil and gas to one characterized by solar and wind. As the energy transition takes place, new jobs and revenues are being brought to West Texas, where drier climates and wide-open spaces make it an ideal fit for solar. 
This is evidenced by the Galloway 2 solar project in Concho County, a project that is creating over 250 peak construction jobs and more than $18 million in local property tax revenues. Avantus (formerly 8minute) is developing the project, which recently commenced construction.
“Today, solar is not only one of the lowest cost forms of electricity generation, but also one of the fastest growing workforces in America. Here in Texas, we are creating lifelong careers in clean energy that can sustain generations to come,” said Tom Buttgenbach, founder and chief executive officer of Avantus. 
Once completed, the project will add 147 MW of capacity to the Texas energy grid, generating enough low-cost clean electricity to provide power for the equivalent of 60,000 Texans, said Avantus.
Most of the project’s energy production is committed to BASF Corporation via a power purchase agreement. The Galloway 2 project is owned by Allianz Capital Partners, with Avantus maintaining a minority stake in the project. RES is performing the engineering, procurement, and construction services. 


An impressive 36 GW buildout is expected by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) over the next five years, building on the 16 GW that is active to date in the Lone Star State. 
(Read: “Utility-scale updates on Texas 36 GW solar path”) 
Much of this investment in solar, which nears $20 billion, is going towards big solar farms, often exceeding 100 MW in capacity.  Over 10,000 Texans are employed by the solar industry, and those jobs numbers will sharply rise as more utility-scale projects are built. Today, nearly 5% of Texas electricity is generated by solar. 
“Galloway 2 has been such a great addition to our local economy here in Paint Rock,” said Paint Rock Mayor Francis Maupin. “Our town is busier than ever, and the tax revenue will help create real benefits for our school and community for years to come.”

Global development has always relied on exploiting natural resources. Coal, oil, and gas not only fueled hundreds of years of industry but formed many of the building blocks of modern society. During the past year, however, the world has once again been reminded of the inherent geopolitical and economic instability in an energy system based on fossil fuels. But as a result the transformation in the global energy landscape has significantly accelerated.
Policymakers are rapidly updating and adapting their energy strategies in light of the present challenges. Global ambitions for solar and wind power deployment, alongside grid-scale energy storage, are rising as countries look to lock in their long-term energy security and restrain record high energy prices, all while achieving critical decarbonization goals.
To achieve net zero, the world must deploy renewables and energy storage faster and at greater scale than has ever been seen before. This cannot be a case of advancement at any cost, however. The global energy transition presents us with a vital opportunity to reshape our societies in a more just way.
Energy for all
A just transition seeks to offer the benefits of clean energy to all, with no one left behind. A low-carbon energy system, underpinned by renewables generation and grid-scale batteries – and supported by appropriate policy and investment decisions – will lead to lower long term energy prices, cleaner air, and a huge reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Done right, this new energy system will create tremendous economic growth and employment opportunities, with those benefits accessible to individuals whose livelihood it threatens, such as workers in the fossil fuel industry, and to communities which disproportionately bear the brunt of the climate crisis.
Invinity recently delivered a vanadium flow battery to a fire station run by the Soboba Band, or tribe, of Luiseño Native Americans in Southern California.

The battery will be coupled with solar panels, and will store excess energy produced at times of low demand to release it when the power is most valuable. The system will also provide back-up when power outages caused by wildfires hamper the ability to provide emergency services to the local community.
Beyond lithium
Energy storage systems are the key to enabling a fully renewables-powered future. By offering a solution to the inherent intermittency of wind and solar power generation, energy storage delivers low-cost, low-carbon energy on-demand for families, businesses, and grid operators around the world.
Lithium-ion batteries have dominated the market to date. Designed primarily to correct occasional deviations in network frequency and fill short-term supply gaps, the technology has done an excellent job, so far, of proving the value batteries can provide as part of our electricity system.
Yet lithium batteries have inherent challenges when used in this manner, limiting the role they can play in a just transition. Currently only 5% recyclable, lithium-ion batteries are expected to generate two million metric tons of waste by 2030. There are also a host of issues surrounding the lithium-ion supply chain, including the use of “conflict minerals” such as cobalt.
To shift to a more sustainable economy that incorporates just transition principles we must look beyond lithium as a “one-size-fits-all” option, and look to a more diverse group of battery technologies to store and deliver clean power on demand.
All of the above
Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) are already established as a leading alternative to lithium-ion devices for stationary energy storage projects. A type of long duration energy storage (LDES) capable of providing from two to more than 10 hours of energy on demand, VFBs are gaining significant attention for their unparalleled ability to store and deliver power on an industrial scale. VFBs do this using vanadium, a metal produced around the world and used primarily to harden steel.
Unlike lithium-ion batteries, VFBs are highly recyclable and do not degrade with use, lasting 25 years or more even with heavy daily use. Vanadium is readily available and can be either mined or recovered from industrial waste. VFBs are also a safe choice as they are fundamentally non-flammable.
Invinity has already deployed VFBs at more than 50 sites across the world, and the installed capacity of its batteries is set to more than double this year in response to growing demand for the technology as its capabilities are proven over and over again in global renewable power and standalone battery projects.
Let’s act now
The increasing global deployment of renewables and energy storage technology, supported by significant policy intervention and investment in the UK, EU, North America, and Australia in recent years, is certainly cause for celebration. But we must keep just transition principles at the front of our mind as we drive towards a low-carbon future.
By broadening policy – both globally and at a national level – which supports the deployment of a diverse set of cost effective and sustainable energy storage solutions, we can avoid a path to a dependency which, left unchecked, could massively curtail the long-term benefits of the sustainable energy transition and threaten the ultimate goal of reaching net-zero with no one left behind.

The IRA boosted investment in wind, solar, energy storage and the EV markets, including domestic manufacturing of battery components and solar modules. The Climate Power report indicates that its momentum has spurred clean energy companies to hire electricians, mechanics, construction workers, technicians, support staff and other roles across 31 U.S. states,
As of January 31, 2023, Climate Power says there are more than 90 new clean energy manufacturing projects in rural towns and large cities, representing an aggregate of $89.5 billion of new investments into the renewable energy market.
To boost the sourcing of domestic battery manufacturing, there have been 40 new battery manufacturing sites announced in places such as Tucson, Ariz., Van Buren Township, Mich., and Florence County, South Carolina.
The EV market meanwhile is expanding vehicle and battery integration manufacturing capacity, with new facilities located in Pryor, Okla., Montgomery, Ala., and Highland Park, Mich.
Further upstream, about 24 companies shared plans to expand solar and wind project equipment manufacturing in seven states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Driven partly by certainty created by the IRA and its incentives to build a domestic clean energy future, American companies restored closed to 350,000 manufacturing jobs in 2022, marking a 25% increase from 2021, a fact cited by President Joseph Biden on his “State of the Union” address earlier this week.
A recent analysis by the BlueGreen Alliance and the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst projects that the IRA will create more than 9 million new clean energy and climate-related jobs over the next decade.

Here are a few highlights from Climate Power with statewide initiatives:
Arizona
Meyer Burger previously put plans for a 400 MW solar factory on hold when the Build Back Better Act collapsed in Congress, but has since relaunched the project thanks to the IRA’s passing. LG Electronics and KORE Power also have construction efforts under way in Arizona, which to date has announced seven projects emanating from IRA incentives. According to the report, $4.15 billion in new renewable energy projects and 11.6k jobs have trickled into the state since passage of the IRA.
Georgia
Freyr Battery announced plans to put a new battery Gigafactory in Coweta County, Georgia, while QCells and Hyundai Motor Group revealed plans to invest $2.5 billion and $9 billion respectively into a new solar module facility and EV battery plant in the southern state. In total, a whopping $15.3 billion in new investments and 16.6k jobs have been announced for the Peach State.
Michigan
The IRA is helping the historic capital of the automotive industry see a green future, with companies revealing $7.2 billion in new investment in the Great Lakes state and 9.6k new jobs in the six months since the IRA passed alone. Another 167,000 clean energy jobs are projected in Michigan for the next decade.  Flo, an EV charging company, launched its first U.S. manufacturing facility to date in Auburn Hills, Mich. and plans to deploy 250k chargers across the U.S. while creating 133 jobs this year.
Nevada
Since the IRA passed, Tesla is resuming construction on its $3.5 billion Gigafactory in Nevada, with production capacity of 105 GWh of EV battery cells and 150 GWh of energy storage batteries. With $3.8 billion of new investments in the state and 3.4k jobs announced in the six months since the IRA passed, the desert state has achieved its goal of becoming the “Silicon Valley of Lithium.”  An additional 40k clean energy jobs are forecast over the next decade.
North Carolina
Besides being fertile ground for utility and DG solar development, several new technology plays invested about $4.2 billion into North Carolina’s clean energy future recently. Toyota Motor revealed plans to expand an EV battery facility in Liberty, N.C. with a new $2.5 billion investment, bringing its total investment into its Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina facility to $5.6 billion. The facility will produce batteries for hybrid electric vehicles and EVs, and employ 2.1k manufacturing and assembly workers.
Tennessee
A staggering $10.9 billion of new investment and 11.75k clean energy jobs have been pumped into Tennessee, with a particular focus on advanced battery manufacturing and EV charging. Numerous companies like Piedmont Lithium ($600 million), Novonix Anode Materials ($1 billion), LG Chem ($3.2 billion), Ford Motors ($5.6 billion) and Tritium revealed plans to open facilities around the state since the IRA passed.
Texas
The adage “everything is bigger in Texas” still applies to incentives stemming from the IRA. The state ranks sixth in Climate Power’s list of top funded states, with $5.14 billion of new clean energy investments, and 2.6k of new jobs. While the state stands close to overtaking California for energy storage project development, the passage of the IRA has prompted numerous manufacturing investments in the Lonestar State as well. Tesla ($770 million), SK Signet, Air Products and AES ($4 billion) are among the companies that announced EV facilities as well as green hydrogen production.  In solar, GAF Energy is building a $100 million solar shingle factory, while SEG Solar, Mission Solar and OCI made similar announcements for production facilities.

Ampliform was formed in 2022 when Pennsylvania-based Prospect14 formed a joint venture with with a group of  energy investors and operators with expertise in power generation and quantitative trading. The company is backed by investors which include the Jones Family Office, Barings, the George Kaiser Family Foundation, and others.
The company is installing the Nevados platform across its entire U.S. tracker portfolio, across a near-term project pipeline of 700 MW construction taking place between 2023 and 2025 and a long-term development pipeline of 2 GW.
“We selected Nevados because their all-terrain solar tracker eliminates the need for costly, risky and destructive mass grading for every site in our portfolio – and their team is a pleasure to work with,” said Robert Stoever, senior vice president, EPC of Ampliform. “Partnering with Nevados will make our solar investments more profitable while preserving the natural vegetation and topography of the land.”
Nevados will initially supply 48 MW of all-terrain trackers for two Ampliform projects currently under construction in Pennsylvania. Nevados will provide performance optimization with their TRACE software and full-service project management, design optimization, and engineering support for all Ampliform projects regardless of size, which the company says is standard for all of its agreements.  
“We are thrilled to support Ampliform because our product is a perfect match for their hilly portfolio,” said Yezin Taha, chief executive officer of Nevados. “Yet the benefits of Nevados’ technology and partner-centric business model go beyond the challenges of uneven terrain. Our integrated solar tracking platform will create new project opportunities for Ampliform by reducing their civil engineering and construction costs and improving system performance one row at a time.” 
Nevados says its solar tracking platform is engineered to eliminate site grading in projects with uneven terrain, thus avoiding time and cost-intensive permitting, construction, and revegetation steps, and dramatically accelerates project schedules. The proprietary design sets Nevados trackers apart from its competitors, with bearings that the company says allow for installation on slopes up to 37% with slope changes as great as 26% across a foundation.
Nevados reports that row-specific tracking algorithms, controls and tilt schedules improve energy yield in projects at a granular level. Gaps in bearings also improve bifacial gains, the company claims.
Other unique design aspects include non-continuous torque tubes, shorter pilings and large tolerances, all of which simplify and speed up the installation, according to Nevados. Top-clamp clips also reportedly help solar modules to align during installation, and accommodate different module sizes. The torque tube and damper designs improve wind performance and, as Jenya Meydbray, chief commercial officer at Nevados told pv magazine USA,  have proven to withstand hurricane-force winds with zero structural damage.
Nevados is headquartered in San Francisco and backed by institutional capital. In this op-ed published in 2019, Yezin Taha describes all-terrain tracking and explains how it is a potentially superior solution for sites with sloped terrain.
Nevados will be exhibiting at Intersolar North America next week, Feb. 14-16, in Long Beach, Calif., where its team will be located at Booth#19.
