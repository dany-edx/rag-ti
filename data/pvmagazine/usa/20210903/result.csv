And smart chargers can even be integrated into a home’s solar and storage system to provide even greater control and flexibility over one’s own energy use.
As with any emerging technology, there are hiccups and issues in the early stages of rollout. However, with smart EV chargers, these shortcomings are more concerning than, say, a malfunctioning new video game console.
Pen Test Partners, a security consulting and testing company, recently spent 18 months investigating the security of some of the market’s leading smart charger offerings, and found troubling results. Of the six smart chargers they tested, nearly all of them included some level of security risk, from accessible user data, to the possibility of hijacking “millions” of smart chargers.
To better understand how these risks emerged, the scope of the issue at hand, and potential remedies to the risks, pv magazine spoke with Baksheesh Singh Ghuman, senior director of product and GTM strategy at Finite State, a cybersecurity company focused on Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices.
IoT refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that are used for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet, like smart chargers, smart thermostats and smartphones.
“It’s a connected device, so its functions are all software defined. The software controls a majority of the functions,” explained Ghuman. “[They can define] who the users are, who can charge and cannot charge, when they can charge, or how much they can charge.”
Ghuman continued to explain that while the devices are connected, they also allow remote access. Functionally, this allows owners to access the charger’s app from a distance, so they can look at state of charge on your automobile, etc. That means the devices are also connected to a user’s home network. If one gets access to a smart charger, that means they can indirectly get access to a user’s home network.
The user is then compromised and potentially open to cyber attacks, as well as ransomware attacks, which shutdown a device until a ransom is paid.
According to Ghuman, the associated vulnerabilities come down to three critical categories.
The specific consequences of these vulnerabilities differ between public-use EV chargers and private chargers in a user’s home. For public chargers, the main concern is theft of electricity.

“If somebody’s got access to it, then they can then we can use the same account to charge multiple devices or vehicles,” said Ghuman.
Individuals could also remotely turn on and off as many chargers as they have access to, whenever they want, for however long they want, which could have an indirect impact on the power grid.
“It’s like a cyber attack, so to speak. There’s a whole range of things you can do you can ever have more access to that. You can actually control the device itself.”
For homes, the risk is more on network control and user data extraction. Individuals could also send bad information to the billing system, charging users for more electricity than they consume, as well as gain access to any and all user data stored within the device and its associated software and apps.
“If you’ve got access to a device, you can actually control the device and, from that device, then, if it’s connected to the internet, you essentially have an impact on other devices within the home,” said Ghuman.
Despite the grim potential of cyber attacks, Ghuman said that the situation is by no means a lost cause, and that remedies would not require significant labor or overhaul, at least not yet.
“There is already work underway, and these vulnerabilities only serve to highlight that there is a strong need for for security,” said Ghuman.
He outlined that most of the known concerns could be patched with firmware. Ghuman said the charger installer must then ensure the firmware is secure, has been tested before deployment, and is updated or patched post-deployment, in case any further vulnerabilities are discovered.
“I think the device manufacturers are working very hard to make sure that the products are secure,” he said. “But as you know, cyber security or security in general is so complex. Sometimes you don’t know from where a vulnerability or a threat factor is going to come from.”
This was a conclusion that Pen Test Partners also came to. After their study, the company said they flagged the manufacturers with their findings, and a number of them resolved the issue within 24 hours.
“I think that more and more companies are realizing the key to a competitive advantage is product security,” explained Ghuman. “So the more secure your product is, the more competitive advantage you have, because nobody wants to do recalls. And so and nobody wants a reputational loss.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/03/study-urges-18-gw-of-solar-in-the-carolinas-by-2030/,"MARKETS,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 3, 2021",Study outlines how 18 GW of solar can be deployed in the Carolinas by 2030,"A low-cost generation mix for Duke Energy’s service territory in North Carolina and South Carolina would add 18 GW of solar by 2030, the Brattle Group found in a modeling study.
That’s more than triple the amount Duke Energy proposed in its “base case with carbon policy” scenario in its 2020 integrated resource plan.
The 18 GW of solar would include 9.5 GW of “economic solar additions” beyond those required under North Carolina’s House Bill 951.
Brattle’s modeling, which did not allow for new gas-fired generators, resulted in a generation mix with costs roughly equal to those of the Duke Energy base case until 2029. After that, annual cost savings rise to $590 million in 2030 and $1.2 billion in 2035.
The cost savings resulted from substituting solar, storage, and wind for Duke Energy’s proposed 3.8 GW of additional gas capacity, and through accelerated retirement of coal plants across Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.
Solar developer Cypress Creek Renewables funded the Brattle Group study and has an operating solar portfolio of 1.6 GW spanning 14 states.
The Brattle plan would also add 3.6 GW of battery storage, versus 0.6 GW in Duke Energy’s plan, and 3 GW of onshore wind power, versus none in Duke Energy’s plan.
Brattle’s approach would reduce Duke Energy greenhouse gas emissions by 74% relative to 2005, versus a 57% reduction in the Duke Energy base case. The Brattle plan also would yield substantial reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, which are byproducts of burning coal.
Brattle Group analyzed the combined Duke Energy system using the firm’s internal capacity expansion model gridSIM, and ensured that the model run achieved reserve requirements.
Capital costs for generation and storage were based on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s 2020 Annual Technology Baseline aggressive case, with regional adjustments from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and cost data specific to North Carolina where available.
Federal tax credits for renewables and storage were assumed to be extended at full value through Jan. 1, 2027, and then reduced by 20% per year. Standalone storage was assumed to be eligible for the federal investment tax credit. No carbon price was modeled.
Brattle said the analysis did not account for any costs of transmission and distribution system upgrades caused by the shift in resources. Brattle estimated that up to $5.2 billion of additional transmission and distribution investments could be made and still result in cost savings through 2035.
Brattle added that the modeling did not consider “rising costs and declining performance” of solar or wind resources added in less ideal locations.
The Brattle Group’s press release provides a link to a webinar describing the study.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/03/trade-group-rejects-chinas-claims-in-cspv-import-dispute-with-the-u-s/,"BUSINESS,PROCUREMENT,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 3, 2021",Trade group rejects China’s claims in CSPV import dispute with the U.S.,"A World Trade Organization dispute panel rejected all four of China’s claims against the U.S. relating to safeguard measures that the Trump administration imposed on solar panels imported from Chinese manufacturers.
In reporting the news, the Bloomberg news agency said that China failed to establish that Washington’s safeguards against imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells were inconsistent with the WTO’s rules on the measures. The Geneva-based body issued its findings in a report.
Trump announced in early 2018 four years of import caps and tariffs on panels after a certain amount was imported. That was in response to a trade suit filed in April 2017 by a bankrupt U.S. solar manufacturer that claimed it had been harmed by low-cost imports, mostly from Asia. The U.S. International Trade Commission agreed in October that year, paving the way for Trump’s decision.
The dispute-settlement body will adopt the panel’s report within 60 days.

The WTO’s dispute-settlement body set up a panel to hear China’s case in August 2019. In it, Beijing alleged that Washington acted inconsistently with a number of articles in the organization’s general agreement on tariffs and trade.
Among China’s allegations that the WTO rejected was that the U.S. failed to establish the required causal link between the increased imports and the serious injury found to exist.
The dispute-settlement body will adopt the panel’s report within 60 days unless either the U.S. or China notifies it of a decision to appeal.
In August, Hanwha Q CELLS USA, Inc., LG Electronics USA, Inc., and Mission Solar Energy asked the International Trade Commission to extend import tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells.
The petition was made under Section 204(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 and Subpart F of part 206 of the rules of practice and procedure of the ITC. The companies said that they are representatives of the domestic industry producing CSPV cells and modules and, therefore, have standing to file the petition.
Days earlier, Auxin Solar and Suniva formally asked the ITC to extend solar tariffs for four more years.
In their separate 420-page filing on August 4, Hanwha Q CELLS USA, LG Electronics USA, and Mission Solar Energy said they had “not yet received the full benefit intended” by tariffs, which were put in place in 2018 and are set to expire in February 2022. The companies said they need more time to “complete their adjustment” to facilitate the domestic module production that they called “critical” to the Biden administration’s aim to make the energy sector carbon-free by 2035.
The remedy that the domestic industry received through the tariffs was “partially impaired” by what they said was import stockpiling before the tariffs took effect, the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, continued import underselling, and increased costs and tariffs on the inputs used to produce modules.
In an interview with pv magazine after the August filings, John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy for the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said the trade group remains opposed to tariffs. He cited numbers that SEIA presented to the ITC as part of its mid-term review of the tariffs, which showed around 2 GW less solar being developed than was forecast prior to the tariffs.
He said in the interview that claims that the tariffs would lead to the creation of 45,000 jobs were “wildly, comically off.” He pegged the actual number of new jobs created as a result of the tariffs at no more than 2,000 through expansion at “three modest facilities.”
Smirnow said that the tariffs hurt overall solar sector growth and are not an effective incentive to spur new manufacturing investment. He said that business investments rely on a five- to 10-year time horizon and not on a four-year window of opportunity.

The project consists of a 300 MWac solar project coupled with a 600 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). It is expected to begin electricity electricity to the Alliance’s customers in Los Angeles and Ventura counties in February 2024. The group’s Board of Directors approved the long-term contract during its September meeting.
The Desert Quartzite Solar+Storage Project is in Riverside County, California, on land administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The BLM designated this area as a Solar Energy Zone (SEZ) and Development Focus Area, land set aside for utility-scale renewable energy development. The project will use horizontal single-axis tracking solar PV technology. The module supplier was not named.
(Read “BLM plans rulemaking to encourage renewable energy on public lands.”)
Founded in 2017, Clean Power Alliance is the locally operated electricity provider for 30 cities in southern California. It ranks as the state’s fifth largest electricity provider.
In June, CPA directors approved four contracts for 256.5 MW of renewable energy and 163 MW of storage. The contracts included one geothermal facility and three solar plus storage facilities.
A 15-year contract with Clearway’s Arica solar plus storage project will add 93.5 MW of solar plus 71 MW of storage. CPA will begin receiving power in December 2023, with an expected average annual generation of 284,054 MWh.
The Clearway Daggett 2 solar plus storage project is an extension of a solar plus storage project already under contract with CPA. The 15-year Daggett 2 contract adds 65 MW of solar plus 52 MW of storage. CPA will begin receiving power in September 2023, with an expected average annual generation of 202,432 MWh.
A third contract is with NextEra Energy Resources’ Resurgence Solar I project, located in San Bernardino County, for a 20-year term. The project adds 48 MW of solar plus 40 MW of storage with an expected average annual generation of 144,161 MWh. The Resurgence Solar Project repurposes an aging solar thermal facility. The project is scheduled to begin operations in March 2023.
The fourth contract is with Calpine’s The Geysers geothermal facility, which will add 50 MW of energy and generate 438,000 MWh of energy per year. Under the 15-year contract, the project will begin delivering January 2022. Located north of San Francisco on the border of Sonoma and Lake counties, The Geysers ranks as one of the single largest geothermal electrical operations in the world.
