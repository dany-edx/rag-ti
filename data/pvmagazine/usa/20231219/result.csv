The Fort Bend County project is a 272 MWdc utility-scale project currently under construction about 40 miles southwest of Houston. Once completed, the project will participate in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) marketplace. 
The project is expected to reach commercial operations in April 2024. It is comprised of over 500,000 solar panels spanning over 1,000 acres of land. It is expected to produce enough electricity to power more than 80,000 Texas homes. The solar facility is expected to help mitigate energy supply security concerns, which have been an acute problem in the hot summer months in the growing Houston metro area. 
Advantage Capital’s tax equity investment leverages the federal Investment Tax Credit and will provide external capital necessary for Sabanci to complete construction of the project. 
“We are happy to partner up with Advantage Capital in our first renewable energy project in the U.S. and proud to demonstrate our execution capabilities in such a competitive market under such a challenging environment,” said Ismail Bilgin, chief executive officer, Sabanci Renewables. 
Allen & Overy and Husch Blackwell served as counsel for Advantage Capital on the transaction, and Troutman Pepper and Duggins Wren Mann & Romero served as counsel for Sabanci Renewables. Carbon Reduction Capital (CRC), formerly known as CohnReznick Capital, also served as Sabanci’s financial advisor. 
Advantage Capital works with renewable energy developers, providing tax-advantaged financing for projects across the U.S. In recent years, the company has invested in over 100 non-residential projects, including commercial and industrial, community solar, and utility-scale projects, in addition to more than 10,000 residential rooftop systems throughout the U.S. and its territories. 
Sabanci Renewables is a subsidiary of Sabanci Holding, a Turkish conglomerate founded in 1967. Sabanci has a 4 GW diversified power generation portfolio in Turkey. Its U.S.-focused Renewables arm targets 1 GW of renewables in its portfolio by the end of 2025. With Cutlass II and its second utility-scale solar project investment, Oriana Solar, Sabanci Renewables owns 500 MW of capacity under construction.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/19/u-s-house-energy-committee-expresses-outrage-over-solar-sales-tactics/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",U.S. House Energy Committee expresses outrage over solar sales tactics,"The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Republican members sent a joint letter to the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office (LPO), on December 7, 2023. They expressed “outrage” over a reported incident of an elderly man allegedly being pressured into a 25-year solar lease by a salesperson. The joint letter is being used to highlight the aggressive or potentially misleading sales tactics that are sometimes employed by contractors of national residential solar companies.
This incident reflects a complex situation. Republicans in Congress are seeking to undermine the transition to local, clean electricity by signaling “outrage”, meanwhile, solar sales companies are grappling with the challenges posed by commission-motivated private contractors, whose sales tactics strain the industry’s reputation.
Residential solar companies have had lawsuits initiated by state attorneys general in Arizona, New Mexico, and Connecticut, largely due to aggressive sales tactics. These same in-home sales techniques prompted California to mandate a comprehensive 24-page Solar Consumer Protection Guide in 2021.
The Joint Letter, addressed to the LPO’s department head, Jigar Shah, specifically addresses Sunnova’s recently awarded $3 billion loan guarantee. This significant loan from the LPO is earmarked to finance up to 90% of “Project Hestia.” The project’s aim is to broaden access to solar and virtual power plant (VPP) services, particularly for disadvantaged communities that typically struggle to secure financing for residential projects.
Sunnova stands out in the industry for integrating individual residential solar and storage installations into the broader power grid. Despite the initial rejection of their Califlornia microutility, its innovative approach is recognized as cutting edge, and will set precedent for future energy deployments.
The joint letter details allegations of unethical sales practices of a Sunnova contractor. It describes an instance of alleged exploitation: “a door-to-door Sunnova salesman sold her father—who she characterized as in hospice care—a $60,000 solar system for his mobile home shortly before his death.” It also references complaints from a 2019 USA Today article regarding Sunnova’s expanding market in Puerto Rico.
The Committee requests all documents related to Sunnova’s loan approval, previous sales complaints, consumer protection measures, and the company’s financial status. They also inquire about LPO’s oversight of Sunnova’s sales practices.
By the end of the third quarter of 2023, Sunnova had amassed approximately 386,000 customers, adding 37,000 customers in the third quarter alone. The company anticipates that they will have added 135,000 to 145,000 new customers in 2023.
In response to the Committee, Sunnova outlined their position in a letter to investors on December 11, 2023, reaffirming their “commitment to Project Hestia, ethical business practices, and customer service.” The letter cited Sunnova’s role as the primary risk-bearer in the $3 billion loan, its expanded service team, the offering of 25-year warranties, and the operation of a “state-of-the-art Global Command Center” to oversee its numerous solar projects.  
The company specifically mentioned the expansion of its support services in Puerto Rico, where the Global Command Center plays a crucial role, reflecting the island’s growing importance in their business strategy.
Regarding the LPO’s reaction, while no official statement has been released, Jigar Shah of the LPO expressed support for Project Hestia and Sunnova in general via a tweet:
LPO firmly stands behind Project Hestia, which will expand solar access to up to 115k US homes. We held @SunnovaEnergy to the highest standards in our due diligence, which they’ve met with enthusiasm since day 1, while implementing new customer service programs.
— Jigar Shah (@JigarShahDC) December 12, 2023

pv magazine USA reached out to Kelsey Hultberg, Sunnova’s executive vice president of communications and sustainability, with several queries about the company’s handling of customer support challenges over the past year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/19/pv-magazine-awards-2023-the-winners/,"SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",pv magazine Awards 2023: The winners,"Eight pv magazine Awards 2023 winners have been chosen, in a year that was characterized by innovation at all levels, from module manufacture to project development.
Despite falling module prices and high inventory levels in 2023, the industry has not focused solely on reducing costs and curbing losses. Instead, a resolute pursuit of high performance continued as solar and storage businesses used technical innovation to stand out from the competition. Technological ambition was evident across the board, including among entries for the new Projects category. Fifty-nine innovative solar and storage projects were entered and choosing a winner was no easy task.
A total of 19 independent expert jurors deliberated over this year’s entries, bringing a wealth of experience and expertise to the process. The pv magazine editorial team would like to thank each of them for kindly devoting time to the selection process.
Commenting on 2023’s entrants, pv magazine editor-in-chief Jonathan Gifford said the innovations on display represented true solutions to the major challenges facing the solar and storage industries. “Solar and energy storage companies continue to demonstrate genuinely extraordinary levels of innovation and roll out new products and services that meet the main challenges of cost, performance, and flexibility. The ever-expanding number of entrants to the eight award categories also speaks to the breadth and scale of the creativity and technical prowess inherent to our industries.”
And the winners are…
700 W-plus power output is a notable achievement in any solar module, but the 2023 Modules winner packs a heap of innovation inside to set it apart. Alongside its heterojunction (HJT) cell, Hyper-ion deploys Risen’s own patented version of busbarless (0BB) cell interconnection – branded Hyper-link, cell thickness at an industry-leading 90 to 100 micrometers, and the option of a steel frame to make a module that truly stands out.
The efficiency and power results are also notable. The module datasheet confirms the Hyper-ion comes with a power range of 680-705 W, in dimensions of 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm, at a weight of 41 kg. Inside are 210 mm half-cut HJT cells.
Beyond performance, Risen has beefed up its warranty, putting it ahead of TOPCon rivals. It offers a 15-year product warranty and 30-year power warranty, guaranteeing 90.3% of nominal power output.

German company Solar Cooling Engineering (SCE) has taken an innovative approach to refrigeration with its PV Cool Kenya project. SCE has developed solar-powered cooling technology that is based on a sustainable refrigerant (R600a) and insulation materials.
Unlike cold rooms that rely on traditional grid-tied cooling methods, the SelfChill system uses modular thermal storage to balance cooling peaks. Water is chilled and frozen, and stored in a water chiller that provides cold water to a fan coil inside the cold room. In this way, energy fluctuations can be balanced by energy stored in the form of ice.
Battery storage can be added if required, but it is not a necessary component of the system. The cooling unit itself was designed in-house, with SCE opting to create a DC unit that is powered by PV modules.
This year’s winner is Deye Technologies SUN-29.9-50K-SG01HP3 – a hybrid inverter for the C&I market. It is available in power classes from 29 kW to 50 kW and is well-suited to retrofitting. The inverter’s 400 AC output fits with older installations, making it a good candidate for revamping PV plants.
Category juror Cormac Gilligan, director clean energy technology at S&P Global, said there is a growing market for revamping and retrofitting solar systems in Europe with the addition of battery systems to increase self-consumption. He saw the flexibility of the Deye inverter as a noteworthy feature. For example, it can be cascaded into a 500 kW application and work entirely off-grid. The option to connect a diesel genset and charge the batteries that way means this inverter could meet demand in regions where weak grids are prevalent.
Origami Solar is rolling out production of its patent-pending steel frame design with contract manufacturers in the United States. Frames are expected to be available from the end of 2023.
Frames are manufactured using recycled steel in a continuous process that Origami Solar says is 10 times faster than aluminum frame making, producing one frame every 15 seconds. It also claims frames have demonstrated increased stiffness in testing, making modules better equipped for heavy loading from snow or wind. Further testing is underway with partners including the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
On price, the company expects to be able to sell frames at least 5% lower than aluminum competitors. There is a sustainability case to be made, too. Origami Solar has worked with consultants Boundless Impact to demonstrate a significantly lower carbon footprint per module.
Multinational steel producer ArcelorMittal claims its XCarb steel is both long lasting and sustainable. XCarb is a certified low-carbon material and the company reports that it is made from predominantly scrap steel, with production carried out via an electrical arc furnace that uses 100% renewable energy.
The steel producer’s Magnelis steel also boasts sustainability credentials. It is long-lived, making it suitable for solar installations in challenging environments. Magnelis steel is a double-sided hot-dip galvanized carbon steel, coated on both sides with a zinc-alumium magnesium alloy.  “Anything you can do to make a solar asset last longer is a positive climate impact,” said juror Jenny Chase, solar analyst at BloombergNEF.
ArcelorMittal has a target of achieving a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity per ton of crude steel by 2030.
The U.S. storage specialist Fluence has developed a storage-as-transmission asset (SATA) that can help network owners and operators to manage renewables curtailment, increase the use of power lines, and limit congestion. UltrastackTM, provides network owners and operators with fast-acting response of less than 150 milliseconds and with higher than 99% system uptime to meet the availability requirements of critical infrastructure. Its advanced control applications, some with pending patents, include synthetic inertia, power oscillation damping control, grid-forming inertia, dynamic voltage control, emergency power contribution, and black start.
Unlike “regular” big batteries, SATA projects are operated to mimic transmission line flows by injecting and absorbing power. In such applications, they can be used to bolster or even replace existing power lines, offering infrastructure planners a new, versatile solution for transmission transition.
US-based Atonometrics is targeting utility-scale solar projects with its monitoring innovation, the RDE300i. The system performs in-situ measurement of current/voltage (IV) curves within a string of modules. This allows technicians to get a direct view of the performance of individual modules within an array, and eliminates costs associated with installing and maintaining reference modules at a site.
The manufacturer is keen to point out that in-situ IV curve measurement could be useful on many fronts in plant monitoring, and that it is working with laboratories and industrial partners to develop new applications for the technology.
For now, the use case for RDE300i is focused on monitoring soiling. Here the system promises more accurate results than the common approaches of reference modules or optical sensors – and it can also integrate with these systems so monitoring teams have all bases covered.
It’s high time that we recognize leading module manufacturers in this category and this is no easy task. There is a wealth of module makers with strong track records and impressive product portfolios.
In 2023, the nod goes to JinkoSolar, which has shipped more PV modules than any other manufacturer. In November 2023 JinkoSolar hit the historic mark of 200 GW modules shipped since it delivered its first panels in 2010. The manufacturer has quickly transitioned to n-type TOPCon and the higher efficiencies it offers. In October 2023 the company announced a new n-type TOPCon cell efficiency record of 26.89% for a 182 mm cell.
But JinkoSolar is much more than just a module producer. It has expanded its product portfolio to include battery energy storage systems (BESS) to offer its customers around the world a complete solution involving both state-of-the-art modules and the latest BESS technology.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/19/california-is-home-to-roughly-37-of-u-s-electric-vehicles/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",California is home to roughly 37% of U.S. electric vehicles,"Data reported from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that California holds a dominant market share in the sales of electric vehicles (EV) in the United States, though other states are beginning to catch up in sales. 
In 2016, California represented 48% of all U.S. EV sales, but in 2022 it represented 37% of the nation’s EV market. Meanwhile, in 2016, about 27% of electric vehicle charging locations were located in California, and that figure has remained relatively flat. 
The vehicle stock data includes all registered on-road, light-duty vehicles and excludes any past vehicle sales that are no longer on the road. The EV charging location data includes both private and public access stations for Legacy, Level 1, Level 2, and DC Fast charging ports. 
In 2022, the number of EVs on the road was six times greater than in 2016, increasing from 511,600 to 3.1 million in a few years. Charging locations nearly tripled from about 19,000 to over 55,000 during the same timespan. California quadrupled its EV total from 247,000 and 1.1 million over the span. 
Despite slipping in total market share, California has about six times as many EVs on the road as the second place state of Florida. 
California’s charging locations have been boosted in part by the California Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Project (CALeVIP) that provides funding for installing publicly available EV charging stations. 
EIA said growth in EVs has outpaced EV charging locations in the United States. In 2016 there was an average of 27 EVs per charging location, and by 2022 there were 55 EVs per charging location. New Jersey has the highest imbalance, with 100 EVs per charging location statewide.
The growing mismatch between chargers and EVs may represent a market opportunity for public charging development, though many EV owners opt to charge at home, which can be especially cost effective when paired with rooftop solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/19/trends-in-u-s-grid-scale-energy-storage/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",Trends in U.S. grid-scale energy storage,"Grid scale energy storage is on the upswing in the U.S., driven in part by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Energy storage was a topic discussed in a panel session at the pv magazine Roundtables US held in October, where George Hershman, chief executive officer of SOLV Energy, noted that the IRA inclusion of an investment tax credit for standalone energy storage projects is a first for storage.
According to the recent Wood Mackenzie and American Clean Power Association (ACP) Energy Storage Monitor Report, in Q3 grid scale increased deployment by 37% quarter on quarter for 2.2 GW/6.8 GWh. This boost led to a record-breaking quarter for both MW and MWh installed.
“Energy storage deployment is growing dramatically, proving that it will be essential to our future energy mix,” said Frank Macchiarola, ACP chief policy officer. “This industry will serve as the backbone of our modern grid. As we continue to build a strong domestic supply chain, streamlined permitting and evolving market rules can further accelerate the deployment of storage resources.”
In addition to the credit offered by the IRA, another driver is utility adoption. At the pv magazine Roundtables US, Vanessa Witte, senior research analyst, Wood Mackenzie,  said that energy storage projects are also being increasingly targeted by utilities in their integrated resource plans as a flexible tool with strong rates of return for revenues. Grid congestion is an increasingly difficult challenge for utilities, and energy storage often offers a much better rate of return than building more transmission lines in the area, she noted.
Grid scale challenges
As the energy storage market grows, so does its demand on the supply chain. One of the greatest challenges in the past year has been a shortage of transformers. Not only is the energy storage market competing against renewables for access to newly minted transformers, but it’s competing against the burgeoning electric vehicle market as well as the growing demands for data centers, Debrup Das, head of renewables, North America, at Hitachi Energy, told pv magazine USA.
In addition to growing demand, prices of transformers are rising, mainly due to increased raw material demand, pandemic-related shortages and backlogs, labor constraints, shipping issues, and geopolitical tensions.
Other challenges faced by a growing energy storage manufacturing in the U.S. include availability and price of raw materials for batteries, as well as recruiting and training a manufacturing workforce.
Future needs
The United States announced that it is joining Australia, Canada, and the European Commission in launching a new Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) global initiative on supercharging grid-scale battery storage. This initiative aims to build a secure and transparent supply chain to boost stationary battery storage development and deployment. Jennifer M. Granholm, U.S. Department of Energy secretary applauded this step, saying that “battery storage is an essential piece of the decarbonization puzzle”. She estimates that the U.S. will need 1.5 TW to 2.5 TW of power capacity, plus up to tens of thousands of terawatt-hours in storage duration to get to net zero.
