https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/31/gm-announces-650-million-production-plan-with-lithium-americas/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NEVADA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 31, 2023",GM announces $650 million production plan with Lithium Americas,"General Motors (GM) announced it will make a $650 million equity investment in Lithium Americas, representing the largest-ever investment by an automaker to produce battery raw materials. 
The partnership targets a mining operation at Thacker Pass, Nevada, the largest known source of lithium in the United States and third largest globally. Lithium America estimates the materials extracted and processed from the project can support the production of up to 1 million electric vehicles (EV) per year. 
“GM has secured all the battery material we need to build more than 1 million EVs annually in North America in 2025 and our future production will increasingly draw from domestic resources like the site in Nevada we’re developing with Lithium Americas,” said GM Chair and chief executive officer Mary Barra. “Direct sourcing critical EV raw materials and components from suppliers in North America and free-trade-agreement countries helps make our supply chain more secure, helps us manage cell costs, and creates jobs.” 
Lithium carbonate from the operation will be used in GM’s proprietary Ultium battery cells. The batteries are designed to be resilient through repeated charging and discharging (including fast charging), delivering high energy density, and offering high levels of usable capacity, said the company.
Materials sourced from Lithium Americas is expected to support customer eligibility for EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, said the automaker.
The $650 million investment will be split between two tranches. The funds for the first tranche will be held in escrow until certain conditions are met, including the outcome of the Record of Decision ruling currently pending in U.S. District Court.  If those conditions are met, the funds will be released, and GM will become a shareholder in Lithium Americas. The escrow release is expected to occur by the end of 2023.
The second tranche investment is expected to be made into Lithium Americas’ U.S.-focused lithium business following the separation of its U.S. and Argentina businesses, and is contingent on similar conditions, including Lithium Americas securing sufficient capital to fund the development expenditures to support Thacker Pass.
Production at Thacker Pass is slated to begin in 2026. GM will have exclusive access to the first phase of production through a binding supply agreement and has the right to first offer upon the second phase of development.
“The agreement with GM is a major milestone in moving Thacker Pass toward production, while setting a foundation for the separation of our U.S. and Argentine businesses,” said Lithium Americas President and CEO Jonathan Evans. “This relationship underscores our commitment to develop a sustainable domestic lithium supply chain for electric vehicles. We are pleased to have GM as our largest investor, and we look forward to working together to accelerate the energy transition while spurring job creation and economic growth in America.”
GM is launching a broad portfolio of trucks, SUVs, luxury vehicles and light commercial vehicles using the Ultium Platform, including the GMC Hummer EV Pickup and SUV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, Cadillac CELESTIQ, Chevrolet Silverado EV, among others.
The automaker has announced four U.S. battery cell plants with annual capacity of 160 GWh, including the Ultium Cells joint venture plant with LG Energy Solution in Warren, Ohio, which is in production. It announced additional JV sites in Spring Hill, Tennessee and Lansing, Michigan that are scheduled to open in 2023 and 2024, respectively. The first three Ultium Cells plants are expected to create 6,000 jobs in construction and 5,000 in operations.
GM is currently building EVs in two Michigan plants, one Tennessee plant and one Ontario plant, and its suppliers are investing to create a robust North America-focused supply chain for EV raw materials, processed material and components, with major projects under way in California, Texas, Ohio, and Quebec.

EDF’s grid-scale team commissioned 922.4 MW while its distribution power team delivered 9 projects totaling 56 MW.
EDF’s onsite solutions team, through affiliate PowerFlex, completed 76.7 MWp of solar, 9.4 MWh of energy storage and 2,606 new EV charging installations.
“I’m very proud of our team’s ability to deliver this scale of renewable energy projects in light of the many challenges during the year around import restrictions, supply chain constraints and increased cost of capital,” said Tristan Grimbert, president and chief executive officer, EDF Renewables. “We launch into 2023 with 1.2 gigawatts (GW) in construction and nearly 8 GW in late-stage development.” 
One EDF project which entered commercial operations in December was Arrow Canyon, a 275 MW solar plus 91 MWh/5-hr storage project whose offtake client is NV Energy. Located on the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians Reservation, Arrow Canyon will benefit the Moapa Tribe and local community over its operating life through land lease, tax and other payments.
In August, EDF Renewables achieved commercial operations for a series of four projects at its Palen Solar site. The projects combine for a total capacity of 620 MW of solar and 50 MW/ 200 MWh of energy storage. The site is administered by the Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
The Palen Solar projects are estimated to bring an average local spend to Riverside County, Calif., of $24,000 per month during construction. Combined the projects create enough energy to power up to 217,000 average California homes.
In December, Munich RE/MEAG acquired a 50% interest in two projects, Maverick 6 and 7, representing 310 MW of solar and 50 MW / 200 MWh of battery storage of the combined Palen Solar projects.
In June, EDF Renewable revealed three solar projects with co-located energy storage were awarded contracts by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The projects represent nearly 40% of the 2.4 GW awarded as part of NYSERDA’s 2020 Renewable Energy Standard Solicitation, and 170 MW of the capacity was awarded as part of the 2018 solicitation.
All three N.Y. community solar projects are expected to reach commercial operations by the end of 2025:
EDF Renewables, the utility’s global development business, is active in 20 countries with an installed global capacity of 8.9 GW as of mid-2020, with wind being the largest sector, followed by solar and storage. It plans to double its renewable capacity by 2030, from 28 GW (including hydro) to 50 GW, as part of its strategic project “CAP 2030”.
Paris-based Électricité de France has a $50.9 billion market capitalization and operates over 120 GW of power generation assets across Europe, South America, North America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/31/community-solar-up-net-metering-down-in-2023/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 31, 2023","Community solar up, net metering down in 2023","The U.S. distributed solar market, which typically involves projects less than 10 MW in capacity, doubled its market size to 8 GW from 2018 through 2022.
Over the last four years, buildout has been pushed down by trade policy challenges, supply chain constraints, persistent labor shortages, and lifted by record-breaking retail electric rate increases and an increased consumer demand for clean energy.
Wood Mackenzie said to look for policy to continue to shift away from retail-rate net metering policies and towards community solar. Net metering involves the crediting of a customer bill for sending excess solar generation to the grid, while community solar typically involves subscribers signing on for a share of generation from an off-site facility that sells wholesale power to the grid.
Net metering down
In the distributed generation (DG) space, across the United States utility-backed proposals and bills in several states including California, Florida, Indiana, Idaho, Michigan, and North Carolina, sought to cut net metering compensation rates.
Likely the most impactful outcome of net metering rulemaking came out of California, where net energy metering 3.0 was approved. The rates paid to participating ratepayers who install solar after April 15, 2023, will be paid based on the Avoided Cost Calculator, a device created by utilities with the goal of avoiding cross-subsidization of solar owners by non-solar owners. The new rate cuts payments by about 75%, and this model may be used by other states if deemed successful.
U.S. retail electricity prices are expected to continue to rise in 2023 to $0.154/kWh, after a 10% increase in 2022. This amounts to an 18.3% increase since 2019. Over the same period, Wood Mackenzie said that that the national market penetration of residential solar will have grown from 3.4% to 7%.
Under new tariff rates, installers will have to find ways to aid their customers in increasing self-consumption and relying on net-metered energy less. Energy storage, proper system sizing, and microgrid-forming devices like the Enphase IQ8 are some tools in the toolkit to maximize customer value.
“Beyond self-consumption, the future holds opportunities for solar-plus-storage systems to provide value through resource aggregation,” said Wood Mackenzie. “Evolution away from retail rate net metering will accelerate the formation of partnerships between battery storage manufacturers, solar-plus-storage installers, and aggregators as they try to capture the value of providing real-time grid services via virtual power plants and package the resulting savings into initial solar-plus-storage retail offerings.”
Community solar
As net metering is phased down in many major markets, state-sponsored community solar programs are on the uptake. With just over 1 GW of new capacity expected for 2022, community solar makes up under 13% of the distributed generation market, said Wood Mackenzie.
Currently 13 states have formal community solar programs, in addition to several states that have utility-run community solar programs. These programs combine to a forecasted 7.3 GW of new solar capacity between 2022 and 2027,” said Wood Mackenzie. This growth is further boosted by a federal push for community solar and rich incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act.
In September, the California State legislature enacted A.B. 2316, authorizing regulators to create a new, state-wide program. Although the precise rules of the program have yet to be established, we expect the first projects could come online as soon as 2024. By 2027, Wood Mackenzie expects upwards of 250 MW of new installations annually, though this number may be revised upward significantly depending on the structuring of the program, which will take place over the course of 2023.
In 2021, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin introduced bills proposing state-wide community solar. All three will likely face opposition from political leaders and utilities. However, if established this year, these programs provide an upside to the Wood Mackenzie forecast of at least 400 MW by 2027.
Arizona Public Service (APS) filed a community solar program proposal in Q3 2022, though it is unlikely to be approved in the proposal’s current state, said Wood Mackenzie. The initial request for proposals would result in 140 MW of community solar. And in Pennsylvania the prospect of a new community solar program has already resulted in early-stage development.
Leases gain ground
The solar industry still awaits guidance from the Department of Treasury on the investment tax credit bonus adders, including for domestic content, energy communities, and low-income goals. Many installers and financiers expect that it will be beneficial to offer third party-owned products (leases or power purchase agreements) regardless of the final details of the guidance.
The third-party ownership (lease and power purchase agreement) segment reached its lowest quarterly share in Q3, 2022 at 18.6% but still experienced considerable growth of 27% year-over-year in 2022 through Q3. The third-party ownership segment is expected to continue to grow and win back share starting in 2023, as it will benefit from being the only residential solar financing segment eligible for the investment tax credit adders.
Although the loan market has consistently dominated the residential solar space since 2018 and grew 66% year-over-year in 2022 through Q3, rising interest rates and dealer fees will slow the segment’s growth in the first half of 2023, said Wood Mackenzie.
Companies that only offer loans may struggle as it will be difficult for salespeople to continue selling loan products at the same pace in this higher rate environment. As such, Wood Mackenzie said companies offering multiple products will gain a competitive advantage in 2023.

The 2022 volume is almost five times the readership of our first full year, which reached just over one million page views in 2017.
U.S. website traffic was driven by a broad variety of topics, but net metering was the hot topic of the year, and for good reason – net metering affects the broadest number of people who might be interested in solar power: homeowners and residential rooftop installers. There are roughly 85 million single family home rooftops in the United States – and so far, only 4 million of those roofs have solar panels.
Two articles on California’s controversial NEM 3.0 had a particularly broad reach. One of the articles, California’s official vote to transition to NEM 3.0, set readership records with close to a half-million page views. The second article, which hints of the potential plans of what NEM 3.0 would be, became our fourth most-read article ever, and third most-read for 2022. Another article on net metering also snuck into the top ten – Florida’s net metering challenges.
An article on the Inflation Reduction Act broke into the top five. Truly, this was by far the solar industry’s most consequential story in 2022. We should expect this topic to ring through, consistently, into the middle of the next decade.
Several topics that are only tangentially related to the solar market managed to find traction, showing that the interest in the energy transition runs far and wide. For example, our second most-read story of 2022 covered a new rooftop wind product! And our fifth most read story dove into research describing how large, ocean-going container ships can be electrified affordably, with current battery technologies.
So with that, we request that you please tell us what topics you think ought to be covered. Help us educate you!

The 48A / 11.5kW Generac EV charger is a Level 2 home charger, which Generac said is capable of charging a car battery in as little as four to six hours, depending on the car battery’s capacity and charge need.
The unit’s J1772 connector is out-of-the-box compatible with nearly all EVs on the market today. The charger’s NEMA-4 enclosure makes the unit rated for both indoor and outdoor residential installation.
The Generac EV charger will be available through Generac’s sales outlets including home improvement retailers, wholesalers, and hardware stores. Customers may also request an in-home consultation with a turnkey installation through Generac’s dealers by filling out a contact form on the Generac website.
“Electric vehicle owners need confidence that they can quickly charge to get where they need to go,” said Nick Schmidling, senior product manager at Generac.
The market for electric vehicles is growing in the United States, and manufacturing of EVs, EV batteries and EV chargers is on the upswing following the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). In addition, several states, including California, are planning to ban gas-powered vehicles, which will give rise to a strong demand for charging infrastructure.
The EV charger is not Generac’s first foray into the clean energy space. In 2021 the company introduced the PRWmicro line of microinverters as well as the PWRcell, a backup battery storage solution.

Emeren stands for “empowering renewables,” which the company says was chosen because it symbolizes its progress and continued dedication to growing solar and renewable energy development globally. A new logo features a sun against a blue background, representing the sun’s energy and serving as a reminder of the importance of renewable energy.

“This rebranding not only provides us with a clear direction and foundation as we aim to become the world’s premier solar project developer and operator, but also showcases our dedication to our partners, customers, and investors,” said Mr. Yumin Liu, chief executive officer of Emeren. “It captures the essence of our future aspirations and achievements as we continue to drive innovation and growth in the solar industry.”
The legal name “ReneSola Ltd.” is now “Emeren Group Ltd,” and the company’s NYSE stock trading name will be changed to “Emeren Group Ltd.” on or about February 9, 2023. Its trading symbol of “SOL” will remain the same. The Company’s ADR stock will continue to be listed on NYSE and the CUSIP number will remain the same.
The company went public as ReneSola in 2008, and had shifted from being a local maker of solar wafers to an international solar IPP and development company. In December 2022 the company announced an increased revenue of 86% in Q3, yet it lowered its Q4 22 guidance to $44 million to $49 million, compared to the market consensus of $73 million, reflecting recent acquisitions of European assets taken on its balance sheet.
The company completed a 10.2 MW Hungarian project in Q4 22 but withheld 110 MW of Poland and Hungarian solar project sales in that quarter based on the company’s European shift to an IPP business model. The company said it expects to energize the remainder of the 100 MW European portfolio in Q3 23.
Emeren reports that it currently has a pipeline of approximately 3 GW of projects and IPP assets across in more than 10 countries across Europe, North America, and Asia. In North America Emeren develops utility- and community-scale solar, solar-plus-storage, and stand-alone storage projects.
The rebranding takes place immediately and encompasses a new logo, tagline and website address at www.emeren.com.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/31/hvdc-transmission-line-to-connect-three-iso-regions/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MONTANA,NORTH DAKOTA,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 31, 2023",HVDC transmission line to connect three ISO regions,"Allette, Inc. and Grid United partnered to build what could become the first high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission line that interconnects three independent system operator regions: the Midcontinent System Operator (MISO), Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and the Western Interconnection.
The new power project, the North Plains Connector, is a 385-mile HVDC transmission line that will connect central North Dakota to Colstrip, Montana. The power line will provide 3 GW of transfer capacity between the middle of the country and all three energy markets. The developers expect it to ease congestion on the transmission system, increase resiliency and reliability, and enable fast sharing of energy resources across a vast area with diverse weather patterns.
The North Plains Connector project is in the development phase. As project developer, Grid United is currently engaged with landowners and stakeholders to determine the best route for the line. Both companies expect project permitting to start this year as they work toward an in-service date of 2029, pending regulatory approvals.
“It is no secret that the U.S. is in desperate need of new electric transmission capacity, and the North Plains Connector will provide resiliency and reliability benefits for decades to come,” said Michael Skelly, chief executive officer of Grid United.
Skelly is behind a previous transmission development company, Clean Line Energy, which dissolved in 2017 when a multi-state project failed to secure state regulatory approval. He previously helmed Horizon Wind Power, now part of EDPR, one of the largest onshore wind developers in the U.S.  He was the subject of the 2019 book, “Superpower,” by Wall Street Journal senior energy reporter, Russell Gold, who chronicled Skelly’s career as a risk taker in the project development market.
Grid United is developing five additional HVDC projects ranging from 100 to 300 miles providing interconnection of renewable energy in Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming. The company backed by an advisory board that includes Carl Monroe, former chief operating officer of the SPP, Jack Hand, former CEO of Power Engineers, and William Kaul, former chief transmission officer of Great River Energy, a Minnesota utility.
Investments in transmission projects have grown in recent months with the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act putting subsidies behind renewable energy projects located in remote places of the grid, requiring a modern grid system.
On January 12, a partnership between Invenergy and the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority outlined the 400-mile North Path transmission line, a proposed HVDC line that will have the capacity to move up to 4 GW of renewable energy produced in New Mexico to the state’s Four Corners region. The North Path line is expected to begin operations in 2025 and reach completion in 2028.
Another major transmission project was recently approved recently by the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC).  SunZia is a 550-mile 525 kV HVDC transmission project. Separately, the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission issued two approvals of Pattern Energy’s SunZia Wind project, a 3.5 GW proposed wind project in New Mexico that will provide power across the transmission line to Pinal County, Arizona. Once complete, the SunZia Transmission and Wind project represents the largest clean energy project in the U.S., including $8 billion in total investments.
