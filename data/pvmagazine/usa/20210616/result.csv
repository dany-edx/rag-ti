The report looks at different scenarios that the region’s three major utilities (NextEra, Duke Energy, and Southern Company) plus the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) could take to achieve 100% renewable generation against the backdrop of a federal mandate.
The study assumes that any federal Clean Energy Standard (CES) would require TVA to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2030 and the other utilities to follow suit by 2035. The report is also not a least-cost optimization and does not account for most transmission or distribution limitations.
The report also only considers existing technologies that do not emit carbon dioxide, without speculating on future technological improvements; it said these future technologies would only make achieving a CES easier.
The first of the two pathways considered focuses on customer-owned distributed energy resources (DERs) that would play a big role in the energy transition.
Under this pathway, the report said that TVA can achieve 100% clean energy with a capacity mix of 10% distributed solar and energy efficiency measures, 41% large-scale solar, 17% wind, 8% other renewable resources, 12% existing nuclear capacity, and 13% energy storage.
Within the scenario, storage is used to meet winter reserve margins, and is not fully used even on peak days. This means that the amount of storage proposed for TVA is there “just in case” of equipment failures or outages during peak events.

Southern Company’s energy mix is split among its three utilities: Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power. These utilities are currently fossil-reliant, especially Mississippi Power, which is currently expected to have 90% of its 2035 generation mix be fossil fuels. The customer-oriented pathway would shift each utility’s mix:
For these utilities, the resource capacity needs are driven by the winter peak demand shape, though there is relatively little excess generation during peak summer days. The renewables and storage to meet summer and winter peaks are projected to be enough to meet load during a typical spring day, meaning that utilities could likely operate some or all nuclear capacity only in the winter and summer.

The NextEra plan includes the utility’s plan to integrate Gulf Power into Florida Power and Light by 2022. The resources needed for this scenario are driven by the winter peak, a result of lower solar generation levels in the winter.
The proposed energy mix is 15% distributed solar and energy efficiency measures, 51% solar, 9% wind, 2% other renewables, 6% existing nuclear capacity and 17% energy storage.
This scenario also makes NextEra’s grid less reliant on importing fuel from outside of the state, due to the proposed penetrations of solar and storage.
And, much like Southern Company, Duke Energy’s mix is split among its three utilities: Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, and Duke Energy Florida. The scenarios for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress differ from Duke Energy Florida, as the Sunshine State utility does not have nuclear capacity and does not build onshore wind in its territory. The scenario looks like:
Because Duke Energy Florida has little wind and no nuclear, solar and storage take a larger role here than in any other scenario explored.

All of these scenarios rely upon a few major mindset shifts for the region, including an immediate and significant commitment to energy efficiency, demand response, and distributed solar, starting in 2022, increased investment in utility-scale solar and storage additions, and some reliance on local wind, which has historically been viewed with low feasibility.
The second major pathway relies more heavily on major capacity additions of large-scale renewables and assumes DER penetration levels are lower than in the DER-focused CES pathways, but still higher than current utility plans.
In this second pathway, TVA can achieve 100% clean energy with a capacity mix of 9% distributed solar and energy efficiency measures, 38% large-scale solar, 22% wind, 8% other renewable resources, 12% existing nuclear capacity and 12% energy storage.
Image: Tennessee Valley Authority
TVA’s existing hydro and nuclear resources help it achieve 100% clean electricity by 2030, even with lower penetrations of DERs, though it is only 1% lower and TVA has not been the most distributed solar-friendly historically. The case would also require a near doubling of the wind developed within the TVA service territory.
As for the three Southern Company subsidiaries, their large-scale mixes put the brunt of capacity on the shoulders of solar and wind, while still maintaining significant DER penetration. Here’s how that plays out:
Image: Nextracker
Alabama Power sees the greatest increase in wind and has nearly zero excess generation on its sample peak summer day, meaning that, under this large-scale renewable-focused pathway, both the winter and summer peaks are driving the need for resources. Georgia Power sees a very similar excess generation situation and Mississippi Power is relying very heavily on wind and solar in this scenario.
Once again, with NextEra, the large-scale renewable-focused pathway takes a heavy focus on solar and storage. The utility’s energy mix would thus look like 13% distributed solar and energy efficiency measures, 48% large-scale solar, 17% wind, 2% other renewable resources, 6% existing nuclear capacity and 14% energy storage.
Lastly, the Duke utilities also turn heavily to solar and storage under this large-scale renewable-focused pathway, especially Duke Energy Florida. Here’s the breakdown:
Even with a de-emphasis, across all utilities and subsidiaries analyzed in the report, DERs still play a fundamental role in achieving 100% clean electricity with a focus on large-scale renewable resources because any reduction in load or peak from DERs reduces the need for large-scale renewables to be built. The report’s authors held steady in the belief that an aggressive and sustained investment in DERs is important in any pathway to 100% clean electricity.
Scenarios outlined under the second path also rely on getting a lot of large projects on-line quickly, meaning that siting and permitting processes would need to be streamlined as much as possible while still being environmentally responsible.
Some alternative strategies are outlined in the report, but its purpose of publication was to highlight that the region can get to 100% clean electricity using technologies available today. Even so, investment in research and development of new technologies should not be overlooked.

The automaker made an initial commitment in March 2020 to invest $20 billion over the time period, including capital, engineering expenses and other development costs. Last November, it increased that total to $27 billion.
In January, GM said that it plans to become carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040. The company worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop what GM called “a vision of an all-electric future” as well as “an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.”
To reach its goals, GM outlined plans to transition to battery electric vehicles or other zero-emissions vehicle technology, source renewable energy, and leverage “minimal offsets or credits.”
The automaker said at the time that it believed that the energy sector was “well on its way to a decarbonized grid” and that an all-electric future would be supported by renewable infrastructure and technology.
(Read “The future of cars is electric–but how soon is this future?“)
In a supply chain review of strategic parts of the U.S. economy, the White House earlier this month shone a spotlight on U.S. battery manufacturing capacity both for electric vehicles and for stationary applications. The report said that the automotive industry will likely drive the demand for batteries and quoted worldwide sales projections of 56 million passenger EVs in 2040, of which 17% (about 9.6 million EVs) would be in the U.S. market.
The report said that if all batteries for EVs in the U.S. market were manufactured abroad, that would result in roughly $100 billion in imports.
GM’s newly announced investments include:
GM also confirmed plans to launch its third-generation HYDROTEC fuel cells with greater power density and lower costs by mid-decade. GM manufactures its fuel cells in Michigan in a joint venture with Honda.
The company said last November that it would deliver 30 new EV models by 2025 globally, with two-thirds available in North America. In its latest update, GM said it will add electric commercial trucks and other products to its North America plan that will use its Ultium Platform. In addition, GM will add U.S. assembly capacity for EV SUVs. Details will be announced later.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported the data and said that renewable energy was the only source that increased in 2020 from 2019; fossil fuel and nuclear consumption declined.
EIA said that solar energy accounted for about 11% of U.S. renewable energy consumption last year. Overall solar consumption rose 22% from 2019. Wind energy accounted for about 26% of U.S. renewable energy consumption. The resource passed hydroelectricity in 2019 to become the single most-consumed source of renewable energy on an annual basis. And last year, U.S. wind energy consumption grew 14% from 2019.
Hydroelectric power accounted for about 22% of U.S. renewable energy consumption. Consumption has remained relatively flat since the 1970s, but fluctuates with seasonal rainfall and drought conditions.
Black & Veatch unit Diode Ventures said it reached financial close on the Grizzly Ridge Solar Project, a 137.7 MW solar project located in Hamilton County, Texas, southwest of Fort Worth. The project was co-developed with RKB Energy. Details of the financing were not disclosed.
Once complete, Grizzly Ridge will provide energy to the ERCOT North Zone, a growing economy and power market where there is high demand for all forms of electricity.
The project has an executed interconnection agreement with Brazos Electric Cooperative, the transmission service provider. The area will undergo an upgrade from 69 kV to 138 kV. Diode also is in discussions to add an on-site battery energy storage system to the project.
The International Finance Corp., the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, and The Rockefeller Foundation announced a partnership to deploy $150 million of capital in blended finance to leverage up to $2 billion of private sector investment in distributed renewable energy.
The two will prioritize countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions, where both organizations have identified immediate opportunities.
By blending philanthropic and private investment funding, the Rockefeller Foundation and IFC hope to de-risk capital investment in distributed renewable projects in emerging markets and help to address global energy access needs.
An initial “rapid deployment” phase will distribute $30 million in blended concessional finance and grant capital to leverage an active pipeline of distributed renewable energy projects developed by IFC. The funding will go toward IFC’s prototype scaling mini-grid program in addition to distributed renewable energy generation, battery energy storage, and other clean energy technologies to facilitate access.
