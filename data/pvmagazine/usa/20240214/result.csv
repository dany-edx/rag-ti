The report looks at how installation costs and energy savings prices change in relation to climate, heating source and type of home. Researchers ask policymakers to further reduce the costs of installing heat pumps so that more U.S. households can benefit from them. The paper was published in Joule, a monthly peer-reviewed science journal.  
The report’s data was collected by studying simulations of 550,000 statistically representative households. Researchers assessed the costs and benefits of three air-to-air heat pump performance levels across various home types, with and without insulation upgrades. 
The Department of Energy states the three common types of air-to-air heat pumps include: 
Researchers found that a country-wide adoption of one or more air-to-air heat pumps across five 2022 to 2030 electric grid scenarios would reduce national emissions by 5% to 9%. They also state that 59% of households could afford the average cost of installing air-to-air heat pumps without subsidies ($5,500, according to the American Society of Home Inspectors). However, the efficiency of the equipment was key, as it impacted the home’s energy bill savings. 
Researchers state that minimum-efficiency equipment could increase energy bills in 39% of households. That number decreased to 19% if insulation upgrades were installed and 5% if higher-efficiency equipment was used. 
The most significant insulation and home efficiency factors influencing a household’s energy savings post-installation included heating fuel type and the presence of air conditioning. Researchers state that 92% to 100% of the 49 million homes with air conditioning and using electricity, fuel oil or propane for heat would experience a median energy bill savings of $300 to $650 yearly depending on heat pump efficiency. Homes in colder climates would see higher savings. 
The Inflation Reduction Act’s $3200 Energy Efficiency Upgrade rebate provides homeowners up to $2000 of savings for qualifying heat pump technology upgrades and up to $1200 for qualifying energy efficiency home improvements. However, researchers state that millions of households still can’t afford to leverage these credits, “We need work to bring down the cost of installing heat pumps,” said Eric Wilson, a senior research engineer at NREL and the paper’s lead author.

Puerto Rico has also reached 680 MW of distributed solar, according to a U.S. Department of Energy study, triple the amount of two years ago.
Rúa-Jovet credits the progress with batteries to Puerto Rico’s “professional, well-informed” transmission and distribution utility Luma Energy, as well as the private sector and “a good regulator.”
The amount of storage keeps growing, Rúa-Jovet said, as 4,500 rooftop solar systems are being added each month with a battery attachment rate of 100% and an average of 1.2 batteries per system. Puerto Rico’s storage “is going to deal with hosting capacity concerns at the distribution level,” he said.
Meanwhile, Puerto Rico’s newly launched battery emergency demand response program has created the first virtual power plant in Latin America and the Caribbean, he said. “Uptake is slow” for the pilot program, he noted, suggesting that the compensation offered to battery owners to participate in the program could be higher, or another program model could be tried.
Rúa-Jovet made his comments at a San Juan meeting headlined by U.S. government officials to announce the summary findings of a study led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to identify how Puerto Rico can reach 100% renewables.
It is “100% possible” for Puerto Rico to reach that goal by 2050, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, but “we’ve got to work harder” to reach 40% renewables by 2025.
Both goals were set by Puerto Rico’s Act 17, enacted in 2019.
SESA-PR President P.J. Wilson said that Puerto Rico hasn’t yet reached 10% renewables, and that reaching the law’s mandate of 40% renewables by year-end 2025, or coming as close as possible, is “what’s relevant.”
Six U.S. national laboratories said in a report last year that by rapidly deploying 3.75 GW of utility-scale solar and 1.5 GW of storage, as regulators had specified in 2020, Puerto Rico could reach 36% renewables by 2025, but that would require speedier procurement by PREPA, the utility that owns Puerto Rico’s generation units.
PREPA is managing the first of several utility-scale solar and storage procurements that were intended to fulfill the 40% renewables goal by 2025, while the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau is managing two more procurements, and Genera, which operates Puerto’s generation units, is managing a 400 MW procurement for large-scale storage.
The majority of the projects in the PREPA procurement “are looking favorable to succeed,” Wilson said, “primarily because most of the viable projects have secured or are securing project support from DOE’s Loan Programs Office, which assumes up to 80% of the risk for the projects.” The success or failure of the two energy bureau procurements “hinges on the outcome” of the PREPA procurement, he added.
Rooftop solar and storage could provide 75% of Puerto Rico’s power, a report by nonprofit groups Cambio and IEEFA found in 2021. The report said that distributed solar and storage should be the focus for $9.6 billion in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds allocated for Puerto Rico’s grid reconstruction.
In line with that recommendation, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit last April aiming to require FEMA to allocate funds designated for PREPA to rebuild the grid to fund distributed renewable generation.
Speaking at the San Juan meeting, FEMA Regional Administrator David Warrington said FEMA has “obligated over $10 billion towards stabilizing the energy grid, to get to the point where renewables are possible.”
The final NREL-led study on how Puerto Rico can reach 100% renewables by 2050 is expected to be released in March.

The Northeast show is the flagship regional conference conducted by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA). It is also the largest of the RE+ regional conferences and this year it is bigger than ever, having outgrown its previous space and now filling a hall in the convention center.
State representative Jeffrey Roy delivered the welcome to a packed room for the opening session. Roy is chairperson of the joint committee on telecommunications, utilities and energy, and house chair of the manufacturing caucus. He welcomed the clean energy advocates to the Commonwealth, a state with a strong policy support for renewables.
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA highlighted the industries associations roadmap for 2024, what she said is a pivotal year for the industry. She emphasized the importance of state policy, as exemplified in the Commonwealth, noting both risks and opportunities affecting the industry. Partisanship is one of the risks, especially in this election year, she said.
Delivering the keynote was Tarika Barrett the CEO of Girls Who Code, an organization with a mission to close the gender gap in technology. Barrett noted a growing gender gap in females entering STEM professions and the impact that has on the economy.
The exhibit hall is filled with over 200 exhibitors, and the larger convention hall provided plenty space for the influx of attendees. Traffic remained steady throughout the day, with attendees remarking that RE+ Northeast has become a must-attend show.
Yaskawa Solectria Solar debuted its XGI 1500 utility-scale and commercial string inverters, designed and engineered in Lawerence, Massachusetts and assembled and tested in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. The company said its inverters are qualified as domestic end products compliant with the Buy American Act and eligible for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. Yaskawa Solectria is exhibiting in booth 325.
One of the technical highlights of opening day was an overview of a new standard by EMerge Alliance. The Alliance describes the new standard as interoperability data model (IDM) framework that allows encoding of electrical compatibility information of microgrid component devices (power sources, conversion, storage, circuit protection and distribution devices) into a machine-readable format.
“This standard and its associated open-source public library satisfies the urgent need for a standardized information framework that can be utilized by design systems to assist inexpert and non-technical users evaluate electrical compatibility in the concept stage of system design and significantly reducing engineering soft-cost of a project,” said Dusan Brhlik, chair of the Microgrid Technical Standards Committee and EMerge Alliance Governing Board member.
RE+ Northeast continues today with more cutting-edge workshops, roundtables, and exhibits. pv magazine USA can be found in booth 850.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/14/large-format-solar-modules-and-legacy-assumptions/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RACKING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,2024-02-14,Large-format solar modules and legacy assumptions,"At the RE+ 2023 conference in Las Vegas, vendors from across the globe displayed their largest, thinnest, bi-facial solar modules, showcasing achievements in photovoltaic cost efficiency. Boasting wattages once unthinkable, the cost reduction juggernaut of solar has marched forward.
For those of us who have designed a solar module and performed mechanical load testing, there is one head-scratching detail that sticks-out and begs for further exploration. These massive modules come equipped with some of the smallest module frames ever seen.
The previously ubiquitous 2- by 1-meter module with a frame height of 50mm is now approximately 55% larger in surface area with frame heights as low as 30mm. How is this possible when mechanical load ratings have remained constant, and the height of a beam is of paramount importance to its strength? Those physics hold true for bridges, buildings, and even the frame of a solar module. Wind and snow loading rise proportionally with the increased surface area, but the latest, longest-ever module frames see a height reduction of ~40%, severely reducing its load-carrying capacity.
Modules are tested to various standard mechanical load tests for certification. These tests apply loads to the front-side and back-side of the module to rate them for withstanding real-world environmental conditions. The current industry standards (UL 61730-2, IEC 61730, IEC 61215-2) all generally agree on mechanical load testing procedures. Many of the modules on the conference floor advertise compliance with these standards and the industry-leading testing labs perform these certification tests with the utmost care and diligence.
While the large-format modules meet these standards in the lab, the lab is not the real-world. The field loading applied to a solar module depends on the structure on which it is mounted and the terrain of the project. The greater the wind zone, the greater the load on the module.
Less obvious is that larger tilt angles typically also increase wind loading on modules and that this varies across locations throughout the array. Picture a ship with its sails raised versus lowered during a storm. Which one has more force to project their vessel forward?
Snow can often have the opposite effect. Panels of a higher tilt angle will often shed more snow than lower tilt panels and thus be more favorable to module loading from snow. Any house roof in a northern latitude will showcase this phenomenon. The project designers must carefully check that the modules selected work with the mounting structure at every location on the project site.
Therefore, to understand the engineering gap at hand, a marriage of large-format module frame design and structural design of racking systems is key. Because module loading is dependent on the supporting structure (e.g., tilt angle, among several variables), structural vendors typically specify expected module loading in project design. Many structural vendors are good at validating that the module itself falls within the certification rating. However, is it possible that some vendors are still missing peak module loads for wind?

Image: Azimuth Advisory Services
A SETO-funded research project being carried out through a joint venture of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and UC Berkeley has determined that vendors need to look at smaller effective wind areas than the spans between foundations (not what is shown in Figure 1 A) when estimating individual module loading. PV modules can be broken if attributable areas as small as one-quarter of the module are overloaded (individual fastener level loading – D in Figure 1) and this can be shown to occur at maximum project design conditions for many projects getting installed today. While the evaluation typically carried out is around a maximum design loading, the SETO-funded research team is currently exploring how a lower, uneven cyclical loading can lead to structural failures as well.
If understated peak module wind loading has been common practice in project design for the last 15 years, then module failures should be rampant, no? In practice, older module frames have been pulling double-duty masking this oversight. Some of those module frames were designed with safety factors of 3. Today, large-format modules appear to be designed to safety factors of 1.5 based on reviews of some module manufacturers datasheets and industry standards. This allows the modules to be competitive in the downward march on cost.
When a certification laboratory tests a module to an actual 2,400 Pa of back-side loading, the maximum design pressure it is certified for is 1,600 Pa. It is critical to check if the module rating advertised is what was tested (including safety factors) or if it is what the maximum allowable design pressure is (without safety factors). 1,600 Pa of pressure on a module is approximately equal to a 72-mph wind gust for a module pressure coefficient of 3. The LBNL / UC Berkeley research team has determined that this coefficient is achievable at row ends for module tilts over 15 degrees. This is hardly a sufficient design for any project in the U.S. based on the latest ASCE 7-22 wind maps. If a designer mistakenly used 2,400Pa to be the design pressure, this would increase the allowable wind gust to 88-mph. Thus, it is important to understand what the module rating includes.
Load capacity
The market has driven module load capacity to its breaking point. This seems to be particularly the case regarding backside (wind uplift) loading. Combining legacy engineering assumptions, larger module areas, smaller module frame heights and unclear manufacturer ratings yields a recipe for failures. The goal is not to lay blame, but to understand the technical issues at hand and offer guidance on what stakeholders can do.
Here are tangible ways that developers, financiers, insurance companies, owners, asset managers, structure manufacturers and module manufacturers can manage these risks:
1. Make sure sufficient independent engineer (IE) budget and time is allocated per project (particularly smaller projects) so key details about module loading can be checked not only per project, but at every location on the project (e.g., exterior rows, corners, fasteners).
2. Structure manufacturer due diligence should confirm that:
3. Module due diligence should confirm:
