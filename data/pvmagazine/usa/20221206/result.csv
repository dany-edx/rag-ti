Incorporating pollinators provides a slew of benefits for solar installations, agriculture, and the environment. But it’s not as simple as scattering some seeds and hoping for the best. Luckily, through extensive experience and research, we have arrived at best practices that will set you up for success. Inovateus Solar and The Bee & Butterfly Habitat/Conservation Blueprint recently conducted a webinar about these risks and benefits, and the following is a summary of those guidelines that will help avoid common pitfalls.
Why plant pollinators?
Solar developers can make a positive environmental impact by planting pollinators around solar panels. Pollinators do more than just provide habitat for bees, butterflies, insects, and other wildlife. They also sequester carbon, help prevent stormwater runoff, and reduce the use of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides; resulting in improved water and soil quality.
What may not be as obvious are the many benefits pollinators provide to solar installations. Pollinator plants can decrease the ground temperature under solar panels, helping panels work more efficiently and produce more power. They can also reduce maintenance costs for solar farms, because mature pollinators require far less mowing than other ground covers.
The benefits don’t stop there. As more solar farms are being developed, many have been facing local opposition. Residents may be concerned that the solar farms will use valuable farmland, ruin views, or change the character of their community. Pollinators can help in several ways, such as by improving solar farm aesthetics. Beekeepers can keep hives around solar pollinator fields to help with honey production. And bringing more pollinating insects to a region helps increase yields for nearby farms. Seeing all these benefits can help communities get on board with solar farms.
As a testament to the benefits, Inovateus Solar, a national solar developer and EPC, has made a commitment to planting pollinators as part of its sustainable solar development. This year, the company has aimed for at least 75% of its solar sites to include pollinator habitat. Inovateus isn’t alone; the trend is becoming popular among solar developers across the U.S. But without the right guidance or experience, it’s easy to go astray — with potentially costly mistakes.
Early planning
That’s where Conservation Blueprint comes in. The company, which creates custom seed mixes for pollinator habitats, has extensive experience tailoring the mixes to the specific needs of solar developers. This is more complex than it might seem; a great overall seed mixture for pollinators might not work well for a solar installation.
Getting it right requires early planning — ideally, before the project has even started. Think of the vegetation as being as important as the electricity that will be generated by the solar panels. The earlier in the process vegetation is considered, the more successful the planting will be.
It’s crucial to involve all parties in these early discussions: the seed mixture designer, the solar developer, and whoever will manage the vegetation.
Panel height
One of the most important things to consider early is the height of the panels in the project.
The utility-scale solar industry is moving to a standard of a lower panel height of 20 to 24 inches off the ground. Many pollinator plants grow taller than this, so they would shade the panels.
Limiting the plant height to species that don’t grow taller than 18 to 24 inches takes a lot of tools out of your toolbox, but you may be stuck with that if panels are too low.
A project with a 36-inch lower panel height may be much better suited to pollinator plants. Those 12 inches make a big difference in designing a seed mixture. The good news for solar developers is that the cost difference between 24 inches and 36 inches is minimal.
Site preparation
The next step in early planning is to prepare your site. That might mean removing any existing vegetation. If the site was formerly used for agricultural production, you will need to control the weeds that will grow on the site.
Site preparation can include establishing the pollinator plants before construction. The advantage to waiting until after construction is that you won’t need to replant some of what was planted earlier. But unless a site requires significant grading or you expect to have to replant more than 30% of the site, it’s cost-effective and much easier to establish a uniform pollinator ground cover prior to construction. For that reason, many projects are going this route.
Vegetation management
A vegetation management plan is essential to guide you through details such as site preparation, timing of the planting, method for planting, and determining what equipment to use. Although the pollinator plants account for a tiny fraction of the total project budget, the whole project can be thrown into disarray if the final vegetative cover is not established.
It’s recommended that once it’s established, pollinator habitat be mowed 9 to 12 inches from the ground rather than close to the ground.  Timing is key. Mowing weeds before they get out of control is essential while the pollinator plants are still establishing themselves.
Seed selection
Native wildflowers are nice to look at, but they’re not always suited to solar sites. Many don’t tolerate being mowed once or twice a year, and some may grow too tall for your panels. On the other hand, some local ordinances require that you establish vegetative cover using only native plant species, so you should check to see what’s required in your region.
A well-managed solar site may often use white Dutch clover, which Conservation Blueprint often combines with fescues and bluegrass for utility-scale solar farms that have a lower panel height of 20 to 24 inches.
The mixture has a very high seeding rate and establishes itself quickly. Clover, though it doesn’t qualify as a native plant, is highly beneficial to pollinators. But for the maximum benefit to pollinators, it’s best to establish two different seed mixtures for a site. The clover mixture can be used around the panels. Areas on the site without panels, usually about 10% to 20% of a utility-scale project, can be planted with a more traditional pollinator seed mixture that has a minimum of 40 native wildflower species. This approach works best for sites that are at least two acres in size.
About 16 states have solar pollinator scorecards that can help guide you in selecting the optimal seeds for your site. You also want a seed mixture that’s adapted to your site’s soil type and geography.
Conservation Blueprint considers these additional factors when designing an optimal seed mixture:
The future of solar pollinators
The use of pollinator plants with solar continues to be studied. In 2023, the Bee and Butterfly Habitat Fund will begin a program to establish high-quality pollinator habitat with utility-scale solar projects. The program will monitor pollinators such as milkweed for five years and will monitor carbon sequestration at each project for at least six years to determine which seed mixtures work best for that purpose.
But you don’t need to wait for further studies like these to start incorporating pollinator plants into your projects. Following the best practices outlined here will ensure that your solar pollinator efforts bring significant benefits to both your projects and the regions where they are located.

Construction of its 4 MW community solar project is scheduled to begin in Q1 2023.  Once construction is completed, the start of generation will be contingent upon testing of the interconnection and final approval from the regional utility.
Genie Energy meanwhile has completed a Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review (CESIR) for a 6 MW community solar project expected to achieve notice to proceed in early 2023.  Both projects are being developed by solar affiliate Genie Solar Energy.
“Community solar plays to Genie’s strengths as an integrated solar provider. In our first two projects, we not only obtained control of the sites and are overseeing permitting, we are also financing and managing the construction of the projects,” said Michael Stein, chief executive officer of Genie Energy.  “We’ll utilize our own designed and manufactured solar panels and our retail arm will identify, enroll and manage the projects’ customers.”
Newark, New Jersey-based Genie Energy is a retail energy provider which provides electric and gas services to customers in 18 states and the District of Columbia and operates a vertically integrated solar development platform.
Subsidiary Genie Solar Energy operates a utility and community solar development business that develops, owns and operates solar projects ranging from 1 MW to 30 MW in size, for commercial, industrial and utility customers. Two affiliated companies, Prism Solar, and Sunlight Energy Investments, operate U.S.-made solar module production facilities and project financing solutions for the solar development business.
In Q3 22, the company acquired site rights to develop seven community solar projects with 34 MW of total capacity in New York, and 30 MW of additional projects in Pennsylvania, which it is advancing through permitting processes.
To date, Genie Solar has deployed commercial and industrial rooftop systems for Integra Biosciences (572 kW), Cardoza Flooring and Kraft Power (58 kW).
On the company’s recent Q3 22 earnings call Stein said, “we expect energy prices to remain volatile as we head into the Winter months, but we continue to be well-positioned from a risk management position and will return to customer acquisition mode on a market-by-market basis when the risk/reward balance is favorable.”
Genie Energy’s shares traded at $10.41 per share today and a $270 million market capitalization.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/06/solar-assets-are-underperforming-by-8-kwh-analytics-reports/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 6, 2022","Solar assets are underperforming by 8%, kWh Analytics reports","kWh Analytics, a climate insurance and renewable energy risk management firm, released its 2022 Solar Generation Index and reports that solar assets are broadly performing below expectations. The report incorporates data from industry collaborators and kWh Analytics’ proprietary Heliostat database. 
On average, projects constructed after 2015 have generated 7-13% less electricity than P50 production estimates.
P50 means there is a 50% chance in any given year that production will be at least a specific amount. If an array has a P50 production level of 500 kWh, it means that on any given year there is a 50% chance that production will be at least 500 kWh. 
The report concluded that as the gap between actual and expected generation grows, underperformance risk jeopardizes investor returns and the industry’s ability to achieve sustainable growth. 
“Underperformance affects investors and lenders critical to the success and growth of solar projects,” said Jason Kaminksy, chief executive officer of kWh Analytics. “As an industry, we must collaborate to find ways to course-correct in order to ensure the industry’s long-term financial health.” 
The average performance of projects constructed last year represented a minor improvement compared to 2020. In general, projects built since 2015 are performing worse than those constructed in the early 2010s relative to their P50 estimates. 
The kWh Analytics report showed that since 2019, projects with capacity >50 MW have performed worse relative to their P50 estimates than projects with capacity between 1-50 MW.
The underperformance trend is a nationwide phenomenon, said kWh Analytics. Under ten years of operational data, average lifetime performance ranged from 5-10% below initial P50 estimates across the seven regions. Over the years, performance continues to decline in each region. The only outliers in 2021 were the Northwest and Southeast regions, which improved by 1% and 2%, respectively.
“It is imperative that we continue to support the long-term success of the renewable energy sector,” said Kaminksy. “To de-risk investments into zero-carbon assets and encourage resilience throughout the industry, sponsors and lenders should consider accurately priced risk-transfer products, be wary of aggressive production forecasts, and be collaborative with stakeholders to encourage data sharing.”
The report also evaluated system performance based on project capacities and mount types and found no underperformance trends isolated to any specific group of projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/06/solar-anti-circumvention-ruling-will-not-damage-short-term-module-supply-but-uflpa-might/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PRODUCTS,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 6, 2022","Solar anti-circumvention ruling will not damage short-term module supply, but UFLPA might","On December 2, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that companies in Southeast Asia are avoiding U.S. tariffs imposed on solar products that originate from China. The preliminary ruling included investigations of BYD (Cambodia), Canadian Solar (Thailand), Trina Solar (Thailand), and Vina (a Vietnamese subsidiary of LONGi). 
Goods found in violation could have tariffs as high as 50% to 250%, creating an untenable amount of risk for project developers.  
However, in June, the Biden Administration placed a two-year moratorium tariff on solar goods. The tariff exemption applies to modules that are imported before June 6, 2024 and installed a project sites before December 2024. 
TrendForce reported that this preliminary ruling should not have a tangible effect on short-term solar deployment due to the Biden moratorium. The company forecasts that installation demand for the entire U.S. market will total around 35 GW to 40 GW for 2023.
 The report continued that the U.S. lacks a complete industry chain and is at a relative disadvantage in PV module production, leaving developers more dependent on imports. TrendForce said due to relatively high labor and energy costs, there is a low chance the country will be able to cut manufacturing costs meaningfully in the near future. With the U.S. facing an election year in 2024, it is unclear whether a new administration would continue to support the Biden Administration’s support of domestic supply chains. In total, this leads TrendForce to conclude that the U.S. government will likely continue to be “open minded” about solar components imported from factories in China and other countries for the next two to three years.
UFLPA
The Energy Information Administration said about 20% of utility-scale solar projects, sized 1 MW and up, were delayed in the first half of 2022, largely due to module supply shortages related to the investigation, as well as to COVID-19 slowdowns and goods seizures from the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
TrendForce said that the UFLPA should warrant more attention than the anti-circumvention investigation as a threat to short-term module supply. 
The UFLPA places a “rebuttable presumption” that goods from the Xinjiang region of China, home to roughly 50% of the global polysilicon supply chain, are made with forced labor. The act places the burden of proof on buyers to show that the imported goods have no connection to forced labor whatsoever. 
To be in compliance with UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at a facility, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily. 
“The origins of components and materials used in PV products are not ascertained through a direct identification process. Instead, regulatory agencies often have to rely on product manufacturers and importers to provide supply chain information and sourcing certification,” said the report. 
TrendForce said the subjective view of Customs and Border Protection will play a role in the flow of solar goods onto U.S. shores as well. Recently, Customs cleared a meaningful supply of JinkoSolar modules made with Wacker polysilicon for the U.S. market. While this clearing of goods was a good sign for solar module supply, there is a significant backlog of modules remaining to be cleared. 
Last month, Reuters reported that over 1,000 shipments of solar energy components, valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, have been blocked in U.S. ports under enforcement of UFLPA. ROTH Capital Partners said in August that as much as 3 GW had been held in Customs since the law was enacted. As much as 9 GW to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering U.S. markets by the end of the year, said Shen. 
ROTH Capital warned that following the release of JinkoSolar goods, Customs Border Patrol may now turn its attention beyond the top solar component importers. “We could end up being in a two steps forward, one step back situation,” said ROTH Capital managing director and senior research analyst Philip Shen.

Renewable Properties was founded in 2017, and it specializes in developing and investing in small-scale utility and community solar and energy storage projects throughout the United States. The company currently has a pipeline of 650 MW solar energy projects under development throughout the southeast, midwest, northeast and Western U.S.  It has also acquired over 100 MW that is either under construction or in operation
The recent projects acquired from NextGrid are participating in Maine’s net energy billing (NEB) program, which allows residential, commercial, municipal, and industrial customers to offset their electricity bills with the energy generated from renewable energy projects located within their utility service territory. The renewable energy landscape of Maine shifted dramatically in 2019, when current Gov. Janet Mills bolstered the NEB policy and also raised the state’s renewable portfolio standard to 50% by 2030. In addition, Maine has plans to install 375 MW of distributed solar by mid-2024 and to reduce the state’s emissions 45% from 1990 levels by 2030. Since these favorable solar policies were introduced, solar generating capacity in Maine has surged by 300%. The projects acquired by Renewable Properties will contribute significantly to continued solar growth in the state.
“We’re excited to help Maine expand its energy market with community solar, which increases access to local clean energy and its many benefits,” said Aaron Halimi, founder and CEO of Renewable Properties. “With these projects, local homes and businesses will save on their electricity bills, regardless of whether they rent or own their roof with no money down. We’re excited about partnering with NextGrid on this portfolio of projects and look forward to building our long-standing working relationship.”
The operational projects in the initial portfolio tranche total 18.63 MW. They include two in the town of Lewiston, one in Poland, and one in Waterville. The 7.5 MW projects in Lewiston projects have 1,233 subscribers and has been operational since Sept. 1, 2022. The projects will offset 7,750 tons of CO2 annually. The 5.56 MW Poland project came online on Dec. 23, 2021, has 1,081 subscribers, and will generate enough energy to offset 5,946 tons of CO2 per year. The 5.55 MW Waterville project came online on March 16, 2022, has 780 subscribers, and will generate enough solar energy to offset 4,959 tons of CO2 annually.
Two projects of 5.4 MW each are under construction in Bangor and Howland. The projects, scheduled to come online by end of Q2 2023, will generate enough clean energy to power approximately 1,202 homes and offset 10,525 tons of CO2 annually. Construction is set to begin in Q1 2023 on another three projects, totaling 12.6 MW, with expected completion in December 2023. These projects, located in Bangor, Winslow, and Manchester, will generate enough solar to power 1,257 homes and offset 11,000 tons of CO2 annually.
“With these acquisitions, Renewable Properties continues to show its commitment to community solar in Maine,” said Aaron Culig, president of NextGrid. “We were pleased to partner with Renewable Properties for this third acquisition and look forward to building on our successful working relationship.”
NexGrid focuses on commercial opportunities and reports that it is one of the largest low-income community solar companies in the United States, with over 1 GW in development and 150 MW of solar-plus-storage assets in operation. In addition to the NextGrid portfolio acquisitions, Renewable Properties is separately developing a 2.8MW project in Skowhegan and another 2.8 MW project in Orono.

Scientists from the Western University in Canada have developed an optimization framework to help BIPV shades to maximize electricity generation, radiative heating, and cooling loads.
“One of the main novelties of this work is that the simplicity of the model allows us to incorporate a wider range of performance influences than have previously been investigated, ranging from empirical fits to predict the photovoltaic response of the solar cells, to the costs and benefits for both heating and cooling of the building, to using architectural design guidelines to estimate the quality and value of the modified interior lighting,” researcher Eric Johlin told pv magazine. “In particular, we find that lighting quality can make significant differences in the optimal design, depending on the location and orientation of the building in question.”
The proposed framework covers design constraints for PV shade systems, weather and radiation data, building properties and orientation, and solar module specifications, according to “Multi-objective optimization of building integrated photovoltaic solar shades,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. The energy modeling considers solar electricity, heat transferred through windows, and daylighting inside buildings. 
“Each value function can be used as a criterion for optimization alone, or in combinations together,” the academics said.
They applied the proposed modeling to a room with a square 55 m2 footprint, no obstructing surroundings, and with two south-facing and two east-facing windows across five different locations: Canada, California, Iran, Germany, and Singapore. The researchers said that the recurring yearly value of the BIPV system needs to be weighed against the upfront cost.
“It is important to note that while the overall value function may stay at a similar level between design modifications, the balance between the three specific value functions may change significantly,” they said. “The actual decision of which point is economically optimal will depend on the current price of PV cells and modules, installation and frame material costs, as well as the discount rate of the owner.”
In non-tropical climates, the value of the BIPV installation increases because fewer, longer shades are used according to location and building specifications, the scientists said. 
“We showed that it is important to recognize the value produced by the window without shades to compare to when considering the true BIPV system value, as this can be significantly positive or negative, again depending on location and building specifics,” concluded Johlin.
