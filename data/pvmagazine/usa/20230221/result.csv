https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/21/re-volv-secures-investment-to-build-solar-projects-for-non-profits/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 21, 2023",RE-volv secures investment to build solar projects for non-profits,"RE-volv, a climate justice non-profit, closed a $3 million investment to build solar projects for non-profits in underserved communities around the country. The Kresge Foundation and the Schmidt Family Foundation have each invested $1.5 million in program related investment funds to help RE-volv deploy community-based solar at scale across the country.
In the past, non-profits could not take advantage of the investment tax credit, but the Inflation Reduction Act changed that, making solar a much more attractive investment. However, non-profits still face barriers to getting their solar projects financed including difficulty demonstrating credit. RE-volv offers long-term zero down solar financing for non-profits, which allows community-serving organizations to switch to solar power with no up-front costs.
“To date, the benefits of clean energy have eluded so many, especially in low-income communities and communities of color, due to a lack of financing options available,” said Andreas Karelas, founder and executive director of RE-volv. “This historic investment demonstrates that now is the time to deploy capital in clean energy projects that benefit frontline communities and vulnerable populations.”
The organization aims to help non-profits in underserved communities go solar, while raising awareness about equitable climate solutions and training the next generation of clean energy leaders. RE-volv reports that it has developed and financed solar projects for over 50 non-profits in 14 states, collectively saving them what it estimates to be over $20 million on their electricity bills. Prior to the investment, RE-volv deployed over $10 million for solar projects through its unique solar finance model that exclusively serves the non-profit community.
As a non-profit organization, RE-volv supports its operations primarily through philanthropic support. The Schmidt Family Foundation was one of RE-volv’s first major supporters, and The Kresge Foundation also has supported the organization.
The Schmidt Family Foundation was established in 2006 by Eric and Wendy Schmidt, and it works to restore a balanced relationship between people and the planet. The foundation makes grants and impact investments through two programs: 11th Hour Project and Schmidt Marine Technology Partners, which partners with communities around the world in working for renewable energy, resilient food systems, healthy oceans and the protection of human rights.
“We’re thrilled that RE-volv will be using new mapping tools developed in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to identify the areas and communities in which solar projects will have the most meaningful and measurable positive impact,” said Jamie Dean, managing director, impact investments at 11th Hour Project.
The Kresge Foundation was founded in 1924 to promote human progress. Today, Kresge fulfills that mission by building and strengthening pathways to opportunity for low-income people in America’s cities, seeking to dismantle structural and systemic barriers to equality and justice. The Kresge Foundation first announced its commitment in October as part of a $7 million package of investments to boost community solar in disadvantaged communities. “Investments are intended to accelerate a just energy transition by providing capital and other supports to co-developer organizations with strong community partnerships, an identified market, and a readiness to scale the number of climate finance projects in the community,” the Foundation said in a news release.
“Climate change overburdens people of color and low-wealth communities, which are more likely to face power affordability issues, experience intermittent power loss, and live adjacent to polluting energy sources that impact health,” said Joe Evans, portfolio director and social investment officer at The Kresge Foundation.
Last year the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) announced support for three non-profits as part of the third round of the Solar Energy Innovation Network (SEIN). The focus of the third round of the SEIN is to help disadvantaged communities overcome barriers to equitable adoption of solar, including funding, as non-profits face particular barriers to accessing solar financing. RE-volv was one of the three selected and received a multi-year contract from NREL for its initiative to help BIPOC-led houses of worship go solar. The two other groups to receive support are Interfaith Power & Light and Green The Church.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/21/rooftop-solar-in-arkansas-threatened-by-new-legislation/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,ARKANSAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 21, 2023",Rooftop solar in Arkansas threatened by new legislation,"Another U.S. rooftop residential solar market is under threat as House Bill 1370 has been introduced in Arkansas. The bill proposes to slash the rate utilities pay solar customers for sending excess renewable energy to the grid. It is sponsored by two Republican representatives, Rep. Lanny Fite and Sen. Jonathan Dismang.
The bill “seeks to unwind promises made in 2019 by the passage of Arkansas’s wildly successful Solar Access Act,” said a filing from a coalition of over 90 Arkansas businesses, citizens, school districts, churches, and other organizations that formed to preserve rooftop solar accessibility in the state. The Solar Access Act led to thousands of new Arkansas jobs and helped many achieve lower and more stable power costs. The act legalized “1:1 net-metering,” offering a full retail payment for exporting clean energy to the grid.
The HB 1370 proposes to lower solar net metered payments to the “avoided cost” to the utility, essentially a wholesale rate that is far lower than the retail rate paid by end users. The result is a damaging loss in value for customer-sited solar, working in direct contrast to statewide and nationwide stated goals of supporting distributed clean energy.
A similar rulemaking change occurred in California, which represents 50% of the U.S. rooftop solar market. The net metering rate cuts in California are expected to lower rooftop solar demand by 30%. In 2017, Nevada cut its net metering rates in a similar fashion, subsequently leading to a 90% drop in rooftop solar installations.
“This bill will end the solar industry in Arkansas and will cost us thousands of jobs,” said Barry Hyde, judge of Pulaski County.
The bill is also putting active projects at risk. After four years of development, approval by the Arkansas Public Service Commission (PSC), and expenditures of more than $40 million, the Producers Rice Mill solar project is under threat. The 20 MW solar plus 40 MWh battery storage microgrid project was evaluated by the PSC to reduce rates for all Entergy Arkansas ratepayers and stabilize the grid when under stress. The bill would “gut this investment being made by over 2,200 farm family members of the Producers Rice Mill cooperative.”
Investor-owned utility Entergy supports the bill. It has repeatedly made claims that solar customers are cross-subsidized by non-solar customers, and that the utility is not fairly compensated for maintaining its transmission infrastructure. It has repeatedly failed to make a convincing case to the Arkansas PSC of the negative effects of net metering.
The PSC rejected a past attempt to cut rates, finding “net energy metering encourages the use of renewable energy resources and renewable energy technologies by reducing utility interconnection and administrative costs for small consumers of electricity” and that “net-metering would help to . . . attract energy-technology manufacturers, to provide a foothold for these technologies in the Arkansas economy, and to make it easier for customer access to these technologies.”
The coalition of opposition to the bill included local school districts.
“Passing HB 1370 will have a direct and immediate negative impact on Batesville Schools with higher electricity bills that could impact teacher pay,” said Batesville School District Superintendent Dr. Michael Hester. “The Batesville School District was able to reduce its electricity costs and invest those savings into pay raises for public school teachers. It is very troubling that the legislature is considering reversing all the tax saving revenue for Arkansas’s non-profit organizations in the name of corporate greed.”
Local residents are also signing on in opposition to the bill.
“Our investment in on-farm solar electricity provides my family’s farm with both reduced power costs and power pricing predictability,” said Mark Isbell, a farmer in Lonoke County. “If that goes away, the investment we have made will be undermined and our farm and family will see significant new challenges that jeopardize our future.”

In total, corporate funding for energy storage was up 55%, with $26.4 billion invested in 2022 compared to $17 billion in 2021. A record of 28 energy storage companies were acquired in 2022, which is the largest number of acquisitions since 2014.
Venture capital (VC) funded energy storage projects with $5.8 billion and 96 deals. While these investments were 35% less than VC funding in 2021 (which was a record $8.8 billion), they represent a tenfold increase over VC funding since 2018, and nearly fourfold increase over VC funding in 2019 and 2020.

One of the more exciting VC deals to receive funding was not a lithium ion product. It was a $450 million investment in Form Energy, which makes a unique 1 MW/100 MWh long-duration energy storage product. The capital will drive the construction of a new manufacturing facility in West Virginia. The company recently signed two deals to install 10 MW/1,000 MWh at retired coal plants in Xcel Energy territory.
Corporate funding of energy storage (which includes VC funding) rose from $17 billion in 2021 to $26.4 billion in 2022, an increase of 55%. In this same period, corporate funding for smart grid companies rose from $2 billion to $4.74 billion, and corporate funding for energy efficiency companies rose from $465 million to $540 million.
The large growth in funding of lithium ion energy storage doesn’t come as a surprise. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, which focuses specifically on lithium ion, has shown massive growth over the course of the last year in terms of announced manufacturing capacity. On February 15, 2022, Benchmark shared that approximately 5.1 TWh of lithium ion battery manufacturing capacity had been announced to be deployed by 2031.

By February of this year, Benchmark showed that these projections had grown by almost 60.
While this capacity will mostly be used for transportation, the volume relative to electricity use is revolutionary. Globally, total annual electricity use is in the range of 26,000 to 27,000 TWh, or approximately 72 TWh per day. Therefore, by 2031, the 8 TWh of lithium ion capacity we could be manufacturing annually would equal about 2.6 hours a day of the earth’s current daily electricity usage.
Consider this: In 10 years enough energy storage could be manufactured to store a full day’s worth of energy, which could—hypothetically—be used on a daily basis.
While lithium ion still gets the big volume headlines, the large variety of deals that VCs have invested in is also a point of interest. That such a variety of products can find this level of funding speaks to the rapid scaling of the industry. With so much money pouring into the industry, there’s a lot of space for experimentation.

Some of the “other” energy storage technologies investments include batteries based on zinc, sodium, aluminum-sulfur, liquid air, nickel, flywheels, iron flow, compressed air, and iron air. As the variety and quantity of technologies increases, so too does the number of investors entering the industry. There were 73 investors when Mercom began tracking the number of investors in 2018. Today, there are 233.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/21/rooftop-solar-friendly-bill-introduced-in-georgia/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,GEORGIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 21, 2023",Rooftop solar friendly bill introduced in Georgia,"Senator Jason Anavitarte of Georgia sponsored SB 210, a bill to expand net metering and community solar in the state. The bill has met strong support from the Georgia Solar Energy Industries Association (GASEIA).
The bill, called the Georgia Homegrown Solar Act of 2023, would raise the state’s net metering cap from 0.2% of annual peak demand to 5%, giving a wider set of homeowners the opportunity to reap the benefits of a net-metered rooftop solar installation. The bill also includes a 20-year grandfathering right to customers who adopt a net metering agreement.
Residential systems eligible for net metering are expanded from 10 kW to 15 kW. Non-residential customer eligibility would change from 100 kW to 125% of maximum annual peak demand. The bill would also allow for a $20 monthly fixed charge for utilities to attach to solar customers but includes language to prevent other discriminatory fees against solar customers.
Senate Bill 210 also enables tax-exempt organizations like nonprofits, churches, and government entities to aggregate electricity demand from multiple locations. These organizations can subscribe to off-site solar facilities 3 MW or less in size.
The bill also has consumer protection provisions, requiring utilities to transparently report energy usage details. Meter readings must be provided “in electronic machine-readable form, without additional charge” and such access “shall be provided in 15-minute intervals or the shortest interval available through existing meters.” Utilities would be required to keep at least 24 months of meter usage data for each customer account.
GASEIA president Pete Corbett said following major legislation in 2013 and 2015, Georgia has had remarkable growth in the solar industry. It ranks within the top ten states for solar deployment with over 4.5 GW of capacity installed through Q3 2022.
“Senate Bill 210 seeks to build upon these strong measures by improving the community solar market and updating net metering provisions in law,” said Corbett.
December decision
This bill has been introduced in the wake of a December 2022 decision by the Public Service Commission (PSC) to raise electric rates, maintain the low cap for net metering, and impose a $100 interconnection fee for new customers.
The PSC decided on a 6.68 cents per kWh net metering export rate for major utility Georgia Power and kept the hard cap of only 5,000 customers allowed to access net metering. While previous customers would receive a credit on their bill for exported solar energy, under the new rule, customers will have to pay their full electric bill first, and subsequently receive payment for their contribution to the grid separately. 
“The Commissioners had all the information and data they needed to expand the pilot monthly netting program and spur Georgia’s rooftop solar market, but they simply chose not to do so,” said Kevin Lucas, senior director of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Lucas said the decision “will keep the state’s rooftop solar sector mired at the bottom of the national rankings.”
At the time of the decision, Allison Kvien, southeast regulatory director at Vote Solar said, “As we begin a new legislative session in a few short weeks, we’ll be looking to state legislators to take real action and make Georgia a place where people have the ability and the real, economic option to manage their energy bills through rooftop solar adoption.”
Senate Bill 210, if passed, would offer some of the benefits Kvien and other industry and public advocates seek.

That’s the utopian future GenZ EV Solutions and Subway Restaurants hope they are mapping out.
This week Miami-based GenZ EV Solutions, an EV charging development company, partnered with the national quick service sandwich franchise to pilot Subway EV Charging Oasis parks at new and existing restaurants. Using multiple charge ports, the Oasis parks will feature picnic tables, playgrounds, WiFi access and additional green space to allow customers to unwind while their EVs charge in what the charging company says is as little as 10 minutes.
GenZ EV Solutions and its EV charging network partner Red E Charging are deploying equipment using the battery-buffered fast charging equipment of ADS-Tec Energy, an EV charging infrastructure company that has operations in Dresden, Germany and Auburn, Alabama.
As part of its multi-year plan to rollout the Subway EV Charging Oasis, small format and fast EV charging stations will be piloted at select, new or newly remodeled Subway restaurants beginning this year. The charging stations are designed to offer added convenience for on-the-go guests, providing an environmental benefit solution and creating an additional revenue source for franchisee partners. Guests can also benefit from Subway promotions at charging stations.
“Equitable access to charging is essential to the adoption of EVs in the future and Subway’s scale will play an important role in democratizing charging infrastructure for millions of Americans,” said Jose Valls, chief executive officer of GenZ. “By coupling our technology and know-how with Red E Charging’s strategic relationships and Subway’s network of restaurants across the U.S., we are continuing to make key strides in building the EV infrastructure of tomorrow.”
Subway is partnering with franchisees for small-format EV charging stations as well as future Subway EV Charging Oasis parks.

ADS-Tec Energy’s fast charging equipment, the ChargePost and ChargeBox battery system, provide up to 320 kW of fast charging in grid systems with limited power capacity, the case in many U.S. cities.  Currently the 140 kWh ChargePost systems are available globally by ADS-Tec distributors while the ChargeBox, with 201 kWh of power distribution capacity, is available across Europe.  The products provide a full charge for EV users in as little as ten minutes.
ADS-TEC Energy, based in Nurtingen, Germany, revealed plans in December to open a U.S. manufacturing facility in Alabama, creating 180 sales, warehousing and assembly jobs for the city. The company expects its new site to be fully functional by 2024, expanding its manufacturing operations out of Germany into the U.S. ADS-TEC plans to invest $8 million for the construction of its new site.
According to Plugshare, Red E Charging, GenZ’s network partner, is a Detroit, Mich.-based company that operates about 26 public charging stations in Michigan and South Dakota with 53 Level 2 charging ports and 17 DC fast charging ports.
In addition to tax credits for purchasing EVs, the Inflation Reduction Act pf 2022 renews tax credits for the installation of EV charging infrastructure in residential, commercial and industrial applications. The credit is for up to 30% of the costs of EV charging equipment. For businesses in designated areas though the credit is expanded from $30,000 to $100,000 per system starting this year. The Biden Administration’s goal is to achieve a national network of 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030.

The case was filed by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The case focused on Broadview Solar’s Montana facility, which applied for an 80 MWac Qualifying Facility electricity contract with the state under PURPA guidelines. The facility was sized at 80 MWac / 160 MWdc of solar power, and 50 MW / 200 MWh of batteries. Broadview says the site will install 20 inverters, rated at 4 MWac apiece.
An initial ruling from the Montana Public Utilities Commission in September 2020 stated that the solar power facility should be based upon its direct current (DC) rating, (the same way solar panels are rated). Broadview argued that its peak grid output, determined by its inverters, is what should be considered. The commission realized this was a departure from previous logic, but they went with it anyway. Broadview appealed.
Montana’s state Supreme Court has ruled against the Commission’s apparent anti-solar biases before.
In March 2021, the Commission vacated its prior ruling, instead stating that the facility’s peak grid output was the motivation for PURPA’s legislation.
By this point, utility NorthWestern Energy, as well as a national utility lobby group that includes the Edison Electric Institute and a local utility, filed legal arguments stating that the battery should be considered to be a separate facility. This would effectively increase the facility’s output to 130 MW, disqualifying the plant from PURPA eligibility.
The court also stated that since the battery’s electricity only connects to the grid through the same 80 MW connection, it would not be considered to be a separate unit.
Another group argued that since one document had technically rated the solar inverters at approximately 82.5 MW (before electrical losses were considered), the project ought to be disqualified. The court disagreed with using the document, or the specific value, as the deciding value.
The aforementioned Montana state ruling set the default electricity purchase rate at $0.0383/kWh.
According to SEIA, Montana currently has 130 MW of installed solar capacity, meaning this facility will more than double the deployed capacity in the Treasure State. Looking ahead, SEIA expects over 1 GW of solar power is coming to Montana over the next five years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/21/impact-of-single-axis-agrivoltaics-systems-on-non-irrigated-grassland/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TRACKERS,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"FEBRUARY 21, 2023",Impact of single-axis agrivoltaics systems on non-irrigated grassland,"From pv magazine global
Scientists at Colorado State University are investigating how the redistribution of rainfall and light caused by agrivoltaic systems mounted on single-axis trackers can affect the growth of non-irrigated grassland. The study is part of the Sustainably Colocating Agricultural and Photovoltaic Electricity System (SCAPES) project, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
“What we found is that on the drip edges of modules, depending on whether you’re tilting to the east or the west when there is a rainfall, you can get somewhere between two to five times the amount of precipitation dumped in one spot,” Colorado State PhD student Matthew Sturchio told pv magazine. “If you want to quantify that for Colorado, it’s about changing the annual precipitation from 350 mm to 1,200 mm of rain. When you do that, you can really improve the amount of soil moisture that stays throughout the season, instead of letting it evaporate.”
Sturchio and his team are conducting research on Jack’s Solar Garden, a 1.2 MW community solar garden in Boulder, Colorado. The project was installed in 2020 and features more than 3,200 380 W monocrystalline PV modules from Vietnam-based solar manufacturer Boviet Solar. The panels are mounted on single-axis trackers, one-third of them at nearly 8 feet in height, and the other two-thirds at 6 feet.
Colorado has a semi-arid climate, with stronger rainfalls and temperatures around 95 F in the afternoons. Temperatures in the morning are around 72 F. The trackers tilt to the east in the morning, and to the west in the afternoon, following the sun. When it rains, this movement simulates the conditions of large rainfalls on either edge, with more water falling on the west edge due to the higher rainfall volumes in the afternoon.
Consequently, the research team originally expected the west drip edge to show increased grassland productivity. Instead, they found that the east edge, with lower soil moisture, has higher grassland growth.
They placed moisture sensors on the land and found that there is a 16 inch to 24-inch wide strip that benefits from the increased soil moisture from the drip edges. Experiments showed that air temperature and dryness also impact grassland productivity within and outside that strip.
The temperature optimum for the grassland growing at Jack’s Solar Garden is a lot closer to 86 F than it is to the 95 F registered in the afternoons, according to Sturchio. “If you exceed 30 degrees [C], you are reducing the amount of photosynthesis that can happen for that plant,” he said.
The team found that the lower air temperatures and reduced air dryness in the morning compensate for lower soil moisture, leading to increased productivity in the east edge.
The shading provided by the solar arrays also proved to increase productivity.
“Typically, you’d imagine that grassland is adapted to deal with really high light for the entire day,” said Sturchio. “But we found that if you shade for half of the day with the solar array, it improves photosynthetic efficiency. You have higher rates of photosynthesis when the sun is available because you have a shorter photoperiod,” he explained.
Moreover, shorter photoperiod results in less evapotranspiration from the leaves, reducing the amount of water loss. This could prove crucial in keeping grassland productivity during periods of drought, according to Sturchio. The team hopes to test the hypothesis if Colorado experiences a drought period in the future.
The installation at Jack’s Solar Garden is designed to maximize electricity production, without much space between panel rows. The team found that the soil outside the east or west edge strip behaves more like the space between panel rows, and the conditions between the two strips are more similar to the conditions directly underneath the solar arrays.
They also observed that the leaves of plants under the solar arrays are 39 F cooler. “There are a lot of plants that can benefit from this lower temperature in the middle of summer in Colorado,” said Sturchio.
Overall, the present design leads to 9% less grass production, mainly attributed to the space directly under the solar array. The economic gains from electricity production vastly compensate for the slightly lower crop production, according to Sturchio.
“But if we space the solar arrays out to 15 meters apart, then you get a 6% increase in productivity in a wet year,” he claimed.
Going forward, the SCAPES project aims to develop agrivoltaics in degraded agro-ecosystems.
The team believes that their understanding of the effects of single-axis agrivoltaic systems on rainfall and light redistribution and consequent impacts on crop productivity can help to restore land degraded by overgrazing, agriculture practice, and water scarcity.
