Southern Power said it will be adding 88 MW/352 MWh of energy storage at the Garland Solar Facility, located in Kern County. Southern Power’s Tranquillity Solar Facility, located in Fresno County, is slated to get 72 MW/288 MWh of energy storage. Both solar projects are 200 MW and went online in 2016.
According to Southern Power, the battery additions will enhance California’s grid reliability by providing SCE and the California Independent System Operator with additional flexible resource capacity that will assist in further integrating intermittent renewable energy into the grid.
The energy storage projects will be owned in partnership with AIP Management (on behalf of Danish pension funds PKA and PenSam) and Global Atlantic Financial Group, both of which have existing ownership interests in the Garland and Tranquillity solar facilities.
Southern Power operates the solar farms and will be responsible for operating the co-located energy storage projects upon completion. The company said the storage projects align with its growth strategy of developing and acquiring projects covered by long-term contracts with strong credit counterparties.

The installation’s 20,000 MWh annual production nearly triples the university’s on-site renewable energy generation portfolio, helping the university meet its 25,000 MWh goal set in its Climate Action Plan.
The 54 acre Solar Farm 2.0, as the project’s name suggests, is the university’s second solar installation. It follows Solar Farm 1.0, a 4.7 MW installation on 20.8 acres.
D.C.-based Sol Systems developed the project, and  contracted with Inovateus Solar, based in South Bend, Ind., for the array’s engineering, procurement, and construction. Construction work began last August.
Solar Farm 2.0 includes 31,122 bifacial PV modules from an unidentified supplier.
Inovateus Solar said that it aimed to achieve zero construction waste, meaning that it worked to prevent site material from being directly deposited into a landfill. Solar Farm 2.0 will act as a pollinator habitat and serve as a demonstration site for pollinator-friendly solar arrays.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/04/sunrise-brief-borrego-to-develop-110-mw-solar-project-its-largest-to-date/,"EV,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021","Sunrise brief: Borrego to develop 110 MW solar project, its largest to date","San Diego-based Borrego said it will develop a 110 MW utility-scale solar project as part of the solicitation for large-scale renewables by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The Rutland Center Solar 1 project will be Borrego’s largest development announced to date.
The award was one of 20 solar projects awarded as part of NYSERDA’s efforts to develop more than 2 GW of new renewable energy capacity throughout New York State. The Borrego array will be sited in National Grid territory in the north of the state, in the towns of Rutland and Watertown in Jefferson County.
Con Edison said that customers in New York City and Westchester County, N.Y. completed 5,542 arrays in 2020 with a combined capacity of 44.77 MW. Utility customers have now completed more than 35,700 projects with a combined capacity of 322 MWs.
Among the five boroughs of New York City and Westchester County, Queens has the most customer solar arrays, 11,334. When it comes to capacity, Westchester is the leader with 83.75 MW. Customers in Queens completed the most projects last year,  2,064. The borough also added the most capacity, 13.35 MW.
Con Edison said that a typical residential customer with a 6 kW solar array can generate enough power to provide up to $700 in annual savings, helping reduce a bill by more than 60%. The company recently began offering solar installers and their customers a device called Smart ConnectDER, which allows a customer to avoid the cost of upgrading the home’s circuit breaker panel and excessive electrical boxes on the side of the house.
Residential solar and energy-efficient home improvement finance firm Mosaic said it passed $4 billion in loans funded through the company’s platform. The company said that in 2020 it closed asset-backed securitizations of $222 million and $280 million, both of which were oversubscribed. The company said that multiple years of historical data has strengthened its relationship with capital markets, reduced its cost of capital, and allowed it to pass along lower rates to homeowners.
Cybersecurity researchers at Idaho National Laboratory have published a book to help train employees at public utilities to recognize cybersecurity vulnerabilities and develop measures to defend their networks from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.
Countering Cyber Sabotage: Introducing Consequence-Driven, Cyber-Informed Engineering, was written by Andy Bochman and Sarah Freeman. It details INL’s approach to securing critical infrastructure systems like the electric power grid, oil and natural gas refineries, and water treatment facilities. The authors said that much of the technology responsible for controlling operations at many public utilities is decades-old and lacks modern defense capabilities. This makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks ranging from ransomware threats to significant service disruptions.
INL developed a think-like-the-adversary cybersecurity approach called Consequence-driven Cyber-informed Engineering (CCE). The method acknowledges the fragility of internet-connected technology and services. Instead of relying on traditional protection strategies like intrusion detection software or additional firewalls, INL’s cybersecurity approach uses engineering design principles to prevent top-tier cyberattackers from damaging or disrupting utilities’ most essential operations.
INL developed the CCE method over the last decade in consultation with leading government, industry and academic researchers. Beginning in 2018, Congress and the Department of Energy Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response provided INL with $20 million in funding to further develop the method. Additional support has come from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense.
XL Fleet Corp. entered into a partnership with Curbtender, a provider of Under CDL refuse trucks, to jointly develop a series of battery electric (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) commercial trucks for use in waste management.
The companies said they plan to develop and launch within the next year a battery electric refuse vehicle equipped with an XL Electric propulsion system and a Curbtender Quantum rear loader refuse truck body. The agreement also includes joint development of plug-in hybrid electric versions of the vehicle, as well as a range of Class 3 – Class 8 vehicle solutions for the waste management industry.
In late January, Romeo Power and Republic Services entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement to develop Romeo Power’s battery technology for use in Republic’s electric garbage trucks.
The companies said that a single refuse truck travels roughly 25,000 miles annually and that the segment contributes around 1.4% of the transportation industry’s overall fuel consumption. That makes them an attractive application for electrification as well as a “high-impact opportunity” to drive decarbonization within the commercial sector.
XL Fleet provides vehicle electrification for commercial and municipal fleets in North America, including Coca-Cola, Verizon, and the city of Boston.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/04/solar-companies-pledge-to-oppose-forced-labor-in-the-supply-chain/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021",Solar companies pledge to oppose forced labor in the supply chain,"Some 175 solar companies, including some of the top solar manufacturers in the world, signed a pledge opposing forced labor in the solar supply chain.
By signing the pledge, companies are stating their commitment to help prevent what they said were “abhorrent practices” and ensure that the products they are using do not have links to forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China, or anywhere else in the world.
The pledge is part of an industry-wide effort led by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) that supports the development of a supply chain traceability protocol and an update to SEIA’s Solar Commitment, which defines common practices and expectations for the solar industry.

John Smirnow, vice president of market strategy for SEIA, said, “Forced labor will not be tolerated in our industry.”
He said that given reports of labor abuses in Xinjiang and the inability to conduct independent audits there, solar companies “should immediately move their supply chains out of the region.”
He said SEIA has called for this for several months and expects that “most of the major suppliers” should be out by June 2021, at the latest. He said the industry organization “will continue to work with lawmakers, customs officials, the Biden administration, and our international partners to make sure solar imports are proven to be free of forced labor.”
The pledge remains open for signatures, and all companies and organizations operating in the solar industry can join SEIA’s effort. SEIA said it will continue to expand its coalition and build on this important work over the next several months.
ENGIE North America signed the pledge, and its chief renewables officer, Laura Beane, said the company rejects “all forms of forced, compulsory, or child labor.” She said the company prequalifies all suppliers, including performing detailed due diligence on key suppliers to validate they satisfy the company’s code of conduct.
Zaid Ashai, CEO of Nexamp, said that solar’s growth “cannot come at the expense of global human rights.” He said that Nexamp is “fully committed to doing everything we can to identify and evaluate the origins of the materials we use.”
Ashai said the company pays particular attention to avoiding materials that can be tied to the Xinjiang region of China, where issues of forced labor have been identified.
