On Wednesday, top-grade polysilicon saw a nearly 2% rise in prices, according to the China Silicon Industry Association (CSIA).
After a decade of price declines, polysilicon is now at its highest price since 2011. The material’s cost to purchasers has risen for six straight weeks. In January 2021, one kilogram of Chinese polysilicon would fetch about $13. Now, prices exceed $43/kg.
The industry is in a sharp supply shortage as a major manufacturer in Xinjiang closed unexpectedly for repairs. The Xinjiang region in western China is home to nearly 50% of the world’s supply of polysilicon, and it is currently under scrutiny for credible allegations of forced labor.
CSIA said it expects polysilicon supply to drop roughly 5% in July compared to June. Bloomberg said prices are expected to continue to rise through the month until newly added factories displace the loss in production from sudden shutdowns. A rise in COVID-19 cases in China is causing shutdowns in the country, possibly further exacerbating the supply shortage in the near-term.
The Uyghur Force Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) was passed this year to ensure that United States imports do not have connection to forced labor practices in the Xinjiang region. Last week, a large shipment of quartzite, an element used in making polysilicon, was detained by US Customs and Border Patrol. Analyst firm ROTH Capital Partners noted there is belief that product from both JinkoSolar and Trina Solar were seized by Customs, indicating the risk to the solar supply chain under the act may be higher than previously expected.
The UFLPA assumes a rebuttable presumption on goods shipped from the region, placing a heavy burden of proof on importers to show that there is no connection to forced labor. At the time of the House passing the UFLPA, U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh said, “The world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/06/entergy-seeks-to-grow-renewables-up-to-2500-over-next-decade/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARKANSAS,LOUISIANA,MISSISSIPPI",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 6, 2022",Entergy seeks to grow renewables up to 2500% over next decade,"Over the last several months, the utility company Entergy has launched a collection of requests for proposals (RFP) for renewable electricity in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi totaling 3 GW of capacity. Furthermore, according to Entergy’s 2022 Investor Presentation, there’s a chance for 14 to 17 GWac of renewables by 2031.
The RFPs, which span three states, are seeking 500 MW, 1.5 GW, and 1 GW of capacity for Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, respectively. These 2022 RFPs represent three times the utility’s 2021 RFPs for the three states, which recently totaled 1.5 GW of capacity.

The Mississippi and Arkansas RFP’s launched in February and April, respectively, while Louisiana’s RFP opens for registration on July 11th. The Mississippi and Arkansas RFP websites are light on details, but the Arkansas website has made more substantial documentation available.
The future volume – found in the 2022 Investor’s Presentation – is 21 to 25 times greater than the capacity which is currently in service, and 11 to 13 times greater than the renewable capacity that is currently in progress or announced.

The company notes that they plan to refine their business activities to ‘increase competitiveness’ while developing solar projects. The company’s project development changes include getting involved in early-stage acquisition, buying and holding land, optimizing grid locations and design standards, and procuring their own solar modules.
The company seeks 50% of the projects via a standard power purchase agreement (PPA), and 50% to be BOT (built by third parties, and later transferred and owned by the utility). The PPA terms allowed are 10 to 20 years, with a preference for 15 years or less. All solar projects must be at least 50 MWac in capacity.
Energy storage was mentioned in the investor presentation, however, it did not mention suggested capacities. The RFP suggests that any energy storage included in proposals should provide four hours relative to the power output, and be DC coupled. However, there was also a hydrogen facility announced; the 2.43 GW Orange County Advanced Power Station.

 
The hydrogen-capable facility is expected to turn on in 2026, and use a mix of fossil gas and 30% hydrogen. It is eventually expected to move toward burning 100% hydrogen. There is no reference to the source of electricity which will be generating the hydrogen.

The deal was secured by the City of Maryville, Tennessee, where DENSO has manufacturing operations, which announced at its July 5 meeting that it approved three contracts between the City of Maryville Electric Department and Silicon Ranch for a total of 10.5 MW of solar energy under TVA’s Generation Flexibility program, a portion of which will serve DENSO’s local operations.
TVA’s Flexibility Program, launched in 2019, allows member utilities the flexibility to meet 5% of their power needs through local generating sources, like wind, solar, and natural gas, as long as they have a 20-year long term partnership agreement in place with TVA.
“TVA’s Generation Flexibility program offered us the right vehicle to serve the needs of Maryville’s largest employer while attracting significant capital investment to our community,” said City of Maryville Public Utilities Director Baron Swafford. “This cooperative effort is reflective of the goals of City leadership to support and assist our customers in successfully achieving their objectives.”
Green Invest
In addition to its role in the three solar projects under TVA’s Generation Flexibility program, DENSO will also participate in TVA’s Green Invest program through a fourth Silicon Ranch facility. According to DENSO, Silicon Ranch will fund, construct, own, operate, and maintain each of the four solar power plants for the long-term.
TVA’s Green Invest program is a platform for businesses that have set specific renewable generation and carbon reduction goals to be matched with local renewable energy projects that help to meet those goals. Through a lowest-cost competitive bidding program, TVA negotiates project terms on behalf of the customer.
While TVA has not been the most solar-friendly entity historically, it has found success with its Green Invest program. TVA has increased its contracted solar capacity by 60% since October 2020, with the Green Invest program. The energy provider’s 2020 Request for Proposals for solar capacity resulting in the addition of 964 MW of contracted solar and 130 MW of battery storage to the TVA system.
TVA plans to have more than 2 GW of solar operating by the end of 2023, expanding that figure to 7 to 10 GW of solar energy by 2040.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/06/a-zinc-based-alternative-to-lithium-ion-batteries/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,PROCUREMENT,CANADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 6, 2022",A zinc-based alternative to lithium-ion batteries,"Lithium-ion batteries dominate the market for electric vehicles and home energy storage due to lower cost, higher performance, and lower weight compared some alternatives, but the main challenges are safety and sourcing of materials. The safety risk of lithium ion is thermal instability, a condition that can lead to a thermal runaway.
Over the past several years lithium-ion batteries have been known to explode in laptops, cell phones, and to cause fires in large energy-storage facilities. Sourcing of the battery materials, which include lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite, is also a challenge as the materials often come from conflict-prone areas like the Congo. These challenges have led some manufacturers to seek alternatives. pv magazine USA spoke with Ryan Brown, CEO and co-founder of Salient Energy, a manufacturer of zinc-ion batteries, and he explained that Salient’s mission is to develop a battery that mimics the performance of lithium-ion while using abundant materials that come from conflict-free areas, and that do not pose a safety risk.

Brown acknowledged that lithium-ion is the best at energy for the weight and that manufacturers have done well to reduce cost, but safety remains an issue. He said, for example, recent fires in Tesla vehicles are caused by thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. “When used in home energy systems, safety is also a top priority,” Brown said.
Zinc-ion batteries are a non-flammable option, due to their water-based chemistry, Brown noted. He said that the zinc-ion energy storage systems have the same power, performance, and footprint as lithium-ion systems, “so they are a true alternative to lithium-ion.”
One advantage to zinc-based batteries is that they can be manufactured on the same lines as lithium-ion, which keeps manufacturing costs low. As far as safety goes, “safety is the killer advantage,” said Brown. “What we’ve done is we’ve made a zinc battery that works the same way lithium ion works. We have zinc reacting on both sides, so we don’t have to store the reactant in electrolyte.”
Target market
The main application market that Salient is targeting is stationary energy storage. “Residential yes, but ultimately we want to be in the shipping containers.” With the main advantage being safety, Brown sees the zinc-ion battery as a viable alternative for batteries that need to be placed indoors, such as in apartment buildings. “A city is not place to put energy storage outdoors, and with California mandating that apartments must have energy storage, zinc-ion is a safe solution.”
To demonstrate the safety of zinc-ion batteries as a residential energy storage solution, Salient Energy is partnering with Horton World Solutions (HWS) a sustainable homebuilder that is installing the batteries in 200K homes that it is constructing in the Dallas Fort Worth area as well as across the Sunbelt. Construction on these homes will be underway by Q4 of 2022.
Domestic supply chain
Salient’s batteries are made up of a zinc, a pH-neutral zinc sulphate electrolyte, and a manganese oxide-based cathode, all of which are abundant are mined and processed in North America, allowing Salient to source materials from a domestic supply chain. While Salient is based in Nova Scotia, in early 2022 the company opened an office in Oakland, Calif. A team of 7 engineers based in Oakland are currently focused on developing and improving Salient’s residential battery systems, the same system used in the HWS demonstration.
For now, Salient is manufacturing batteries at its Dartmouth, Nova Scotia facility at a small scale of around 100 batteries per month, but the company is in the process of ramping up production at this facility to the pilot scale (1000s of batteries per month) to support pilot projects in the residential space.
