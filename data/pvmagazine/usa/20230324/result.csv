The results indicate that this cell model provides 504 Wh per kg and 1321 Wh per L at 25 degrees C.
Amprius said the silicon anode cell is roughly half the weight and volume of leading conventional commercially available lithium-ion cells.
The cells have applications in the fast-growing electric aviation space and could later be integrated with electric vehicles. Together, electric aviation and light-duty EV battery demand is estimated to exceed over $100 billion globally by 2025, said the company.
The Amprius cells offer a run time of 200% compared to leading graphite battery cells, while being lighter and smaller than other batteries with the same energy content.
“This latest validation continues Amprius’ track record of producing the world’s most powerful battery cells and sets an industry benchmark for next-generation battery technology that will ultimately revolutionize how high we fly, how far we travel and how long we can use our devices,” said Jon Bornstein, president of Amprius Labs.
Customers can adjust specifications on the battery cell platform to meet their project’s engineering needs. The customizable platform allows customers to select the option to either increase energy content in a battery pack without increasing weight, reduce weight in applications that target a fixed energy content, or a combinations of the two. Higher energy is important for longer run times, range and endurance, while lighter packs increase energy efficiency.
The battery cells are planned to be integrated with the AALTO Zephyr, a high-altitude platform station (HAPS). The solar-electric telecommunications aircraft offers persistent earth observation with 18cm ground sampling distance, near-real-time video and imagery from the stratosphere, day and night.
“We look forward to taking advantage of Amprius’ 500 Wh/kg cell to further develop Zephyr’s unrivalled stratospheric endurance capabilities,” said Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technical officer at AALTO HAPS, an Airbus subsidiary. “Amprius is a valued current supplier with a great track-record, and we are confident that its battery will deliver the capability we need.”
Amprius operates a research and development laboratory in Fremont, California. It recently signed a letter of intent for a 774,000 square foot facility in Brighton, Colorado that would provide up to 5 GWh of manufacturing capacity.
The Department of Energy (DOE) targets improvements in battery performance to stabilize the critical materials supply chain and offer attractive products to vehicle buyers. “While a number of electric drive vehicles are available on the market, further improvements in batteries could make them more affordable and convenient to consumers,” according to the DOE.
The DOE funds advanced battery development, systems analysis, and testing in pursuit of these goals. Read more about DOE’s involvement with batteries here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/24/solsmart-program-sets-goal-to-designate-1000-leading-solar-communities/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 24, 2023","SolSmart technical assistance program targets 1,000 leading solar communities by 2027","In support of the Biden administration’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2035, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) set a goal to recognize 1,000 communities as solar leaders that are taking steps to reduce barriers to solar energy access.
Launched in 2016, the SolSmart program offers expert technical assistance at no cost to help local governments adopt nationally recognized best practices to advance solar energy adoption. The goal is to help municipalities save time and money by reducing the soft costs of solar adoption, which span five criteria categories: permitting and inspection, planning and zoning, government operations, community engagement, and market development. In June, the DOE announced that 60 more towns had achieved SolSmart designation.
The expanded SolSmart program adds a new platinum-level designation for the most forward-looking communities. Nearly 500 local governments in 43 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Island have achieved SolSmart designation at one of three current levels (gold, silver, or bronze). These local governments are in 43 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The new platinum level requires a local government to earn a total of 350 points across five categories and complete certain prerequisites, including offering an instant online permitting tool for rooftop solar, such as the SolarAPP+ platform developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The government must implement partnerships and programs designed to enable the benefits of solar energy to be shared by all members of their community.
The enhanced SolSmart program also now establishes priorities around support for disadvantaged communities. A cornerstone of the program is to further the goals of the federal Justice40 initiative to provide equitable opportunities for underserved communities. The Justice40 Initiative supports programs that improve clean transit and workforce development, while also investing in programs that make clean energy more affordable and accessible and strengthen resilience to climate change. Generally these communities have a higher household energy burden, suffer the effects environmental and climate impacts, and have socio-economic vulnerabilities. Of the 500 new designees, at least 40% will be in underserved communities.
“Local governments across the country are looking to solar power to cut energy costs and transform their energy futures,” said Alejandro Moreno, acting assistant secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. “This is why the SolSmart program is so important. It reduces barriers to solar energy by giving communities the tools to equitably deploy solar and enjoy the many benefits including household savings, job creation, resilience, and more.”
The program has also extended its designation criteria to include solar-plus-storage, codes and standards, innovative financing, and data collection and metrics.
SolSmart’s updated and expanded designation criteria address new areas, such as:
SolSmart is led by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and the International City/County Management Association (ICMA), along with numerous other partner organizations with expertise in solar energy and local government. Funded by the DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), this team helps local governments and regional organizations implement national best practices that reduce local barriers to solar energy development.
The program invites all cities, towns, counties, and regional organizations in the U.S. to contact the program to begin receiving no-cost technical assistance to achieve designation. For those communities that are already SolSmart-designated, the program invites them to “level up” to designation as silver, gold, or platinum.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/24/renewables-generation-predictability-can-improve-profitability/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 24, 2023",Renewables generation predictability can improve profitability,"A difficult challenge in the renewable energy sector is the ability of operators to reliably predict the amount of power generated.
A study by researchers at the University of Adelaide, Australia looked to quantify the effect of predictability on the profitability of renewable assets. It found that low predictability can reduce up to 10% of a solar facility’s revenue. The findings were published in Patterns. 
Owners of solar and wind assets often sell their energy to the market ahead of time, before it is generated, however there are sizeable penalties for underperformance. Renewable plant operators bid conservatively, below their actual prediction, to dodge the imbalance penalties, which results in green and cheap energy spillage or curtailment. This can add up to millions of dollars in lost revenue each year. 
Even in a real-time market where participants can bid only a few minutes to hours before every dispatch interval, prediction errors of renewable generation can lead to significant financial penalties. 
“Peaks and troughs are the reality of this form of power generation, however using predictability of energy generation as part of the decision to locate a solar or wind farm means that we can minimize supply fluctuations and better plan for them,” said Sahand Karimi-Arpanahi, a PhD candidate at the university. 
The data showed that optimal location for project siting changed when the predictability of generation was considered. Potential revenues at sites were increased when more predictable locations were selected. The researchers offered a case study in Australia as an example. 
The predictability of solar energy generation is the lowest in South Australia (SA) each year from August to October while it is highest in New South Wales (NSW) during the same period, said the researchers. Four studied renewable plants in SA lost more than 20% of their energy market revenue in 2020 due to Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) charges related to the difference between the actual production level of renewable plants and their commitments. 
In the event of interconnection between the two states, the more predictable power from NSW could be used to manage the higher uncertainties in the SA power grid during that time, making for a more profitable operation of renewable assets.
“The average predictability of renewable generation in each state can also inform power system operators and market participants in determining the time frame for the annual maintenance of their assets, ensuring the availability of enough reserve requirements when renewable resources have lower predictability,” said Dr. Pourmousavi Kani, a participant in the research. 
As most conventional power plants are expected to retire in the next few years in Australia, the market rules have been changing to ensure reliable grid operation. Such changes mean that if renewable plants’ output is not predictable, they must hold sufficient additional capacity to respond to the unpredictable generation changes and meet their forecasts. While the U.S. trails Australia in terms of renewable energy generation share, the study shows the importance of including predictability in calculating the value of renewables increases as renewable market penetration grows.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/24/argonne-and-stellantis-launch-ev-workforce-training-program-and-competition/,"BATTERY,EMPLOYMENT,EV,MARKETS,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 24, 2023",Argonne and Stellantis launch EV workforce training program and competition,"To supercharge the U.S. electric vehicle market, the Department of Energy (DOE) and automaker Stellantis joined forces to launch the Battery Workforce Challenge, a three-year collegiate engineering competition with vocational training and youth education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs.
The DOE has set a bold target to address climate change and put the U.S. on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide by 2050. Key to this goal are the design and development of advanced batteries to electrify the transportation and energy sectors and a skilled workforce for positions within the electric vehicle production, EV charging and battery markets.
Managed by the Argonne National Laboratory and co-sponsored by Stellantis, the government to industry partnership is aimed at building the next generation of automotive engineers, technicians and workers to address the unprecedented demand for domestic EVs and batteries.
“American leadership in the global battery supply chain will be based not only on our innovation, but also on our skilled workforce of engineers, designers, scientists, production workers, and technicians,” said Michael Berube, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Sustainable Transportation and Fuels at the DOE. “This comprehensive workforce program will build an educational ecosystem delivering training and education for high school graduates, and vocational and transitional workers, fostering a diverse talent pipeline of trained engineers, workers and technicians who can charge North America’s battery industry forward.”
For more information or to enroll in the Battery Workforce Challenge, click here.
Kicking off in fall 2023, the Battery Workforce Challenge includes a battery design and development student competition in which universities and trade schools can design, build, test and integrate an advanced EV battery into a future Stellantis model EV. Stellantis is the name of the rebranded automaker company formed by the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group, while its vehicle brands include Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroen, Fiat, Jeep, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot and Ram, among others.
Teams will follow industry milestones focused on battery design, simulation, controls, testing, and vehicle integration and demonstration. Participants will also learn project management, communications, teamwork and problem-solving skills that will provide experience and ready them for future careers.
Each year, winning teams will share awards across engineering and sponsor-related categories, as well as about $100,000 in industry-provided prize money. However, the most highly valued prize may be employment and collaboration and networking opportunities with sponsors related to Stellantis or other companies, according to the platform’s website.
The Battery Workforce Challenge Year One milestones are as follows:
Schools located in the continental U.S. that are accredited by the Accreditation board for Engineering Technology (ABET) are eligible to apply. In addition, Canadian schools that are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEBA) are also eligible to apply.
Additional workforce and education initiatives will complement the challenge, including a national Career-Connected Learning Management System to provide accessible and equitable training for learners across the education pipeline, as well as high school graduates and transitional workers, to connect participants to top jobs from the nation’s leading automotive and battery employers.
“We’re excited to welcome 11 teams to participate in the Battery Workforce Challenge, which is a great opportunity for college and vocational students to experience high-impact collaborations,” said Paul Kearns, director at Argonne. “We are pleased to manage this competition which supports both advanced battery innovations and the development of the next generation of battery researchers and professionals.”
The Inflation Reduction Act amended the Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit (IRC 30D), now known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, and added a new requirement for final EV assembly in North America that took effect on August 17, 2022, according to the DOE.
For new fully electric, fuel cell electric, and plug-in hybrid EVs acquired, delivered or placed in service after August 16, 2022, the final assembly requirement applies. For vehicles placed in service after January 1, 2023, the Clean Vehicle Credit provisions are subject to updated guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of the Treasury.
Under the IRA, the light-duty electric vehicle (EV) tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle has been extended through 2032, which will allow millions of Americans to utilize this credit and switch to an EV. The previous credit, with a cap of 200,000 vehicles per automaker, had already ended for Tesla and General Motors and would have also ended for a few other automakers, reports the Electrification Coalition. However, other modifications, including an MSRP cap, income cap, assembly/sourcing requirements, and options to transfer the EV tax credit to a dealer at the point of sale, have been added under the IRA legislation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/24/assessing-the-area-intensity-of-pv/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESEARCH,WORLD",,"MARCH 24, 2023",Assessing the area intensity of PV,"From pv magazine global
The area of solar panel per person needed to provide all required energy is simply estimated. Typically, developed countries such as the United States, Australia and Singapore consume about 10 MWh of electricity per person per annum. This will need to double to accommodate the electrification of transport, heating, and industry. Assuming 22% efficient panels and a DC capacity factor of 17% (averaged across rooftop solar and solar farms), we arrive at a figure of 13 kW per person occupying 60 m2.
The global population is 8 billion, and thus 0.5 million square kilometers of solar panels are required for an affluent, energy-intensive world that is fully decarbonized using only photovoltaics. For perspective, this is 1% of the area devoted to agriculture (50 million km2). Regions with lower per capita energy consumption, and those with substantial wind or hydro resources, will need much smaller areas of solar panel per person.
Solar panels can be mounted on rooftops, at solar farms in conjunction with agriculture (agrivoltaics), in arid areas, on inland lakes (floating PV), and on calm maritime waters. Agrivoltaics and floating PV are growing rapidly, but from a much smaller base than more traditional rooftop or ground-mounted PV.
Agrivoltaics in combination with pasturing costs nearly the same as conventional ground-mounted PV, except that the panel rows might be more widely spaced. The farmer benefits from lease fees and the livestock benefit from shade from the panels. The solar farm company benefits from free grass control. Agrivoltaics in conjunction with cropping usually requires taller panel supports and other adaptations, which add to the cost.
The cost of floating PV is around 20% higher than that of rooftop solar, but can be similar to that of tracking, ground-mounted PV with bifacial modules. This augurs well for rapid future growth. Although the cost of floating PV is currently higher than roof and ground mounted PV, it has large potential in countries with high population density. Many countries have substantial inland reservoirs that can host large solar farms.
The potential for maritime floating PV is enormous. Indonesia’s calm, tropical inland sea has 0.7 million km2 of seascape that never has wind and waves larger than 15 m/sec and 4 m height respectively, which is sufficient for all the solar energy an affluent and fully decarbonized world will need.
The world has 1.3 TW of hydroelectricity capacity, which will be passed by global solar capacity during 2023. This comprises a mixture of run-of-river systems with small reservoirs and large storage reservoirs. Covering 100% of a hydroelectric storage lake with solar panels will typically yield much larger power capacity and annual energy than the hydroelectric system.
One of the largest hydropower plants in the world is Itaipu in Brazil, with a flooded area of 1350 km2 and an installed capacity of 14 GW. The 50-years old plant was part of the country’s foreign debt for many decades (US$63 billion – last instalment paid recently!). Due to water constraints and eutrophication, only 66 TWh of electricity was generated in 2021 (compared to a record 103 TWh in 2016). If the Itaipu lake were completely covered with PV modules, the installed capacity of this giant PV power plant would be 270 GW (nearly 20 times Itaipu’s installed capacity), and it would generate some 350 TWh of electricity per year (more than five times Itaipu’s 2021 production), accounting for over 70% of the Brazilian annual electricity consumption.
It took 10 years to build Itaipu, and another 10 years to bring it to full capacity. Fifty years after the Treaty of Itaipu was initially signed, it is the country’s largest “battery,” and solar PV on rooftops and on the ground benefit tremendously from this large baseload modulator. Brazil allowed solar PV to be connected to the grid only in 2012, and 10 years later reached an installed capacity nearly twice that of Itaipu (18 GW of rooftop PV and 8 GW of large-scale, ground-mounted PV as of February 2023).
Rooftop solar
Rooftop PV is the fastest growing segment of the global energy market. Rooftop PV is behind the energy meter and competes with retail electricity tariffs, which are typically much higher than wholesale tariffs. Households and companies provide the funding and assume the risk, which avoids the need for public debt.
In Australia, about one third of residential dwellings have rooftop PV. Continued rapid growth in rooftop PV is expected because most houses and commercial buildings will eventually install PV systems. An important trend is the repowering of earlier systems: houses upgrading PV systems from 2 kW to 4 kW to 8 kW to 15 kW each. Large-scale home storage to increase self-consumption is available in the form of electric vehicle batteries, home batteries and hot water storage tanks. Australia’s electricity grid remains highly stable despite dire predictions from a decade ago.
High photovoltaic conversion efficiency is key both to reducing prices and reducing land use. Efficiency has improved around fourfold since the 1950s. The first practical Si solar cell was presented in 1954, with an area of about 3 cm2. It was around 6% efficient (60 Wp/m2 at STC) and cost US$286/Wp, more than a thousand times the current price of large-area Si solar modules.
Nearly 70 years later, individual best-of-kind Si solar cells approach 27% efficiency, and commercially available Si solar photovoltaic modules are close to 24% efficient (240 Watts per m2). Commercial Si modules might reach 26% in 2030. Tandem cells have higher efficiency potential than Si cells. However, there are formidable technical and commercial obstacles, including unstable device efficiency. If these can be overcome, then 30% efficient tandem cells may become available. The required area of solar panel for a fully decarbonized energy intensive economy would drop from 60 m2 to 45 m2 per person.
Electricity demand in developing countries is much lower than in developed countries (Bolivia, Brazil, and Chile respectively 1.6, 2.5 and 4.1 MWh per capita per year). For many reasons, it is debatable whether and when energy consumption will reach the level of more affluent countries. Important drivers of future clean energy consumption include private vehicles, electrification of industrial heating, production of hydrogen atoms for the metals and chemical industry, and production of synthetic aviation fuels. Solar PV can be the energy source for all of this, and there are no area constraints in most countries.

The company reports that it will invest approximately $5.5 billion to construct a battery manufacturing complex in Queen Creek, Ariz., where it will make cylindrical batteries for electric vehicles (EV) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) pouch-type batteries for energy storage systems (ESS).
A year ago LG Energy Solution announced it was investing approximately $1.4 billion to construct a factory to manufacture cylindrical batteries, with mass production slated for the second half of 2024. Now the company says its investment will be more than four times the amount the company initially announced.
Out of the $5.5 billion, LG Energy Solution plans to invest $3.2 billion in building a cylindrical battery manufacturing facility with a capacity of 27 GWh. Cylindrical batteries are used by EV manufacturers as well as electric tool companies in North America. The rest of the investment ($2.3 billion) will go into construction of the second facility where LFP pouch-type batteries will be produced, with an expected capacity of 16 GWh.
The company plans to break ground on both facilities this year, and expects mass production of 2,170 cylindrical battery cells in 2025. These batteries will primarily serve U.S. EV manufacturers who are seeking made-in-the-USA batteries in order to take advantage of the tax credits offered by the Inflation Reduction Act.
The LFP pouch-type batteries will be sold to ESS manufacturers, and LG Energy Solution claims that this will be the first ESS-exclusive battery production facility in the world. The company expects to begin production of the LFP pouch batteries in 2026.

“Our decision to invest in Arizona demonstrates our strategic initiative to continue expanding our global production network, which is already the largest in the world, to further advance our innovative and top-quality products in scale and with speed,” said Youngsoo Kwon, chief executive officer of LG Energy Solution. “We believe it’s the right move at the right time in order to empower clean energy transition in the U.S.”
The new Arizona facilities will use state-of-the-art smart factory technologies that the company says carries out all decision making on machine-produced data. The smart factories are expected to enhance product quality and help the company to increase yield to better respond to the rising battery demands in the region.
LG Energy Solution was formed in 2020 after being spun off from LG Chem, and it debuted on the Korea Exchange (KRX) in January 2022. In 2017 LG Chem was the first international player to enter the U.S. residential battery market, and now, as LG Energy Systems, focuses the burgeoning U.S. battery market for electric vehicles and energy storage systems. In January, LG Energy Systems announced that it will pursue 25% to 30% increase in the annual consolidated revenue in 2023, and plans to double its capex over the previous year; however, there is currently no indication as to whether those plans will change with this new, increased investment in U.S. manufacturing.

The Redwood City, Calif.-based company is seeking to raise just over $100 million in loans to support the development of the company’s U.S. solar window manufacturing facility, while creating hundreds of jobs in the process, a company spokeswoman told pv magazine USA.
The Title XVII loan program provides capital support for decarbonization technologies nearing commercialization. To date the DOE reports that its Loan Programs Office has provided more than $25 billion in loan guarantees and currently has approximately $62 billion in available funds to accelerate the energy transition.
“This opportunity will allow us to accelerate the commercialization of our innovative transparent solar technology and bring it to market faster,” said Susan Stone, chief executive officer of Ubiquitous. “We look forward to working with the DOE to continue driving the transition to a clean energy economy
According to Architecture 2030, with commercial buildings generating 40% of global CO2 emissions per year and the global building floor area expected to double by 2060 based on urbanization trends, there is an urgent need for zero-emissions energy sources across new buildings. Architecture 2030 is a non-profit organization whose mission is to transform the built environment into a “central solution to the climate crisis”.
Meanwhile, financial incentives and job creation opportunities enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act further enhance the DOE’s investment in commercially viable renewable energy solutions.
Ubiquitous Energy said its technology is the only patented transparent photovoltaic glass coating that produces energy, while retaining the same look as a traditional window.

In August 2022, Ubiquitous Energy partnered with one of the largest window manufacturers, Anderson Corporation, to jointly develop clean energy generating window and door products using Ubiquitous’ UE Energy technology, which generates clean energy through photovoltaic window glass. Anderson also led a January 2022 strategic VC investment in the company as part of a $30 million Series B round closing that also saw participation from ENEOS, Safar Partners, Hostplus, Red Cedar Ventures, and Riverhouse Investments.
Over 20 billion square feet of windows are installed each year, creating an opening for the company to integrate its technology. Over the last year, the company installed transparent solar windows at a Nippon Sheet Glass manufacturing center in Northwood, Ohio, a commercial office building in Boulder, Colorado, and campus buildings at Michigan State University.
Windowed skyscrapers often have to spend a lot on cooling the building as large amounts of light and heat shine through. Solar windows not only provide thermal insulation for a building, but also use the absorbed energy to generate electricity. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that glazed skyscrapers can reduce energy usage and carbon emissions by 40% using PV windows.

Scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which is funded by the US Department of Energy, have created a free web-based tool that estimates the benefits and implementation costs for ground-source heat pump installations in buildings in the United States.
The tool was designed to allow building owners, heat pump system designers, and installers to estimate the efficiency and cost savings of ground-source systems in various buildings across all climate zones throughout the United States.
“You can change building characteristics, ground properties, and utility rates, and the annual return on investment is updated in real-time based on these inputs,” said ORNL researcher Xiaobing Liu. “This is the only tool available that can automatically simulate and predict the performance of [ground-source heat pump] applications.”
Users are free to use the tool after registering with the platform. It is possible to make a simulation for pre-configured buildings or real-time simulations, in addition to modifying the prices of electricity, water, and natural gas.
According to a dummy simulation by pv magazine for an existing mid-rise apartment in the state of New York, replacing its gas furnace with a ground-source heat pump would cost $87,238 and lead to annual savings of $11,837, with a payback period of seven years.
