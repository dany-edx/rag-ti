The grid scale project marks Ford Motor’s further expansion into on-site energy storage generation following the May 2021 deployment of a battery energy storage system (BESS) to power EV chargers at the Ford Research & Engineering Center in Dearborn, Michigan with an on-site PV generation of 1.1 GWh.  The project represents the third distributed energy project announcement since Ford Motor’s August announcement that it will procure 650 MW of utility solar generation in Michigan from local utility DTE Energy, marking the largest commercial procurement of utility solar.
Ford Motor’s new Ontario standalone BESS project utilizes Convergent’s proprietary AI-based lithium-ion battery technology allowing the automotive manufacturer to lower its energy costs while providing grid resiliency solutions into the local Ontario grid.
Convergent spokesperson Kate Siskel told pv magazine that the energy storage developer has developed 40 MW of BESS projects in Ontario to date. Its project portfolio includes more than 500 MW of storage and solar projects under development.
“With our friends at Ford’s Essex Engine Plant, we’ve proven that our battery energy storage systems can lower commercial and industrial facilities’ utility bills,” said Johannes Rittershausen, Convergent CEO .
According to the Ontario Energy Board, daily peak energy prices have risen to 15.1 cents per kWh today from under 10.5 cents per kWh in 2015.  High energy prices has caused numerous commercial and industrial customers in the province to procure distributed energy resources such as solar and energy storage projects from regional developers.
Two years ago, Ford Motor Company announced its intention to achieve carbon neutrality globally by 2050, with interim targets set. The company will be able to attribute all its electricity supply in Michigan to clean energy. Ford is purchasing carbon-free electricity through DTE’s MIGreenPower program, which, to date, has more than 600 businesses enrolled, along with more than 62,000 residential customers.

These agreements are with five of the top U.S. and global utility-scale solar developers, Erthos reports.
What makes earth mount solar PV unique is that the solar arrays are mounted directly on the earth with no mounts or trackers below. While the design is unusual, the company announced the closing of a $17.5 million Series B funding round in March to scale-up. This follows a $7.4 million Series A in 2019, which launched the company and helped it finalize the earth-mount system architecture. It also funded the development of the autonomous cleaning robot, which drives over the surface of the panels to clean them, which is necessitated by having the solar modules so close to the ground.
While most utility-scale solar installations use single-axis trackers, Erthos said that with the drop in solar module prices, it is more cost-effective to buy additional solar modules to make up for the loss of efficiency from foregoing trackers. The company points to other advantages as well, including increased panel density, which can cut land costs. Visual impact is minimal because the modules sit on the ground. And the company says it can install the modules in about half the time, halving the cost.
Maryland-based Chaberton Energy focuses on community solar and is benefiting from Earth Mount Solar PV’s ability to deliver the desired energy on a fraction of the land compared to other solutions.
“Erthos technology allows us to build projects in specific locations that present challenges in terms of land availability and visibility. We’re excited to collaborate with the Erthos team, and we look forward to the opportunity to deploy this technology at more locations,” says Stefano Ratti, CEO of Chaberton Energy. Erthos and Chaberton Energy have executed two Owner’s Architect Agreements for projects in the mid-Atlantic.
Encore Renewable Energy, which focuses on community-scale renewable energy and energy storage development with headquarters in Vermont, has signed an MOU with Erthos for a noteworthy project in its portfolio.
“As a forward-looking company, our team is always looking to improve the value of our projects with innovative technology,” says Chad Farrell, CEO of Encore Renewable Energy. “Erthos is answering that call for a project of ours, significantly improving project economics with its novel earth-mounted approach,” says Farrell.
Path Company, which has operations across the southern U.S., has agreed to use Earth Mount Solar PV for a community college project in its home state of Mississippi. Erthos offered Path several key benefits, including the lowest first cost for the project, optimal land usage, and access to the knowledge and experience of the Erthos team.
“With Erthos, we are getting a solution adapted to our specific site and project, provided by some of the most experienced professionals in the business,” says Russ Phillips, co-founder of Path Company. “We know our project is in good hands.”
Projects under contract will bring the installed base of Earth Mount Solar PV to 17 MWdc. Additionally, Erthos has signed an MOU for a 107 MWdc project with a yet-to-be-disclosed U.S. developer.
“In this case, the project has very high interconnection costs,” says Jim Tyler, CEO of Erthos. “Erthos offers a clear advantage here because it has two to three times the energy density of a tracker or fixed-tilt system. This makes it ideal for projects with high fixed costs,” says Tyler.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/01/assessing-capabilities-of-residential-solar-storage-systems-amidst-long-duration-outages/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022",Assessing capabilities of residential solar + storage systems amidst long-duration outages,"Amidst the recent destruction caused by Hurricane Ian has emerged a story of resilience from the 100% solar community of Babcock Ranch.  Despite being in the path of the storm, the community retained power through a combination of solar + storage. 
This is not another post-disaster silver lining story but rather a working demonstration of behind-the-meter (BTM) solar + storage during an outage induced by extreme weather conditions. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of certain weather extremes, long-duration power outages will impact more Americans households. Extreme weather events compounded by power outages carry a potentially deadly comorbidity for millions of people.  Recent research published in the Environmental Science & Technology journal points to between 68 and 100% of the urban populations of Atlanta, Detroit, and Phoenix being at elevated risk of heat exhaustion and/or heat stroke if a blackout coincided with a heat wave. 
Residential consumers of BTM solar + storage systems have already begun to internalize this reality into their decision-making in the marketplace. A recent Sunpower survey of more than 1,500 households found that among those actively considering solar, 70% said they plan to include a battery storage system in their initial purchase for additional resilience during outages.  About one-third of those considering solar said they look at high-profile outages as motivation for pursuing backup power sources.  
This effect was seen in the significant uptick of solar + storage in Texas after Winter Storm Uri in February 2021.  The Lawrence Berkeley National Lab’s annual Tracking the Sun report found that solar + storage interconnections increased by more than 3-times in CenterPoint’s service area of Houston, and by about 6-times in Oncor’s service area of Dallas, and Fort Worth in 2021.  Nationally, the rate of residential solar + storage attachment grew to 10%.  
A recent study from Berekeley Lab answers any doubts about the capabilities of residential BTM solar + storage during the type of long-duration outages which are driving adoption. 
The study took a two-pronged approach looking at both synthetic outage events based on standardized assumptions, as well as at 10 historical events to provide more realistic, and possibly more extreme cases. This was possible through a combination of hourly outage data, hourly solar and end-use level load profiles, simulated battery storage dispatch during interruptions, and building stock data.
For the synthetic analysis, simulations were run for every U.S county and month with a base-case assumption of a 3-day outage beginning on the median “net load” day each month, with 100% initial state of charge for the battery, and a PV system sized to generate 100% of each customer’s annual energy consumption. Within the testing, limited critical loads were defined as refrigeration, lighting during evening hours, well pump, and basic plug loads, like a computer and the internet.  Critical loads were defined as limited loads plus heating and cooling-related end-uses. Both 10 kWh and 30 kWh battery storage were tested.
For limited critical loads, a battery with just 10 kWh of storage could fully supply backup power in almost all counties for residential consumers in virtually all U.S. counties any month of the year.  This remained true in most counties even if the PV system was sized to generate only 50% of the annual customer load.
When it came to critical loads, 10 kWh of storage could backup power across 85% of all counties and month on average.  A system with 30 kWh of storage could provide 96% of critical load on average.
The report concludes that the backup of critical loads is heavily lowered in regions where electric heating is common, like the southeast and northwest, and in regions with large cooling loads, like the southwest and southeast. Variance occurred within individual regions as a result of “infiltration” or leakiness of air in the different building stock, along with things like the average square feet, and types of heating and cooling systems.  For example, in Chicago and Boston, 100% of the median winter critical load is served for homes with fossil heat, while about 41 to 43% for homes with electric resistance heat. 
For the historical analysis, Berkeley Lab analyzed 10 events including: the Wildfires in California (2019), Iowa derecho (2020), Texas thunderstorm (2020), Winter storms in Washington state (2019) and Oklahoma (2020), and Hurricanes Harvey (2017), Irma (2017), Florence (2018), Michael (2018), and Isaias (2020).
Within each event, four types of affected counties were tested: urban, rural, vulnerable, and longest interruption.  This analysis used similar assumptions as in the synthetic analysis, with the focus being on critical load backup for residential consumers.  Assuming 30 kWh of storage, the majority of single family homes would be able to maintain critical loads across all events besides Hurricane Harvey, Florence, and Irma. In comparison, 10 kWh of storage provided almost total backup of critical loads for the California wildfires, the winter storms in Washington and Oklahoma, and the thunderstorm in Texas.  There was significant performance variation across the hurricanes because of low solar insolation levels and the length of the events.  For example, Florence had 3 days with almost no solar with outages lasting 6-10 days.
These capabilities for resiliency in extreme outages, among the many other benefits of solar + storage, point to a bright future for the peanut butter and chocolate combination of the energy transition.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/01/mission-solar-announces-1-gw-made-in-usa-solar-panel-manufacturing-expansion/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022",Mission Solar announces 1 GW made-in-USA solar panel manufacturing expansion,"The latest announcement in a rising wave of made-in-USA clean energy manufacturing comes from Mission Solar, which said it will add 1 GW of solar panel manufacturing capacity by 2024. The first wave of buildout will be a 300 MW annual production line that begins expansion in Q4 2022.
Mission Solar has been providing U.S.-made solar modules from its 246,000 square-foot Texas facility for ten years, and it now sets its sights on expansion as the energy transition ramps up in the U.S.
The company’s current offerings span residential, commercial, and utility-scale applications. The company offers a 72-cell, 435 W utility-scale module with 19.8% efficiency. It also has a 66-cell 400 W module for residential and commercial applications with 19.9% efficiency.
OCI Company, Mission Solar’s parent company in Seoul, South Korea will provide the polysilicon for the modules. The company said it prides itself on a quality product comprised of component parts sourced within a careful and conscientious supply chain.
Demand for U.S.-made solar panels are on a sharp rise following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The act includes both project-based and production-based incentives, some of which require minimum amounts of domestic content to qualify for full credit value.
“By 2035, solar installations are expected to quadruple from current levels. At present, four percent of the electricity fed to American energy grids is generated by solar,” said Jae Yang, president and CEO of Mission Solar. “The U.S. aims to have 40 percent of its electricity generated by solar technology by 2035. These are exciting opportunities for us as a company. Additional motivated team members will be needed to help us build a greener future.”
The support of a U.S. supply chain is another key focus of the IRA. Each leg of the module supply chain, plus key balance-of-system components and energy storage are supported by direct tax credits. Some of the provisions in the IRA for manufacturing include:
Module-based incentives include:
Other PV-related manufacturing incentives include:
“For the first time in decades, we have a meaningful policy to support not just using solar energy but making solar products here in the USA. This bill is a major step forward for energy independence and catalyzes the growth of a sustainable, resilient low-carbon solar supply chain by spurring much-needed expansion of domestic solar manufacturing,” said Michael Parr, executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/01/pv-modules-with-longer-lifetimes-could-slash-demand-for-materials/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022",PV modules with longer lifetimes could slash demand for materials,"from pv magazine global
NREL has evaluated the trade-offs between extending PV module lifetimes or ramping up closed-loop recycling for solar panels with shorter lifetimes. It presented its findings in “Circular Economy Priorities for Photovoltaics in the Energy Transition,” which was recently published in PLOS One.
Using the United States as a case study, a group of researchers analyzed 336 scenarios using the in-house PV Circular Economy Tool (PV ICE). They only considered monocrystalline silicon-based modules.
The researchers assessed the impact on new material demand with different module lifetimes, from 15 to 50 years. They also looked at closed-loop recycling, and assumed that the United States will have 1.75 TW of cumulative PV installed capacity by 2050.
The results show that modules with 50-year lifetimes could reduce new material demand by 3% through lower deployment, in comparison with the 35-year baseline scenario. On the other hand, modules with 15-year lifetimes would require an additional 1.2 TW of replacement modules to maintain 1.75 TW of PV capacity by 2050. That would increase new material demand and waste unless over 95% of the module mass was closed-loop recycled, said the researchers.
“This requires 100% collection and a high-yield, high-value recycling processes, which presents a technology and management challenge because no PV technology has achieved this level of closed-loop recycling for all component materials,” they said.
They added that with sustainable PV supply chains, there is a tendency to go straight to recycling as the solution, but there are many other circular options to try first, like lifetime extensions. They concluded that “offsetting new material demand can be accomplished in ways other than recycling, including high-yield, high-efficiency, reliable systems (thereby reducing replacement and total deployment needs,) remanufacturing of components, and circular material sourcing.”

With an impressive façade and two grand stone columns at its entrance, one would not guess that the home was LEED Platinum Certified, built with sustainability, energy efficiency and comfort in mind.
The home was designed  by Square Center LLC Architecture and Design to capture as much of the sun’s energy for heat in the winter and cooling in the summer. Suntuity Solar installed the 31 kW PV solar system made up of 80 LG solar modules with Enphase microinverters attached to its Englert A1500 snap-lock architectural standing seam metal roof system. Nine Tesla Powerwall batteries (7.6 kilowatts each) provide a supplemental power source.

The 80 high-efficiency LG solar modules are attached with the S-5! PVKIT direct-attach rail-less, solar mounting solution.
Challenges
There were numerous challenges on the project, including ongoing supply chain issues and work stoppages due to the pandemic. The roof itself was a challenge. While it does have a standing seam metal roof—the best for solar installations—it has a varying angles, cuts and intricate roof details. Additionally, there were demands about aesthetics, durability, color and finish matching—plus penetration-free attachments were required, so that the roof’s integrity would not be compromised.
The solution
The metal roof, made from 25% recycled material, is LEED and ENERGY STAR compliant. And it is the ideal platform for solar integration because the solar panels can be mounted directly onto the standing seams of the roof using S-5!’s penetration-free PVKIT direct-attach system.

The PVKONCEAL module skirt conceals the lower edge of the modules and all mechanical and electrical components underneath, while keeping critters, debris and other unwanted objects out from under the solar array. While New Jersey isn’t known for huge amounts of snow, the roof also features the complete ColorGard snow retention system for those occasional winter storms. ColorGard is mounted on every one of the roof surfaces to protect the grounds from dangerous melting snow and ice sliding off the roof.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/01/ess-sees-flow-battery-demand-curve-turning-upward/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022",ESS sees flow battery demand curve turning upward,"It might be that long duration energy storage has turned its growth curve upward, and some of us might not have realized it. pv magazine USA sat with Hugh McDermott of Energy Storage Systems Inc (ESS) at RE+ to discuss the company’s technology and future.
The truth is, all the commotion around batteries has mostly been focused on the lithium ion industry, which has announced plans to manufacture greater than 7 TWh/year by 2031. And while it’s true that 90% of this capacity appears to be slated for the auto industry, the stationary energy storage industry has a massively scaled and funded co-conspirator in lithium ion, assisting with the rapid development of the global energy storage market.
However, the market is showing that lithium ion isn’t the only game in town. ESS is now seemingly sold out of its Iron Flow Battery technology, and is working hard to expand by at least 400% by the end of 2023.

When we asked McDermott about the location of the nation’s upcoming long duration markets, he rattled off a list of utility-scale opportunities via Requests for Proposals (RFPs) in Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, and California. If ESS were to close all of these deals, it would saturate their manufacturing capacity.
ESS then reminded us of the projects they have already signed, like their recently announced deal with California’s SMUD, for 200 MW/2,000 MWh of long-duration projects. These projects are still being developed, and are expected to be deployed across five to ten sites and used to increase remote resilience. They will be placed near substations and other strategic distribution points.
The first facility is 4 MW/40 MWh, and is scheduled for deployment in 2023.
McDermott then mentioned ESS’s 2 GWh by 2026 deal with Softbank from 2021, and the conversation shifted to the logistics behind supplying this demand.

Image: ESS Inc.
In the United States, ESS seeks to expand its manufacturing to 25 MW per year by the end of 2022, and to over 100 MW by the end of 2023. The company recently partnered with Australia’s Energy Storage Industries Asia Pacific (ESI) to distribute ESS’ iron flow batteries in Australia, New Zealand and Oceania. ESI will also build a factory in Australia, which is expected to produce 400 MW per year for the country, and begin operations in 2024.
Aspirations of 750 MW per year manufacturing capability was mentioned in an earnings call.
The company sees demand reaching far beyond 1 GW/year of manufacturing capacity. The Long Duration Energy Storage Council released an analysis suggesting that under the right conditions, 1.5-2 TW/85-140 TWh of long duration batteries could be deployed by 2040.
McDermott said ESS sees four megatrends pushing these huge volumes:
As we move through those trends, McDermott says, “once we cross 20 to 25% renewable electricity, balancing becomes more challenging using only 1 to 4 hour batteries. Due to its steepness, the evening ramp as the sun goes down becomes really challenging. We need to go beyond the ramp, into the evening peak period.”
Real life evidence of these future megatrends are appearing outside of ESS as well.

Source: California Energy Commission
California recently approved what might be the largest flow battery in the United States – a 60 MWh vanadium flow facility on Native California land. The battery will be coupled to a behind-the-meter microgrid with a solar carport.
Form Energy, with its 1 MW/150 MWh battery product, has signed two deals: one in Minnesota, and more recently a deal in Georgia that could reach 15 MW/1.5 GWh in size.
Add the Inflation Reduction Act into the mix, and McDermott likens it to “rocket fuel”. The long-duration market might see continued growth in excess of 90% a year, especially since ESS products get a 10% bonus from the domestic content incentive. Of course, that will drive learning curves, price declines, efficiencies, and increased volume.

Looking to its future, ESS’s goals are ambitious, but realistic. One of these goals is to deploy projects within one week of arriving on site. McDermott says ESS, ‘drops it in, plugs it in, fills it with water, and warms it up.’ Another goal is to increase the energy storage capacity of each shipping container by 20%, from 1.25 MWh to 1.5 MWh.
The company says that it will take time to reach these goals. They are going to have to work through supply chain challenges, which have nearly doubled their delivery times. They will need to install and field test their units in more challenging terrains and climates. And of course, they’re going to have to build additional facilities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/01/as-china-expands-energy-storage-manufacturing-the-u-s-can-step-up-to-compete/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022","As China expands energy storage manufacturing, the U.S. can step up to compete","Whether it’s California’s record-breaking heat waves causing narrowly avoided blackouts or Texas’ billion dollar efforts to keep the lights on, the need for resilient stationary energy storage systems throughout the United States has never been more acute. Unfortunately, the deployment of these systems is inhibited by serious issues with the lithium-ion batteries used in these systems. Bottlenecks in the battery supply chain and the increasing occurrence of catastrophic fires are the most serious of these issues. The U.S. can address both by developing a domestic battery supply chain whose products are tailored to the unique needs of the stationary energy storage market. Accomplishing this will enable a rapid transition to reliable electrical grids powered by renewable energy.
EV industry creates fierce competition for batteries
Although electric vehicles account for less than 10% of new cars sold, automakers already purchase over 75% of the world’s lithium batteries. With an ever-increasing number of companies entering the market, the EV industry’s demand for batteries is expected to grow by over 500% by 2030. The world already produces less lithium than these companies need, and these shortages are expected to last throughout the decade.
Securing both high quality batteries and the scarce materials needed to make them has become a top priority for automakers that have bet their future on succeeding in the EV market. Companies like Ford, Tesla, and GM are securing multi-year exclusive supply contracts from miners and battery makers to avoid falling victim to future shortages. Suppliers are eager to sign these contracts since they provide guaranteed revenue for the multi-billion-dollar investments they need to improve their production capacity.
These contracts create serious issues and major risks for energy storage system (ESS) manufacturers, a much less mature market than the EV battery market. Suppliers will always choose years of predictable revenue offered by an agreement with automakers over orders placed by ESS manufacturers, leaving these companies with massive uncertainty in future battery costs, availability, and delivery times. Until recently, the ESS industry has avoided this fierce competition by buying heavier lithium-ion batteries that use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes since automakers preferred lighter versions with metal oxide cathodes. However, nearly all automakers now plan on incorporating LFP into entry level vehicles. This only furthers the fact that the ESS industry needs an alternative supply chain dedicated to its unique needs to support its rapid growth.
Batteries solve safety and supply challenges
The chemistry behind lithium-ion batteries makes them uniquely well suited for applications that require compact and light battery packs. This is why they were first commercialized for personal electronics in the 1990s – no other technologies could match their energy density. Since EVs similarly require light and compact battery packs, lithium-ion has come to dominate this industry as well. Any application that requires portable or mobile battery packs is best served by lithium-ion. But – as its name implies – the stationary energy storage industry does not need mobile batteries, it needs batteries that are safe, affordable, and built with abundant raw materials. The energy storage industry has a unique opportunity to adopt new battery technologies that are too heavy for use in EVs, such as zinc-ion batteries, which are a promising candidate.
Zinc-ion batteries use the same fundamental design as lithium-ion but use zinc-ions instead of lithium-ions to store charge. Zinc is far heavier than lithium, making zinc-ion batteries too heavy for EVs. Otherwise, they offer the same power and service life as lithium-ion, meaning they are just as well suited for energy storage systems. The materials used in zinc-ion batteries are significantly more abundant than those used in lithium-ion, offering ESS manufacturers a solution free from the supply chain shortages previously described. Zinc-ion batteries also use a water-based design that cannot catch fire, which is a significant advantage over lithium-ion batteries. Safety is of critical importance to the ESS industry, especially when these systems are installed in homes and businesses.
New battery chemistries offer the ESS industry a unique opportunity to develop a dedicated supply chain free from competition with automakers. To hit decarbonization targets, this supply chain will need to match or exceed current lithium-ion production by the end of the decade. This will require governments to invest in the development of an energy storage supply chain as aggressively as they have for EVs.
The U.S. can lead the global energy storage battery industry
In 2015, the Chinese prioritized the development of domestic lithium-ion manufacturing. As a result, they now produce 70% of the world’s lithium-ion cells. Western governments are now spending billions of dollars to kickstart their own cell production, but since China accounts for 80% of global cathode material production and 90% of global anode material production, the world’s automakers will be dependent on Chinese supply chain for the foreseeable future.
The United States has a unique opportunity to avoid the same outcome for its energy storage industry by prioritizing the development of a supply chain based on zinc batteries. A robust domestic supply chain for both zinc mining and refining already exists, and it produces far more zinc than the energy storage market would require – the only missing link for a domestic energy storage supply chain is cell production. Fortunately, zinc-ion batteries can be built using the same standard techniques and equipment used to produce lithium-ion cells. The Department of Energy is already investing billions of dollars in cell production for EVs. By investing in the same types of factories to build zinc-ion batteries for energy storage, the U.S. can rapidly establish a complete energy storage supply chain.
Forecasts have shown that the energy storage industry will need as many batteries as the EV industry does to achieve global decarbonization targets. Lithium-ion’s dependence on scarce raw materials means this technology will not be able to fill demand from both markets. The solution? The energy storage industry can adopt new technologies like zinc-ion batteries to avoid competing with automakers for limited battery supply. The United States can pair its existing zinc supply chain with continued investment in cell manufacturing to rapidly develop a domestic energy storage supply chain.

Ryan Brown is the co-founder and CEO of Salient Energy, developing technology, such as zinc-ion batteries, to accelerate the clean energy transition.
