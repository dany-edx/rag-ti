In addition to a strong distributed generation market, New York is one of the epicenters of community solar and last year hit the milestone of 1 GW of cumulative installations. Now that figure has doubled, with Governor Kathy Hochul announcing that more than 2 GW of community solar has been installed in the state, or enough to serve 393,000 homes.
Last April Governor Hochul announced that the State Public Service Commission approved a new framework for New York State to achieve at least 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030, enough to annually power nearly 700,000 average-sized homes. That framework provides a strategy to expand the state’s already successful NY-Sun initiative into one of the largest and most inclusive solar programs of its kind in the nation. Seven months later, the state has 5 GW of distributed solar, with 3.3 GW in development.
The program expansion also focused on bringing the benefits of solar to low- to moderate-income (LMI) New Yorkers, intending to deliver at least 35% of the benefits, with a goal of 40%, from the investments to disadvantaged and LMI communities.
Community solar is an ideal solution for LMI communities as there is no upfront cost to participants, and many customers can lock electricity rates as a hedge against the rising cost of power.
“New York’s two-gigawatt community solar achievement proves our commitment to a building a clean and healthy future,” Governor Hochul said. “Our ongoing investment in community solar generates measurable benefits for our health, our environment, our economy, and for the thousands of New Yorkers who can now enjoy lower electric bills, all thanks to our ability to harness the power of the sun.”
While community solar made up more than half the installations in New York this year, NYSERDA opened a second round of solicitations for the Inclusive Community Solar and Expanded Solar for All programs, which aim to add another 1.14 GW of community solar for LMI households and disadvantaged communities.
Wood Mackenzie Solar Market Insight quarterly report ranked New York as the all-time national leader in installed community solar, as well as number one in 2023 for community solar installations, number two in overall distributed solar and number five for residential solar.
“New York is steadfast in its commitment to achieving our Climate Act goals, and every milestone reached is one step closer to a more reliable, equitable, zero-emissions electric grid,” said Doreen M. Harris, NYSERDA president and CEO. “As the top market in the nation, community solar will continue to be a vital model to deliver clean, low-cost renewable energy to places where rooftop-mounted solar panels aren’t feasible, ensuring more New Yorkers realize the benefits of this renewable resource.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/29/maximize-californias-front-of-the-meter-distributed-solar-advocates-say/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 29, 2023","Consider maximizing California’s front-of-meter distributed solar, advocates say","A California process to evaluate pathways for the state to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2045 has been challenged by six advocacy groups for not yet considering an approach to maximize cost-effective front-of-the-meter distributed generation.
The groups propose an approach they call the “Max DG Pathway,” which would maximize cost-effective solar on the built environment, including warehouses, shopping malls, schools, parking lots, irrigation canals and highway rights-of-way. Several studies have evaluated the technical potential to deploy solar on such sites, they say.
The groups backing the proposal include The Climate Center, Center for Biological Diversity, Local Government Sustainable Energy Coalition, and Vote Solar. They submitted comments to three state agencies that are evaluating pathways to achieve the state’s clean electricity goal.
On sites in the built environment with suitable solar exposure, a “small-to-medium-size” utility-scale solar array could be deployed, probably with co-located storage, the groups say. Each solar array on the built environment would have its own front-of-the-meter (FTM) utility interconnection, even if it is physically located on the premises of an end-use customer.
The sizes of these arrays “would generally be appropriate for distribution-system interconnections,” the groups say. The solar developer could earn revenues through a power-purchase agreement with a load-serving entity, or through some other business model.
Maximizing cost-effective FTM solar and storage, the groups say, could supply a substantial amount of renewable electricity without triggering land-use concerns or other sources of public opposition, while reducing the costs of transmission upgrades and providing valuable local benefits.
Those local benefits include resilience benefits from incorporating FTM solar plus storage as grid-forming resources in community microgrids, the groups say. The resources could be developed under local, municipal or tribal ownership models “that help build community wealth and advance energy justice.”
Modeling
The groups’ key complaint relates to the state’s proposed approach to modeling various pathways to achieve 100% clean electricity. They say the three state agencies have proposed an approach to capacity expansion modeling that “would never construct a Max DG scenario,” and thus could never evaluate such a scenario.
The groups say that the state’s proposed approach would instead consider utility-scale generation as a general category, and then, through a method “yet to be determined,” would assign some share of the resulting utility-scale selection to the FTM distributed generation category. “This will create a bias that under-values and therefore under-selects” FTM distributed generation.
The groups also challenge the state’s proposed approach of including a “feasible” level of FTM distributed generation based in part on current state policies and programs. This is “backwards logic,” they say. “If a particular energy technology is shown to be beneficial and cost-effective, then the policy-maker’s mission is to devise policies to facilitate its deployment.” The groups add that current policies and programs “are not conducive” to FTM distributed generation deployment.
The groups propose that the state develop a “Max DG Pathway” scenario that could be evaluated in comparison with other pathway scenarios.
The three state agencies evaluating pathways to reach the state’s 100% clean electricity goal are the California Energy Commission, California Public Utilities Commission, and California Air Resources Board.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/29/polysilicon-prices-could-hit-all-time-low-by-year-end/,"COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 29, 2023",Polysilicon prices could hit all-time low by year-end,"From pv magazine global
Polysilicon prices could soon reach a new all-time low, according to a new report by Bernreuter Research.
“It might already happen in late December 2023,” polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter told pv magazine. “I definitely expect it for the first half of 2024.”
The report states that the world could reach 2.95 million MT of polysilicon capacity by the end of this year, with just 200,000 MT of this capacity located outside China.
The company said that China-based Tongwei is set to add another 575,000 MT of polysilicon capacity in 2024, surpassing the global polysilicon demand increase of just 200,000 MT. This significant overcapacity is expected to result in the abandonment of numerous projects announced in the last two years and the elimination of up to 2,400,000 MT of capacity.
“This number also includes capacities still under construction,” said Bernreuter.
This new industry shakeout will mostly affect China-based producers, European companies, and new entrants.
“While China’s share in the global polysilicon output will further increase to 90% in 2023, the non-Chinese manufacturers Wacker, OCI, Hemlock Semiconductor and REC Silicon will remain exempt from the shakeout,” the report says. “The reason for that is the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in the United States, which bans products from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwestern China.”
Bernreuter said he also expects global PV demand to grow from 425 GW in 2023 to 1.1 TW in 2027. He claimed that this could lead to a shortage of silicon metal, a raw material in polysilicon production.
“Quartz for silicon metal will run short in the second half of this decade,” he said.
