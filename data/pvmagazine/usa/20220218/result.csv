Sheetz will receive approximately 110 million kilowatt hours of energy per year from the long-term power purchase agreements for the 55MW of Pennsylvania-based solar that Constellation is procuring, with that energy matched by Green-e Energy Certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) sourced from renewable facilities located throughout the U.S.
Constellation is also purchasing the electricity generated by the installations via separate power purchase agreements. All of these projects are expected to achieve commercial operation by January 2024.
To simplify the purchase, Sheetz will use a solution that builds off of the Constellation Offsite Renewables (CORe) retail power product, which enables the development of, and increases businesses’ access to, renewable energy projects by removing the significant hurdles associated with traditional offsite power purchase agreements. By combining the simplified contracting and aggregation process of CORe with the commitment and involvement from sustainability-minded companies, Constellation is able to offer more customers the ability to demonstrate their support of large-scale, offsite renewable energy projects.
“Sheetz is dedicated to being a responsible steward of our environment,” said Travis Sheetz, president and CEO at Sheetz. “Through this purchase agreement and partnership with Constellation, Sheetz will be able to power more than 160 stores and approximately 40 other facilities with renewable energy, significantly reducing our environmental impact in Pennsylvania.”
The 55MW of new projects across Pennsylvania also represent a significant investment in solar, at least when compared to what the state has installed so far. According to the Solar Energy Industries association, Pennsylvania has installed 855MW of solar to date, with the vast majority of that capacity achieving operation since the start of 2020.
The state is projected to add 1,788MW over the next 5 years, which ranks 21st in the nation over that time, but represents a more than 200% increase over the amount of capacity installed thus far.
Those 1,788MW of expected new solar include the capacity from the 127 MW CPV Maple Hill solar installation, which is expected to be one of the largest installations in Pennsylvania. In March 2021, the state’s government executed a 15-year fixed-price supply agreement for seven new solar energy arrays, totaling 191 MW, all of which are being built by Lightsource bp, which also will own and operate the capacity. The move represented one of the largest solar commitments by any state government in the country, and the portfolio is expected to go into operation on Jan. 1, 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/18/program-for-low-income-housing-authority-solar-assistance-finds-success-in-pilot-set-to-expand/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 18, 2022","Program for low-income housing authority solar assistance finds success in pilot, set to expand","Last June, the Massachusetts Solar Technical Assistance Retrofits (STAR) program announced the raising of $10 million in funds to support the development of solar projects on affordable housing units. Launched in January 2021, the nonprofit program offers financial and technical help to community development agencies looking to cut costs through the savings of rooftop solar.
Researching the complex financial and technical aspects of solar projects for numerous multi-unit buildings can be a heavy lift for an already stretched housing agency staff. The program seeks to address this issue by acting as a guiding force through the decision-making process.
In the initial stage, the campaign collected over $40,000 in donations, which were distributed as grants to 15 participating organizations. This allowed the staff to devote time to gathering data for feasibility studies, including utility bills, roof ages, and square footage.
The pilot run of the program has been deemed a success, as Resonant Energy partnered with the Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations (MACDC) and Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) Boston to commit to over 1.2MW of solar projects across 48 affordable housing rooftops. This participation surpassed the program’s pilot goal by 20%.
Thus far, six organizations decided to proceed with solar installations based on the analysis they received through the STAR program. All told, the organizations are expected to save an estimated $1.3 million over the 25-year program. Building the projects on rooftops saved an estimated equivalent of 1,210 acres of land development, said STAR.
“Without the expert assistance and flexible financing options through the STAR program, a shift of this magnitude would have been extremely difficult for us,” said Rafael Mares, Executive Director of The Neighborhood Developers (TND). “The STAR program provided the perfect opportunity for us to transition more than a dozen buildings in our portfolio to using and producing sustainable energy.”
One of the major hurdles in developing solar for housing authorities is the review and consent process with leaders and investors. STAR organizers worked directly with these parties, providing staff time and guidance to streamline the process.
“We launched this program as a pilot to see if we could collaborate to break down the persistent barriers we had been seeing for solar within the affordable housing community,” said Isaac Baker, Co-CEO of Resonant Energy. “Thus far, I have been really impressed with the uptake from the first phase and expect we’ll continue to get participation from that cohort even as we start working with new developers in the next phase.”
The second phase of the program is planned to assist another 15 organizations with grants to perform solar feasibility studies. The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center and the Jampart Charitable Trust will fund the next phase, which should bring the solar commitments from 1.2MW to roughly 3MW. The lifetime benefit of the entire program is expected to surpass $6 million in savings.

US-based start-up mPower Technology, a spin-off of the Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories, has developed a flexible monocrystalline silicon solar module technology, called DragonScales, which it claims can be used for both space and terrestrial applications.
“Our main business is expected to be in the space solar cell segment,” the company’s president and CEO, Kevin Hell , told pv magazine. “But we are also planning to enter the building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) business, as our products could be easily used for residential and commercial projects, and to produce solar modules for soldier portable and shelter power applications.”
The fully encapsulated modules are fabricated with conventional back contact silicon solar cells with a thickness of 150 um or less and are assembled using existing high-volume fabrication processes from the microelectronics industry. “Our pilot line is a conventional machine for the production of semiconductors that has been adapted to the manufacturing of our flexible solar modules,” mPower CTO Murat Okandan stated. “The panels can be customized according to the customers’ needs and adapted to different applications.”
According to the manufacturer, its production equipment can produce very high volumes of modules and allow rapid scaling as needed by the customers and applications for space.
The back-contact solar panels consist of micro-singulated silicon dies that are “hyper-interconnected” in series or in parallel. According to the company, the design allows customization of its “super modules” to any shape, thickness, voltage, size, material stack, and other design considerations to meet application-specific requirements at the lowest cost.
The modules feature efficiencies ranging from 22 to 23% and temperature coefficients spanning from 0.4 to 0.27 percent per degree Celsius, depending on the size or applications. Since the interconnect design is very customizable, it is possible to provide high voltage/low current or other desired array configuration details to fit the desired physical footprint and achieve the highest possible power delivery, the company stated.  This is also claimed to bring in a very high level of innate electrical and mechanical resilience at the system level.
This approach, according to the manufacturer, leverages the massive scale and high power of the terrestrial silicon PV market to minimize cost, while eliminating the challenging, hard-to-scale models of custom cell manufacturing.
“Our products are more expensive than conventional PV panels, but they are three to five times less expensive than III-V modules based on gallium arsenide for applications in space,” Hell further explained. “They are also significantly lighter since they are flexible and thus require less structural materials.”
At the beginning of February, mPower raised $10 million in a Series B financing round. The funds will be used to scale up the company’s manufacturing facility and integration and test facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and to further develop the cell technology.
The production line currently has a capacity of 100 kW and the company plans to expand it to 1.5 MW.  The yearly volume is projected to reach around 50 MW by 2025.

The Union Solar facility will be a 325MW installation set to be constructed on 2,013 acres within a 3,355-acre project area in Washington and York townships, just south of Dayton. The solar farm, which will use tier-one modules on trackers, is expected to begin construction later this year, with construction finishing and operations commencing in 2023.
The project represents an estimated $320M investment that will create more than 300 local jobs at peak construction. It will create an estimated 12 to 14 full-time jobs during operation. Union Solar is one entry included in a portfolio of solar farms being developed in a relationship between ACCIONA and Tenaska.
Union Solar now checks in as the third-largest project to be proposed during the development boom that has hit Ohio in the last two years, just behind Open Road Renewables’ 350MW Harvey Solar Project. The largest project proposed during the boom is the 577 MW Fox Squirrel Solar project, which will occupy approximately 3,444 acres within a 3,766-acre area located in Madison County, west of Columbus. Fox Squirrel Solar is being developed by EDF Renewables and its 577 MW of capacity ties it with OCI’s multisite Alamo project in San Antonio as the 5th-largest American solar project known to pv magazine.
With all of the recently-approved, massive projects, Ohio is beginning to establish itself as one of the hottest markets for utility-scale solar development. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Ohio is expected to install 4,630MW of solar over the next 5 years, which ranks as seventh-most across the country over that period.

Perch Energy is a spinoff, riding in on the waves of its predecessor BlueWave Solar. Perch will build on its proven community solar services and management platform, and said it plans to add talent and resources to expand its direct-to-consumer energy platform. 
Perch has initiated more than 6,300 community solar subscriptions for homes, businesses, and municipalities. The company said it has provided an estimated $9.7 million in savings to date. Perch has a wide set of community solar packages, serving both homeowners, renters, and businesses. The team has over 500MW of contracted experience behind it. 
Perch performs acquisition support, detailed client reporting, customer communications, credit management, customer support and service, and a software management platform to streamline reporting. 
In addition to community solar, Perch’s platform allows customers to connect to other clean energy sources. The company performs continuous market analysis to offer customers a transparent snapshot of all clean energy options available to them locally. Perch said it plans to scale its business to a growing list of US markets. 
Community solar in Massachusetts 
Perch’s home state of Massachusetts was one of the first to offer community solar options in the country. The Green Communities Act of 2008 established the state’s first solar carve-out, part of its renewable portfolio standard. The carve-out targeted an initial 400MW deployment across the state, about 1% of the total electricity use of the state at the time. The 2008 Act also established the state’s virtual net metering policy, allowing customers to receive bill credits for energy generated at offsite community solar facilities.  
The Institute of Local Self-Reliance estimates Massachusetts has 595MW in operating community solar capacity over 386 projects. Top marks go to Minnesota, which has 819MW over 415 projects. New York notably has 643MW over 456 projects, and Colorado ranks after Massachusetts in fourth with 96MW over 81 projects. 
New York is set to be a particularly strong community solar development hub, as Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) efforts led to boosted incentive values for the NY Sun program. The program has been extended and expanded, paving the way for more growth.

REC Silicon reported fourth quarter 2021 revenues of $43.2 million compared to $36.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. The company also reported an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $0.4M compared to a loss $3.7 million in the prior quarter.
Silicon gas sales volumes for the fourth quarter were 750 MT compared to 728 MT during the prior quarter. Total polysilicon sales volumes for the quarter were 481 MT and polysilicon inventories decreased by 168 MT.
REC Silicon reported cash balances of $110.5 million on December 31, 2021 compared to $126.3 million on September 30, 2021.
REC Silicon ASA is a producer of advanced silicon materials, supplying high-purity polysilicon and silicon gases to the solar industry worldwide. It manufactures Granular Polysilicon (NextSi) from Fluid Bed Reactor (FBR) technology for solar applications, and when both are operational, its two US-based plants have a capacity of more than 20,000 MT high-purity polysilicon, the company reports. REC Silicon is headquartered in Fornebu, Norway and listed on the Oslo stock exchange under the ticker: REC.
REC Silicon’s Moses Lake facility in Washington state was shut down in mid-2019 when China imposed steep tariffs on US-made polysilicon, in retaliation for tariffs imposed on Chinese-made solar panels in 2013. In the REC Silicon ASA audiocast Q4 2021 James May, CEO, said that investments by Hanwha in January “improves the company’s liquidity position and is expected to give us the capital necessary to restart the FBR facility in Moses Lake and make targeted investments in and improve our product portfolio in the semiconductor materials segment.”
In November 2021, Hanwha Solutions bought 21.9 million shares in REC Silicon ASA from Aker Horizons in addition to approximately 48.2 million new shares in REC Silicon through a private placement. As a result, Hanwha Solutions and Aker Horizons both own approximately 16.67% in REC Silicon.
“Fourth quarter events clearly demonstrate that REC Silicon’s strategic plan is coming together. REC Silicon financial position has been substantially improved due to Hanwha Solutions’ investment. REC Silicon’s low cost, high quality granular solar grade polysilicon will become a key component in ensuring the success of a PV supply chain in the United States. At the same time, opportunities in silicon anode battery materials are beginning to materialize. These events are expected to result in a firm plan to restart operations in Moses Lake, Washington, “ said James A. May II, CEO.
REC reports that it is focusing its efforts on creating a domestic market for its product in the United States, working with a battery company looking to use polysilicon for the next generation of rechargeable batteries and an Oregon-start-up looking to build solar panels in Moses Lake.
