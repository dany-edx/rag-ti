Trina Solar broke ground on its Thai Nguyen plant in December, and completed construction in five months. The factory has a capacity for 3 GW of cells and 4.5 GW of 210 modules. On May 15, the facility manufactured the first batch of 210mm Vertex 550W modules. Plans for Vertex 400W and 670W module production are now in the works for the plant, which can boost the annual capacity to an equivalent of 3.5 GW of 210 cells and 5 GW of 210 modules, respectively.
The fully automated plant represents one of the first overseas factories that manufactures 210 cells and 550 W modules.
Currently, Trina Solar runs multiple 210 Vertex cell and module factories in China and Vietnam. Altogether, they are expected to produce more than 50 GW of modules by the end of 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/24/montana-cryptocurrency-producers-back-a-utility-scale-solar-project/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,MONTANA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 24, 2021",Montana cryptocurrency producers back a utility-scale solar project,"Local news reports said that Madison River Equity LLC will seek a special use permit next month from a Montana zoning board for a 300 MW, 1,600-acre solar array known as the Basin Creek Solar Project to be built on private ranch land in Butte.
Madison River Equity is a unit of an entity that developed the Atlas Power data center near the proposed solar project. Atlas Power mines cryptocurrency and reportedly plans to expand its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), adding new buildings and thousands of additional GPUs. If all the permits are acquired, Atlas Power’s owners would buy the Basin Creek Solar Project to power the data center.
Roughly 700,000 solar panels would be placed on either side of a seasonal drainage channel, with a 1,500-foot wide corridor left in the middle for wildlife. Developers said the array would be large enough to power around 40,000 homes. Butte has around 15,000 homes.
The Solar Energy Industries Association reported that as of the fourth quarter of 2020, Montana had roughly 116 MW of solar capacity installed, ranking it 43rd in the nation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/24/after-a-pointed-exchange-hawaii-regulators-revise-conditions-for-a-500m-energy-storage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,POLICY,HAWAII",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 24, 2021","After a pointed exchange, Hawaii regulators revise conditions for a $500m energy storage project","Utility regulators in Hawaii backed off of several conditions they earlier had imposed on a $500 million energy storage project intended to help speed the retirement of a coal-fired power plant and advance the state’s clean energy goals.
Earlier in May, Hawaiian Electric asked regulators to remove operational and financial conditions imposed in its April 29 decision and order (No. 37754). The utility said that without changes to the order, it would have been “nearly impossible for the project to move forward.”
The proposed 185 MW/565 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) on Oahu won approval from Hawaii state utility regulators, paving the way for Plus Power to begin construction.
The Kapolei Energy Storage project was selected a year ago as part of Hawaiian Electric’s transition away from fossil-fired generation. In all, 15 renewable energy and battery storage projects located across three islands were selected. Plus Power’s Kapolei project was the largest battery storage project in the group.
The lithium-ion battery project will be located on eight acres in an industrial area, where it will interconnect with a Hawaiian Electric substation. The project will provide load shifting and fast-frequency response services to Hawaiian Electric, enhancing grid reliability and accelerating the integration of renewable energy. The project is planned to enter service in June 2022 in advance of the closing three months later of the island’s last coal-fired power plant, which is owned by AES.
In early May, the utility asked regulators to modify or withdraw six of nine conditions that were placed on the project’s approval. The utility argued that without modification, the decision would send a “chilling message” to developers about the state’s renewable energy and storage markets.
In their modified decision, regulators said they had voiced concerns about the BESS on several occasions, particularly when it came to the utility’s plans to charge the battery with fossil-fueled generation in both the short- and long-term, as well as the utility’s ability to deliver benefits to its customers.
Regulators said that aside from citing the “urgent need” to replace the AES coal plant, “little was proffered in terms of the project’s customer benefits, ultimately compelling the Commission to impose several conditions in approving the project.”
Regulators acknowledged that they had used “pointed language” in describing what they said was their “disappointment” with having “few options to respond to the extremely serious situation that is developing” in terms of the coal plant’s looming retirement. They said it was “expressly the lack of other viable options” that contributed to the need for the BESS.
Even so, regulators said that concessions offered by the utility led them to revise parts of their earlier decision.
Regulators also initially required Hawaiian Electric to file monthly reports on renewable energy utilization, a requirement that the utility said would be “duplicative and onerous.”

The commission modified its decision by removing threshold requirements and dates. Instead, it said it would conduct a prudence review of the storage system’s use and energy costs on an annual basis for the first 10 years of its operations.
Regulators also said that they would continue to require the retirement of Waiau Units 3 and 4 by 2024, noting that the date represented a “stated commitment” by the utility. However, the commission removed a requirement that the remaining units at  the 500 MW, oil-fueled plant be retired by a specific date. Instead, those units would be prioritized as part of a retirement plan being developed in a separate docket.
Regulators also initially required Hawaiian Electric to file monthly reports on renewable energy utilization, a requirement that the utility said would be “duplicative and onerous.”
The utility indicated that while it was impossible to say how much of the energy stored in the BESS was generated by renewable resources, it could show what the resource mix was on the company’s system as the BESS was being charged. It said that data would be a proxy for the mix of energy that was being stored.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/24/sunrise-brief-leaders-urge-support-for-clean-energy-tax-breaks-that-benefit-public-power/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 24, 2021",Sunrise brief: Leaders urge support for clean energy tax breaks that benefit public power,"Top executives of the nation’s public power providers are urging congressional leadership to support tax policies that allowing public power and electric cooperatives to fully make use of direct pay for renewable and clean energy tax credits.
Leaders of the American Public Power Association, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, and Large Public Power Council wrote to top leaders in the House and Senate seeking what they say would be “comparable energy tax incentives” to support the deployment of clean energy technologies.
One shortcoming of federal energy tax policy is that not-for-profit and tax-exempt community-owned electric utilities have been excluded.

The executives said that much of the value of the tax credits flow to the project developers and their investors rather than to the not-for-profit utilities and their customers. In addition, to qualify for the credit, the project developer and tax-equity investors must retain ownership of the facility. Public utilities may only later buy the facilities by paying market prices for the facility.
“This increases the cost and inefficiency of the present system and means that the purchasing utility is denied the substantial operational benefits that flow from direct ownership,” the executives wrote.
They said that direct payments would be used to help offset project costs and increase the incentive for further investments, while enabling public power utilities and rural electric cooperatives to own clean energy facilities directly.
The three organizations represent public power utilities, which serve more than 49 million Americans, and rural electric cooperatives, which serve another 42 million.
Indiana-based Cummins and Iberdrola said they plan to build a $60 million, PEM electrolyzer plant in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, to produce green hydrogen. The investment follows their earlier decision to partner on large-scale hydrogen production projects in Spain and Portugal.
A site selection search is currently underway for the plant, which will house system assembly and testing for roughly 500 MW/year and will be scalable to more than 1 GW/year. The facility is slated to open in 2023. Cummins has deployed more than 600 electrolyzers in 100 countries globally.
As part of the deal, a 230 MW green hydrogen project in Palos de la Frontera that Iberdrola has planned for fertilizer producer Fertiberia will become a benchmark for large electrolysis projects. Cummins will be the electrolyzer supplier for the Palos project. With experience gained in the project, Iberdrola and Cummins will work to design other large electrolysis projects. The two are also working on a hydrogen refueling station in Barcelona.
In Castilla-La Mancha, Iberdrola operates 2,376 MW of solar and wind energy. Recently, the company has completed three photovoltaic projects in the region, totaling 150 MW.
In the first four months of 2021, natural gas-fired generation in the Lower 48 states averaged 3,394 GWh per day, a nearly 7% decrease from the same period in 2020, according to data from the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA). The drop stems from higher natural gas prices and increased competition from renewables, and is the first year-over-year decline since 2017.

EIA said that natural gas-fired generation has faced increased competition from renewable generation because of recent record-high capacity additions to solar and wind power plants. Between May 2020 and February 2021, some 22.5 GW of combined net solar and wind additions came online, a 15% increase. EIA said that it expects another 28.7 GW of solar and wind capacity to enter service by the end of 2021.
By contrast, 4.8 GW of U.S. natural gas capacity came online between May 2020 and this past February, a 1% increase. EIA said it expects another 3.8 GW of natural gas capacity to come online through the end of the year.
U.S. natural gas prices have risen since April 2020 because of lower natural gas production and higher winter heating demand. Higher prices have made natural gas-fired generation relatively less competitive compared with coal-fired generation, prompting natural gas-to-coal fuel switching. EIA said that coal-fired generation rose nearly 40% during the first four months of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020, and accounts for 23% of total generation.
Aurora Solar, which provides software for solar sales and project design, closed a $250 million Series C funding round led by Coatue, with follow-on participation from existing investors ICONIQ Capital, Energize Ventures, and Fifth Wall.
Over the past two years, Aurora Solar has raised more than $320 million. The company said it will use the investment to expand its product roadmap, hire more people, expand sales and customer support, and build its leadership team to scale the company.
