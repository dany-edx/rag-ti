“The company is in active discussions regarding the factory’s location,” Laureen Sanderson, chief communications officer for CubicPV, told pv magazine. “Effectively immediately, the five-year agreement – subject to certain terms and conditions and with options for renewal – establishes a commitment for an annual purchase volume of 1 GW of Direct Wafer cells from Cubic’s factory.”
Waaree will begin purchasing cells from CubicPV upon completion of the factory, Sanderson added. The cells will feature wafers made with CubicPV’s transformative Direct Wafer technology, which produces wafers in one step, directly from a molten bath of silicon. The product purportedly delivers the world’s lowest cost of electricity today, while offering a significant reduction in carbon footprint over conventional methods.
“Our Direct Wafer technology is the ideal solution for India’s domestic utility market and Waaree, by choosing this technology over generic methods, is setting the tone for an Indian manufacturing future that makes better use of materials, requires less energy and is defined by high efficiency,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO of CubicPV. “CubicPV is honored to begin our journey in India with Waaree. The synergy between one of the leading module manufacturers in India and Cubic’s innovation agenda will create value for both companies and the solar industry in India.”
The partnership with CubicPV provides Waaree with a domestic supply line and thus a level of immunity with respect to the logistics challenges and volatile commodity pricing that has defined the import market.
“As an early entrant in the solar industry, Waaree recognizes the value of innovation to our continued leadership position. We believe that CubicPV’s technologies will deliver significant benefit to our customers and to the Indian solar market both immediately and in the long-run. We are proud to bring a module to the market featuring domestically-produced wafers and cells manufactured with a low carbon footprint,” said Hitesh Doshi, chairman and managing director of Waaree.
CubicPV was formed from the merger of US wafer maker 1366 Technologies and Hunt Perovskite Technologies.

The Waitsfield Brewery and Taproom was generating about 10% of the electricity to run its operation, but with the addition of 215 kW from 495 solar modules, it expects that 60% of its electricity bill will be offset with net metering credits.
The canopy, built by SunCommon, features 495 REC 375W solar modules, which are arranged above 40 covered parking spaces. Customers with electric vehicles can top off the battery at the 10 level-two electric vehicle charging stations.
SunCommon, an iSun company,  installs residential, community, and commercial solar, as well as battery storage. Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility (VBSR) awarded co-founder Duane Peterson its Terry Ehrich Lifetime Achievement Award for sustainable business. Parent corporation, iSun, has a portfolio of over 400 MW solar installed across residential, commercial, industrial, and utility-scale sectors.
Lawson’s Finest Liquids, the company that owns the Waitsfield Brewery, makes sustainability a priority. The project, built throughout 2021 and early 2022, is part of the company’s Green is Grand initiative within the Social Impact Program (SIP). They first installed solar panels on the brewery in 2019, an independent wastewater management system in 2018, and they partner with local businesses to responsibly recycle spent grain and byproducts. Through its SIP program, Lawson’s Finest builds connections and strengthens communities. Since 2018 it has donated more than $1 million to area causes.
“When my wife Karen and I started Lawson’s Finest, values were at the center of what we wanted to do with our business,” said Sean Lawson, CEO and Founding Brewer of Lawson’s Finest Liquids. “From the beginning we set out to be the finest, source the best ingredients, invest in state-of-the-art equipment, brew the best beer possible and cultivate healthy, vibrant communities. That’s why our efforts in sustainability and striving to offset our brewery’s utility bill through renewable energy are so important to us.”
A celebration of the completion of the parking canopy and its continued dedication to sustainability and green energy was held on Earth Day with Vermont’s renewable energy leaders in attendance to celebrate Lawson’s Finest solar power expansion.

“Businesses like Lawson’s show us that it’s possible to provide great products, grow to meaningful scale, and generate financial success all while creating increasingly positive impact on the communities where Vermonters live and work,” said Duane Peterson, co-founder at SunCommon, “We’re stoked to partner with Lawson’s to further expand their sustainable practices. Now we can all enjoy a ‘Sip of Sunshine’ in more ways than one!”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/28/anti-rooftop-solar-bill-vetoed-an-industry-reacts/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,FLORIDA",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 28, 2022",Anti-rooftop solar bill vetoed: An industry reacts,"The clean energy world let out a collective sigh of relief last night, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed House Bill 741, a wildly unpopular piece of legislation dubbed the “anti-rooftop solar bill,” which would have phased down the value of net metering and opened the door for utilities to add fixed charges to solar customer bills.
And while the bill’s return to the legislature doesn’t mean it’s quite dead yet, having passed the first time by the exact same margin needed to override the veto, the belief is that DeSantis, a current frontrunner for the GOP ticket in 2024, wouldn’t have vetoed the bill if he believed in the possibility of an override, which could somewhat weaken his campaign.
In our previous coverage, we included commentary from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Vote Solar, however the conversation does not end with those two entities. pv magazine has collected a series of responses from other players across the political, regulatory, and industry spaces, and will continue to update this column with additional commentary points as they come out.
Florida SEIA
“The rooftop solar industry employs more than 9,000 Floridians and gives every Florida resident the freedom to choose how they generate and use electricity. Governor DeSantis understands the value of solar as an economic engine and a powerful tool for energy independence here in the Sunshine State,” said Justin Vandenbroeck, president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association. “His decision to veto this bill will allow our industry to continue growing and give more homeowners in our state the chance to lower their electric bills with solar.”
Energy and Policy Institute

Alissa Jean Schafer, a research and communications manager at the Energy and Policy Institute, commented on the genesis of the bill:
Smith said, “No monopoly utility owns the sun, nor the right to use misinformation to raise rates on their customers.”
CALSSA

Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association, draws a correlation between the Florida bill and California’s NEM 3.0 controversy:
“Governor DeSantis did not fall for the utilities’ playbook of protecting their profits and monopolies by eliminating competition from rooftop solar. Governor Newsom’s administration should not fall for it either. When it comes to keeping solar affordable, growing, and contributing to our clean energy future, California should be not only keeping pace with Florida, but leading the world.”
Conservative Energy Network
Tyler Duvelius, director of external affairs, Conservative Energy Network applauds the protection of energy freedom in Florida:
“By vetoing this anti-net metering bill today, Governor DeSantis protected Floridians’ rights to energy freedom and ensured solar energy remains a strong economic force and job creator in the Sunshine State. Net metering gives Floridians access to clean, affordable energy and provides an element of choice and competition in the energy market. The practice reduces strain on the grid and diversifies energy sources, benefiting all energy consumers, not only those with rooftop solar.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/28/commercial-and-industrial-solar-epc-takes-a-holistic-approach-to-greening-buildings/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW JERSEY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 28, 2022",Commercial and industrial solar EPC takes a holistic approach to greening buildings,"Distributed rooftop solar PV comes with numerous benefits, be they financial, environmental, or for grid resilience. Another benefit that Pfister Energy places focus on is the human element. 
In addition to performing work as a long-standing commercial and industrial solar engineering, procurement and construction firm based in New Jersey with a national presence, Pfister Energy adds a few more elements to its projects to make them stand out from the competition. Taking experience from a long career in roofing, Wayne Pfisterer moved into solar about 20 years ago, and has since added numerous ancillary services to boost the value of renewable energy for his customers. 
Early on in his solar story, Pfisterer’s company, like all others starting out in the relatively new field of photovoltaics, was highly reliant on federal and state incentives to deliver a valuable proposition to his customers. At the time, he had about 3 or 4 employees, and uncertainty caused by the potential of incentives drying up, Pfisterer pivoted, adding energy efficiency services to his company. 
“Growing up, I got yelled at if I left a light on in the other room,” Pfisterer told pv magazine. “I always thought it was a little wasteful to put solar on an inefficient building.” 
So, Pfisterer’s company got to work on new solutions for his customers to expand beyond PV on roofs and carports. The company installs daylights in factory buildings, a device that brings in electricity-free natural light that doesn’t let in or out unwanted thermal changes. The team has also installed green roofs, planting vegetation on an otherwise dead space, which absorbs excess heat and helps the solar array perform at a more ideal temperature. It also extends the life of the roof by protecting it from UV rays. Solutions like these are both proven to have beneficial impacts on worker health, bringing a more natural environment to the factory floor. 
The company also installs rainwater solutions that repurpose rain for irrigation or greywater applications. Such a system is in operation today at the Goodfellows Airforce and a Colgate Palmolive facility.
Efficiency is chief of mind for Pfisterer Energy, too. The company installs energy-efficient measures like insulation, efficient lighting, and has done work in the building-integrated photovoltaics space. Pfisterer said this has led to winning bids versus competitors that all offered a vanilla 1 MW array, while his 750 kW array offered a better return on investment to his customers and was able to meet their needs due to boosted efficiency. 
Consistent policy breeds success
Pfisterer shared that in New Jersey, the incentive programs of the past were instrumental to accelerating his business. The TREC program was a very rich incentive, perhaps even too rich, he said. The problem was when TRECs went away, and a softer SREC program was launched, customers had become accustomed to unbelievable deals, like projects that would entail only a three-year payback. Pfisterer believes consistency and predictability would have done better for the industry. A long-term, reasonable incentive that smoothed out these sudden booms and busts in the market would benefit all involved.
This sentiment of wanting consistent policy is felt today at the national scale, too. The antidumping investigation of four Southeastern Asian countries that supply 80% of US solar modules has frozen the industry in its tracks, especially at the utility scale, due to untenable levels of uncertainty and risk.
In an interview with pv magazine, utility scale developer SOLV Energy CEO George Hershman said the antidumping investigation was a “baseless” claim and seemed to be a poorly veiled and poorly planned attempt to boost US manufacturing. However, in the short term, inconsistent policy does not work. “We need to align around legitimate industrial policy to support manufacturing in the US,” said Hershman.
Pfister Energy’s director of estimating, Varun Harnathka said the announcement of the investigation immediately led to a 25% jump PV prices, and now prices continue to creep up every day he calls for a quote. He said that contracts from the four countries now incorporate tariff risk into their price.
“In the last week of March, panels were about $0.40/W, now they are about $.50/W. Pre-covid we were only at about $0.28/W,” said Harnathka. Pfister added that raw material prices like copper and other key elements have been driving the spike, as well.
With panel costs up 30-40-50% and still rising, Pfisterer said that his company’s unique projects that incorporate a holistic approach to efficiency may pencil out better for customers than placing the largest system possible on a roof. “Let’s look at some energy efficiency, storage, EV charging, and how we can design a net-zero electricity building,” he said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/28/gigawatt-scale-hydrogen-optimized-water-electrolyzer-factory-planned-for-south-texas/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 28, 2022",Gigawatt-scale Hydrogen Optimized water electrolyzer factory planned for South Texas,"The Hydrogen City project is planned to be a 60 GW green hydrogen production, salt cavern storage, and transportation hub, expected to produce over 2.5 billion kilograms of green hydrogen per year. The project will be powered by 60 GW of solar and wind, with additional energy drawn for the grids at lower cost times. The project will be built in phases, with the first phase expected to be operational in 2026.
The proposed RuggedCell manufacturing facility will also be built in stages, with a goal of 5 GW a year of electrolyzer production. GHI plans to purchase the output for the first 10 years to supply its Hydrogen City project. Locations being considered for the factory include the Austin, Houston, Dallas, and Corpus Christi areas.
GHI’s plan for gigawatt-scale green hydrogen production requires very large-scale water electrolysis technology, and Hydrogen Optimized high-current RuggedCell technology meets that requirement. Most systems on the market today scale up to 20 MW per unit, according to GHI. However, RuggedCell was designed for large-scale hydrogen production, as the company is targeting individual installations of 100 MW up to 400 MW. Other advantages of RuggedCell are its fast, dynamic response to variations in electrical current levels from 0 to 100% power load, and the fact that the systems do not use costly iridium and other expensive platinum group metals, according to GHI.

GHI has acquired salt storage rights at strategic sites globally, with a potential for 100 TW hours of energy storage capacity. Hydrogen City is GHI’s first project, and it will be centered on the Piedras Pintas salt dome in Duval County, Texas. It is planned that the green hydrogen will be delivered through pipelines to Corpus Christi and Brownsville, where it will be turned into green ammonia, sustainable aviation fuel, and other products, or it will be delivered by pipeline directly to hydrogen power plants and other users around the state.
“We’re particularly excited to explore GHI’s plan to store green hydrogen in salt caverns, an approach that inherently recognizes the need to produce and store green hydrogen on a massive scale to unlock a region’s renewable energy potential and drive the transition to clean energy,” says Andrew T. B. Stuart, president and CEO of Hydrogen Optimized.
