https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/28/more-than-125-local-governments-adopt-solarapp/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2021",More than 125 local governments adopt SolarAPP+,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has achieved its goal set this summer, announcing that more than  125 communities have signed up to use the Solar Automated Permit Processing (SolarAPP+) tool — a free, DOE-developed web-based platform that allows local governments to instantly approve residential solar installation permits.
A total of 127 communities have made the commitment, so DOE has extended the challenge, now looking to add another 60 communities through the SolSmart program by March 2022.
SolarAPP+ was developed DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and in May, NREL signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the global company UL to develop and commercialize the app, which was officially launched in mid-July.
“Everyone has access to sunlight but not everyone has access to solar power—this Administration is committed to changing that,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “DOE’s SolarAPP+ tool and SolSmart program are helping communities tear down barriers to clean energy and unlock the health and economic benefits of solar.”

In using the app, there is a cost of $25 per approved permit, but in many early trials, jurisdictions have subsequently lowered their permit fees due to the benefit of saved time, leading to an average of $6 in savings per project. 
The SolSmart program, under which communities can sign up to add SolarAPP+, offers targeted, no-cost technical assistance to communities across the U.S., aiding municipalities in becoming solar-ready and streamlining local processes. More than 400 communities in 41 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have received SolSmart designations. Nine million people live in communities with a SolSmart designation.
Earlier this year, DOE announced a $10 million funding opportunity to expand SolSmart over the next five years and incorporate new solar-related technologies while emphasizing assistance for underserved communities.
SolSmart has found success nationwide, with the city of West Palm Beach, Florida seeing a 50% year-over-year increase in solar installations after using SolSmart to institute one-day permitting. In Orlando, Florida, the number of solar contractors working in the state doubled since the city achieved SolSmart Gold designation, and in Boise, Idaho, residential solar permits increased by almost 50% in the year following their designation.
In case you were wondering, the “plus” in SolarAPP+ references energy storage permitting , which is expected to be added to the software soon.
Jurisdictions interested in taking on this initiative to save time in their approvals departments, and solar companies looking for faster install times can navigate to https://solarapp.nrel.gov/ to get started.

The facility’s initial production capacity will be 400 MW, with potential to grow to multiple gigawatts of capacity. Startup capacity will include capabilities to manufacture solar modules for residential, commercial/industrial rooftop, and utility-scale applications. Production is expected to be begin by the end of 2022, and the facility could create hundreds of jobs.
While a final site has not yet been determined, the company made the expansion decision as part of its commitments to produce modules near its customers and source material from regional suppliers. It also said it aims to improve overall sustainability by reducing transportation emissions and optimizing the carbon footprint of its solar modules.
President of Meyer Burger Americas, Ardes Johnson, said it is critical for the U.S. to develop its domestic supply chain and de-risk itself from heavy dependence on Asia-based equipment suppliers.
With supply chain concerns and shipping delays becoming a paramount issue for the solar industry, this approach may ease delivery delays or constraints and provide flexibility for customers.
Meyer Burger said it expects to have the site selected by the end the year. It said key criteria include available facilities, regulatory and tax frameworks, state and local economic development programs, access to skilled workforce, proximity to transportation infrastructure, renewable power supply, and local commitment.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/28/strategies-to-enhance-the-value-of-utility-scale-pv-is-focus-of-berkeley-lab-study/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2021",Strategies to enhance the value of utility-scale PV is focus of Berkeley Lab study,"With recent declines in battery storage costs, PV plants with trackers, storage, and a high inverter loading ratio offer a greater net value than designs using west-facing panels or vertical bifacial panels.
That’s according to an evaluation of an assortment of PV plant strategies by staff of Berkeley Lab and published in the journal Applied Energy.
In California, with its relatively high level of PV on the grid, the PV plant design with the highest net value used single-axis trackers, 4-hour storage sized at half the system’s AC capacity, an inverter loading ratio (DC:AC ratio) of 1.7, and DC-coupled batteries (referred to as the “DC-coupled” design).
DC-coupling means that battery storage is placed on the DC-side of shared inverters, improving system efficiency.
While most utility-scale solar-plus-storage plants at year-end 2019 had an inverter loading ratio (ILR) of 1.3, the study said that examples of DC-coupled hybrid systems with higher ILRs are increasing.

The study found that in an area with a small amount of PV on the grid, a system that uses tracking, an ILR of 1.3 and no storage might be competitive with the DC-coupled design.
But regardless of the amount of PV on the grid, west-facing and vertical bifacial designs were found to have lower net value than plants that included tracking.
As PV penetration increases, more electricity is produced during sunny hours. Without the deployment of storage or an increase in price-responsive load, the authors said, growth in PV capacity will lead to lower wholesale prices during sunny hours.
On California’s grid, for example, as power during sunny hours became relatively abundant between 2012 and 2018, the wholesale value of solar generation from a fixed-tilt system without storage fell 39%. PV developers have largely been shielded from this value erosion, the authors said, due to long-term, fixed-price power-purchase agreements.
PV can be made more “grid-friendly,” they said, through modifications to project configuration and operations. They used the phrase “grid-friendly” to describe PV that maintains marginal grid value as PV penetration increases.
Additional strategies were evaluated in addition to a base design which used monofacial panels tilted south with a 1.3 ILR. Those other strategies reflected modifications to the base design to include bifacial panels, tracking, a greater or smaller tilt angle, a lower or higher inverter loading ratio, or storage.

One other strategy involved selling regulation services. Doing so would require solar plants to operate with “headroom” to be able to respond to automatic signals to ramp output either up or down.
The net value of each strategy accounted for the PV plant’s cost, the wholesale value of the electricity it sent to the grid, and its capacity value.
Cost elements were obtained from previously published literature. A 30% investment tax credit was assumed for both solar and storage.
The free-to-access article is titled “Project developer options to enhance the value of solar electricity as solar and storage penetrations increase.”

GAF Energy provides low-profile alternatives to rack-mounted solar panels. Launched in 2019, it reports having installed solar on over 2,000 roofs nationwide. Parent company Standard Industries said it has pledged to spend $1 billion on building technologies including solar.
In May, GAF Energy announced that its manufacturing operations would move from South Korea back to the United States, bringing jobs to about 400 people in manufacturing, engineering, and R&D. The facility is expected to be able to produce 50 MW of solar panels annually.
In an interview with pv magazine, Martin DeBono, GAF Energy’s president, said that R&D teams will be a short stroll away from the production line. And while California and Silicon Valley are not known for their low costs, the company chose San Jose for its proximity to a talent pool that is used to innovating for Apple, Google, and others.

DeBono said that one part of the company’s strategy is to focus on the street-side look of its solar roofs. A second focus aims to trim the amount of time it takes to install a solar roof. DeBono said installers typically need around two days from start to finish, and GAF Energy aims to reduce the time still further.
GAF Energy said expects to benefit from reduced risks associated with offshore production, including possible tariffs on Asian-made solar goods and rising transportation costs.
GAF said its solar system is integrated into the roof. Unlike rack mounted systems, GAF said its product avoids the step of drilling through the roof’s shingles.
The integrated systems are characterized by low-profile, high-efficiency solar modules with black perimeter shielding and flashing to reduce leaks and animal intrusions.
In addition to serving homeowners, GAF works with roofers who want to become solar installers by providing them with hardware components, design, permitting, and electrification services.

The company said it had “significant growth aspirations” across Canada, the United States, and Australia and would focus on renewable and energy storage project for large customers. The company said it plans to expand further into contracted renewables with solar, onshore wind, and battery storage.
As part of its new focus, the company said it will suspend a planned 730 MW conversion to natural gas of a former coal-fired unit known as Sundance Unit 5. The company cited what it said were escalating costs, changing supply and demand dynamics, and forecasted power prices in the Alberta market, as well as regulatory risks. It said it planned to use the capital previously targeted for the Sundance Unit 5 repowering to fund renewable energy projects.
TransAlta said it has a development pipeline which includes 1.2 GW in the United States, up to 2 GW in Canada, and 270 MW in Australia.
In early September the company said it would pay $96.65 million for a 122 MW portfolio of operating solar facilities in North Carolina. The assets are being acquired from a fund managed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.
The portfolio consists of 20 solar photovoltaic facilities that are all operational and were commissioned between November 2019 and May 2021. The facilities have long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with two Duke Energy units. The PPAs have an average remaining term of 12 years. Under the PPAs, Duke receives the renewable electricity, capacity, and environmental attributes from each facility.
The North Carolina portfolio is expected to generate an average annual EBITDA of around $9 million and average annual cash available for distribution of around $7 million. The facilities are expected to have an annual production of 195,000 MWh.
