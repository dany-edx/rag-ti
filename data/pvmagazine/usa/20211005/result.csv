The project is located in Texas, near South Padre Island and the U.S. – Mexico border.
Construction is yet to begin, but project’s site has been finalized thanks to long-term leases covering approximately 1120 acres of cultivated farmland. Interconnection studies for the project have begun and the preliminary environmental analyses have been completed. Westbridge anticipates completion of the project and interconnection agreement to take place Q1 2023.
The acquisition represents the first foray by Westbridge into the American solar market, and the company now controls solar assets in Alberta, Canada and Texas. The company will likely expand into other states and Canadian provinces, as Stefano Romanin, CEO of Westbridge, shared that the company has a goal of “quickly expanding its portfolio of high-quality projects under development to become a leading renewables development platform in North America.”
Westbridge is committing up to $2,500,000 for the development of the project, including acquisition and transaction costs, and an approximately $2,000,000 at project exit. As part of the transaction, Aelius Solar Corp. will continue to support Westbridge with development activities under a services agreement.
In September, Westbridge announced that it had completed environmental and wildlife field study programs for one of the largest solar installations ever proposed in Canada: the 230 MW Georgetown Solar Project. The project is set to be constructed on 710 acres of privately owned farmland southeast of Calgary. Development began in early 2020, while construction is anticipated to begin in August 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/05/renewable-energy-dominated-new-u-s-generating-capacity/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 5, 2021",Renewable energy dominated new U.S. generating capacity,"Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass, dominated new electrical generating capacity additions in the first two-thirds of 2021, accounting for an 86.5% share, reports the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
A total of 13,868 MW of the 16,039 MW added to the grid was renewable energy, the majority of which was solar and wind energy. Wind led the way with 7,244 MW, and solar was close behind with 6,585 MW added. The remainder of non-renewable energy added was mostly natural gas, with 2,155 MW brought online.
Renewables are now providing more than a quarter (25.22%) of all U.S. available installed generating capacity.  Five years ago, it was 18.39%, and a decade ago renewables accounted for 14.09%.
Solar has surpassed 5% of the nation’s generating capacity, a figure that does not include distributed (rooftop) solar. Further growth in solar is expected, with “high probability” additions through 2024 expected to reach 44,052 MW, said FERC.
The forecast for the next three years for net renewable capacity additions is 66,581 MW. That is nearly identical to the actual net additions of renewable energy for the last three years (65,820 MW). If these predictions hold, renewables will reach nearly 30% of total installed capacity.
Moreover, solar is set to surpass nuclear power over the same three-year period, said FERC. New utility-scale solar additions in the next three years will be more than 20 times greater than nuclear. The only major planned nuclear activations are the two Vogtle reactors in Georgia, some 2,200 MW of capacity that has been in development since 2013.
“FERC’s data confirm that wind and solar are dominating new capacity additions in 2021 and are likely to continue doing so in the future,” said Ken Bossong, executive director of the SUN DAY Campaign.

Solar facilities were found to produce “cool islands” that extend up to 700 meters from the boundaries of the arrays. Land surface temperature was reduced by up to 2.3 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) at 100 meters away; the cooling effects tapered off exponentially to 700 meters.
Studies of two solar parks–the 300 MW Stateline project in California and the 850 MW Longyangxia project in China–were conducted using Landsat satellite images, an approach the researchers said had not previously been applied to solar. The study team compared land surface temperatures around solar facilities before and after they were built. The Stateline solar park measurements were supplemented with ground-collected data.
The researchers hypothesized that the cooling was caused by a combination of shading and insulating the land surface, and by the direct conversion of energy into electricity by the solar panels.
The study authors concluded the effect could have impact on local ecological processes. Productivity, decomposition, and ultimately the carbon balance could be skewed by the cooling. The scale of effect depends on location, and impacts could range from positive, negative, or inconsequential based on local ecosystems.
For example, in California’s Mojave Desert, lower surface temperatures leads to reduced germination rates and a loss of biodiversity. But, in the Tibetan Plateau, lower surface temperatures could potentially reduce the amount of methane lost to the atmosphere, said the scientists.
“This heightens the importance of understanding the implications of renewable energy technologies on the hosting landscape – we need to ensure that the energy transition does not cause undue damage to ecological systems and ideally has net positive consequences on the places where we build them,” said the research, which was published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Transition.
The studies were conducted in arid locations. The researchers said that further study is needed to determine the effect in more temperate climates.

This is particularly true when it comes to inverter technology, in which the still limited number of competitors have taken advancement and innovation to a snail’s pace, if not a standstill.
With more options to choose from, installers and their customers will enjoy the freedom to assemble solutions that are just right in terms of performance and cost. The solar (and storage) industry will have the opportunity to expand beyond 10% market penetration.
New and innovative competition will benefit not only consumers, but the installers who will reclaim their role as energy consultants. After all, before all-in-one systems and “walled gardens,” pioneering solar installers did significant engineering work to assemble systems of disparate components.
What is different today? High levels of compatibility, interoperability, and industry standards will make just-right solar systems the obvious answer for consumers and businesses who may have been on the fence. The availability of more options for solar installers will drive growth in the solar market.
A recent analysis found that the solar market will grow by $5.99 billion by 2025. Solar-friendly nations will reap the sustainability benefits of solar, boosted by a range of improvements from cost-efficiency, keeping up with clean-energy goals, and improved solar technology.
For instance, Australia’s solar rooftop initiatives are advancing ten times faster than the global average. In addition, the Australian government’s ability to create policies that serve solar companies and consumers has bolstered the adoption of residential solar. Australia can serve as a valuable example of how the U.S. market can adapt as it matures and transitions from solar as ‘exception’ to ‘rule’ in energy infrastructure.
Innovation and competition are not simply the key to the global energy transition with solar; they are fundamental requirements to scale the industry quickly. To wit, solar industry suppliers must scale rapidly to keep up with the massive waves of government incentives and investments in the same.
Rapid growth requires competition. The eagerness to be the best drives product improvements, service quality, and innovation around the efficiency with which products can be installed and serviced, all of which improve installer and consumer experiences. However, parts of the solar industry seem to have fallen behind in options available on the market. The inverter and storage segments, in particular, have strong demand but limited options that leave customers with few options.
One visible example is Tesla, which, despite its high profile, did not have sufficient momentum to take home energy storage mainstream. As both the first-to-market and a premium product, the car-maker’s home storage products have been unable to come down the cost curve quickly enough to gain consideration from most consumers.
Homeowners in the high-end market engaged Tesla with enthusiasm, but a large gap in viability for most homeowners in the market remains. In turn, suppliers like Generac (a fossil fuel generator company) and Enphase (a solar energy electronics company) have been able to tap into the lower price bands by offering differentiated features and more modular storage building blocks. Their competing offerings in the energy storage and backup market fueled their move into the US market.
The solar-plus-storage industry must continue to add competitive options to break the past single-digit attach rates and add value to more consumers. The U.S. home energy market can cater to the needs of many more customers when its participants have a wider spectrum of products from which to choose.
This applies to the entire stack of offerings, including home energy management systems, supply chain diversification, price and capacity options. This is also true for the base of installation companies, for which more options mean more opportunities to reduce soft costs, including customer acquisition, installation labor, and the inspection process.
U.S. solar soft costs continue to be much higher than those of other developed solar markets, and they represent an opportunity for competitive differentiation. More installer options with installers who have more choices will provide consumers more targeted features, lower costs, and generally reduce barriers that keep consumers from going solar.
The effects of global supply chain disruptions, both organic and crisis-induced, are a persistent reality. More competition means more suppliers who, collectively, create resilience in the form of a larger number of diverse supply chains. With increased demand, manufacturers will seek out more partners and places from which to source materials.
One or two single points of failure (read: one or two suppliers of any given component) will create the risk of stunting the growth of clean energy deployment, which S&P Global Market Intelligence expects to be strong. To wit, solar installers, who create the majority of clean energy jobs in the U.S., do not make money while waiting for components to ship. Competition, therefore, is vital to keeping well-paying solar salaries flowing.

Policy-driven opportunities, such as net metering, renewable energy credits, tax incentives, and resilience programs continue to make advances. To take advantage of these opportunities, installers must have the right mix of products and services to deploy solar and storage technologies quickly and service them efficiently. Here, again, supplier competition is instrumental, if not critical.
At the federal level, sweeping climate and decarbonization plans and legislation that aims to promote renewable and distributed energy are gearing up to flood the market with financial incentives.
The programs not only aim to eliminate fossil fuels and deploy renewables, but they will also be a forcing function for a drastic increase in energy-related jobs. More consumer demand and more installers will create tremendous opportunities for new products and services. An entirely new slate of solar and storage product providers will (and must) emerge to take advantage of the impending surge in demand.
The solar community should not fear competition because its collective success depends on it. Serving the full spectrum of homeowners, instead of just the less price-sensitive segments, will require a broad spectrum of products, services, and installers. More freedom and flexibility allows installers to assemble systems with high fidelity and precision, regardless if they are designed for value, performance, longevity, or the latest features.
Greater competition, more innovation, varied supply chains, and more price bands will power the residential solar industry.

That’s according to a new report from IHS Markit.
The firm forecasts that the energy storage industry will notch rapid growth this year, with installations topping 12 GW. That would be an increase of more than 7 GW from 2020. Annual global installations are forecast to exceed 20 GW in 2024 and 30 GW by 2030.
The company said its outlook is underpinned by a growing number of national energy storage targets linked to stronger decarbonization goals. It said of particular note was China’s recently announced 30 GW energy storage target by 2025, which will help Asia to account for a growing share of global demand in the coming five years.

IHS Markit said growth in electric vehicle (EV) adoption is leading to increased constraints in the supply of Li-ion batteries. This could cause delays to project commissioning as cell manufacturers prioritize larger customers in the automotive industry over relatively small energy storage system integrators.
The lower share of battery demand from the energy storage industry will leave it at risk of supply shortages. Even so, IHS Markit said it expects that the disruption to ease within 12-18 months, as suppliers diversify their supply base and EV manufacturers firm their procurement plans.
Globally, around 87 GW of national energy storage targets have been announced this year. Reaching those goals will require developing new market opportunities as well as regulatory changes, IHS Markit said.
It said this is particularly the case in China, where targets are expected to drive it to be the largest market globally in terms of annual installations by 2025. The firm said China will grow “significantly faster” than any other region in order to meet its target, with annual installation levels expected to be 14 times higher than 2020 levels in 2030. This compares to growth rates of 3 times and 4 times for the United States and Europe, respectively.

As part of its focus on residential, the company acquired residential solar provider Blue Raven Solar for up to $165 million in cash. The move is intended to help SunPower expand in the Northwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.
Under terms of the deal, Blue Raven CEO Ben Peterson will join SunPower’s executive team, and the company expects to build on Blue Raven’s current employee and contractor relationships.
Blue Raven was founded in 2014 and, according to a statement, has achieved 93% revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) with a direct-to-consumer sales and installation model. Blue Raven currently books more than 90% of its volume in 14 states. Those states account for around 5% of SunPower’s sales. SunPower said this creates “a significant net-new geographic coverage opportunity.”
SunPower said it plans to combine its products and digital marketing tools with Blue Raven’s direct sales model to accelerate its growth strategy. In addition, SunPower said it expects that Blue Raven’s volume will help expand its financial products and “significantly” increase its 2022 loan volume.
The acquisition highlights SunPower’s focus on growing its residential and light commercial business. It said it is exploring options for its Commercial & Industrial Solutions business including new ownership.
It said the realignment would optimize capital deployment for residential and light commercial and enable Commercial & Industrial Solutions “to better take advantage” of community solar, front-of-meter storage, and “infrastructure legislation tailwinds.”
