The acquisition is Repsol’s first move into the U.S. renewables market. The company will have the option of acquiring Hecate Energy’s outstanding shares three years after this transaction closes. Other terms were not disclosed.
Repsol has operated in the U.S. for more than two decades, and has oil and gas upstream assets in Pennsylvania, Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska. Repsol also markets and trades natural gas, crude oil, and related products. For more than 10 years, it has sold lubricants for motorcycles and the industrial sector.

Hecate Energy has a portfolio of renewable projects totaling more than 40 GW. Of these, 16.8 GW are PV solar projects and energy storage associated with these assets, all at advanced stages of development. The company also participates in Hecate Grid, a battery platform for energy storage with a capacity of 4.3 GW. Most of Hecate’s assets are located in ERCOT, WECC, and PJM.
The U.S. is the second renewables market that Repsol has entered outside Spain. Last July, it signed an agreement with the Ibereólica Renovables Group, which gave Repsol access to a portfolio of projects in Chile in operation, construction, or development.
The portfolio includes more than 1,600 MW by 2025 and the possibility of more than 2,600 MW by 2030. The company also participates in WindFloat Atlantic, an offshore semi-submersible floating wind farm off the northern coast of Portugal with a total installed capacity of 25 MW.
In a related development, Hecate Energy said that construction has begun on two solar projects totaling 600 MW. In Falls County, Texas, near Waco, Hecate developed the 500 MW solar and battery storage project, Roseland Solar, from inception and transferred it to the North American unit of an unnamed European utility in March. In Highland County, Ohio, east of Cincinnati, Hecate developed the 100 MW New Market Solar project and transferred it to Canadian utility Algonquin Power & Utilities in May.

The Renewables and Wholesale Electricity Prices (ReWEP) tool allows users to compare pricing trends across locations, regions, and a number of different timeframes, down to the nodal level. These comparisons help illustrate the ongoing interactions between solar and wind generation and wholesale energy prices.
The ReWEP tool consists of maps, time series, and other interactive figures that provide a general overview of how average pricing, negative price frequency, and extreme high prices vary over time; and a summary of how pricing patterns are related to solar and wind generation. Interactive functionality allows investigation by transmission regions (ISOs/RTOs), year, and season, and over diurnal cycles.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/21/the-u-s-shines-as-a-market-ripe-for-renewable-investment-ey-says/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NORTH AMERICA",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 21, 2021","The U.S. shines as a market ripe for renewable investment, EY says","The U.S. is the most attractive market worldwide for renewable investment, according to a pair of reports released by EY consulting: The Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index (RECAI) and the Power & Utilities Transactions and Trends Q1 report.
The ranking is partially driven by what EY calls “a new era of energy policy,” referring to the country’s re-acceptance of the Paris Climate Agreement, coupled with the recent announcement to cut greenhouse gas emission levels 50-52% by 2030 and to achieve 100% carbon free power by 2035.
Not only will these policy drivers lead to increased investment interest in the U.S., but the RECAI shows that current renewables spending is vastly short of what’s needed to meet Paris Agreement standards. That means institutional investors will have a magnified role in the energy transition, highlighting the maturation needed by the industry to keep building momentum.
The U.S. saw $12.6 billion in renewable investments during the first quarter, a 19.1% increase compared to Q4 2020. The figure also marks the highest level of investment in the first quarter of a year over the past three years.
Across the Americas, the $17.9 billion total deal value notched in Q1 represents a threefold year-over-year increase from Q1 2020. There were five multibillion-dollar deals in Q1 2021, with a combined value of around $12.4 billion. The deal value in the region during Q1 2021 was driven by integrated assets ($6.8 billion) and generation ($4.2 billion).
During the quarter, the largest deal came when PPL Corp. sold off its UK business to National Grid for $19.8 billion, and acquired Narragansett Electric Co. in exchange. This repositioning, according to EY, will transform PPL into a high-growth, purely U.S.-focused company with a strong balance sheet.
Another deal highlighted by the report was EDP Renewables North America acquiring an 85% stake in C2 Energy Capital to expand its presence in the distributed generation market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/21/sunrise-brief-farmland-dispute-deals-a-setback-to-a-utility-scale-solar-project-in-new-jersey/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 21, 2021",Sunrise brief: Farmland dispute deals a setback to a utility-scale solar project in New Jersey,"A local planning board in southern New Jersey rejected a zoning variance sought by Dakota Power for a 150 MW solar project on an 800-acre site that is part of agricultural retention zone.
The project included plans to have around 1,000 sheep graze the land. Several board members expressed skepticism over the long-term viability of a sheep farm on the property.
“The Pilesgrove Township Planning Board made the right decision to protect their prime farmland from what would have been the largest solar development in New Jersey,” said Tom Gilbert, campaign director New Jersey Conservation Foundation and ReThink Energy NJ.
The New Jersey Legislature is considering a bill (S2605) that would generally preclude solar development on the best soils in Agricultural Development Areas. It would include a waiver that could allow for solar development on around 8,000 acres of these farmlands subject to approval of the Board of Public Utilities.
(Read “Minnesota is primed to turn a page on the conflict between solar growth and farmland preservation.”)
In January, township officials in far western New Jersey approved a $100 million, 70 MW solar farm that also is being developed by Dakota Power Partners. Construction on the Harmony Plains Solar project could start by the end of the year with the project entering service in late 2022. Both the Pilesgrove project and Harmony Plains would sell energy into the PJM grid.
Approval of the Harmony Plains project is being challenged in court by environmental advocates and two residents who said, among other things, that the 600-acre project would adversely impact prime farmland.
In total, Dakota Power is proposing a roughly $1 billion, 1 GW investment in New Jersey that would include utility-scale solar and solar + battery storage projects.
Maxeon Solar reported both sharply lower module shipments and corresponding revenues during the first quarter as the company continued to pause its large-scale business in markets outside of the U.S. and China.
Maxeon said that its gross margins were affected by rising supply chain costs.
CEO Jeff Waters said, “Shipment and revenue declines reflected the natural seasonal pattern in our distributed generation business, combined with our ongoing pause in large scale.”
The company earlier said it would supply around 1 GW of its bifacial Performance 5 UPP solar panels for the $1 billion Gemini solar plus storage power plant project near Las Vegas, Nevada. And it also released its Air technology platform, which the company said enables it to produce frameless, thin, lightweight and conformable solar panels.
The company said it shipped 379 MW during the first quarter, down from the 531 MW it shipped in the same quarter in 2020 and the 655 MW shipped in the fourth quarter. First quarter revenues were $165.4 million, down from $227.6 million a year earlier and nearly $245.6 million in the fourth quarter.
Net loss attributable to stockholders was $38.8 million in the first quarter. That was up from a reported loss of $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2020. The company reported a nearly $3.5 million net income during the fourth quarter.
The company’s pause in large-scale projects was evident in its breakdown of revenue by markets. The company reported revenues of $19 million in the first quarter of 2020 in Mexico and Latin America. That number fell to $1 million in the fourth quarter and $0 in the first quarter of 2021.
Total revenue in the U.S. and Canada was $59 million in the first quarter. That was down from $71 million in the same quarter of 2020 and $76 million in the fourth quarter.
Maxeon said it expects to ship between 415-475 MW during the second quarter and generate revenue of $165-$185 million. It said it expects out-of-market polysilicon costs to be $16-$19 million leading to an expected gross loss in the range of $5-$15 million.
Kentucky regulators set a residential net metering rate of $0.09746 per kWh under a new tariff structure. That was higher than Kentucky Power’s proposed rate of $0.03553 per kWh. The commercial rate was set at $0.09657 per kWh.
The commission said its adjustments addressed issues of “transparency and consistency that were lacking in Kentucky Power’s proposal.”

The regulatory authority established a compensation rate based on an avoided cost methodology proposed by the utility, but expanded the components that are factored into the rate to ensure what it said would be a “just and reasonable estimate of avoided generation, distribution and transmission capacity, energy, and ancillary service costs, as well as avoided
environmental costs.” The commission said its adjustments addressed issues of “transparency and consistency that were lacking in Kentucky Power’s proposal.”
Under the order, residential and commercial net metering customers taking service after May 15 will be paid for the electricity at the rate established in what is known as NMS II. Net metering customers with generating facilities that were placed in service prior to May 15 will continue to take service under the previous net metering tariff, renamed Tariff NMS I. That tariff is a continuation of past net metering practices where customers are allowed to net their electricity exports against their electricity usage on a kilowatt-hour basis.
Distributed Solar Development closed $85 million in tax equity financing from Bank of America to support its pipeline of distributed generation solar projects in the commercial and industrial market through 2021. A portion of the financing will go toward New York State Energy Development and Research Authority Value of Distributed Energy Resources assets.
This is the third major financing deal DSD has closed this year. DSD announced a two-year, $300 million debt facility financed by Credit Suisse in January, and a two-year, $150 million construction revolver with Rabobank in March. Both will support DSD’s expanding pipeline of distributed generation solar projects in the C&I market.
Last November, BlackRock Real Assets completed its acquisition of the remaining 20% stake in DSD from GE Renewable Energy. That followed BlackRock’s initial investment in July 2019 for an 80% stake.
