Under terms of the investment agreement in principle, Oneida Energy Storage LP, together with private-sector lenders, will finance the balance of the project’s capital cost, which is estimated at around C$500 million. Construction is expected to begin this fall.
The bank and project developers signed a memorandum of understanding in January that led to the financial commitment.
The project will draw and store existing surplus energy during off-peak periods and also provide grid balancing services and reduce the need for renewable curtailment.
Oneida Energy Storage LP, a partnership between NRStor Inc and Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corp;, will create internship opportunities for Six Nations community members and result in training and employment opportunities. Oneida Energy Storage will be responsible for the design, construction, operations, and maintenance of the facility.
The project is part of the infrastructure bank’s C$2.5 billion clean energy initiative and goal to invest at least C$1 billion in projects in partnership with, and for the benefit of, Indigenous Peoples.
Scotia Capital Inc. is acting as financial advisor to NRStor Inc. and Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corp.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/02/dual-axis-tracker-supports-power-production-in-cold-climates/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH AMERICA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 2, 2021",Dual-axis tracker supports power production in cold climates,"North of the 39th parallel near Halifax, Nova Scotia, an area familiar with harsh winter conditions, low sun angle, and coastal-related degradation concerns, a dynamic solar array has been installed. A Halifax estate owner hired the Aartha Group of Surrey, British Columbia, to construct a solution that uses a Mechatron dual-axis tracker.
The tracking mount, according to Aartha Group, has performed better than most tracker technologies in northern climates. The group cites the tracker’s near-vertical positioning capability as an effective method for snow-shedding.
The Mechatron structure was also selected for its expected reliability. Its gearless design is expected to be an advantage over a typical geared structure. Other designs have had occurrences of shattered gears in conditions of extreme cold and high wind.
The array includes 90 Canadian Solar bifacial 390W panels, which allows the panels to gather solar irradiance reflecting back from the snow, or from the light-gray gravel substrate beneath the mount.
The estate owner claims a 20% increase in output from the bifacial panels. This, combined with the 35% increase in production due to the dual-axis tracker, as opposed to a fixed-mount, has led to what the owner claims is a nearly 50% increase in production.

A product of SEIA’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice (DEJI) Council, the database is intended to support inclusivity in the solar market.
SEIA said that climate resilience, sustainability, and racial justice serve a central role in America’s economic recovery in the 21st century. The database is intended to place a spotlight on underserved groups, so that they may drive innovation and share in the benefits of the energy revolution.
SEIA’s database aims to offer a connection to businesses that are at least 51% owned by racial minorities, disabled persons, veterans, LGBTQ+ community members, and women. Additionally, the database has a goal of spurring small-business growth, highlighting what SEIA classifies as “small business,” “historically underutilized business,” or “small disadvantaged businesses.”
SEIA’s DEIJ leadership council further aided the organization’s corporate social responsibility efforts with the launch of an environmental justice policy platform. The council pointed to the Principles of Environmental Justice, a document created by the 1991 First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit, as a waypoint to guide its environmental justice efforts. They made use of the summit’s core values of mutual respect, informed consent, self-determination, workers’ rights, and decision-making equality. The principles are intended to operate on engagement, communication, responsibility, and efficacy measurement.

The transaction closed on June 1. Financial details were not disclosed.
Founded in 2009, Pivot offers a distributed solar development platform that develops, finances, and manages commercial and community solar projects across the U.S. The acquisition is expected to provide Pivot with increased access to capital and move to a model of aggregating and managing recurring cash flowing assets through in-house development, co-development partnerships, and acquisitions.
CohnReznick Capital acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Pivot Energy on the transaction. Latham & Watkins, LLP served as legal advisor to ECP.
ECP, founded in 2005, invests across energy transition, electrification, and decarbonization infrastructure assets, including power generation, renewables and storage solutions, environmental infrastructure, and efficiency and reliability assets facilitating the energy transition. In 2016, ECP invested in Houston-based Sunnova Energy Corp., an owner and operator of residential solar and storage assets. A year later, it engineered a $17 billion deal to take Calpine Corp. private. At the time, Calpine had a portfolio of 80 power plants with a combined capacity of 26 GW.
In May, Pivot Energy said that it and Standard Solar were developing three new community solar projects in Colorado with a total capacity of 4 MW.
One megawatt of the portfolio is dedicated to serving low-income subscribers. The remaining 3 MW have been subscribed to by local municipalities and organizations. Pivot Energy developed and built the solar gardens and will provide customer management services. Standard Solar will finance, own, and maintain the systems.
Pivot also said it was currently developing and co-developing more than 94 MW of community solar in New York State. The community solar projects will serve low- and moderate-income households, residents, and small businesses. Pivot is also developing 35 onsite commercial solar projects for local New York businesses.

The projects are the Blackford Solar Wind and Blackford Wind projects, both located in Blackford County, Indiana, northeast of Indianapolis. The projects were originated by Tri Global in 2019, and are currently in the process of securing permits before construction starts. The capacity is expected to enter service in 2023.
Blackford Wind would be the larger of the two, capable of delivering up to 200 MW, while Blackford Solar will have a capacity of up to 150 MW.
This marks the second deal between Tri Global and Leeward. The two companies earlier announced a transaction involving two of Tri Global’s other Indiana projects: the 180 MW Hoosier Line Wind project and the 400 MW Honey Creek Solar project.
Once completed, Blackford Solar will be among the largest projects in a state with a rapidly-shifting energy landscape. Indiana, a state historically committed to the fossil fuel industry, has seen a solar renaissance, especially at the utility level in the last several years. In late May, another 150 MW solar installation was proposed, the Honeysuckle solar farm in St. Joseph County, home to South Bend and Notre Dame University.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/02/controversial-california-solar-bill-undergoes-major-revisions/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 2, 2021",Controversial California solar bill undergoes major revisions,"California’s controversial Assembly Bill 1139, an act which looked to cut net metering rates paid to rooftop solar customers and remove some benefits for existing solar customers, has been significantly revised by the State Assembly.
The revisions removed a section that would have lowered net metering rates to wholesale electricity rates. That would have worked out to roughly 3 cents per kWh, a drop from the current range of 20+ cents per kWh. The revision also returns the length of time that legacy net metering rates would be given to existing customers to 20 years, instead of 10 years.
The watered-down revision of AB 1139 also gives California’s Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) an extra six months to make its own decision regarding a net metering successor tariff, extending the deadline to August 2022. The initial bill included provisions that would have taken effect had the CPUC not hit a February deadline. Even so, the revised version keeps the provisions intact, regardless of whether regulators meet the deadlines.
This would mean that the bill as it stands would get rid of requirements that the CPUC consider the sustainable growth of the solar industry and distributed energy resources (DERs) when making decisions and that utilities consider the grid cost savings from DERs when making planning decisions.
According to an analysis done by Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners, the probability of AB 1139’s passage is “low.” Shen said that even if the Assembly passed the bill, the Senate likely would reject. If it were to pass both chambers, Shen said that Gov. Gavin Newsom almost certainly would veto it.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/02/enteligent-offers-rapid-shutdown-module-with-power-optimization/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 2, 2021",Enteligent offers rapid shutdown module with power optimization,"California startup Enteligent launched the SolarUp Rapid Shutdown Module, a rapid shutdown device (RSD) with module-level power electronics (MLPE) for efficient power optimization. The company said the device will be available in August and adds the benefit of power optimization at a price competitive with standalone RSD.
As stated by Enteligent, its MLPE solutions offer system-level interoperability and simplified solar rooftop placement while maximizing generation. This enables installers to deploy more modules on suboptimal roof planes, increasing sales opportunities. The design also is a boon to homeowners who have rooftop mounting areas that absorb marginal solar irradiance and who are looking to increase their energy offset.
In full sunlight, SolarUp has among the highest energy outputs in the rooftop market. In shaded conditions, the panel-level Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) optimization engages. Rather than continuously optimizing output, SolarUp only enables its MPPT when needed, which results in an improvement in power loss when compared to other optimizers.
The Sunspec certified device allows for ease-of-install and service, housing both RSD and MLPE in a single location. SolarUp Single provides module-level shutdown and optimization across two panels, while SolarUp Dual allows for shutdown at module level with independent module optimization for two panels.
Enteligent said it soon will release a residential EV Quick Charger. This device charges directly from solar, delivering what the company said would be as much as 13% more electricity from panels than traditional EV charging. After sunset, the charger pulls from storage or the grid. This product will ship in Q2 2022.

The plan calls for Hallador to develop around 200 MW of solar and battery storage capacity through power purchase agreements with Indiana-based Hoosier Energy in 2025. Hallador will seek other customers for the remaining capacity at the interconnection site.
Hoosier aims to replace the 1,000 MW coal-fired Mercom station. Around 200 MW of capacity is expected to become available in 2022 through a power purchase agreement with the Riverstart solar project in northeastern Indiana. That project is being developed by EDP Renewables.
In its integrated resource plan, Hoosier said its near-term portfolio modeling suggested adding 800 MW of wind PPAs, 500 MW of solar PPAs, and 300 MW of natural gas-fired resources through 2023, and another 200 MW of gas resources in 2024.
Hallador operates Sunrise Coal, one of Indiana’s largest coal producers. Its Oaktown mine produces more than six million tons of coal annually. The company also has a 50% interest in a gas exploration company with operations in Indiana.
Rosendin’s Renewable Energy Group said it was contracted by units of SB Energy US Holdings One to design and build the $700+ million, 450 MW Athos I and Athos II projects, which will cover nearly 5-square miles in Riverside County in southern California.
Once completed, the solar installations will provide capacity to generate over 2,200 GWh per year of renewable energy.
Athos I will have the capacity to generate up to 361 MW as early as March 2022. Athos II will have a 288 MW capacity when completed around November 2021. Together, the sites will use around 1.48 million First Solar Series 6 modules on a 3,440-acre land parcel, located 75 miles east of Palm Springs. SB Energy is a unit of SoftBank Group Corp.
Stem Inc. said it will provide smart energy storage services to Ameresco for a battery storage project with Holy Cross Energy, an electric cooperative that serves three counties in western Colorado.
In April, Ameresco announced a 5 MW solar PV project with 15 MWh of battery energy storage for Holy Cross, which aims to source 100% of electricity used to serve members’ load with renewable resources by 2030.
Stem’s Athena smart energy software is expected to enable the cooperative to dispatch the battery into system peaks to minimize costs and maximize efficiency.
Greenskies Clean Energy said it completed a 1.17 MW solar array for the Town of East Haven, Connecticut. The project, at a five-acre capped landfill, includes about 3,000 solar panels.
Greenskies has more than 27 MW of solar landfill projects at 14 sites in Connecticut and Massachusetts.
Through Connecticut’s virtual net metering program, the town will credit the energy produced by this solar installation against several buildings, including two schools, a recreation center, and police department.
The town signed a 20-year lease agreement and a power purchase agreement with Greenskies. Over the next 20 years, the town is expected to save around $1.4 million in electricity costs and generate additional revenue in annual lease payments. The project is expected to generate around 1.64 million kWh of energy every year.
Sunnova Energy International expanded its lease service offerings for solar + Tesla and Generac storage system to nine new markets, including Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Florida, New York, and Rhode Island. The company will offer a choice between a lease program or loan offerings when selecting a solar + storage system to power their home. The company said that 22 states have access to Enphase batteries through its loan program.
New Mexico-based Kit Carson Electric Cooperative is installing nine electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in northern parts of the state. Sol Luna, a local solar installer, will install the EV charging stations. Once the project is complete, Kit Carson will have 19 EV charging stations with 28 charging points.
In May 2020, the co-op received a $200,000 New Mexico Environment Department grant from the Volkswagen Settlement Fund to initiate an EV charging station network in the state.
