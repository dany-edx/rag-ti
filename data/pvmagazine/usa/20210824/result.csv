Several of the projects aim for lower costs for PV module materials or PV racking, or lower defect rates on module assembly lines. Another aims to prevent installed systems from catching on fire. Other projects are developing inverters for utility-scale PV that would eliminate the need for a transformer.
DOE also granted $25 million for a public-private consortium to advance grid-forming inverters, which allow solar and other inverter-based technologies to restart the grid without a spinning turbine at a fossil-fired generating unit. Grid-forming inverters will enable a high-renewables grid with little or no fossil generation.
Further grants of $6 million aim to provide better data to utilities about rooftop solar generation.
Here are descriptions of the nine solar manufacturing projects supported by DOE grants:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/24/solar-power-is-targeted-most-often-when-california-orders-curtailments/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 24, 2021",Solar power is targeted most often when California orders curtailments,"New data show that the amount of solar generation undergoing power curtailment is increasing in California.
The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed 1.5 million MWh of utility-scale solar in 2020, representing 5% of total production, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
Solar is by far the most dominant source of energy that undergoes curtailment in the state. EIA said 94% of power curtailments in 2020 involved solar energy.

Curtailment is the deliberate reduction in output that otherwise could have been produced, and typically occurs when supply exceeds demand. Curtailments reach a peak in the spring months, where demand is relatively low and solar output is relatively high. For example, in the early afternoon hours of March 2021, an average of 15% of utility-scale solar was curtailed, CAISO data showed as reported by the Energy Department.

The growth of installed capacity drives further increases in curtailment rates. CAISO said it expects another 1.6 GW of utility-scale solar to be added, along with 400 MW of wind, in 2021. The two technologies represent 44% of capacity additions this year.
Small-scale solar is expected to rise as well. Home and business-sited projects decrease the need for CAISO-delivered power.
CAISO is exploring a few options to improve the utilization of utility-scale solar and wind sources.
One tool is the CAISO Energy Imbalance Market (EIM), a real-time market that allows those outside of CAISO’s territory to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2020, 16% of possible curtailments were avoided through inter-market trading, according to the EIM.
Another solution in increased use of energy storage. The CAISO region is expected to add 2.5 GW of battery storage capacity  in 2021, according to EIA. Much of that new storage added will be co-located with solar. The EIA reported more than 70% of energy storage will be built alongside solar, an increase from historical rates of 30%-60%.
Image: EIA
California contributed 31% of the nation’s energy storage capacity additions in 2020, and that number may be on a course to expand exponentially. The state accounts for 40% of power capacity planned between 2021 and 2023. These planned additions put the Golden State in line to meet its energy storage requirement by 2024.
The industry has been pushing for a stand-alone energy storage investment tax credit of 26%, which currently only applies to solar or solar-plus-storage projects. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has shown that coupling storage with a standard solar operation produces only modest price savings, if any, leading many to argue that a standalone storage incentive is a logical next step.
CAISO has also identified grid operation techniques as another tool to reduce curtailment rates.
Increasing demand response would adjust consumer demand when warranted. Encouraging time-of-use rates to better match consumer prices with real-time energy prices would influence a smoothing of peak-demand. And, reducing minimum generation levels for existing generators would enable greater opportunity for renewable energy production.

Other terms were not disclosed.
Sage was founded in 2009 and has managed over $2 billion in clean energy projects and power purchase agreements for clients in the public and private sectors.
The deal is expected to help NV5 Global expand in clean energy systems, electric vehicle fleets and infrastructure, and asset management. NV5 has more than 300 projects to date in solar, wind, and energy efficiency.
Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Sage provides energy planning and project management services for businesses, public agencies, and schools.
The company recently said it would work with the Judicial Council of California (JCC) on an investment in solar power and energy storage. The JCC plans to install rooftop solar panels, solar carports, and batteries across 43 potential locations to enable its courthouses to generate enough solar power to cover a portion of their routine energy needs.
Sage will evaluate the sites, and provide procurement support, preconstruction, construction, and post-construction management, and commissioning support. Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) may be negotiated to lock in the price of the resulting solar power and power resiliency services.
Florida-based NV5 Global provides compliance, technology, and engineering consulting services. In early August, it reported second quarter gross revenues of $179.5 million compared to $162.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, a 10% increase. Net income was $13.6 million compared to $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2020, a 203% increase. The company projects full-year revenues to range between $705-$727 million.

The Renewable Energy Investment Tracker report from  analyst BloombergNEF  tracked a first-half record $174 billion of investment in clean power, with bumper equity investments more than compensating for a reduction of finance for wind projects. Wind technology posted a banner year in 2020.
The $28 billion raised by renewables companies cashing in on the share price peaks reached at the start of the year marked a 509% rise on the equity investment compared to the January-to-June period of last year, according to BloombergNEF. The analyst noted that 2021 has also posted a six-month record of $5.7 billion worth of venture capital and private equity backing.
While the $85 billion invested in wind power projects during the first six months of last year eased to $58 billion for the same period this year, the report said that solar parks banked a record $78.9 billion.
That finance included $4.9 billion in the second quarter alone in China, following a $2.8 billion investment in January to March. In the U.S., the report stated, investment of $5.3 billion in solar projects during the first quarter rose to $6.4 billion in the April to June time period.
BloombergNEF head of analysis Albert Cheung warned, however, that 1.8% year-on-year increase is “nothing to write home about.” He said that “an immediate acceleration in funding is needed if we are to get on track for global net zero.”

The roofs of two adjacent office buildings in Sydney’s Barangaroo precinct in Australia have provided researchers a rare glimpse at the real-world effects of green roofs on solar arrays. The findings are substantial – in comparison to the conventional roof, the solar array fitted above beds of plants had an average daily power output 39 kW, or 13.1%, greater.
The study was led by Peter Irga from the University of Technology Sydney and funded by the City of Sydney Council, with research carried out on International House’s conventional array and Daramu House’s green roof array, known as a bisolar roof.
Both roofs generated substantial quantities of solar energy over the eight months they were studied, with the conventional roof yielding 59.5 MWh, while the green roof produced 69 MWh.
“Despite the similarities in build and location, the effect of urban geometry on solar irradiance on each rooftop is made evident outside of the hours during which the sun is near/at its solar peak… During these hours, the green roof produced an average energy output that was greater than the conventional roof by ~ 6 %. Prior to, and after these hours, the influence of urban geometry confounds the reportable efficiencies (-3.6 to 16 %)” the study read.
After correcting for these differences, the panels on the green roof were found to be, on average, 3.63% more efficient on any given day. Following on from that, over the eight-month study period the green roof produced an additional 9.5 MWh of green electricity.
This efficiency boost is thought to stem from the fact the green roof remained far cooler than the traditional concrete one during the day, meaning the panels did not overheat and therefore underperform. In some instances, the green roof was as much as 20°C cooler, with its temperatures also fluctuating far less in the evening.
While increasingly popular, there is currently a lack of research confirming the benefits of green roofs. Furthermore, “there is very little research that compares similar buildings which are exposed to similar environmental conditions by virtue of close proximity,” the study noted.
In addition, the significant increases in its solar array’s output, the green roof was also found to have a nine-fold increase in insect species diversity, as well as a four-fold increase in avian species diversity. It also saw reductions in some air pollutants, improved stormwater management, improved building insulation.
“For the size of the positive impacts generated relative to the costs, green infrastructure is perhaps the easiest and most efficient initiative we can make to help make our cities sustainable,” the study read.
The study’s authors described their findings as “substantial,” though they noted just two roofs were monitored.

The Arizona Corporation Commission approved two-year plans filed by Tucson Electric Power and its sister company UniSource Energy Services. The plans were designed to comply with the state’s current renewable energy standard.
Tucson Electric won approval for its proposed annual budgets of $65.9 million for its 2021 and 2022 implementation plans under the state Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (REST). The tariff was adopted in 2006 and requires state-regulated power companies to get at least 15% of their power from renewable sources by 2025.
The utility also won approval to expand its GoSolar Home community-based solar program. The program allows customers to pay a fee to buy power from a dedicated 5 MW photovoltaic solar facility and receive a fixed bill for up to 10 years. That program is fully subscribed at 841 participants, with about 500 on a waiting list, local news reports said.
Regulators approved extending the program to renters and and also expanding the facility supporting the program by 10 MW, a move that is expected to clear the waiting list.

The Oregon-based group said that fewer than 35% of Haitian schools have access to electricity and so operate without lights, cooling fans, or computers.
In light of the 7.2 earthquake and tropical storm Grace which struck the country within days of each other in August, the need for rural, off-grid solar systems “has come into stark relief,” the group said. A PV system on a local school can provide electricity when an area is cut off by disaster.
The group takes donations of discarded but still useful solar modules and offers solar apprenticeships to provide both training and reduced-cost PV systems to schools. A 6 kW system can be installed for about $6,000, or around $1 per watt, installed.
Brighten Haiti said that U.S. solar companies have shipped nearly 4,000 PV modules to the country.

This 20 MW portfolio marks the second investment with Harrison Street for Soltage’s Iris capital vehicle, with the other being the March 2021 announcement that the two would collaborate on a $250 million partnership to fund solar and other clean energy infrastructure, with the ultimate goal of deploying 450 MW of new distributed solar and storage projects across the United States.
All of the assets will be owned by the partnership and operated by Soltage.  The partnership’s first investment after the initial $250 partnership announcement was a 14.5 MW portfolio of solar assets, representing $30 million of project costs.
This portfolio will serve customers including investor-owned utilities purchasing electricity via PURPA contracts, as well as businesses buying solar to meet clean energy goals and secure reduced electricity costs.
Earlier this summer, on July 27, Soltage announced that it raised a $130M debt facility led by Silicon Valley Bank, with that capital set to be used to finance a 110 MW national portfolio of projects across six states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Maine, Illinois, Virginia and Maryland.
Like today’s announcement, the projects included in that portfolio will be community solar assets and PURPA installations, again serving investor-owned utilities and businesses. It’s a bit strange that both announcements have referenced the building of community solar projects, yet none of the potential energy buyers listed are homeowners or those without access to distributed generation of their own.
Unlike today’s announcement, significant progress has already been made on many of the projects in that July portfolio, with soltage reporting that the construction of this portfolio will be staged over the next three quarters, with construction currently underway on ten projects across four states.
