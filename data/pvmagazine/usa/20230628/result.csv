The company is the result of a merger between Power Capital Energy Group and Sulus Solar.
Since its beginnings in 2016, Portland, Oregon-based Sulus Solar scaled to deliver more than $150 million of solar projects across Oregon and Washington. The company is headed by two industry veterans, Colin Murphy and Conor Grogan.
“We’re incredibly proud of the success we’ve had and have a huge appetite to ramp up our operations with new infrastructure from this merger,” said Grogan.
The company is backed by Omnes Capital, a Paris-based green energy private equity firm valued north of $5 billion. Omnes Capital stated intent to invest over $250 million in the new Phoenix, Arizona-headquartered developer over the next three to four years.
Hawthorne Renewables said it targets 2 GW of operational solar assets over the next five to seven years. The company will develop, finance and operate projects. It will have a Portland office in addition to the Phoenix headquarters.
“We thoroughly analyzed a large set of potential development platform companies for our entry to the U.S., followed by extensive third-party legal and technical due diligence on the Sulus Solar platform,” said Justin Brown, co-founder and co-chief executive of Power Capital. “Conor and Colin stood above the pack as ideal partners amidst a dynamic and competitive market.”
M&A
In 2020 and 2021 mergers and acquisitions activity for renewables surged as valuations for platforms, which included project portfolios and corporate development teams that manage them, reached all-time highs. 
There is a growing trend of international players acquiring experienced U.S. developers with strong project portfolios, and CohnReznick said it expects this trend to continue in 2023. International independent power producers and infrastructure funds see acquisition as an efficient tool to enter or expand their presence in the growing North American market.
Corporate M&A activity that includes developer experience and a portfolio of projects offers scale and transaction efficiency that the acquisition of individual projects aren’t able to match.
FTI Consulting said in a whitepaper that notable 2022 M&A transactions included Brookfield Renewable’s pair of acquisitions of Scout Clean Energy ($1 billion) and Standard Solar ($540 million), Enbridge’s acquisition of Texas wind developer Tri Global Energy for $270 million, and German energy producer RWE AG’s acquisition of Con Edison’s Clean Energy Businesses for $6.8 billion.
“With patience, we anticipate strong M&A activity in traditional renewable assets, platforms and emerging technologies trending toward the second half of 2023 and into 2024 as greater clarity and increased value creation are established,” said the March 2023 whitepaper.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/28/what-salary-and-benefits-can-i-expect-in-solar-development/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 28, 2023",What salary and benefits can I expect in solar development?,"A transition to a carbon-free energy sector is going to take a large, well-trained workforce. Solar now represents 59% of the clean power capacity in development, gaining 4% in share from 2021 to 2022, said the American Clean Power Association. To reach the federal goal of 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, the solar workforce will need to more than double from 255,000 to over 538,000, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). 
With key incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act requiring prevailing wage payment and apprenticeship programs, and the high demand for solar projects and the people who develop, engineer, install and maintain these projects, the prospects for a career in solar are strong. 
Each year, RO Energy runs a survey of solar industry professionals, outlining the wages, benefits and perks that can be expected from the industry. This year, the firm released a report for both solar developers and solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) careers.
“A slick, efficient recruitment process also positively reflects on the company and makes the opportunity more appealing to potential employees,” said Courtney Howard, senior development consultant, RO Energy. “The hiring process is a two-way street; companies must now sell themselves as attractive employers to secure top talent. The attitude should be to sell the company rather than hire the candidate.”
Salary (EPC)

Salary (Developer)

The RO Energy Survey also indicated a pay gap between men and women, though fortunately that gap is closing. In 2022, men in solar made 16% more in similar roles in solar than women, and in 2023, the pay gap has shrunk to 12%.
“However, there is a significant pay gap at junior levels, and far fewer women are joining the solar industry from a grassroots level. Few women start a career in solar, which only exacerbates diversity issues further down the line. Creating graduate schemes or programs in STEM for women locally would be an excellent initiative to encourage a diverse workforce and actively promote diversity,” said RO Energy.
Benefits (EPC)

Benefits (Developer)

When asked what the most important benefit was, survey respondents chose remote working options, healthcare and enhanced paid time off as major motivators. For EPC workers, a strong per diem program was also listed as an important benefit for workers in the field.
It may not come as a surprise, but workers in the solar industry are sustainability and environment-focused. On average, survey respondents rated the importance of sustainability as an eight out of ten, with ten being most-important. However, 48% of respondents did not know if their company had a carbon policy, or responded that the company did not have a policy on carbon emissions.
“Sustainability and the environment are important to prospective candidates, seeing bike leasing and electric car schemes gain interest over the last year. Looking after the environment is a recognized issue and proactive efforts for the better are viewed positively by candidates who want to get involved,” said RO Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/28/electric-vehicle-charging-stations-to-quadruple-in-u-s-by-2027/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 28, 2023",Electric vehicle charging stations to quadruple in U.S. by 2027,"According to the inaugural North American EV charging infrastructure monitor from Wood Mackenzie, President Biden’s goal of building out a national network of 500,000 EV chargers will be far exceeded in four years. While the majority will be residential chargers, the report forecasts that 18 million chargers will be installed across the U.S. by 2027. In addition to residential chargers, public and commercial sectors are expected to post strong growth.
“Public EV charging networks are looking to establish and secure their footholds through aggressive expansion plans, innovative financing structures, and partnerships with automakers and other brick-and-mortar businesses,” said Nick Esch, research analyst, Wood Mackenzie.
As an incentive to move toward the Biden Administration’s goal of bulking up the charging network, the Department of Energy (DOE) awarded $7.4 million to seven projects to develop medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicle (EV) charging and hydrogen corridor infrastructure plans that will benefit millions of drivers across 23 states. This program and proximity to population centers is driving retail store chains to deploy EV charging networks, according to the Wood Mackenzie report, which sees much growth potential in placing EV chargers at commercial establishments.
Walmart, for example, is on track to become the fifth largest DC fast charger (DCFC) network in the U.S., based on current deployments. Subway restaurants and Bank of America are also adding EV chargers to many locations.
“There is so much opportunity in the brick-and-mortar segment as it has synergies with EV charging,” said Amaiya Khardenavis, analyst, EV Charging Infrastructure, Wood Mackenzie. “It is estimated that 85-90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of major retailers, making them very convenient charging locations for EV drivers. The stores seeking to increase customer dwell time will benefit from offering onsite EV charging, while stores that already enjoy high dwell time seek to earn additional revenue from charging.”
As for which port design will become the standard, the report notes that Tesla and ChargePoint are currently dominating the market, with Tesla boasting a 61% market share of DCFC ports in the U.S., while ChargePoint leads with a 46% market share of level 2 ports in the U.S. The market will likely shift toward Tesla chargers, however, as automakers including Ford, General Motors and Rivian announced plans to adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector used by the Tesla Supercharger network. ChargePoint and other rivals such as ABB and Tritium have announced that NACS ports will be an option for their site hosts.

Another market for EV chargers is fleet electrification, and the Wood Mackenzie report notes that substantial government funding is helping to drive school bus electrification. This would be significant in terms of carbon reduction in the atmosphere, as school transportation is the largest mass transit system in the U.S.
While installing charging infrastructure at bus depots can take time, the report notes that the growth of electrified school buses will drive more demand for charging infrastructure as well, with more than 4,000 electric school buses receiving funding in Q4 of 2022, more than three times Q1 2022 totals.
The U.S. government is incentivizing the purchase of electric vehicle charging stations for individuals and businesses with tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. The credit is for up to 30% of the cost of EV charging equipment. For businesses in designated areas, the credit is expanded from $30,000 to $100,000 per system starting this year.
The North America EV charging infrastructure monitor is the first in a new quarterly report series from Wood Mackenzie covering the electric vehicle charging infrastructure market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/28/50-states-of-solar-incentives-hawaii/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,HAWAII",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 28, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Hawaii,"Hawaii is the eighth smallest state by land area, but with 1.4 million residents, it ranks 13th in the country by population density. The 50th U.S. state has just 10,931 square miles of land mass, with sloped volcano ridges not ideal for sprawling utility solar development. However, Hawaii, or the Aloha State, has embraced the small-scale adoption of community solar, and in the 10 months since the Inflation Reduction Act has passed, the lush island state shows huge potential for new community projects.
Hawaii has the highest electric rate in the United States with the average price of 44.24 cents/kWh in early 2023, according to the Energy Information Administration. For the past century, Hawaii has relied on expensive imports of motor fuel, distillates, jet fuel and various other petroleum products for its power generation. But in 2018, the island state became the first in the U.S. to set a carbon neutral goal of becoming fully renewable powered by 2045.
With 1.72 GW of installed solar, Hawaii catapulted to 17th in the U.S. for solar generation from 27th in 2022, with 162 MW brought online for the year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Solar represents 17.25% of the island state’s power mix and the state has made strides to deploy about 150 MW per year in new installations. At year end 2022, utility Hawaiian Electric (HECO) had achieved 32% of its renewable procurement standard goal of becoming fully renewable powered by 2045.
In 2022, the utility ended the use of coal plants, allowing the expiration of a last remaining power plant, while the state’s regulators committed to add 1 GW of new renewable energy projects, including 50,000 rooftop solar projects across the islands and expanding geothermal power development.
Incentives
Prior to 2015, Hawaii had a net metering framework but it lapsed in the regulator’s hands despite 60,000 residents signing up. In its place the state now has two distributed generation tariffs: the Customer Grid Supply Plus (CGS Plus) and the Smart Export tariff. The CGS Plus is available for residential and commercial customers, and Smart Export is for customers who own renewable energy plus energy storage systems.
HECO customers under the CGS Plus program receive a monthly bill credit for energy delivered to the grid based on an island-specific rate. The export credit rate was fixed through October 2022, with the islands of Hawaii (10.55 cents/kWh), Oahu (10.08 cents/kWh) and Maui (12.17 cents/kWh) seeing the lowest rates of the islands, while the lesser-populated Molokai (16.77 cents/kWh) and Lanai (20.80/kWh) enjoy the highest export rates to the utility, according to HECO’s website.
For solar-plus-storage users, ratepayers under the Smart Export framework receive an export credit of 11 to 20.79 cents/kWh depending on the island, while no export credit is available during daily peak times from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., as this is the time ratepayers are to charge their home battery systems.
Like all solar installations in the U.S., Hawaiian solar projects are eligible for the federal Investment Tax Credit. The credit covers 30% of installed system costs, and can be rolled over year to year if the customer lacks the tax liability to take advantage of the credit in one tax year.
At year end 2022, HECO ratepayers contributed 542.7 MW of solar and storage power resources into the Hawaiian grid, as the investor-owned utility saw residents contribute to a sustained compounded annual growth rate from rooftop solar of 7% per year since 2016, the first year under the state’s current tariff framework.
Community solar
Building on the successes of its rooftop solar penetration rate, Act 100 of the Hawaii State Legislature was initiated in 2015 allowing for community solar. The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (PUC) established a “community-based renewable energy” tariff, Sec. 269-27.4. The details of the tariffs and programs have been and continue to be developed under PUC docket #2015-0389.
Even though Hawaiian Electric refers to community solar as a “shared solar” program across its jurisdiction, the state’s utility allows community members to participate in local solar generation projects in nearby solar fields or rooftops without preclusions.
The inaugural phase of HECO’s community based renewable energy (CBRE) program has seen just shy of 6.02 MW of community solar projects enter operations or advanced-stage construction.
In November 2022, HECO selected its first seven community solar projects on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii and Maui, providing 27 MW of clean power to low- and moderate-income subscribers, as part of Phase 2 of the utility’s CBRE program.
Boston-based project developer Nexamp is currently completing the approval steps for the projects, and other projects across the island state, with a goal of commercial operations in 2025. The developer is building projects on the Hawaii (9 MW / 36 MWh storage), Maui (8 MW / 32 MWh storage) and Oahu (6 MW solar) islands.  On Oahu, home of capitol city Honolulu, the developer partnered with MeLink Solar to develop that project.
Our commitment to accessibility shapes everything we do, Chris Clark, chief development officer of Nexamp, tells pv magazine USA, so we are proud to be bringing our expertise to Hawaii and addressing the needs of these communities. Dedicated to low- and moderate-income residents, each of these shared solar projects will ensure equal access and lower electricity costs for participants while reducing the state’s fossil fuel dependence as it works toward 100% renewable energy by 2045. This work will help to ensure that Hawaii, with its unique ecology and island geography, builds a clean and sustainable future for the next generation.
Other CBRE developments are going on across the isles.
The Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC), the utility that manages the grid on the western Kauai Island, does not have any community projects under development, according to the state’s CBRE website.
Further information as well as CBRE enrollment details can be found on the state’s interactive energy project directory.
Notable project
Located north of the village of Haleiwa on Oahu, Kawailoa Solar is a 49 MW utility solar project  developed by Clearway Energy Group in 2019. The project produces enough electricity to power 16,808 homes and ranks as the largest Hawaiian solar facilities.
Kawailoa Solar was built on 300 acres of land owned by the Kamehameha Schools within the Kawailoa Plantation, a historic sugar cane plantation that also features a 69 MW wind farm built in 2018 by First Wind. Kawailoa Solar shares existing roads, substation, and transmission lines with the wind project.
The $7 million capital cost solar project was constructed by local construction subcontractor Goodfellow Brothers for developer Clearway Energy, using close to 500,000 solar panels.
Since becoming operational, Clearway Energy has utilized local ranchers to allow them to graze sheep for vegetation management on the Kawailoa site.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/28/statewide-rps-platforms-require-300-twh-of-clean-energy-by-2030-800-twh-by-2050/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 28, 2023","Statewide RPS platforms require 300 TWh of clean energy by 2030, 800 TWh by 2050","Roughly half of all growth in U.S. renewable energy generation and capacity since 2000 is associated with state renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requirements, although that percentage has declined in recent years, representing 30% of all U.S. renewables capacity additions in 2022. However, within some regions, particularly the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, RPS policies continue to play a central role in motivating renewables growth.
The report, U.S. State Renewables Portfolio & Clean Electricity Standards: 2023 Status Update, from Berkeley Lab found that statewide policies require roughly 300 TWh of additional clean electricity supply by 2030 and 800 TWh by 2050, requiring total non-hydro renewables generation to reach 28% of electricity sales by 2050 (compared to 17% today). This amounts to roughly 25% of the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) projected growth target through 2050.
RPS demand growth tapers off after 2030, as most states pass their maximum percent target, an important note to consider as state clean electricity standards (CES) can pick up the pace of renewable energy deployments at that point, Berkeley Lab notes. The report defines CES as being similar to an RPS, but the target is based on a broader set of eligible technologies.
Roughly half of the 2050 CES demand (see chart above) can be met with existing resources, primarily nuclear and large hydro. A sizeable share of new supply needs may be met over the same timeframe by offshore wind and solar plus distributed generation targets (see chart below).
RPS standard
An RPS is defined as a long-term statewide goal for the state to generate a specified percentage of its electricity the state’s utilities sell from renewable energy resources.
Among the 29 U.S. states plus D.C. with an RPS, 16 states have RPS targets of at least 50% of retail sales, and 17 states have a 100% CES or RPS target. Hawaii and Rhode Island have 100% RPS standards, while Maine, Vermont, New Mexico and Virginia have 75% or more RPS targets.
CES standard
The Berkeley Lab report notes several states along the West Coast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast have an RPS standard that overlaps with CES guidance.

Out of 150 total statewide bills introduced over the last year, 63 bills have strengthened RPS and CES standards versus 32 bills that have weakened statewide standards, while 55 additional bills had no impact.
Two small states who claim the highest rate of electricity, Hawaii (44 cents/kWh) and Connecticut (33 cents/kWh), revised RPS standards or created a new CES target. Hawaii revised its RPS to be based on a percentage of total generation, rather than a percentage of retail sales, a trend which the report suggests raises Hawaii’s target of producing more clean energy.
Connecticut created a new CES targeting 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2040. Other states such as Minnesota (100% CES by 2040, increased RPS to 55% by 2035) and Rhode Island (100% RPS by 2033) bolstered their clean energy plans as well.
Growth drivers
Statewide RPS and CES policies contributed to 44% of total renewables growth in the 22-year timeframe the two standards have been in play. Those policies required a 281 TWh increase and contributed to non-hydro power-related renewables growth of 630 TWh since the year 2000.
The Berkeley Lab report asserts that RPS and CES standards are just one pillar supporting statewide renewable energy increases, while the other pillars include voluntary utility procurement (i.e., integrated resource plans), net metered solar, often not counted toward RPS standards, and voluntary green power markets (ie: corporate power purchase agreements, green power programs).
In Western states, net metered solar caused states like California to exceed RPS requirements on paper, even though about 33 TWh of net metered solar generation across those states is not technically used in RPS tabulation, a reason for strong utility IRP’s and corporate environments, the report says.
Pricing trends
Prices for New England Power Pool Class I RECs remained at roughly $40/MWh over the past year, just below alternative compliance payment rates in the larger state markets, while REC prices in the PJM Interconnection market continued to rise, reaching $30/MWh by year-end, Berkeley Lab reports.
Prices for solar RECs remained relatively stable, and continue to exhibit wide variation across states, with the highest prices ($200-450/MWh) in New Jersey, MA, and DC.
The report was authored by Galen Barbose, a research scientist in Berkeley Lab’s Electricity Markets and Policy Department.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/28/is-your-project-underperformance-caused-by-trackers/,"GUEST POST,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"JUNE 28, 2023",Is your project underperformance caused by trackers?,"Solar projects around the world are increasingly making use of trackers. In estimates of PV system energy generation, trackers are typically modeled in an idealized state such that they track the sun and perfectly minimize row to row shading. In operational projects, this is not always the case. Trackers can deviate from the idealized tracking angles, they can go offline and they can stow due to high wind speeds. They require regular tuning and performance checks as part of a maintenance plan.
The following two case studies explore how trackers perform in operational PV systems in relationship to their modeled performance and estimate the energy lost due to the difference between modeled and actual tracker performance.
Case study 1: Poorly commissioned trackers
The data below is from a PV system in its first year of operation. The system was found to be missing performance expectations and a performance analysis was needed to identify causes of underperformance.
Project specifications:


Even in the first year of operation, the trackers exhibit inconsistent tracking during the day, inconsistent back-tracking and offline times. A significant number of trackers exhibit large errors in tilt as compared with a PVsyst tracker.
Figures C and D show the performance index of the trackers during six months of operation and the relationship between performance index and tracking error.


Performance Index (1) = POA for actual tracker / POA for PVsyst tracker.
Tracking error and downtime can translate to 2%-10% lost energy for the project.
Case study 2: Ground slope
The data presented below is from a PV system in its first year of operation. The system was found to be missing expectations compared with the PVsyst model that assumes a flat project site with no ground slope.
Project specifications:


Figures E and F above show the tracking error as compared with the project PVsyst model and the performance index during five months of operation, respectively.
Most trackers are tracking within one degree of the PVsyst model and have performance indices higher than 0.99. The tracking system appears to be performing as expected.


Figures G and H show the inverter performance index on a representative day and images of significant inter-row shading on the PV modules at 10 a.m., respectively.
The PVsyst model and the tracker back-tracking algorithm are set up for a “flat” site. This results in inter-row shading in the morning for this site with a 7% E-W grade. Even though the trackers are performing as modeled by PVsyst, the project is underperforming for most of the morning due to inter-row shading.
In conclusion, while it may seem like tracker underperformance is an insignificant factor, it can translate into quantifiable revenue losses for a project in the range of 2% to 10%.
All tracker suppliers are not created equal. A high-quality tracker has the potential for better performance in the field. Trackers should be commissioned well to ensure high performance; and for sites with significant ground slope, trackers need to be tuned appropriately.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/28/clean-energy-employment-on-the-rise/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES,WEST VIRGINIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 28, 2023",Clean energy employment on the rise,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) released the 2023 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER), an annual study that tracks employment trends across the energy sector, and it shows that the energy workforce added 300,000 jobs in 2022, of which 114,000 were in clean energy.
Clean energy technologies, such as solar and wind, accounted for more than 84% of net new electric power generation jobs, adding over 21,000 jobs, or a growth of 3.6% in 2022 over the previous year. Jobs related to zero emissions vehicles saw nearly 21% growth, adding over 38,000 jobs.
“Today’s report shows that the clean energy transition is accelerating, with job growth across every pocket of America, and that unionized employers are filling these new positions with much more ease than non-unionized employers,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Thanks to President Biden’s historic Investing in America agenda, we expect to see steady growth of jobs to make and build a resilient and clean energy system offering good-paying and secure employment opportunities to America’s workers across the country.”
Jobs in both solar and wind have been on an upward trajectory since 2020. The report notes that solar had the largest number of jobs gained, adding 12,256 workers (+3.7%).
Another area of growth is in the clean vehicle industry, which includes battery electric, plug-in hybrid, and hydrogen/fuel cell vehicles. The most rapid growth was in battery electric vehicle jobs, which added more than 28,000 jobs, and increase of 27%.
Looking at job growth from a regional perspective, while all states experienced growth, California topped the charts with 13,000 clean energy jobs added or an increase of 3.2%. West Virginia was next, with 7,000 added jobs (+19%) and Texas added 5,100 clean energy jobs (+3.5%).
A demographic shift was noted, as women made up more than half of the net 300,000 energy jobs added in 2022. Veterans, who make up 5% of the jobs in the overall economy, make up 9% of jobs in the energy workforce. The energy workforce is also younger than the national workforce average, with 30% under 30 years old. Black, Hispanic or Latino workers are still underrepresented across the energy workforce. Diversity may soon increase, however, as 11% of energy workers are union labor, and union employers were found to be twice as likely to have a policy to recruit persons of color, and 2.5 times more likely to have a policy to recruit LGBTQ+ people.
“This new data from the 2023 U.S. Energy and Employment Report shows strong growth in energy jobs, and as investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act really start to gear up, I expect we’ll see this growth accelerate over the next few years.” said U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (NH).
The growth in clean energy jobs was faster than last year’s robust overall job growth, the report points out. And the growth is expected to continue, as the nation works toward achieving the Biden Administration’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and a net-zero economy by 2050, through the Invest in America Agenda.
