Under development in Yellowstone County near Billings and with an expected commercial operation date of July 2022, MTSun Solar is set to clock in at 80 MW of capacity. That’s not far below the 117 MW of solar currently operating in the state. MTSun Solar has a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) in place with Northwestern Energy.
MTSun was developed by Broad Reach Power, an independent power producer based in Houston. The acquisition brings Greenbacker to more than 1 GW of generating capacity, including assets yet to be built. The portfolio includes 773.5 MW of utility-scale and distributed solar facilities, 242.6 MW of wind, 15.5 MW of battery storage, and 12 MW of biomass facilities.
The 80 MW Montana project is just one of several that will increase the state’s solar capacity.
The 150 MW Cabin Creek solar farm, currently being developed by Clenera in Fallon County in far eastern Montana, is the largest project in the state to move forward;  it has a 15-year PPA with Basin Electric Power Cooperative. The project will begin construction in 2022 or early 2023 and is expected to be completed before the end of 2023.
A 160 MW solar project has been proposed north of Dillon, Montana, in the state’s western quadrant. This project would be located on roughly 1,300 acres, but is being held up as the developer, Clenera, works to come to terms on pricing with Northwestern Energy, the project’s initial interested buyer. The goal was to bring this project on-line by the end of 2021. Without a power contract in place, that timetable may be hard to achieve.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/06/sunpower-reports-30-year-over-year-bookings-growth-for-the-first-quarter/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JEAN HAGGERTY,"MAY 6, 2021",SunPower reports 30% year-over-year bookings growth for the first quarter,"SunPower reported first quarter revenues of $306.4 million, 5.5% higher than the company’s Q1-2020 level, but $35 million below Q4-2020.
On the back of strong demand and positive industry tailwinds, SunPower’s Q1 residential bookings climbed 30% year over year.
“Overall, we executed well in the first quarter as we met our key financial metrics, increased our gross margin by 660 basis points year-over-year and improved linearity compared to prior years,” said Manavendra Sial, SunPower’s CFO. The company also generated positive cash flow at the business unit level, and repaid its $30 million, 8.5% fixed-interest loan with the California Enterprise Development Authority.
The company reported that its first quarter non-GAAP results excluded net adjustments that, in the aggregate, decreased GAAP loss by $57.6 million, including $44.7 million related to a mark-to-market loss on equity investments, $7.1 million related to results of operations of legacy business to be exited, $5.0 million related to stock-based compensation expense, $5.2 million related to litigation costs, $3.8 million related to restructuring charges, and $1.0 million related to business reorganization costs.
This was partially offset by $5.4 million gain on sale and impairment of residential lease assets and $3.8 million for income taxes and other non-recurring items.
In January, Sunpower said it would close its module plant in Hillsboro, Oregon, which it had acquired from Solarworld Americas in October 2018. Sunpower started production of its P-series modules at the facility in February 2019 but at the end of that year decided to transform itself from a PV manufacturer into a provider of rooftop arrays and storage systems. As part of the plan, it outsourced its production to Maxeon Solar Technologies, which now operates as an independent company.
The company said its first quarter gross margin for the quarter was 22%, up more than 700 basis points from a year earlier. The company said it benefited from stable pricing, efforts to lower its cost of capital, and an ongoing shift to higher-margin loan and lease sales and full system sales. Those sales made up around 55% of residential installations for the quarter.
It said that as more than 70% of consumers are opting for system ownership, loan options that lower the monthly cost of solar will “continue to be an important differentiator.”
For Q2, SunPower said it expects residential and light commercial volume growth of 20% sequentially and over 50% higher versus the prior year, said Peter Faricy, SunPower’s newly installed CEO.
Faricy, who formerly served as CEO of global direct-to-customer for Discovery, Inc and as a vice president leading Amazon Marketplace, joined SunPower in late March. He replaced Tom Werner, who announced his retirement after 18 years with the company.
During the earning call Werner, who will serve as chair of SunPower’s board of directors for the next six months, also flagged solar-plus-storage and standalone storage as strong growth areas.
Over the last two years, SunPower has changed from a vertically integrated global solar provider to a distributed generation solutions company. Against that backdrop, Werner said that SunPower is exploring how to expand its current distributed generation market through storage and services while also addressing market segments like multifamily and affordable housing.
SunPower is also exploring partnerships to expand its reach to a wider dealer network. The hope is that this will enable the company to lower its customer acquisition costs while offering the potential to expand into adjacent markets. One thing that the company is trying to do is “blend together” its dealer network and, where it makes sense, its direct to customer activities, Faricy said.
At the end of the day, the overarching aim is to make solar, storage and EV charging easier for customers, to improve reliability, and to help people save money, Werner said.
SunPower sees an opportunity in the Biden administrations plan to buy clean energy for federal buildings as well as solar adoption in school districts. The company said it has installed more than 150 MW of capacity at almost 40 school districts in the U.S.
SunPower also considers itself well positioned for a standalone storage investment tax credit, given its roughly 3 GW installed base in the residential and commercial space, Faricy said. “Potential refundability will help our light commercial business,” he said.
According to SunPower, demand for its SunVault residential and light commercial storage solution remained high in the first quarter. SunVault experienced strong bookings momentum, but its pace of install fell behind the company’s plans.
“Our storage plan always included a strong second half ramp,” said Norm Taffe, executive vice president. He said the company remains hopeful that it can attain its 2021 goals. SunPower said that it expects lead times to come in closer to expected levels by the end of the second quarter.

The county, which is southwest of Washington, D.C.,  currently has a land-use policy regarding solar projects, which provides guidelines that are not codified into law as they would be in an ordinance. It previously shot down an attempt to create a new zoning district within the county for solar projects.
Of the 30 people who spoke about the proposed plant, 23 opposed it. Some claimed that the project would ruin the rural nature of the area, the environment, and historic resources. The county is the site of the Civil War’s Brandy Station battle. Others voiced concerns regarding construction traffic during the three-year development and construction period, as well as noise from blasting on site. Strata said that construction would take just one year.
According to local press reports, one resident argued against utility-scale solar in the county at large, referring to it as “a redundant, unnecessary technology to start with—a technology that is already antiquated.”
The county board had previously recommended denying the solar proposal on two separate occasions. Following the most recent action in March, Strata Solar doubled the siting agreement to the county to $2 million. A spokesperson also asserted that the project would generate $14 million for the county through revenue-sharing and create 400 construction jobs.
Culpeper County is reviewing a draft solar ordinance that would allow for the future development of utility scale projects. The draft includes a laundry list of project provisions, including:
Had the project been approved, Strata states that it would have started construction in late 2021 and been completed in a year later.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/06/on-site-and-off-site-community-solar-options-whats-right-for-you/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 6, 2021",On-site and off-site community solar options: What’s right for you?,"In an earlier article, we reviewed the three most typical models available to businesses for buying solar power: customer-owned on-site, third-party on-site, and community solar.
Now, let’s dive a little deeper into some key differences between on-site options and the off-site community solar option. Just like last time, we’ll think of community solar as the only off-site option, given its broad availability for many consumers.
Let’s start out with one of the largest demising lines for most businesses: do you own the property, or are you a tenant? If the answer is tenant, in many cases this can nearly end the discussion and take on-site solar off the table.
There are several reasons why this may be the case for renters. For example, electric utilities often don’t hold these discussions with anyone but the owner. Or, the potential for dispute arises when property damage or loss occurs should a leaky roof result or loss of generation occur due to maintenance work not being performed.
Of course, everyone’s situation is different, and maybe you have a great relationship with the landlord, you plan to be in your location for the long haul, and the utility company is willing to work with you; but in most tenants situations, it doesn’t work out.
If you are a building owner, one consideration for going on-site with your system, and one that may require a conversation with your accountant, is the available state and federal incentives. These incentives can significantly offset your system installation price if you qualify and if you are in a taxable position to take advantage of them.
While state programs vary wildly, the federal Investment Tax Credit for solar in 2021 can offset your tax burden by 26% of the installation costs. That credit alone can make payback calculations look much more attractive. And if you are already talking to your accountant, it may be a good time to bring up things like depreciation of assets relative to the solar installation, and maybe even the potential increase in property value related to solar energy measures you are considering installing.
One important factor in deciding between on-site and off-site models is its maintenance and ongoing performance monitoring to make sure you are getting your money’s worth. Theoretical payback calculations go out the window if a system isn’t operating as it should.
Theoretical payback calculations go out the window if a system isn’t operating as it should.

When comparing financial models for on-site and off-site options, make sure you are capturing costs for third-party monitoring and/or maintenance for an on-site system. It also is prudent to make some assumptions for periodic capital costs to replace inverters or other components that can fail over time.
If any or all of these things don’t appeal to you, then that may be a check mark in favor of community solar; in that model, maintenance and performance are taken care of by the system owner.
Other factors have to be weighed into your decision, but these are some major points that should help narrow down your choice. As always, it’s never a bad idea to speak with a knowledgeable professional if you can, and take advantage of their insight and, most importantly, their knowledge of things that haven’t gone well in the past relative to your situation. That way, you can learn from other’s mistakes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/06/sunrun-posts-sharp-q1-revenue-jump-looks-to-ev-cross-sales-opportunities/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,FINANCE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JEAN HAGGERTY,"MAY 6, 2021","Sunrun posts sharp Q1 revenue jump, looks to EV cross-sales opportunities","Sunrun reported that first quarter revenue rose to $334.8 million, 59% higher than Q1-2020, putting the company on a path that just might end up as its best ever.
During an earnings call, Sunrun’s chief financial officer Tom vonReichbauer raised the company’s 2021 solar energy installed growth rate from 20-25% to 25-30%. He said that Sunrun’s execution, scale advantages, differentiated service offering, and competitive position factored into the company’s decision to revise its forecast.
“The strong momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter has continued into 2021,” he said. “Consumer demand for alternatives to an old, expensive and dirty energy infrastructure continue to increase at a rapid pace.”
Lynn Jurich, Sunrun’s CEO, said, that consumer adoption of electric vehicles is likely to drive further solar adoption as those same consumers want to use clean energy to power their vehicles.
“The purchase of an electric vehicle can create a moment where it makes sense to make an investment [in solar or solar plus battery storage].” Homes with electric vehicles consumer around twice the amount of electricity as non-EV homes, she said.
Sunrun is investing in business development efforts around the EV point of sale, she said. To large manufacturers, Sunrun’s nationwide footprint and its broad geographic reach offers an appealing business model for partnerships, she said. One strategy is to further integrate batteries into home energy management systems as the demand to instantly dispatch power from the battery becomes increasingly valuable.
“We’re just in the early innings of people feeling the resiliency pain around outages,” she said. Outages, like those experienced in California and Texas, will drive consumer interest in batteries, she said.
She said that over time, effectively all solar will be paired with storage as battery prices fall and it becomes evident that aggregating batteries is the most effective way to deliver peak power. Batteries can help smooth out intermittency issues of a renewable-based system, she said.
Attachment rates for Sunrun’s Brightbox batteries hit a fresh record in Q1, the company said. Despite supply constraints, Sunrun said it expects more than 100% growth in battery installations in 2021.
“The bad news is that we would be growing [our battery business] even faster, if not for the tightness of the market,” said Edward Fenter, executive chairman.  One impact of the tight market is that end pricing for batteries has not fallen along with input prices for those batteries.
But Jurich said that as manufacturers expand their battery offerings, supply constraints will ease, allowing Sunrun to meet pent-up demand and accelerate adoption.
According to Sunrun, its effort to further electrify homes includes converting natural gas appliances to electric. Sunrun said that this provides another opportunity to increase its share of the home energy wallet and enhance its value to customers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/06/sunrise-brief-michigan-utilities-signal-support-for-raising-a-cap-on-rooftop-solar/,"COMMUNITY,COVID-19,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 6, 2021",Sunrise brief: Michigan utilities signal support for raising a cap on rooftop solar,"Michigan utilities DTE Energy and Consumers Energy said they support raising — but not ending — a cap on rooftop solar that would boost the amount of solar power the utilities can buy from consumers with rooftop solar panels.
Local news reports said that since 2016, state energy law has imposed a 1% cap on how much solar power the utilities may buy from rooftop arrays. The actual amount is based on the utilities’ average peak load for the past five years.
House Bill 4236, introduced in February, would remove the 1% cap, which the utilities say creates a tax on most utility customers to benefit a smaller number of private solar users. As an alternative, the utilities are looking to raise the cap on rooftop solar by an unspecified amount and address the subsidy.
The utilities alleged that solar customers pay about 23% less than the average customer, but also use the grid more. The higher the cap, the utilities reportedly said, the higher the bills for the average customer.
A Berkeley Lab report looked at the financial performance of a Connecticut Green Bank (CGB) solar leasing program, run in partnership with PosiGen, that targets low- and moderate-income customers. The report said that the program successfully reached underserved customers and had “reasonable repayment rates given the credit characteristics of the participants.”
The program reaches many more underserved customers than other PV financing programs in Connecticut. For example, most participants live in census tracts that have a median income of less than 80% of the area median income. In contrast, around 9% of participants in the other Green Bank solar financing programs live in these same census tracts.
And, the majority of participants (56%) in the program that was studied have FICO scores that would generally be considered non-prime (<670). That compared with 2% of participants in the other programs.
The report said that credit, not income, was the primary factor that explains participants’ financial performance. It found that delinquency and annualized losses were higher for PosiGen (2.3% and 0.9%) than for other Connecticut Green Bank programs (1.4% and 0.1%). Across all Green Bank programs, lower credit scores are associated with higher rates of delinquency and loss. Therefore, the report said, participants’ lower credit scores explain much of the program’s higher rates of delinquency and annualized losses.
The Berkeley Lab report said that PosiGen leases performed competitively with market-rate solar and non-solar leases and loans. When compared to securities backed by market-rate PV loans and leases with similar amounts of seasoning, the PosiGen leases had higher delinquency rates but comparable gross loss rates.
It said the similarity in losses is notable given that loss rates for PosiGen leases were higher than those of the other Connecticut Green Bank leases and loans. Rather than the PosiGen leases having high loss rates, other CGB leases and loans had unusually low loss rates.
Comparing PosiGen to non-solar benchmarks, including indices of auto and consumer loans, the report found that the PosiGen leases had “significantly less delinquency” than non-prime auto loans, and had performance comparable to many consumer loans.
Energy production in the United States fell to just below 96 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) in 2020, down more than 5% from 2019’s record high, according to the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA).
The drop from 101.3 quads in 2019 to 95.8 quads in 2020 marked the largest annual decrease in U.S. energy production on record. Economic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic that began during the spring of 2020 drove most of this decrease, EIA said.
Between 2019 and 2020, U.S. coal production fell by 25% to less than 11 quads, its largest annual decrease on record. U.S. coal production in 2020 was less than half what it was at its peak in 1998 as natural gas and renewable sources increased their shares in the electricity generation mix over the years, displacing coal.
U.S. renewable energy production rose 2% between 2019 and 2020 to a record-high 11.8 quads in 2020, EIA said, primarily due to increased electricity generation from wind and solar. In 2019, U.S. renewable energy production surpassed U.S. coal production for the first time. Wind energy production rose by 14% to 3 quads, and U.S. solar energy production grew by 23% to 1.2 quads. U.S. hydroelectric and geothermal energy production stayed flat, while biomass production, including biofuels and wood, fell 8%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/06/solar-employment-fell-but-worker-productivity-rose-in-pandemic-scarred-2020-report-says/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,EMPLOYMENT,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 6, 2021","Solar employment fell but worker productivity rose in pandemic-scarred 2020, report says","The U.S. solar industry employed 231,474 workers in 2020, a 6.7% drop from 2019 due to pandemic restrictions and increased labor productivity, according to the National Solar Jobs Census 2020. The annual report was released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), The Solar Foundation, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), and BW Research.
The report said the drop in jobs was largely split evenly among states. Labor productivity rose in all three market segments, up 19% in the residential sector, 2% in the non-residential sector, and 32% in the utility-scale sector. Less labor-intensive utility-scale installations contributed to a record amount of solar capacity added in 2020, the report said.
However, the pandemic took a toll on residential jobs in the summer, and those jobs did not fully recover by the end of the year.
Labor productivity improvements were a result of growth in average system size, less labor-intensive customer acquisition, and increased competition for skilled labor, the report said. In 2020, the average worker installed more than 200 kW of solar, double the amount in 2017, and more than three times the amount recorded in 2011.
The Solar Foundation has published the National Solar Jobs Census annually since 2010.
Installation and construction-related employment continued to be the largest segment in the industry, representing 67% of all jobs. Of those jobs, 55% were residential, 18% were commercial, 8% community solar, and 19% were utility-scale.

Workers in solar manufacturing jobs represented 14% of the sector’s employment. Sales and distribution and operations and maintenance represented 11% and 4% of all jobs, respectively. Workers in fields like finance, legal, research, advocacy and communications, made up 4% of all U.S. solar workers in 2020.
The solar industry’s five-year streak of job growth ended in 2016 when employment hit more than 260,000. Since then, numbers have trended sideways and even downward, reaching the pre-pandemic level of 248,000 in 2019.
SEIA said that the solar industry is on a course to end its employment plateau and reach 400,000 solar jobs by 2030. Even so, employment will need to top 900,000 workers by 2035 to meet the Biden administration’s clean energy goals. SEIA said it is advocating for policies that will grow clean energy deployment and lay the groundwork to hire and train those workers.
The U.S. solar industry has a unionization rate of 10.3%, which SEIA said is higher than previously estimated and comparable to the economy-wide rate.
The report also showed an increase in solar workforce diversity across nearly every demographic category, including workers identifying as “female,” which now represent 30% of the solar workforce. Representation among women and minority demographic groups has improved since 2015, including a 39% increase for women, 92% increase for Hispanic or Latino workers, 18% increase for Asian American and Pacific Islander workers, and a 73% increase for Black or African American workers.

The solar industry also continues to outpace the rest of the economy in its employment of veterans, which represent 8.7% of the solar workforce, compared to 5.7% in the overall economy.
The report said that lockdowns that began in March 2020 in major solar markets from California to the Mid-Atlantic put a halt to most residential and commercial installations – the largest source of solar jobs – leading to tens of thousands of layoffs and furloughs.
It said that the overall increase in people working from home, using more electricity, and spending less money elsewhere increased interest in solar. This helped solar companies rehire many of their laid-off and furloughed staff.
Utility-scale solar construction was generally allowed to continue work that had already begun, in part due to federal and state guidance that deemed large-scale solar construction to be essential work. This sector never saw the steep employment drops experienced by residential and commercial solar installers, the report said. However, many large solar contractors experienced labor shortages throughout the remainder of 2020.
