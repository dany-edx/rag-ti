https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/26/girls-leadership-academy-adds-rooftop-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,NORTH CAROLINA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 26, 2023",Girls leadership academy adds rooftop solar,"The Girls Leadership Academy of Wilmington (GLOW), N.C. demonstrated leadership in clean energy adoption, adding a 300.3 kW solar project across several roofs.
Cape Fear Solar Systems installed the project, which is comprised of 660 solar panels on three campus buildings. The project was made possible by supporters of the academy and by funds made available through the Duke Energy Solar Rebate Program.
“As a local company, we are committed to helping our community transition towards a more sustainable future, and this solar power installation is a significant step in that direction,” said Robert Parker, chief operating officer, Cape Fear Solar Systems.
The project is expected to save GLOW Academy $33,000 in utility bill costs in the first year and $1.1 million over the 25-year life of the system. This makes more funds available to support educational programs.
The project is expected to generate 410,000 kWh annually. The carbon emissions abated by the project are estimated to be equivalent to taking 65 combustion engine vehicles off the road, powering 57 homes, or sequestering carbon through the planting of 4,800 trees.
“Not only will solar help us save money on our energy bills, but it will also provide a valuable learning opportunity for our students about the importance of sustainability and renewable energy,” said Todd Godbey, chief executive officer, GLOW Academy.
Cape Fear Solar Systems, established in 2007, has designed and installed nearly 4,500 local solar projects to date. The company offers turnkey systems including PV arrays, home batteries, and EV charging stations for both residential and commercial accounts.
Since 2015, solar for schools has tripled, and now 9% of schools source electricity from PV, said a report by Generation180. Energy is second only to teacher salaries when it comes to cost, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and U.S. schools spend more than $6 billion a year on the line item.
“We are striving for all schools and communities, regardless of their size, geography, or wealth, to have access to clean and affordable power,” said Tish Tablan, lead report author and director of Generation180’s Solar For All Schools Program.
The report found the U.S. is home to 8,409 solar schools, with over 6.1 million students in attendance. Across the nation, over 1.6 GW of solar capacity has been installed for schools, enough to power 300,000 homes annually.
Generation180 runs a national campaign for solar advocacy, and offers a toolkit as a step-by-step grassroots organizing guide. Once the school district has buy-in from the community, decision makers can use Generation180’s how-to guide for going solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/26/50-states-of-solar-incentives-nevada/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,NET METERING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEVADA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 26, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Nevada,"Among the top six U.S. states in terms of solar irradiance and blessed with a large land area of more than 110k square miles, it should come as no surprise that Nevada is well suited for ground-mounted or utility-scale solar development. In fact, the Silver State is home to nearly 5.4 GW of solar energy resources, placing it sixth in the U.S. among solar states, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Using data going back to 1998, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows much of the southern portion of Nevada blending into the region of highest solar resource in the nation, with portions of desert land around Las Vegas carrying 5.5 kWh and 5.75 kWh per square meter of daily solar irradiance.
As the state nears a feat of providing enough power from solar to one million homes, the state is at a turning point for solar deployments, with more than 5.8 GW of projected projects to be installed in the next five years, which would more than double its current output, according to SEIA’s data.
Despite its vast utility-scale solar arrays, Nevada consumes six times more energy than it produces, according to the Energy Information Administration. This is likely due to the energy used to power Las Vegas, the 25th most populous city in the country, located in an isolated desert region.  In 2022, solar represented 23% of the state’s energy mix, with natural gas still providing a 64.8% majority, while the remainder came from coal (5.2%), geothermal (5%) and hydroelectric (2%).
Two of the state’s remaining coal plants, located in southern Nevada, closed over the past decade, while a third coal-fired power plant, the 522 MW North Valmy  plant that supplies electricity to northern Nevada, is scheduled to retire in 2025. Coal retirements around the Southwest provide numerous opportunities for utility solar-plus-storage deployments, and Nevada is no exception to this growing trend.
Incentives
Nevada’s original net metering framework dates back to 1997 and was amended eight times, most recently in 2017. Systems of up to 1 MW generating capacity from solar, wind, geothermal, biomass or hydro are eligible, although systems greater than 25 kilowatts (kW) in capacity may be subject to additional costs at the utility’s discretion, according to DSIRE.
Net metering was axed in the state from 2015 to 2016, but its current framework provides surplus electricity generation credited at 95% of the full retail rate until the installed net metering capacity reaches 80 MW.  Currently, credits for new net metering customers will be valued at 75% of the retail rate of electricity. The state’s largest utility NV Energy, operated by Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Energy, allows net metering for systems installed in both of its territories in northern and southern Nevada.
Community solar
Currently Nevada does not have a statewide shared-access community solar program, though for several years utility NV Energy has constructed several utility-provided community facilities to residents in its service territories. A prior community solar bill under SB-392 was vetoed by Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval in June 2017.
Under NV Energy’s Expanded Solar Access Program (ESAP), codified in-state as AB 465, the utility allows a limited number of residential and business customers to use the utility’s shared community solar systems. The framework directed the utility to construct three to 10 solar access programs, with 25% of shared solar programs reserved for low-income customers and 50% reserved for residential customers unable to install rooftop solar.
Noteworthy installation
Located in Boulder City, Nev., Arevon completed construction of the Townsite Solar and Storage project in January 2022. Situated in the southern portion of the state where two of NV Energy’s coal facilities were shuttered, the 232 MW (DC) utility solar and 360 MWh storage facility provides grid stability in a region where energy consumption remains high in Las Vegas, Justin Johnson, chief operating officer of Arevon, told pv magazine USA in early 2023.
Incorporating 528,084 U.S.-made First Solar Series 6 modules, Nextracker tracking hardware and Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries, Townsite produces more than 500,000 MWh per year of clean energy, enough to power 60,000 homes per year, and serves two municipalities in NV Energy’s service territory, including Las Vegas, Johnson said. The facility interconnects underground to a 230 kV substation, before power travels overhead via a tie-in to the Mead Substation near Boulder City.
Construction of the 1,053-acre solar-plus-storage facility took 14 months, spanning from November 2020 to January 2022, with U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm visiting the facility at a January 11, 2022 ribbon-cutting event. Rosendin Electric provided engineering and construction services for Arevon’s project.
The Townsite project was part of Gigawatt 1, a utility-scale solar project portfolio first proposed by Arevon’s predecessor Capital Dynamics, Tenaska Power Services, and Switch in February 2018. The Gigawatt 1 portfolio was designed to generate the lowest cost solar power in Nevada and generate enough clean energy to power nearly one million homes.
Since 2018, NV Energy has purchased power from 14 utility solar projects with about 3.2 GW of total generating capacity, alongside an additional 1.5 GW of nameplate capacity storage systems, according to a utility fact sheet. Over the next two years, the utility is expected to add another 1.2 GW of solar capacity from the Gemini Solar (690 MW) plus storage (1.42 GWh) facility, Southern Bighorn Solar (300 MW) plus storage (540 MWh) facility, and Arrow Canyon Solar (200 MW) plus storage (455 MWh) facility.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/26/enel-finalizing-site-for-3-gw-solar-panel-and-cell-factory-in-the-u-s/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OKLAHOMA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 26, 2023",Enel finalizing site for 3 GW solar panel and cell factory in the U.S.,"Enel North America announced it has identified Oklahoma as the leading candidate for its new solar cell and manufacturing facility. The facility, first announced in November 2022, will be operated through the company’s affiliate, 3Sun USA. 
Initial capacity of the major cell and panel factory is expected to be 3 GW, and Enel stated plans of doubling that capacity to 6 GW at the site. The facility is expected to bring millions of dollars of investment in the state and create more than 1,500 jobs, with production anticipated by late 2024.
“We are currently finalizing our evaluation of prospective sites for the facility, considering factors such as land availability, the presence of a skilled workforce, connections to transportation networks, and tax and incentive structures in making our siting decision,” a spokesperson for Enel told pv magazine.
The U.S. has become increasingly attractive to solar component manufacturers as the $370 billion Inflation Reduction Act is rich with manufacturing incentives, including tax credits for the production of solar cells and panels.
Enel currently holds a $3 billion portfolio of wind power assets in the state and an office in Oklahoma City. “We are excited about the possibility to expand our presence in the state,” Enel said.
The factory would join the Qcells 3.3 GW vertically integrated solar manufacturing site in Georgia as one of the largest U.S. solar manufacturing announcements to date.
(Read: “Reviewing the U.S. solar panel value chain manufacturing capacity”)
“[Oklahoma is] on the one-yard line to land one of the largest economic development deals in our state’s history with Enel, a company that has been invested in our state for over a decade,” said Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt.
Enel said it is considering the Tulsa area for its new facility. 
This article was amended on 4/27/2023 to indicate that Oklahome is the leading candidate, rather than the final choice.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/26/enphase-posts-lower-q1-23-earnings-comments-on-nem-3-0-market-adaption/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BATTERY,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,AUSTRIA,CALIFORNIA,FRANCE,GERMANY,NETHERLANDS,SWITZERLAND,UNITED STATES,WESTERN EUROPE",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 26, 2023","Enphase posts lower Q1 23 earnings, comments on NEM 3.0 market adaptation","Enphase Energy, a residential inverter and energy storage systems producer, posted revenues slightly lower Q1 2023 revenues of $726 million, below the market consensus forecast of $732 million.
The company shipped 1.96 GWdc of microinverters in the first quarter, a 90% increase compared to 1.03 GWdc shipped in Q1 2022. IQ battery shipments of 102 MWh in Q1 2023 were down 15.3% compared to 120.4 MWh shipped a year ago.
Microinverter sales in the U.S. were 21% less in Q1 23 compared to the last quarter of 2022, while California sales were down only 9% lesser in the same timeframe.
As a result of the slight earnings blip, Enphase’s stock traded down 24% today, from $220 per share yesterday to $166.98 per share today.
Lower guidance
Enphase’s management sees Q2 2023 guidance to revenue of $700 million to $750 million, compared to market consensus of $773 million, and expects to ship 80 MWh to 100 MWh of battery storage in Q2 2023, which is noticeably lower compared to 132.4 MWh batteries shipped a year ago.
In prepared remarks, CEO Badri Kothandaraman said there was some impact due to weather in early Q1 2023, “but the NEM 2.0 rush in Q1 more than compensated for it.”
“California installers took advantage of the NEM 2.0 rush and have built up a solar backlog for the next three to four months,” Kothandaraman said. “We believe when the stockholders aren’t expanding their crews to accelerate installation, they’re laser focused on their cash flow due to the high interest rate environment and are looking clarity — for clarity on the NEM 3.0 demand,” he said.
Enphase battery sales were down 23% in Q1 2023 versus Q4 2022, as installers focused on rolling out new solar systems. The CEO said he expects this trend to continue in the next quarter. “After that, we see NEM 3.0 as a net positive for California and expect strong demand to resume for solar plus storage.”
Kothandaraman said Enphase’s third generation IQ battery has a higher charging and discharging rate compared to previous models, which is  “uniquely beneficial for NEM 3.0 systems in California through its ability to generate revenue by exporting into the grid at the appropriate time.”
“We think our battery is going to be perfect for NEM 3.0, because the increased power of the battery will give the ability to export more energy during the time when the grid needs it in August and September, and people can get paid handsomely for it,” Kothandaraman said in response to a question about battery volume declines by Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch.
NEM 3.0 installer base
Enphase provided additional comments on recent forecast changes the company has made due to NEM 3.0 for solar design and software as it applies to its installer base.
In December 2022, the California Public Utilities Commission pulled the plug on the state’s previously lucrative net energy metering framework, voting to cut the average export rate in California from $0.30 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh, with the cuts taking effect on April 15.
Enphase said solar- plus-storage systems under NEM 3.0 can achieve a payback period between six and eight years, depending on the utility. The higher power of its third-generation IQ battery helps to export more energy to the grid and maximize savings,  Kothandaraman said in prepared remarks.
“Selling from NEM 2.0 to NEM 3.0 requires installers to adapt. And now the storage attach is going to be a lot more, it is a change in selling,” Kothandaraman said in response to a California NEM 3.0 question by Deutsche Bank analyst Corinne Blanchard.
“It is a change they are not used to yet. So the next three to four months will be probably well spent in training the installers on how to sell NEM 3.0, because with NEM 3.0 now the consumption of the homeowner is important,” Kothandaraman said.
“My personal opinion is NEM 3.0 — of course, it requires a lot of evangelizing, a lot of selling, but NEM 3.0 will be a catalyst for solar-plus-storage,” Enphase’s executive said.  “Like Germany, if you go look at Germany. Germany, the solar market is over 2 gigawatts, maybe 3 gigawatts right now. The attach rate is over 80%,” he said.
Capacity expansion
Enphase posted 25% higher revenues from its European business, while the U.S. was down 9% in Q1 2023.  The company meanwhile posted to capacity expansion from both sides of the Atlantic, taking stock of both European increase in distributed generation systems in the residential market as well as incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S.
During Q1, the company began shipping microinverters from contract manufacturer Flex in Romania. At the Flex factory Enphase increased global capacity to 6 million microinverters per quarter, enabling improved delivery times to European customers, while addressing the region’s rapid growth and demand for residential solar.
New inverter shipments include to customers in France, Germany and Austria.
In April, Enphase began shipping IQ batteries to new customers in France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, expanding its European presence.
Starting in the Q2 2023, Enphase is adding additional U.S. manufacturing capacity due to the global demand for our products and incentives related to the IRA, which will bring total global quarterly capacity to more than 10 million microinverters exiting 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/26/oregons-largest-solar-farm-at-205-mw-comes-online/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,OREGON",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 26, 2023",Oregon’s largest solar farm at 205 MW comes online,"Avangrid, a power and utility company of the Iberdrola Group, announced the commercial operations of the Pachwáywit Fields solar farm in Gilliam County, Oregon, becoming the largest operating solar farm in Oregon at 205 MW(dc) power capacity.
Pronounced Patch-Why-Wit, meaning “sun” in the Sahaptin language of the Columbia River, Ore.-based Native American tribe, the project is located on ceded lands of the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs.
Previously known as Montague Solar, Pachwáywit Fields will deliver clean, renewable energy to commercial and industrial customers as well as municipalities enrolled in Portland General Electric’s (PGE) Green Future Impact program, allowing them to meet their ambitious sustainability and carbon reduction goals.
Avangrid spokeswoman Mariel Huerta Meza told pv magazine USA the project location was determined based on interconnection, transmission and offtake interest, solar resource, willing landowners, permitting, and constructability. For many years, Avangrid has brought clean energy jobs to Oregon communities near the Boardman power plant, a retiring coal generating facility. The Pachwáywit Fields location is also adjacent to operating Avangrid wind facilities, providing easier interconnectivity with existing infrastructure, she added.
The utility-scale project will provide clean energy to 17 of PGE’s largest customers, which include Intel, Digital Realty, Daimler Trucks North America and Comcast, as well as three universities and ten Oregon municipalities, according to PGE.
Pachwáywit Fields, which began construction in 2021, spans 1,223 acres or 1.9 square miles, and uses 471,156 modules solar panels, 42 TMEIC inverters, 52 WEG power transformers and Array Technologies trackers, providing enough clean power to approximately 40,000 local homes. During construction, the facility created around 300 jobs and brought $1.37 million to the community through local taxes and property lease payments.
Sterling & Wilson served as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor for the project, while Sukut Construction LLC performed civil, piles, and racking installation services.
“Thanks to Avangrid for selecting Gilliam County for this project, we now house the largest solar project in Oregon and will be receiving a significant increase in tax revenue in the future,” said Pat Shannon, Gilliam County Commissioner. “The project has also made Gilliam County the largest producer of combined wind and solar renewable energy in the State of Oregon.”
While the Pachwáywit Fields currently holding title to the largest solar installation in the state, it will soon be unseated by the 400 MW Obsidian Solar Center. Oregon’s Department of Energy has an active list of solar facilities in development and operations by county (AC power).
Oregon ranks 12th in the U.S. for renewable energy output, with 4.9 GW of active solar, wind and storage projects, according to American Clean Power. Oregon’s wind portfolio consists of 4.25 GW of power capacity assets, most of which is operational. About 17.3% of the state’s electricity is produced from renewable energy resources.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/26/south-georgia-106-mw-regenerative-agrivoltaic-project-at-white-oak-pastures/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,GEORGIA",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 26, 2023",South Georgia 106 MW regenerative agrivoltaic project at White Oak Pastures,"Green Power EMC and Silicon Ranch joined local officials, residents and farmers from White Oak Pastures in a ceremonial “flip the switch” ceremony on the 106 MW (AC) Clay Solar Project in Bluffton, Georgia. The energy generated by the Clay Solar Project, which came online late last year, is shared by 30 electric membership corporations (EMC) from across the state and will generate enough reliable, low-cost energy to help serve more than 17,000 EMC households annually.
Silicon Ranch deployed an agrivoltaic model it calls Regenerative Energy at the Clay Solar Project, which was developed after White Oak Pastures owner, Will Harris, introduced Silicon Ranch leadership to the methods of planned livestock grazing and regenerative agricultural practices that his family had been practing for more than two decades. Silicon Ranch now uses the Regenerative Energy model in the design, construction and land management that the company has deployed across thousands of acres it owns and manages across the country. In addition, Silicon Ranch developed and funded a gopher tortoise sanctuary in partnership with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, relocating gopher tortoises to additional land that Silicon Ranch owns in Clay County.
“There are no losers in this deal,” said Will Harris, owner of White Oak Pastures. “The Silicon Ranch land will remain pastoral. Our rural community gets much-needed jobs, and a new renewable energy project to be proud of. With the help of our pre-seeding of the site, Green Power EMC and Silicon Ranch will sequester even more soil carbon and create a record of the ecological impact for others to repeat. In the future, consumers can participate by purchasing the pasture-raised meats that will be grazed by Silicon Ranch.”
White Oak Pastures began regenerative farming in 1995, when the family-run farm moved away from industrial agricultural techniques and treated the farm as a living ecosystem. They raise ten species of humanely treated animals on land that is holistically managed. The farm employs over 155 people who help run the vertically integrated, zero-waste agricultural business.
For the Clay Solar Project, Silicon Ranch selected IEA as the EPC contractor, which hired more than 400 workers during construction, with preference given to the local labor pool and the military veteran community. The Clay County project marks the largest collaborative solar project brought online by Georgia’s electric cooperatives, according to Jeff Pratt, president of Green Power EMC, the renewable energy supplier for 38 EMCs in Georgia. Silicon Ranch is an independent power producer and renewable energy company. Attendees at the event, including State Rep. Gerald Greene, the Clay County Board of Commissioners, the Clay County Development Authority, and others, toured the solar project and learned about the regenerative agriculture practices deployed at the site.
Collectively, the partners’ portfolio now includes nine operational utility-scale solar installations, totaling more than 550 MW (AC) of energy, or enough to help power more than 90,000 EMC households annually. In 2022, Green Power EMC, Silicon Ranch announced 252 MW Georgia solar portfolio that is expected to operational by 2024 and will be owned, operated, and maintained by Silicon Ranch.
Green Power EMC is a not-for-profit cooperative founded in 2001 to support 38 of Georgia’s electric cooperatives in their search for renewable resources. The company negotiates power purchase agreements with Georgia-based renewable resource providers like Silicon Ranch.
Nashville-based Silicon Ranch is an integrated provider of customized renewable energy, carbon and battery storage solutions. The company capped 2022 with a $375 million equity raise completed at the end of the calendar year, It has a portfolio of more than 5 GW of solar and battery storage systems, all of which it owns and operates. Silicon Ranch specializes in utility-scale agrivoltaics, and pairs it with its recently acquired Clearloop, which allows customers to reclaim their carbon footprint in various applications such as farming, commercial or industrial use.
