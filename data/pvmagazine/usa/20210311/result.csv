The measure stops short of allowing solar systems on land zoned for agriculture, but the council is organizing a work-group to determine how to open up those parcels to development.
In other areas of the U.S., community solar developers and farmland owners have developed a symbiotic relationship; the wide-open, usually flat land is ideal for PV projects and landowners stand to receive income that requires no maintenance or labor on their part.
As for where projects can go in Harford County, installations up to 2 MW in capacity are approved for business and residential-zoned land, with up to three installations allowed on one parcel or on connecting parcels of land. Systems can be located no closer than 150 feet from a property line or closer than 200 feet from a dwelling, no taller than 15 feet, require landscape buffering and fences at least 6 feet high, and must be constructed with glare mitigation in mind.
The measure also designates community solar installations as special developments, allowing them to be appealed.

The conservation groups said the roadmap found that these solar installations can be deployed without negatively affecting the region’s natural areas, forests, or farmlands.
According to the roadmap, Long Island has enough low-impact siting potential to host nearly 19.5 GW of solar capacity in the form of mid- to large-scale installations 250 kW and larger. That much solar could produce enough electricity to power 4.8 million New York homes each year, more electricity than the Long Island region uses. Around one-third of that total could be sited on parking lots and rooftops; the other two-thirds would be ground-mounted arrays on land already impacted by human activities.
Long Island has enough low-impact siting potential to host nearly 19.5 GW of solar capacity in the form of mid- to large-scale installations.

The roadmap found that developing even one-quarter (5 GW) of the island’s low-impact solar potential by 2030 could help meet the state’s clean energy goals. That capacity also would deliver around $10 billion in local economic benefits and an additional $5 billion in earnings for workers in the construction industry.
New York State ranks 10th among the states for installed solar capacity with about 2.5 GW.
The roadmap reflects the input of state, local, and county governments; the solar industry; farmers; environmental and community organizations; utility PSEG Long Island; businesses; and academic institutions. The groups began working in 2018 to design a pathway to speed smart siting of mid- to large-scale solar power.
While Long Island already boasts the highest concentration of residential rooftop solar installations in the state, the development of larger solar projects would enable more residents, like renters, to benefit.
More than 90% of Long Islanders surveyed in 2019 said they favored solar development in their communities.

The roadmap’s methodology included three main research components: public surveys, economic analysis of the costs and benefits of solar development, and geospatial analysis.
Public opinion research conducted in 2019 for the report found 92% of surveyed Long Islanders in favor of solar development in their communities.
Spatial data scientists from The Nature Conservancy and Defenders of Wildlife’s Center for Conservation Innovation used mapping techniques to identify low-impact sites for solar arrays in Nassau and Suffolk counties and to show their energy generation potential.
The data is available as a public map that may be used by municipal officials, property owners, and solar developers to identify potential sites that offer the least impact to the environment.

California-based Nextracker filed suit in federal court in June 2020 in a matter titled NEXTracker Inc., v. Solar FlexRack and Northern States Metals Company, Case No. 1:20-cv-00849-MN (Delaware).
Under terms of the settlement agreement, Solar FlexRack will pay Nextracker royalties on qualifying sales revenue of Solar FlexRack’s TDP 2.0 solar tracker and certain related products, services, and components. Other terms were not disclosed.
The lawsuit alleged that FlexRack improperly made use of Nextracker’s patented technology. The patents include U.S. Patent No. 9,806,669, entitled “Single-Axis Follower Support System for a Solar Collector,” and No. 9,970,686, entitled “Balanced Solar Tracker Clamp.”
In a separate statement, Solar FlexRack said it agreed to dismiss claims filed with the Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate Nextracker patent rights that were the subject of the lawsuit. Northern States Metals said it denied ever infringing on any of Nextracker’s patent rights. It said the settlement agreement provided for “only nominal payments” by Northern States, which the company said it agreed to pay to avoid a protracted legal process.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/11/california-city-eyes-fema-grant-for-solarstorage-projects/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MICROGRID,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 11, 2021",California city eyes FEMA grant for solar+storage projects,"Nonprofit group Clean Coalition won a contract to manage design work for solar microgrids at five facilities owned by the city of Camarillo, California, a city of around 65,000 northwest of Los Angeles.
The projects would total about 3.8 MW and are intended to achieve zero net energy over their 30-year life and reduce the cumulative carbon footprint of the five sites by around 88%.
The city is considering two options to fund the projects:
First, it is pursuing a nationwide grant opportunity from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The grant money is for up to $50 million to support projects such as microgrids that reduce risks from natural disasters.
Second, the city is weighing a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a third-party developer that would build, own, and operate the microgrids. The developer would be chosen through a request for proposals (RFP) process.
The microgrids are expected to yield utility bill savings at all five city facilities. They also are expected to bring the city resilience benefits, which the Clean Coalition said it can quantify using a value-of-resilience methodology.
The city earlier approved moving forward on the project, after the Clean Coalition wrote a feasibility study along with TRC Cos., a subcontractor. The recommended hybrid approach carried a price tag of around $16.3 million. It would incorporate solar, storage, and a diesel generator. The microgrids would keep four of the five sites online during multi-day outages, with diesel generators reserved for use only during extended outages.
The largest solar deployment would be around 2.6 MW at the city’s wastewater treatment plant.
A pure solar microgrid, without diesel, was recommended for a public library, which does not need to remain online during an extended outage.
Clean Coalition will now begin the design work for the microgrids, with TRC again acting as a subcontractor. Designs are expected to be completed by the end of July.
The Clean Coalition is a nonprofit that works with utilities, community choice aggregation agencies, municipalities, and other entities on opportunities for local renewables and other distributed energy resources.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/11/city-breaks-ground-on-6-8-mw-community-solar-portfolio/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 11, 2021",City breaks ground on 6.8 MW community solar portfolio,"The City of White Plains, New York, and developer Distributed Solar Development (DSD) have broken ground on a 6.8 MW community solar project portfolio at city-owned sites.
The nine solar projects include a mix of canopy, rooftop, and ground-mount installations at four parking garages, an ice rink, a recycling facility, a park, and the city’s water and sanitation departments. Two of the projects will include energy storage systems.
Construction is expected to finish this fall. When completed, the portfolio will triple the amount of solar energy produced in Westchester County, generating enough to power more than 700 homes annually. It will also represent the largest municipal renewable energy deployment in the county, which is just north of New York City.
When complete, the portfolio will triple the amount of solar energy produced in Westchester County, north of New York City.

The city chose New York-based DSD and signed a multi-year deal to set up a community solar program in conjunction with utility Con Edison. DSD partnered with Community Solar Platform to manage residential and commercial customer sign-up.
In 2014, White Plains was one of the first cities to adopt the New York State Unified Solar Permit, which expedited residential solar permitting. In 2017, it was designated a Clean Energy Community by the New York State Energy Research Development Authority.
DSD will own and maintain the projects. Over the 20-year term of the deal, White Plains expects to collect more than $20 million in rent for hosting the installations.
The projects will help realize Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s goal of installing 6 GW of solar in New York by 2025 as called for in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Enacted in 2019, the act mandated a zero-emissions electricity sector by 2040, including 70% renewable generation by 2030. New York currently ranks 10th in the nation for installed solar capacity, with about 2.5 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/11/sunrise-brief-california-looks-to-electric-vehicles-for-grid-support-this-summer/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 11, 2021",Sunrise brief: California looks to electric vehicles for grid support this summer,"Electric vehicle owners could help support California’s electric power grid starting this summer.
State utility regulators signaled they are open to looking at how EVs could be used as a demand response tool to provide grid support services.
Both Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and Southern California Edison (SCE) have expressed doubt that programs could be set up in time for EVs to be of much help this summer. But other groups, including the California Energy Storage Alliance, backed the idea of offering incentives or payments to EVs that export power to the grid.

The idea came as part of a proposed order by the California Public Utilities Commission that would direct utilities to put in place measures to cut energy demand and boost supply during critical hours of the day both this summer and in 2022. The commission opened a proceeding last November in response to the mid-August 2020 extreme heat event that forced the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to initiate rotating power outages.
Besides looking into how EVs may be used as a grid resource, regulators laid out a number of new initiatives.
One would shift the Critical Peak Pricing event window for residential and non-residential customers to 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. and increase the maximum number of such events allowed each year. The shift would help ensure that price signals are sent during critical hours of a grid emergency.
A second initiative would direct utilities to secure at least an additional 2.5% of supply- and demand-side resources for all customers. The action would increase the planning reserve margin from 15% to 17.5%.
In practice, the change would result in minimum new resource targets of 450 MW for PG&E, 450 MW for SCE, and 100 MW for San Diego Gas & Electric. On the supply side, the proposal would order utilities to give preference to storage contracts, efficiency upgrades to existing generation resources, and short-duration contract terms.
Nautilus Solar Energy said it acquired eight community solar projects in Maine totaling 47.2 MW from ISM Solar Development. The projects are expected to start construction in the third quarter. When fully operational, the projects are expected to generate nearly 70 million kWh annually.
The projects are part of Maine’s Net Energy Billing program. Nautilus will be the long-term owner and also will handle acquiring and managing customer subscriptions.
This marks the third deal between Nautilus and ISM, and it follows Nautilus’s acquisition of a 19.2 MW community solar portfolio from Walden Renewables Development in January.
The U.S. Department of Energy gave a green light to the design and construction of the Grid Storage Launchpad (GSL), a $75 million facility located at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington State. The GSL is intended to speed up the development and deployment of long-duration, low-cost grid energy storage.
The planned $75 million facility will include 30 research laboratories.

In addition to federal funding, the Washington State Department of Commerce pledged $8.3 million for advanced research equipment and specialized instrumentation.
The state’s Department of Commerce has also signed a memorandum of understanding with DOE’s Office of Electricity to promote partnerships to advance grid energy storage technologies, support the energy storage innovation ecosystem, and share best practices with other states.
Sunrun said it priced a securitization of leases and power purchase agreements, known as Sunrun’s solar-as-a-service offering. The securitization consists of a single-tranche of A-rated notes with a $201 million initial balance, representing an 80.0% advance rate. The notes priced at a yield of 2.46%, representing a spread to the benchmark swap rate of 135 basis points (bps). The company said this was a 40 bps improvement from the securitization issued by Vivint Solar in September 2020, which previously was the lowest spread achieved by Sunrun or Vivint Solar.
With a yield of 2.46%, the cost of debt is 172 bps below the average cost of the company’s senior securitized notes. The notes carry a weighted average life of 6.3 years and have a final maturity of January 30, 2052. The notes are backed by 16,686 solar rooftop systems distributed across 17 states and Washington D.C. and 52 utility service territories. The transaction is expected to close by March 17. Credit Suisse served as structuring agent and bookrunner. Truist Securities served as co-manager for the securitization.
