https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/08/ramping-up-u-s-grid-scale-energy-storage/,"EVENTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",Ramping up U.S. grid-scale energy storage,"Energy storage is ramping up at the grid scale to meet an energy mix increasingly dominated by renewables. The U.S. set a new quarterly record for deployment in Q2 this year, installing 1.7 GW / 5.6 GWh of storage, for an average of 3.3 hours of duration. 
This relatively young industry is expected to continue to achieve new quarterly highs for deployment for years to come. Over 66 GW of energy storage is expected to come online through 2027, 83% of which will be at the grid-scale. How will this goal be achieved? 
These questions were addressed in the fourth session at the pv magazine Roundtables US 2023, we were joined by four experts in utility-scale energy storage and solar development. The panel included Darleen DeRosa, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs, Stem Incorporated; George Hershman, chief executive officer of SOLV Energy; Vanessa Witte, senior research analyst, Wood Mackenzie, and Gabe Murtagh, director of markets and technology for the Long Duration Energy Storage Council. 
IRA and new markets 
The conversation began with a reflection on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which was passed just over a year ago. Hershman highlighted the fact that the IRA included an investment tax credit for standalone energy storage projects, a first for storage. This enables much-needed energy storage projects in congested urban areas, which have suitable open spaces for storage, but less room for a co-located solar array. 
DeRosa celebrated the direct pay provision of the IRA, which enables tax-exempt entities to use the investment tax credit as a payment against tax liability, and any remaining balance can be refunded as a cash payment by these entities. This is particularly beneficial for non-profit entities like rural electric co-ops, said DeRosa, which were otherwise unable to participate in the tax credit market pre-IRA. 
Witte shared that mining and manufacturing for energy storage has ramped up massively this year, and prices have declined throughout the year as supplies frees up. Wood Mackenzie projects that there will be an oversupply of both manufacturing and lithium carbonate supply by the end of 2023, providing more much-needed price relief for storage.  
Despite these cost reductions, Witte said that the IRA has boosted demand for other related electrical components, which by effect has caused some sharp increases in price. Medium- and high-voltage equipment, circuitry, transformers, switch gears and GSUs have all gone up in price considerably this year, and procurement lead times have stretched out as demand rises. 
Furthermore, the prevailing wage requirement is increasing costs, some of which are passed on to the developer. Despite these increases, Witte said total system costs have decreased, and she expects this trend to continue. 
Roles for energy storage 
Energy storage serves a multitude of roles from baseload energy storage and dispatch, peak demand response, demand balancing, and more. DeRosa said it is a cliché in the industry that energy storage is the “Swiss army knife” of the energy industry, but it holds true. Energy storage is sought as a flexible technology. 
Murtagh echoed earlier statements that the standalone credit for energy storage is an important change for the market. While storage used to have to be directly tied to solar to receive a tax credit, it is no longer the case.  
This may lead some to consider whether storage would still be supporting rapid decarbonization. Murtagh argued that it does, even if the grid is storing natural gas-fired electricity. By storing normal, marginal cost baseload natural gas generation while solar is in peak production, and dispatching it during peak demand hours later in the day, the system avoids using high-demand based natural gas peaker plants. These plants are highly inefficient, said Murtagh, and unlocking standalone storage will be instrumental in displacing the high-carbon and wasteful peaker plant model. 
Witte said that energy storage projects are also being increasingly targeted by utilities in their integrated resource plans as a flexible tool with strong rates of return for revenues. Grid congestion is an increasingly difficult challenge for utilities, and energy storage often offers a much better rate of return than building more transmission lines in the area. Whether it is in urban areas, rural and remote areas, or other regional congestion constraints, energy storage can be strategically placed as a ready-made solution to the costly problem of grid congestion.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/08/blm-seeks-public-comment-for-5-3-gw-of-solar-projects-in-nevada/,"POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEVADA",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",BLM seeks public comment for 5.3 GW of solar projects in Nevada,"The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is seeking public comment on a proposal as it evaluates the impacts of seven large-scale solar-plus-storage projects called Esmeralda 7.
The seven solar installations are to be located near Tonopah in central Nevada and are expected to generate a total of up to 5.3 GW of electricity, or enough to power approximately 4 million households. In a state that currently has just over 5 GW of solar energy installations, these seven sites would move it far closer to achieving its renewable portfolio standard goal of 50% by 2030.
According to the project description, the location provides a large, flat portion of land suitable for solar development near the proposed NV Energy GreenLink Transmission Line as well as the Esmeralda substation. Using the BLM Solar Energy Environmental Mapper, the land is identified as available solar variance land with strong solar potential. The project description includes decommissioning plans and states that it will will have minimal impact on residents as it is located in a rural area more than 24 miles from the nearest population center in Tonopah and approximately 13 miles from the town of Silver Peak.
The Energy Act of 2020 aims to deploy 25 GW of solar, wind, and geothermal on public lands no later than 2025, as such deployment is integral to meeting the nation’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, as well as Congress’ direction in the Energy Act of 2020 to permit 25 gigawatts of solar.
“The effort is a high priority for BLM Nevada and will be a significant source of renewable energy in support of reaching the country’s clean energy goals,” said Doug Furtado, district manager of Battle Mountain. “I am very proud of the work each of these companies have done working together with my staff to ensure a timely and efficient permitting process for the E7 Solar Projects and we look forward to hearing public comment on the proposal.”
The seven projects are:
The Proposed Project is intended to be constructed in a single phase, although it may be developed in multiple phases depending on power purchase agreements. If constructed all at once, it is expected to take 24 months. A Notice of Intent is expected to be published in the Federal Register next week to open a 30-day public comment period. More information, including maps, planning documents, how to register for virtual public scoping meetings, and instructions on how to submit scoping comments are available at the BLM National NEPA Register.
The BLM manages more than 245 million acres of public land located primarily in 12 western states, including Alaska, with potential to make significant contributions to the nation’s renewable energy portfolio. To promote development of these energy sources, BLM provides sites for environmentally sound development of clean energy on public lands.

The test lab expanded its Product Qualification Program (PQP), which has been offering accelerated testing services since 2012. The PQP provides empirical data for PV module benchmarking and project-level energy yield and financial modules to identify top performing PV modules. 
The PQP testing helps inform the company’s annual PV Module Reliability Scorecard, which provides actionable insights for solar module procurement. Find a report on the most recent module reliability scorecard report here. 
“The improvements we’ve made in this PQP update incorporate critical feedback from our downstream partners, research institutes, module and component manufacturers, and our own test results, keeping the PVEL PQP at the forefront of the growing demand for PV module procurement due diligence,” said Tristan Erion-Lorico, vice president of sales and marketing at PVEL. 
Highlights of changes made to the PQP include: 
Participation in PVEL’s PQP is voluntary for manufacturers and only top-performing module model types are named in the annual PVEL Scorecard. To date, PVEL has tested over 600 balance-of-materials from more than 70 manufacturers for the PV Module PQP.
“The module buying landscape has changed dramatically in recent years with advancements in module technology and new players entering the market, and in response, PVEL has focused our globally-acclaimed test program on addressing these changes,” said Erion-Lorico.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/08/analysis-finds-10-gw-of-solar-could-have-dropped-unserved-load-by-15-during-winter-storm-uri/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,TEXAS",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",Analysis finds 10 GW of solar could have dropped unserved load by 15% during Winter Storm Uri,"Winter Storm Uri of February 2021 resulted in the worst blackouts in recent domestic history. Unusually freezing temperatures in Texas and an aging grid largely reliant on finite energy sources left many residents across the state’s 254 counties without heating and water for several days.
An analysis by electricity grid forum GridLab and energy systems consulting company IdeaSmiths found that the high demand and low supply of energy pushed state grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to call for 20,000 MW of load shed, which cost over $100 billion in power generation expenses as well as infrastructure damage costs. This is due to the loss of over 50,000 MW of power plant capacity and 30,000 MW of natural gas, coal and nuclear capacity.
To understand how an additional 10 GW of utility-scale solar could have decreased the risk of blackouts and associated infrastructure damage, GridLab and IdeaSmiths conducted a study. The findings suggest that while additional solar power wouldn’t have stopped the blackouts, it could have provided one million homes with four to eight hours of electricity each day throughout the storm.
“While dealing with daily outages would still have been challenging, having power for at least part of the day would have made the storm much more bearable and potentially much less costly and deadly,” the study reports.
According to ERCOT, the state’s existing solar fleet at the time contributed 56,000 MWh of the total 4.1 million MWh of energy provided to residents during Winter Storm Uri. However, adding 10 GW of solar-powered electricity would have contributed an additional 150,000 MWh of energy.
“In this scenario, the amount of unserved load drops by almost 15% to about 850,000 MWh,” the study said.

Decreased load shed during Winter Storm Uri with additional solar.
Moreover, the analysis found that the additional solar generation would cover 25% of the total load shed for at least four hours on the worst storm day. During the first day of outages, the extra 10 GW could have reduced the load shed over six hours by a third. This figure would change by half a reduction in load shed during the last day of outages.
The report does not take into account energy storage. It assumes the additional solar is only available while the panels produce electricity. While shorter winter days experience less sunlight, thus making smaller amounts of energy when compared to the summer (approximately 40% to 60% less, according to New York State solar power provider Lighthouse Solar), solar was one of the only forms of generation that continuously exceeded ERCOT’s worst-case expected output during the storm, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at The University of Texas at Austin and CTO of IdeaSmiths.
According to energy analysis and management platform Enverus, ERCOT forecasted a load reach of 75.8 GW during Winter Storm Uri. 
The report states that Texas has added almost 16 GW of solar power to its grid since Winter Storm Uri. The state now leads the country in solar development, as the Solar Energy Industries Association announced a 36 GW build-out early last month. The additional infrastructure is key to decreasing the risks of blackouts and grid congestion this season, as the Texas Farm Bureau forecasts another unseasonably cold and stormy winter due to El Nino brewing in the second half of 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/08/solar-plus-storage-outperforms-diesel-in-military-survivability-analysis/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",Solar-plus-storage outperforms diesel in military survivability analysis,"Analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) demonstrated that solar energy systems, when paired with up to 100 hour long duration energy storage (LDES), outperform military grade emergency diesel generators (EDGs) in both survivability and financial viability in military applications over a fourteen day window.
Historical data comparing the failure rates of EDGs to solar plus LDES technologies demonstrates that, over a 14-day standard military uptime evaluation, solar plus LDES’ survivability probability exceeds 95%, while the diesel generators’ survivability hovers around 80%.

The study also suggests that a more strategically sized solar-plus-storage system could achieve nearly perfect reliability, with uptime approaching 100% over a two-week period. NREL differentiates between the 95%+ ‘Intermediate’ Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), which is currently available for field testing and provides a 38% round-trip efficiency, while the 100% ‘Goal’ BESS, still in the conceptual phase, is expected to provide a 48% round-trip efficiency and cut the energy storage system costs in half. However, since the ‘Goal’ BESS is currently under development, future costs may deviate from these projections.
The analysis also found that the Intermediate solar-plus-storage projects had a positive net present value, meaning that they paid for themselves over the long term. The same could not be said for the EDGs. The theoretical Goal BESS sized projects with 100% uptime over the 14 day window were projected to have a net present value positive over their lifetimes.

NREL presented these findings in the report titled Long-Duration Energy Storage: Resiliency for Military Installations.
Upon release of the report, Michael McGhee, acting deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment & energy resilience at Department of Defense (DOD), emphasized the significance of the NREL evaluation:
Important work by NREL to evaluate LDES, coupled with solar PV (the most likely way to easily and simply generate power without the need for off-base supply chains), to help extend availability of military capabilities at our fixed installations for critical electrical loads. 14 days is our minimum DoD requirement for energy assurance for those needs.
The product modeled is Antora’s heat energy to  thermophotovoltaics BESS. Electricity is used to heat up the storage medium and is later absorbed by thermophotovoltaics panels into electricity, through the usual inverter and grid connection steps. A distinct advantage of this system is the electrical separation of the storage and generation segments, allowing rapid charging from the grid or local solar without affecting thermal PV output.

Currently, Antora’s BESS, with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7, is in beta field testing. NREL’s analysis provides compelling evidence for the DOD to expand field trials on military installations.
Survivability
The study identifies three primary risks for DOD’s EDGs: Failure to start, availability and mean time to failure. It estimates a 0.94% failure-to-start rate, 99.5% availability and 1,100 hours mean time to failure. Diesel system resiliency rates at 70% and 80% over 14 days, assuming a continuous fuel supply, a significant logistical challenge because bases rarely stockpile two weeks’ worth of diesel.
NREL assessed EDGs across three military sites, considering the critical load responsibilities of eight EDGs at Fort Bliss, seven at Patuxent River and four at Holloman AFB. The systems have a responsibility of meeting the site’s critical loads. Across the three sites critical loads were 18.5%, 23.5%, and 37.5% of the military base’s total electrical demand.

For the two-week period, the analysis suggests that operational solar-plus-storage systems during grid outages have a more than 99% probability of continuing to run post-incident, significantly outpacing the diesel generators.
The report recognizes space constraints as a primary limitation for solar on bases, calculating six acres per megawatt of panels. At the Patuxent River naval air station, where land is scarce, upsizing energy storage is a costly necessity, making it more challenging for the energy storage system to cover its costs in the long term. However, most bases do have sufficient space to increase the size of their solar installations.
For this reason, the report also analyzed hybrid systems that combined the solar with the EDGs, finding that in specific instances the results were very strong for survivability. However, the operations and maintenance for these multi-technology systems do pose additional risk and increased costs.
Multiple military branches are already testing long-duration energy storage solutions. For example, a multi-megawatt Cellcube facility, (image featured at the beginning of this article), is under evaluation by the Navy & Marine Corps. Concurrently, the Air Force is examining Redflow’s megawatt-scale zinc-bromine flow battery and control system. This advanced storage equipment, coupled with microgrid software, aims to create a cohesive system at the Air Force base. According to the DOD, Redflow’s solution will enable “a dispatchable solar–plus-storage resource for peak shaving and energy resilience.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/08/electriq-power-expands-into-new-england-with-solar-plus-battery-storage-system-program/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CONNECTICUT",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",Electriq Power expands into New England with solar-plus-battery storage system program,"Electriq Power Holdings, a provider of energy storage and management solutions, has launched a program in the city of Derby, Connecticut to help homeowners access solar-plus-battery solutions regardless of their socioeconomic status.
The program, dubbed PoweredUp Derby, is supported by the city and will contribute to lowering electricity costs and providing back-up power for participants during outages, according to the company. Under the program, homeowners can have a turnkey solar-plus-battery storage system installed in their homes without any upfront costs, income verification, credit score, or property lien requirements. Almost 3,000 homeowners in the city are eligible for the program.
“It gives customers, including those who are low-to-moderate income the ability to access clean, reliable energy whereas traditionally, to install a system like this, you’d have to pay upfront,” CEO Frank Magnotti told pv magazine USA. 
These systems are also compatible with virtual power plant programs and if needed, can be integrated with local programs, he added. 
Electriq Power calls these set-ups ‘Sustainable Community Networks’ (SCNs) and has deployed a number of them in California. This will be its first SCN in the New England region. Both these areas have very high electricity costs – in Connecticut, for example, the retail price of electricity is around 10 cents/kWh higher than the national average, and has risen 17% between 2015 and 2022 – which is one of the reasons the company has targeted them. 
That’s because solar-plus-battery storage systems can help homeowners save money – in part by storing demand when energy is cheap and plentiful, and then discharging it during peak demand periods, when electricity rates are high. Electriq Power estimates that the systems can help save up to 20% in electricity costs annually. 
Electriq Power’s partnership with the city of Derby will help residents lower electricity costs and strengthen their financial position, Roger Salway, the city’s economic director, agreed.
“This is a program that can help residents improve their life, and for us, that’s a win-win,” Salway added. 
Electriq Power is also actively pursuing additional SCN programs throughout New England, and “would welcome the opportunity to work with municipalities and community-based organizations within the area to help them accelerate their sustainability goals, while assisting residents with lowering their electricity bills and being prepared for power outages,” Magnotti said. 
In addition to being a source of back-up power, Electriq Power’s solar-plus-storage systems also have the ability to export power back to the grid. The battery storage component of the system is equipped with operational software that allows owners to participate in virtual power plant programs, Magnotti said, where their stored energy can be exported to the local electrical grid to help alleviate stress when demand is high, helping to prevent a power outage.
In March this year, Electriq Power entered into a multi-year agreement with a U.S.-based clean-energy company for financing estimated to be more than $300 million over 30 months. This funding was reportedly to support the deployment of SCNs in California, which Electriq Power views as a hedge against rising utility rates.
