The projects consist of six front-of-the-meter (FTM) standalone energy storage sites in Staten Island that represent more than 110MWh. The portfolio, expected to be completed by May 2023, will participate in New York’s Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) program, through which NineDot will develop the energy storage sites, own the assets, and monetize the VDER credits.
Stem will procure the storage hardware, and it will also use its Athena smart energy software to optimize VDER credits and other incentive programs to help generate additional project revenues, achieve incentive and warranty compliance, and provide a single platform for NineDot to monitor the portfolio of energy storage sites.
New York has made great strides in renewable energy and energy storage in the past year. In July New York had achieved 3GW of solar capacity, and when combined with projects under development, the milestone represents 95% of the state’s goal to install 6GW of solar by 2025, as mandated in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.
The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates that New York is receiving about 3% of its electricity from solar, a step toward its goal of 100% clean energy use by 2040. The state recently announced plans to double its energy storage target to 600MW by 2030. Carlyle, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, recently committed to invest approximately $100 million in NineDot to build and operate energy storage sites in New York.

The investment marks Greenbacker’s entry into the floatovoltaic market, and will enable Noria to scale its platform, while executing on and expanding its existing pipeline of solar projects.
“Greenbacker is thrilled to partner with Noria to build our presence in the floating solar market,” said Ben Baker, Managing Director and Principal of the Fund. “The Noria team’s track record and innovation in the space, along with their overall solar development expertise, position them well to continue expanding and contributing to a clean energy future.”
Founded in 2018, Noria has developed both floating and traditional solar projects, with over 1GW of constructed capacity in company’s history. The company also has a project pipeline in excess of 200MW, a figure that is expected to expand quickly following this investment.
Noria is also responsible for co-developing the largest floatovoltaic project currently operating in the US. The 4.8MW Healdsburg Floating Solar Project was installed on ponds at the City of Healdsburg’s wastewater treatment plant. It is contracted deliver energy to the city under under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
Noria Energy co-developed the project with White Pine and provided installation services. The behind-the-meter project’s entire installation, from procurement to commissioning, was completed in less than six months.
In 2018, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated that installing floating solar photovoltaics on the more than 24,000 man-made U.S. reservoirs could generate about 10% of the nation’s annual electricity production. The technology also offers generally higher energy production, due to the cooling effects of water and wind. Even so, the floating solar has not reached widespread adoption, due in part to higher overall costs than traditional PV plants.

The facility will be located in Monterrey, Mexico, bringing Centipede’s production closer to Powin’s customers.  
Large-scale procurement of renewable energy and battery energy storage is underway in nearby Texas and California, making the new location a strategic move to provide customers greater supply chain flexibility, said Powin. The Centipede platform will be assembled and tested on site at the Celestica facility before delivery to project locations. 
The nearshoring effort will allow Powin to consolidate its production to one facility and will reduce logistical risks like vessel availability and tariff-related cost volatility, said the company. Powin said it vertically-integrates its business, going deeper into the supply chain to purchase individual components from a variety of suppliers for increased supply chain resilience. 
The modular battery platform was launched in November 2021. The system consists of pre-integrated modular units containing batteries, thermal management equipment, and other safety features. 
Powin said Centipede requires half the time to procure and deploy and uses 30% less space onsite, while reducing lifecycle costs, when compared to contemporary modular storage systems. The Stack750E battery will be the first unit integrated for the Centipede system and is designed for 2-hour to 4-hour durations. The design offers scalability and supports up to 200 MWh storage per acre. The third-generation battery module was updated with new thermal controls, a change that Powin said will create an anticipated 80% reduction in service times.
Mass production of Centipede is expected by Q2 2022, with first deliveries scheduled a year later. Powin said it has secured more than 2 GWh of contracts for the battery system from multinational independent power producers and utilities.
Powin president Geoff Brown said the platform will aid in increased renewables penetration, non-wires alternatives, and power decentralization. “With Centipede we have meticulously reinvented our entire storage ecosystem, including our supply chain, battery hardware, and balance of system design to create [the design],” he said.

As part of the deal, Sol Systems and Microsoft were to invest in grants and investments in under-resourced communities and people disproportionately impacted by climate change. Today Sol Systems announced its first set of investments associated with its Master Power Purchase and Community Impact Agreement with Microsoft. 
Sol Systems has contributed $200,000 to four community-based organizations focused on communities in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington DC and one new national non-profit focused on increasing diversity in the solar industry.  Through the partnership, Sol will invest at least $50 Million in underserved communities across the US, beginning with an investment of approximately $1.2 Million in 2022.
The five initial partner organizations are: GRID Alternatives Mid-Atlantic, PowerCorps PHL, Bright Solar Futures, Groundswell, and Black Owners of Solar Services (BOSS). Each of these partners are focused on workforce development, energy access, or community resiliency. This initial step is intended to lay the groundwork for future partnerships and future investments over the next 20 years.  
According to Yuri Horwitz, co-founder and CEO, Sol Systems, these partnerships are part of the company’s effort to maximize community impact.
Microsoft has a goal of 100% of their electricity consumption matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030, coupled with support for underserved communities. 
The funding for the organizations will be used in various ways. Elijah Perry, executive director of GRID Alternatives Mid-Atlantic, sees the investment as advancing environmental justice “by creating pathways into the solar workforce for people of color and in the most underserved communities in our region.” PowerCorpsPHL trains people in sustainable careers, and Executive Director, Julia Hillengas said that partnering with Sol Systems will “ensure that access to these opportunities continue in our communities.” 
In Baltimore the funding will support the City of Refuge. According to Michelle Moore, CEO of Groundwell, “The solar generation there will also reduce the facility’s own electricity bills – freeing up funds for additional direct services”.

The portfolio was announced by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) as part of a 11.5GW renewable energy procurement plan for the state.
Earlier this month, CPUC issued all load serving entities, including community choice aggregators (CCA) and investor-owned utilities to contract for 11,500MW of online capacity in the state by 2026. The historic mandate was initiated in part due to the decommissioning of the Diablo Canyon nuclear facility, planned for decommissioning in 2025.
(Read: “RFP Alert: 11.5 GW of renewables mandated by CPUC”)
PG&E must procure 2.3GW of renewables to come online between 2023 and 2026. The issuance for energy storage is an effort to support the grid in providing reliable renewable energy like solar PV. The batteries are planned to be lithium-ion with four-hour duration and will serve the grid with 15-year resource adequacy plans. The company shared its project list:
PG&E’s battery storage pipeline now exceeds 3.3GW through 2024, with about 30% of the portfolio to come online through the end of 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/25/big-box-retailers-could-be-50-solar-powered/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 25, 2022",Big box retailers could be 50% solar powered,"Environment America has released an analysis which shows that big box retailers in the United States could host 84TWh worth of solar capacity, and that the stores are already hosting close to 10% of that number. The power would meet approximately 50% of their needs, and could save these locations approximately 25% of the ~$17 billion a year currently spent on electricity bills.
This represents 72 gigawatts of solar capacity – equal to approximately 60% of all solar installed in the nation as of January 1, 2022.

The analysis, Solar on Superstores: Big roofs, big potential for renewable energy, found that there are greater than 100,000 big box stores in the United States. A big box store is one defined as greater than 25,000 square feet and less than 15 stories tall. In total, the stores offer greater than 7.2 billion square feet of space.
Ikea, Walmart, Apple, and Target have already installed a large amount of solar – about 1.4GW. Ikea leads the pack with 54 installations, covering 50% of its electricity, and 90% of its stores. Target has the most capacity with 259MW of volume on greater than 500 locations, while Walmart has installed 194 MW.
Since Apple doesn’t own many large roofs, some of Apple’s installations are ground mounts.

The top ten big box companies could cumulatively install approximately 24% of the 84 TWh of generation potential.
Because Americans will use anything to measure as long as it’s not the metric system, here are a few other ways to think about the numbers. The average Walmart roof is as big as three football fields. Combined, the roofs could power 8 million US homes, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an equivalent of 11.3 million gas powered cars.

The report notes that solar power also lowers the cooling needs of many stores by absorbing or reflecting the heat away. And if these groups were to integrate energy storage into their solar projects, they could add resiliency – or more importantly – attack their demand charges, which represent 30-70% of their electricity bills.
Speaking of resiliency, the states with the two largest collections of big box stores — California and Texas — also have the power grids with the most challenges.
The authors of the report suggest that politicians offer four techniques to help big box stores go solar in a financially viable way:
There are some nuances to installing on these types of roofs. Specifically, the facility managers at these locations care deeply about the quality of their roof seal. Leaks can obviously have very expensive consequences. Additionally, these buildings are constructed in a cost effective manner, which means their structural strength is typically just enough to meet code requirements.
As a result of these two dynamics, solar is managed differently. For instance, these companies generally won’t allow penetrations into the roof membrane – meaning it is a requirement to use systems that are ballasted or glued to the rooftop. Additionally, some big box retailers will redo their roof every five to ten years. This means that the solar racking, and the modules, must come down. The economic and technical realities of this procedure must be considered in the financial models.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/25/solar-tsunami-2022/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",CHRISTIAN ROSELUND,"JANUARY 25, 2022",Solar Tsunami: 2022,"If you want to get an idea of where the solar market in the United States is headed, a good place to start is the process every developer has to go through to plug their project into the grid. Every grid operator has an interconnection queue and you can learn a lot about where the market is going by looking at this public data.
On January 1, 2019, John Weaver and I published the first “Solar Tsunami” article in pv magazine USA. At the time we were really excited about the 139 GWac of solar that we found in the queues of six of the nation’s seven big grid operators. Even if only a small portion of it would get built, it was so much solar!
But 139 GWac is chicken scratch by comparison to what we found at the beginning of this year. In our latest analysis, we found no less than 639 GWac of large-scale solar projects in the queues of the seven wholesale power markets, plus TVA, the Bonneville Power Administration, and two of the nation’s largest investor-owned utilities (Florida Power & Light and Southern Company). If we limit that to the queues we tracked in 2019, it still shows a more than 3x increase.

It’s important to keep in mind that this is not even all the solar projects being planned. The 639 GWac number does not include projects in the queues of dozens of other utilities across the South and Mountain West, or the smaller projects, like rooftop solar, that connect to the distribution grid. And these can add up; in California, distributed solar accounts for around 1/3 of the total capacity online.
But to understand these numbers, you have to also keep in mind that putting a project in the queue does not necessarily mean that it will ever get built. Also, there are plenty of speculative projects. ISO-New England estimates that only 30% of the capacity in its interconnection queue gets built; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in a very detailed 2021 report, estimates that only 16% of the solar projects in grid operator queues have been completed.
Looking only at projects that have gotten approval to connect to the grid gets you closer to what might actually see built in the near term—and this still shows very big numbers. Across the queues tracked in this article, 82GWac of solar projects had been granted interconnection approval.
By comparison, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that 15.5GWac of solar came online in the United States in 2021, and predicts 21.5GW in 2022.
The capacity of projects with interconnection approval is also higher than the amount the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) expects over the next three years. In FERC’s latest update, the Commission found 53GWac of solar projects with a “high probability” of getting built—far more than any other resource.
FERC doesn’t share its methodology of how it determines which projects are most likely to get built. Our team is currently developing our own methodologies so that we can offer more specific numbers in the future.

Digging into the massive volume waiting to be built also tells the story of how solar is moving beyond California to conquer the entire United States. While we don’t yet have final data, 2021 looks like the first year when Texas installed more solar than California. Even more is coming. The 25GWac of solar projects in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid that hold interconnection agreements exceeds the California Independent System Operator’s (CAISO) 21 GW.
And the story goes beyond Texas. The Midwest and Mid-Atlantic are the new hot spots for solar development; the Midcontinent System Operator (MISO) and PJM Interconnection together have more than 26GW of solar projects with interconnection agreements.

Looking at all the active projects in the queue shows an even bigger geographical shift. PJM, the nation’s largest wholesale market, has the largest capacity in its queue and nearly 2x the capacity in ERCOT. And after these two and CAISO, MISO is in third place with 87GW. 
It is important to not infer too much into the numbers of active projects, as speculative projects affect the overall size of queues, and there will be different amounts from queue to queue. Regardless, the sheer volume of projects—with nearly 2,000 active solar projects in PJM’s queue—suggests that these regions could be the next to take off in a big way.
Batteries, Batteries, and More Batteries
The second major trend documented by these queues is the explosion of the battery storage market, and in particular solar + storage. As happened with solar, California is in the lead. Not only does CAISO represent more than 1/3 of the 329GWac of battery projects (including those paired with solar*) that we found in various queues, but more importantly CAISO dominates projects with interconnection agreements. Of the 27GW of battery projects with interconnection agreements, 21 GW were in CAISO’s queue.
The only other region showing large-scale near-term battery deployment is Texas, with 4GWac of projects with interconnection agreements in ERCOT. For the other grid operators there may be many battery projects but few are ready to build; of the 78GW of battery projects in the PJM queue, only 203MW were approved for interconnection. 
The biggest factor to consider here is that it takes time to move through the interconnection process. Many of these battery projects are likely simply too new to show up in the list of projects with approvals. There is also the matter that grid operators are struggling with the large numbers of solar, wind, and battery projects that are being proposed. MISO has already had to make major changes to its queue process to deal with this volume, and other grid operators are also considering doing so.
Another trend that we’re seeing is solar being paired with batteries, but this varies widely by queue. In CAISO, more than 90% of the solar projects in the queue include battery storage, whereas in ISO-New England it is around one quarter and in PJM it is 16%.
Over time, as penetrations of solar increase and policies catch up, we expect to see solar increasingly paired with energy storage, as the peanut butter and chocolate combination of the energy transition. But if California is any indication, as the market evolves there will also be many standalone energy storage projects; in California’s queue there were 270.
That’s all for the January 2022 edition of Solar Tsunami. Stay tuned, as we will be publishing another look at the queues in April, featuring expanded research to bring in more data from more queues.

“The capacity of our factory in Catania is currently only 200MW per year and, in order to achieve the best possible price, we need to increase the scale,” he told pv magazine, referring to the funding that the company recently received from the European Commission to scale up the manufacturing facility. “We are planning to start the works for the enlargement of the factory soon. We will add a new building close to the existing one.”
The factory is expected to begin manufacturing activities by the end of 2023 and to reach full capacity by mid-2024.
“Taking into that 3GW is a relatively small size compared to the huge development of PV in the world, we may consider building another factory with a ‘copy and paste’ approach out of Italy, like for instance in the United States,” Bernabei said. “Once we will have the first factory working, I think it will be a good idea to replicate this facility in other geographies.”
The CEO also revealed that EGP is currently developing its next-generation solar module technology based on tandem cells relying on perovskites. “In five years from now, we will see this technology achieve efficiencies over 30%, which means 50% more compared to the current efficiencies,” he said. “The funds awarded by the EU will not be used only to scale up the factory in southern Italy, but also for further developing our heterojunction technology and the tandem modules. Our competitive advantage here is the technical know-how for these two technologies.”
Bernabei further explained that EGP is betting on other innovations for its solar modules. “We will also work to launch a new technology to replace glass with cheaper plastic,” he stated. “It will enable us to produce lighter panels that will be easier to install.”
EGP deployed around 2.24GW of new solar capacity in 2021, according to data released during the press briefing, and this year it is expected to add another 6.1GW of renewable energy capacity. In the 2022-2024 period, the company should install 21.2GW. “The proportion should be 60% of solar and 40% of wind power,” Bernabei said.
In 2021, EGP deployed 220MW of battery capacity for the first time. “The growth in the pipeline of projects under development was also notable, reaching approximately 370GW, which includes renewables, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and capacity already in execution,” the company said in a statement.
