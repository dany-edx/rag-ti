Topics ranged from 3Sun’s burgeoning product line, their expertise in heterojunction (HJT) technology, future endeavors in Oklahoma, to a sneak peek into their next-gen solar panels.
Historically, 3Sun has produced solar modules exclusively for its parent company, Enel. However, it is now advancing plans to expand its facility in Italy and establish a new manufacturing center in Oklahoma. The strategic decision in May 2023 to make Oklahoma its primary solar hub, with a potential capacity reaching up to 6 GW, has earned the company substantial tax benefits and praise from local officials.
A recurrent question in solar industry forums is the availability of 3Sun’s modules. At the moment, unless you’re an insider at Enel’s development team, purchasing these modules is off the table. However, that exclusivity is about to change. Bolstered by a grant from the European Commission, 3Sun’s 200 MW facility in Catania, Italy, is slated to ramp up production. By 2024, the facility aims to achieve a 3,000 MW annual production capacity, positioning it as Europe’s largest solar panel manufacturing facility.
The European Commission’s pivotal backing in 2011, which enabled Enel to launch a thin film manufacturing facility, underscores this venture as both strategic and promising for the European sector.
The solar efficiency revolution will be heterojunction
Tracing back to 3Sun’s evolution, Bertolino emphasized that the company’s proficiency in manufacturing the current HJT models is rooted in its original experience manufacturing thin film solar modules starting in 2011. HJT and thin film share manufacturing characteristics that differ substantially from silicon modules. The company initiated its shift to HJT panels in 2018, launching their first automated manufacturing line the following year. By early 2020, 3Sun had announced the creation of an HJT solar cell with an efficiency of 24.63%.
Expertise in HJT has empowered the company to announce a commercial solar module with a 25% efficiency earlier this year. Set for release in the coming year, this marvel was showcased at the RE+ event in Las Vegas. For now, it’s poised to be the highest efficiency solar module available in the market.
The residential offshoot from this range promises a peak 24.5% efficiency, while its utility-scale counterpart edges slightly higher at 24.6%. The solar cells based on this product line are G12 sized (210 mm) n-type products.
Bertolino noted that the utility-scale variant, employing a glass-glass encapsulation with 95% bifaciality, degrades at a rate of less than 0.25% per year. As a result, the module retains, under warranty, at least 91.8% of its initial efficiency after 30 years. This rate closely mirrors Meyer Burger’s module degradation rate of 0.2%, a figure confirmed by CEO, Dr. Gunter Erfurt, following 1,000 hours of accelerated testing.
When asked whether 3Sun’s module had a similar ‘near zero’ degradation value in testing, but settled on a reasonable 0.25% due to legal prudence, Bertolino confirmed as much.
Bertolino spoke very highly of his company’s capabilities with HJT technology and its prospective contributions to the future of the industry. This author’s longstanding admiration for HJT technology can be found in our previous article, “The solar efficiency revolution will be heterojunction.”
Coming to America!
In May, 3Sun was awarded up to $180 million in benefits to establish their U.S.-based solar manufacturing facility in Oklahoma. The funding, a surplus from the state’s 2022 budget, requires 3Sun to create a minimum of 1,400 jobs.
Groundbreaking for the HJT manufacturing lines is slated for early 2024. Initial module production is targeted for 2024, with general availability in mid-2025. The production line is anticipated to churn out 1.5 GW of modules in 2025, scaling to 3.0 GW in 2026. Given the right business demand, the facility has the potential to expand to 6 GW.
Bartolino highlighted the strategic importance of the industrial park’s infrastructure in Inola, Oklahoma. The planned factory site is the Tulsa Port of Inola, adjacent to the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation system, ensuring cost-effective and low carbon module transportation.
Questions regarding 3Sun’s perovskite ambitions were met with an intriguing answer: 3Sun aspires to build a perovskite-silicon tandem solar line during the Oklahoma facility’s second phase.
The company recently announced a 27.1% efficiency perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.
3Sun said their experience with HJT solar panels has put them in a position to deliver perovskite-silicon modules. The HJT modules’ production process, especially its vapor deposition phase – a method 3Sun is familiar with from their thin film days – aligns closely with perovskite production. This deposition technique, along with HJT’s lower temperature manufacturing processes, closely resembles the method used to apply perovskite layers to standard silicon solar cells.
Bartolino stated that 3Sun’s perovskite-silicon manufacturing is “very well advanced”, noting that the company has full-sized perovskite-silicon cells. In contrast, other entities with higher efficiency records operate with smaller research cells. Bartolino informed pv magazine USA that 3Sun is currently fine-tuning its machine line, which seamlessly integrates with its extant HJT technology.
The company speculates that the perovskite + silicon production line and product might be operational in 2025, with full-scale production by the end of 2026. Deliveries are possible by 2027.

The projects are expected to deliver electricity to customers in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) service territory.
Golden Triangle I is a 200 MWac project with 50 MW of battery storage, expected to be completed in summer 2024. Golden Triangle II, a 150 MWac project contains 50 MW of battery storage, planned to be complete in spring 2024. These projects are located in Lowndes County, Mississippi.
The third phase is called Optimist, and this 200 MWac project with 50 MW battery storage is located in Clay County and has a projected completion date of mid-2025.
The utility-scale battery storage for each site is provided by Mitsubishi Power Americas.
About 1.5 million solar modules will be installed on the sites, which are expected to generate the equivalent electricity of the demand of 126,000 homes.
Oirigis Energy is the developer, construction firm, and operator of the solar and storage assets. The projects will deliver electricity to TVA via power purchase agreements.
“Projects like these, ensure we can continue to provide affordable, reliable, resilient and sustainable energy to fuel the region’s economic growth,” said Jeremy Fisher, senior vice president commercial energy solutions with TVA.
Over $106 million in near-term economic benefits are expected due to construction and job creation. Over the life of the project, an estimated $145 million in regional economic benefits are expected to be generated.
“Our office has worked continually with both TVA and Origis through all phases of this project. These investments provide a unique diversification to our tax base and upon completion provide additional tax revenue to the counties and the schools,” said Joe Max Higgins, chief executive officer, Golden Triangle Development Link.
 RES is providing construction services to Origis for the portfolio, employing about 300 people over the course of the three projects. Upon completion, Origis Energy will employ about 9 on-site jobs over the 35+ years expected life of the projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/13/solar-cell-prices-are-expected-to-hit-fresh-record-lows-following-chinas-golden-week/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 13, 2023",Solar cell prices are expected to hit fresh record lows following China’s Golden Week,"Solar cell prices stopped declining this week – arresting three straight weeks of prior decline – due to limited activities during China’s Golden Week holiday. According to OPIS data, prices have momentarily stabilized at their lowest levels ever this week – Mono M10 and G12 cell prices stayed unchanged at $0.0814 per W and $0.0836/W, respectively; TOPcon M10 cell price this week likewise remained at $0.0856/W.
The majority of industry sources concurred that following the holiday, new record lows for cell prices can be expected. A seller source predicts that the price of P-type M10 cells will decline to around CNY 0.61 ($0.085)/W after the holiday, while the price of TOPCon M10 cells will continue to carry a CNY0.05 ($0.0069)/W premium over p-type M10 cells.

 
The pricing differential between p-type and n-type M10 cells is confirmed by a second seller source, who predicts that after the holiday, p-type M10 cells may drop to around CNY0.63 ($0.088)/W while TOPCon M10 cells would drop to CNY0.68 ($0.094)/W
According to a market observer, cell producers are currently maintaining a profit margin of about 10-15%. This source therefore expected that there is still room for cell prices to decrease after the holiday.
Insiders anticipate a fall in cell prices, mostly as a result of a decline in demand for cells from downstream module producers due to certain module makers curtailing production. Additionally, module prices are also in the bearish sentiments due to the severe oversupply, as a result, cell prices will inescapably be influenced by downstream pessimism.
A source from an integrated player, on the other hand, expressed skepticism over the prediction that cell prices will continue decreasing following the holiday. “After all, the price of cells has already decreased by about 14% over the last three weeks, which is a significant amount,” the source explained.
The price of polysilicon has a significant role in determining how much cell price will drop after the holiday, a source from a specialized cell manufacturer concluded. There isn’t much room for wafer and cell prices to decrease at present. More significant price cuts must wait until polysilicon’s price drop frees up price reduction space for wafers and cells, the source added.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/13/aqua-metals-6k-plan-first-circular-supply-chain-for-lithium-batteries-in-the-u-s/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,TENNESSEE",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"OCTOBER 13, 2023","Aqua Metals, 6K plan first circular supply chain for lithium batteries in the U.S.","Lithium-ion battery recycler Aqua Metals and 6K Energy plan to create the first “truly sustainable circular supply chain” for domestic lithium-ion battery manufacturing in the U.S.
The two companies have signed a multi-part memorandum of understanding, and are planning a co-located facility at a site in Jackson, Tennessee. This facility will be the first of its kind, producing low-carbon cathode active materials for batteries, using raw materials from domestically-sourced batteries that are at the end of their life, as well as scrap materials from manufacturing partners. 
The company expects to construct the co-located facility starting in 2026, as 6K Energy ramps up their cathode manufacturing operations and demand for critical battery metals, Steve Cotton, president and CEO of Aqua Metals told pv magazine USA.  
“In the interim, we are building out our first commercial scale recycling campus in Tahoe-Reno, capable of processing 10,000 tonnes per year of battery material when at full capacity, and this facility will supply recycled materials for low-carbon cathode active material (CAM) manufacturing,” Cotton added. 
At the shared facility, Aqua Metals will transform spent batteries and manufacturing scraps into raw materials for 6K Energy’s proprietary cathode active materials manufacturing process. The former’s technology is based on using electricity to recover critical materials from end-of-life lithium-ion batteries, a process it estimates will reduce landfill waste from current battery recycling processes by 95%. 
The companies’ partnership will foster domestic job growth, technological advancement, and a sustainable footprint in the global lithium battery market, building a robust supply chain for the technologies critical to combating climate change at a lower cost than China, said Sam Trinch, group president at 6K Energy. 
The American lithium battery recycling industry is just getting started, and Aqua Metals is one of only two operational lithium battery recyclers today. But this model of meeting the growing demand for low-carbon battery materials with a modular recycling technology is highly replicable and can be scaled to fit other battery manufacturing plants, according to Cotton. There are many benefits to co-locating recycling operations right alongside other facilities in the battery supply chain, he added. 
“One of the main sources of material for recycling in the coming decade will be manufacturing scraps and out of spec batteries – and eliminating the distance these materials travel is a significant cost and emissions savings,” he said. Integrated facilities like these also offer operational efficiencies, lowering production costs and reducing carbon emissions even further, Cotton said. 
In September, battery supplier Dragonfly Energy announced it had manufactured a lithium-based battery cell using lithium hydroxide pulled by Aqua Metals from recycled batteries. The lithium hydroxide was recovered from a mixture of crushed and shredded battery cells – called “black mass” – which contains valuable raw materials, including lithium. The two companies are working on clothing the “lithium loop” in Nevada, a state that is believed to have the largest source of lithium in North America, as well as a quickly growing market for electric vehicles and energy storage systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/13/pope-francis-says-the-renewables-transition-is-happening-too-slowly/,"SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 13, 2023",Pope Francis says the renewables transition is happening too slowly,"Pope Francis, head of the Roman Catholic Church, said that the “necessary transition” to clean energy and the “abandonment” of fossil fuels are not progressing “at the necessary speed,” in a statement described as an “exhortation to all people of good will on the climate crisis.”
The statement, with the Latin title “Laudate Deum,” comes before next month’s conference of 197 nations that have signed on to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Pope expressed hope that next month’s Conference of the Parties (COP), to be held in the United Arab Emirates, will be “a historic event,” setting “binding” terms for the energy transition that are “efficient, obligatory and readily monitored,” and beginning a new process that is “drastic, intense, and counts on the commitment of all.”
“That is not what has happened so far” at the 27 previous COP gatherings, the Pope said, yet “only in this concrete manner will it be possible” to significantly reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
Catholics constitute 23% of the U.S. population. Various organizational levels of the U.S. Catholic Church, from local parish churches to metropolitan-area archdioceses, are promoting the Pope’s statement, as are national Catholic publications.
The Pope said he encounters “certain dismissive and scarcely reasonable opinions, even within the Catholic Church” about the correlation between global climate phenomena and “the accelerated increase” in greenhouse gas emissions. The Pope’s statement walks through scientific evidence of that correlation.
The Pope quoted a 2019 statement by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops saying that “our care for one another and our care for the earth are intimately bound together. The effects of climate change are borne by the most vulnerable people, whether at home or around the world.”
Pope Francis’s 2015 climate statement “Laudato Si” and his visit to the U.S. later that year were associated with an increasing percentage of Americans saying they are concerned about global warming, said the Yale Program on Climate Change Communications in a report titled “The Francis Effect.” After the Pope’s 2015 visit, 59% of Americans and 64% of American Catholics said they were concerned about global warming, up 8 points and 11 points, respectively, compared to survey results before the Pope’s 2015 climate statement.
The Pope highlighted the work of activists at COP gatherings, saying that at these conferences “the actions of groups negatively portrayed as ‘radicalized’ tend to attract attention. But in reality they are filling a space left empty by society as a whole, which ought to exercise a healthy ‘pressure,’ since every family ought to realize that the future of their children is at stake.”
The statement’s title “Laudate Deum” translates to “Praise God” in English.
