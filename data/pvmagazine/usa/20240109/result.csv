The Fusion of Functionality in BIPV
Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) holds huge potential for the future of the building industry, as it represents a pivotal intersection of electricity generation and building functionality. However, to identify the potential of BIPV installations in detail, the need for an evaluation tool becomes apparent. Recognizing the multifunctional nature of BIPV installations—acting as electricity generators, building components, and contributors to visual aesthetics—the IEA-PVPS Task 15 adopts a multidimensional approach for comprehensive evaluation.
Defining and Rating of Performance Indicators
To assess the quality and efficiency of BIPV systems, a set of performance indicators (PIs) was established in four categories: Economic, Energy-relevant, Environmental, and Optical/Visual Appearance. The PIs range from BIPV building element costs to recognizability and glare risk (see Figure 1).
Subsequently, a numerical rating system, ranging from 1 to 5, was established for each performance indicator. The process involved defining possible ranges based on real installations, setting a scale for each PI, calculating mean-rated PIs for each category, and visualizing the results in a newly developed diagram format (see Figure 2 for an example). This step ensures a quantifiable and comparative analysis of diverse BIPV installations.
Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Tool
The heart of the methodology lies in the Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Tool. This tool requires specific data on installation sites (geographical, climatic, orientation, inclination, shading), PV modules (datasheet), BIPV installations (application and system category, sub-system, building type, total installed area and total nominal power of the BIPV building skin, photos), and rated performance indicators. By combining general information and performance indicators, stakeholders can assess the multifunctional performance of a BIPV installation in terms of energy, economy, environment, and visual appearance.
Harmonized vocabulary for BIPV installations
To ensure a standardized approach, a harmonized vocabulary for BIPV installation types has been developed by IEA PVPS Task 15 experts. This optimized hierarchical approach serves as a reference for the classification of BIPV building envelope technology, facilitating a comprehensive breakdown into individual parts (see Figure 3).
Multi-Functional Evaluation of BIPV Cases
To validate the tool, real BIPV installations representing various building typologies were identified. These included a multifamily apartment complex with a camouflaged BIPV facade, an office building with BIPV elements, BIPV roofs of terrace houses, and a multifamily apartment block with BIPV parapets and window balustrades. Experts conducted a preliminary analysis of representative building typologies to test and validate the methodology. The assessment covered BIPV facades, roofs, and external devices. Results showcased the tool’s efficacy in providing a comprehensive understanding of BIPV installations, including visual performance.
Challenges and Difficulties
The journey towards a comprehensive BIPV evaluation methodology was not without challenges. Issues such as data availability, the subjective nature of aesthetic assessments, and the evaluation of lighthouse projects were encountered. Despite these challenges, the methodology underwent several improvement iterations, providing valuable insights into real-world applications.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
IEA-PVPS Task 15’s multidimensional assessment methodology for BIPV systems represents a significant step forward. Through continuous learning cycles and real-world testing, the challenges posed by data availability, visual assessments, and project evaluation have been addressed. The methodology, showcased through real BIPV installations, serves as a valuable resource for architects, developers, and stakeholders involved in the design process of BIPV projects. As the BIPV landscape continues to evolve, this innovative evaluation approach paves the way for more effective and sustainable integration of photovoltaics into building structures.

The organization entered a 25-year service agreement with solar installer Secure Solar Futures.
The array is installed on the Natelli Family Y in Ijamsville, Maryland. It is comprised of 544 monocrystalline panels from JinkoSolar. It is expected to produce 294 MWh in its first year of operations, covering roughly 18% of the facility’s electricity usage. YMCA will continue to source the rest of its electricity from the local utility.
The YMCA location is expected to abate 2,997 metric tons of carbon emissions and save $97,226 on electricity over the 25-year power purchase agreement. At the end of the service agreement, YMCA can take ownership of the solar array, which can continue to produce electricity for another decade beyond the agreement.
Secure Solar Futures also installed an electric vehicle charger on site. The Level 2 charging station is manufactured by ChargePoint, offering two charging ports for members and nonmembers. The first two hours of charging are offered for free, and after that the fee is $3 per hour and $0.25 per kWh of power used.
“The YMCA of Frederick County is generating solar power at its facility for use on the electricity grid while making clean energy available to local drivers simultaneously,” said Secure Solar Futures CEO, Ryan McAllister. “It’s an increasingly popular approach among our customers, and we expect to see even more integration of on-site solar and electric transportation as our company expands into the state of Maryland.”
In 2023, Secure Solar Futures announced the Coalfield Solar Fund in partnership with Intuit and the National Energy Education Development Project (NEED) to offer up to $5 million in grants to public schools and community colleges that sign solar power purchase agreements (PPA) in coalfield regions of West Virginia and Southwest Virginia. The company also partnered with the Virginia Community College System, signing several solar PPAs.
The company was also involved in the development of West Virginia Senate Bill 544, sponsored by Senator Ben Queen, which increased the solar PPA cap from 500 kW to 1 MW in the state of West Virginia.

The program supports electric vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-X charging and discharging technologies. 
The competitive grant funds will support the deployment of home energy stations throughout California. Dcbel will collaborate with UC Davis, Berkeley Laboratory, Southern California Edison, Sonoma Clean Power, and Grid Alternatives, to execute the project. 
The REDWDS program focuses on funding projects that enable customers to readily respond to dynamic signals on the electric grid, minimizing charging and discharging costs for electric vehicles at home. 
Dcbel’s solution is comprised of a home energy station, a UL certified bidirectional DC electric vehicle charger that doubles as a solar and stationary battery inverter. The home energy system is controlled by the company’s edge computing platform, called Orchestrate, which plans whether to use, store, or sell electricity based on grid price signals and homeowner preferences. The company’s solution also includes Dcbel Chorus, a real-time technical aggregation Internet of Things (IoT) software platform. 
“With minimal intervention, [home energy station] customers will find their EV charged and ready when they need it using the least costly energy source available,” said Dcbel. “Customers can subscribe seamlessly and safely to multiple energy programs provided by utilities, energy service providers, microgrids and virtual power plants through Dcbel’s app-based platform.” 
The company said customers can partake in vehicle-to-grid incentive programs by browsing the Dcbel app hub, making it easier for customers to access such programs. 
In addition to revenues provided by dynamic grid response, Dcbel said its customers can benefit from increased energy independence and resilience. The home energy station can power homes through grid outages lasting multiple days by leveraging the large amount of energy stored in EVs. For increased energy independence, customers can connect solar panels and a home battery to the home energy station. 
“Our all-in-one solution is ready to change the way homes interact with the grid and, crucially, allows people to make use of their EV’s energy for backup power and to discharge their EV battery to provide grid flexibility services,” said Dan Fletcher, chief business development officer, Dcbel.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/09/plus-power-to-construct-175-mw-350-mwh-energy-storage-in-maine/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MAINE",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JANUARY 9, 2024",Plus Power to construct 175 MW / 350 MWh energy storage in Maine,"Battery energy storage system (BESS) developer Plus Power LLC is constructing Cross Town, the 350 MWh facility located at Gorham Industrial Park in Gorham, Maine, just outside of Portland.
The project is intended to enhance the New England grid, adding 175 MW of storage and stimulating a faster and more extensive integration of renewable energy into the six regional states. Plus Power also states that Cross Town will help Maine meet its decarbonization goals of generating 80% of its electricity from renewables by 2030, followed by 100% by 2050.
According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, as of September 2023, New England had about 330 MW of operational BESS, primarily comprised of small projects with up to 5 MW of storage. However, completing the Cross Town project pushes the Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE) a step closer to ensuring the region meets its reliability needs.
According to ISO-NE, these requirements are centered around ensuring the continuous build-out of transmission infrastructure to sustain power system reliability through scaling an efficient wholesale electricity marketplace.
ISO-NE’s Forward Capacity Market is a yearly auction that verifies that the New England power system will have enough electricity resources to meet future demands. It focuses on promoting economic investment in crucial supply and demand capacity resources needed three years in advance. Each year, suppliers compete to obtain a capacity supply obligation (CSO) for upcoming projects. Those who clear the auction, receive capacity payments in exchange for a commitment to provide resources when called upon.
In 2021, Cross Town cleared the ISO-NE Forward Capacity Market, securing a seven-year CSO to provide energy storage for ISO-NE. The site is located just outside of a flood plain, and Plus Power received a permit from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP) stating that the project met applicable standards regarding the reduction of negative impacts on stormwater management, groundwater protection, infrastructure, wildlife and fisheries, noise, and unusual natural areas.
With approval from the Town of Gorham, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, MDEP, a National Resources Protection Act permit, among others, Plus Power began constructing Cross Town in Fall 2023. The site is expected to start commercial operation in Fall 2025.
This project is part of Plus Power’s growing portfolio of utility-scale lithium-ion BESS across 25 states and Canada. The company says it has 10 GW of interconnection capacity in transmission interconnection queues.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/09/nautilus-solar-acquires-16-community-solar-projects-in-illinois/,"ACQUISITIONS,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ILLINOIS",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 9, 2024",Nautilus Solar acquires 16 community solar projects in Illinois  ,"Nautilus Solar Energy LLC has acquired a 75.6 MW portfolio consisting of 16 community solar projects in Illinois, a state that holds a healthy mix residential, commercial, and community solar installations.
The projects are located throughout Illinois and are projected to achieve operation between 2025 and 2027.
“This acquisition marks a significant commitment to the Illinois market and is a pivotal step towards expanding Nautilus’s overall footprint in the Midwest. The scale of this acquisition underlines Nautilus’s capabilities and reaffirms our position as a leading community solar company with projects and subscribers located across the country,” said Jeff Lee, business development director at Nautilus. 
The portfolio of projects is qualified under the Illinois Shines program, also known as the Adjustable Block Program, which created renewable energy certificate incentives with 25% going toward the development of community solar with benefits also being extended to subscribers. The program aims to deploy 400 MW of community solar projects by 2030.
The nearly 76 MW portfolio is expected to generate enough clean energy to serve the needs of approximately 10,000 homes and commercial businesses. Nautilus is overseeing construction, will be the long-term owner and will be responsible for acquiring and managing customer subscriptions. Nautilus reports that the projects will enable Ameren and ComEd customers to save on their electric bills. In addition, the portfolio supports the state’s ambitious Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which requires 100% carbon-free energy by 2045.
“Illinois’ ambitious renewable energy targets are a testament to its commitment to environment and energy equity. At Nautilus, we are proud to lead this transition,” added Eric Paul, vice president of Partner Development. “Our focus is not just on producing clean energy but ensuring that the benefits, particularly the cost savings, reach every Illinoisan, especially those from low-to-moderate income backgrounds and historically disadvantaged communities.” 
Nautilus Solar, owned by Power Sustainable, a wholly owned subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada, operates and manages solar farms in 10 states and is known for its portfolio acquisitions in leading markets. For example, Nautilus acquired up to twelve community solar projects in Minnesota  totaling 16.8 MW. It acquired two community solar portfolios totaling 26.2 MW in Maine from BNRG Maine LLC. The company reached an agreement to acquire a nine-project portfolio with 54 MW of community solar assets in New York from Seaboard Solar. And it acquired two community solar portfolios in Maryland totaling 23 MW, comprised of six projects spread across the state. The Illinois acquisition marks its entry into the Midwest.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/09/rain-insufficient-for-removing-tree-pollen-from-solar-panels/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 9, 2024",Rain insufficient for removing tree pollen from solar panels,"A collaborative study by experts from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Duke University, Solar Unsoiled Inc., the University of Jaén in Spain, and Sapienza University of Rome, has revisited the assumption that rainfall alone can effectively clean solar panels. In their examination of different pollens at five solar power facilities in North Carolina, the researchers discovered that pollen from tree species such as cypress, juniper, pine, and oak proved particularly stubborn in adhering to solar panels.

During peak pollen seasons, variations in pollen types led to a decrease in solar panel efficiency by as much as 15%. Despite the rain ‘cleanings’, unwashed panels suffered approximately 10% annual production loss. Manual cleaning with a wet brush, after rain, showed a performance increase of 5% to 11%.

The facilities studied, ranging in capacity from 4 to 9 MW, face due south at a 20° angle and have been operational for approximately seven years.
The researchers initially expected minimal soiling losses due to the area’s relatively high average rainfall and short dry spells. In testing, however, they found that the soiling and associated generation losses exceeded their expectations.
This data set is not universally applicable nationwide, as pollen types and intensities vary across regions. Deserts primarily contend with dust, but agricultural areas in these regions also face pollen challenges during certain seasons. Facilities on the East Coast, characterized by a generally wetter climate and dense tree cover, consistently encounter pollen-related challenges.
In this study, tree pollen was the predominant type affecting the sites during the spring, significantly impacting solar generation. The researchers observed that grass and weed pollens, which peak towards summer’s end, did not correlate with the highest soiling losses on solar panels, unlike tree pollens.
Source: NREL
NREL and Solar Unsoiled will continue their research to gain a deeper understanding of the issue. They noted that pollen particles from different trees have varying adhesion levels, influenced by factors such as the size and shape of the grains, the nature of the surfaces they stick to, their compositional properties, and environmental conditions like relative humidity and wind patterns.
Carla Dawson of Soilar Tech, PV soiling mitigation consultants, suggests using a soft, rather than a hard brush when cleaning pollen from solar modules. She states, “Due to the high level of cementation generally associated with pollen compared to dust, it is commonplace to clean with brushes with stiff bristles.”
While stiff bristles can remove pollen in one pass, it can create permanent damage to the anti-reflective coatings on solar panels, “creating a long-term permanent loss,” she said.
Dawson concluded that it’s best to clean panels with high levels of pollen deposition with soft bristles, “and they should  have been tested in laboratories that measure anti-reflective coating degradation levels and water with low TDS levels.”
The paper, An Investigation on the Pollen-Induced Soiling Losses in Utility-Scale PV Plants, appears in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.
