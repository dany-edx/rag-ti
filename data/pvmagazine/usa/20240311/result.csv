Lyten’s 800V lithium-sulfur batteries feature Lyten 3D graphene, a material that eliminates the need for nickel, cobalt or manganese in a battery cell. The compound is created by converting greenhouse gasses into solid carbon and hydrogen gas. Lyten states the hydrogen gas is repurposed as a clean fuel while the carbon is separated and formed into a three-dimensional substance called graphene. The battery manufacturer refers to graphene as a supermaterial due to its tunability. Graphene’s atoms can be engineered to bond with various elements on the periodic table, reducing the risk of thermal runaway while optimizing energy density, elasticity and lightness, among other variables.  
Lyten said its 800V lithium-sulfur batteries offer an energy density that ranges between 3000 Wh/kg and 600 Wh/kg. That’s about two times the energy density of batteries made from lithium-ion chemistries, including lithium-ion phosphate and lithium-ion-nickel-manganese-cobalt, which have an energy density that ranges between 100 Wh/kg and 400Wh/kg, according to the Clean Energy Institute at the University of Washington.
Lyten projects its batteries will result in a 170 kg weight reduction compared to applications using lithium-ion batteries due to the lightness of the 800 V product’s chemistry. Research published in Stanford Advanced Materials states that the lightweight nature of sulfur reduces the overall weight of the vehicle, thus enhancing efficiency.
Designing a cathode without nickel, cobalt, and manganese and an anode without graphite also has social, supply chain and economic benefits. Lyten does not need to rely on sourcing cobalt, a material that continues to raise concerns around environmental degradation and human rights abuses. The manufacturer’s graphene development process reduces the miles from resource extraction to final assembly from 50,000 to 3000, the company reports, as all materials are sourced and manufactured in the U.S.
“We believe our lithium-sulfur batteries represent the future battery platform of electric vehicles, sourced through entirely local supply chains and manufactured in the U.S., Europe, and eventually around the globe,” said Dan Cook, Lyten’s CEO and co-founder. “We’ve been able to dramatically accelerate the development timeline of lithium-sulfur through the discovery and commercialization of our graphene innovation.”
In June 2023, Lyten opened its first lithium-sulfur production facility in San Jose, California. The campus features a Graphene Lab and an automated lithium-sulfur production line that develops 200,000 cells each year. 
Lyten is working toward delivering commercial cells to non-EV and government consumers throughout the rest of this year. The company is configuring its graphene material to develop more lightweight solutions that charge faster and offer increased conductivity, optimum resistivity and permeability. Lyten is testing how to restore recycled materials to virgin properties while replacing non-recyclable polymers and composites with Graphene Polyethylene. Lyten says the substance offers over 40% more stiffness and over 22% more flexibility. 
The company reports it has raised over $410 million in funding to date, receiving investments from organizations including automobile corporation Stellantis, FedEx, and the multi-national product conglomerate Honeywell.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/11/california-has-become-rooftop-solar-and-batteries-nem-esis/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-11,California has become rooftop solar and batteries NEM-esis,"From pv magazine 3/24
California, once known as a clean energy leader, has fallen off track with its clean energy goals. That was the view shared recently by the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) during a panel discussion at the Intersolar North America 2024 conference in San Diego, California.
The state passed a bill in 2018 targeting 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. Governor Gavin Newsom recently set an interim target of 90% carbon-free electricity by 2035, further accelerating the ambition for deployment.
Considering California’s lofty goals for whole-home electrification and a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, electricity demand is expected to rise sharply, making the state’s clean energy goals even more ambitious.
Policy and planning body the California Energy Commission (CEC) projects that the state will need to build 6 GW of solar-plus-storage capacity every year for the next 26 years to meet the 2045 target.
Over the past five years, California has only averaged approximately half of that 6 GW figure.
“We started to get on pace in the past two years but it is driven at least 50% by the distributed [rooftop solar] market,” said CALSSA Executive Director Bernadette del Chiaro.
Based on CEC projections, total solar generation capacity will need to increase by 350%, and total energy storage capacity by 700%, to meet the state’s policy targets.
During its march toward 100% carbon-free power, however, California has shot itself in the foot by introducing the NEM 3.0 policy, which cut customer compensation for exporting power to the grid. Combined with a high interest rate environment, project economics for rooftop solar in California have been eroded and demand has imploded.
Storage costs
As the share of intermittent solar generation in California’s energy mix rises, the need for energy storage to even out generation and consumption has increased as well. When regulator the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) passed NEM 3.0, it was described as a “modernized solar tariff to support reliability.” “The new tariff promotes solar systems and battery storage, with a focus on equity, and advances the new clean energy technologies we need to meet our climate goals and help ensure grid reliability,” said CPUC President Alice Reynolds.
The regulator said that under the new tariff, average residential customers who installed solar could expect to save $100 a month on their electricity bills, and customers who installed PV paired with battery storage could expect to save at least $136 a month. However, that economic analysis has not proven to be the case.
While the new rate environment does support the economics of solar-plus-storage projects over standalone solar arrays, it no longer represents a cashflow-positive benefit to homeowners, making such systems a very difficult sell.
Ross Williams, chief executive officer of regional installer HES Solar, shared this grim reality at the Intersolar panel discussion. What was once a $20,000 to $25,000 standalone solar system, with a five-to-seven-year payback period, has turned into a solar-plus-storage system that costs $40,000 to $45,000 and has a nine-to-10-year return.
“You weigh that against all the other options in the investing world and that is not a good option,” said Williams. “Simply adding storage increased the cost by almost double.”
At the same time, high interest rates have further squeezed the industry, making it more expensive to borrow money to pay for systems. Williams said a $25,000 standalone system used to be a cashflow-positive investment, meaning, on an annualized basis, that paying for the loan would cost less than simply remaining with a traditional utility company contract. Now, with a $40,000 project and higher financing costs, customers would expect to pay more for power with a solar-plus-storage system. “It’s not as simple as ‘just add storage’,” said Williams.
Part of what made the NEM 3.0 decision such a disaster for rooftop solar companies was the business turbulence it caused. For HES Solar, a rush of consumers trying to secure NEM 2.0 rates led to the company booking 20% more sales in the first quarter of 2023 than it had in the whole of 2022. Once NEM 3.0 went into effect in April 2023, HES Solar sales dropped to zero.
CALSSA has said it is currently focused on supporting changes that can get the industry through the next six months and is suggesting changes aimed at keeping businesses alive. CALSSA Policy Director Brad Heavner has shared some of the steps needed to stop the bleeding. Short of reversing NEM 3.0, CALSSA’s specific recommendations include:
1)Do no more harm and reject the $30 income-graduated fixed charge. Simplify bill AB 2143 to protect small businesses that install solar and storage, and do not limit licensed solar contractors from installing solar-plus-battery systems.
2)Launch a “Million Solar Batteries” initiative. Invest in energy storage for all consumers across all income brackets.
3)Restore the right of multi-meter properties to self-consumed power.
4)Dramatically expand virtual power plant programs.
5)Cut red tape. Assess penalties for utility non-compliance in interconnection timelines and simplify permitting at the city and county level by implementing Senate Bill 379.
6)Reform the utility profit model. Utility financial returns should be based on positive outcomes, not just capital expenditure.
“We had one sale in May,” said Williams at the Intersolar discussion. “In the first quarter, we sold 600 systems. I’m telling you – it went to zero.”
When July and August came around for HES Solar, and sales were still at 50% of what was needed to retain staff, Williams had to lay off employees. A similar story has plagued most of the rooftop solar installers in the state, leading to the loss of some 17,000 jobs.
California interconnection data indicate batteries would typically be paired with 10% to 15% of rooftop solar systems before NEM 3.0. In the first three weeks of selling NEM 3.0 systems, residential installer SunPower reported battery attachment rates rose to 47% and solar and storage modelling software platform EnergyToolbase projects that attachment rates will reach as high as 70% to 80%.
Demand for rooftop solar has fallen 65% to 80% during NEM 3.0, according to interconnection queue data. So did CPUC accomplish its goals?
Based on middle-of-the road analysis, the numbers would suggest the outcome has been mixed at best. Assume a scenario where, in the NEM 2.0 era, 100 rooftop solar projects were installed with an attachment rate of 12%, indicating 12 battery systems. Under NEM 3.0, the solar installation figure would be reduced to 28 arrays due to lower demand. With optimistic battery attachment rates of around 75%, that would lead to 21 battery installations. Industry reports indicate the actual battery attachment rate could be as little as 48%, meaning 13 batteries under that model.
Essentially, the new net metering regime may have led to a marginal increase in total distributed battery storage capacity but it has also cratered rooftop solar installations.
Trouble ahead
CALSSA has warned that the next couple of months could be even worse, as this is typically a slow season for rooftop solar. CALSSA’s Del Chiaro said cashflow issues and other ongoing concerns are likely to be raised in the first quarter of 2024.
Insurer Solar Insure told pv magazine USA that 75% of the companies it covers are considered to have a “high risk” of bankruptcy. Major publicly traded global equipment suppliers, including Enphase and SolarEdge, have made significant cuts to their workforce. National installer Sunworks has filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. In December 2023, SunPower issued a warning that it endured recurring operating losses for three of the nine months ending Oct. 1, 2023.
California has averaged around 2.3 GW of utility scale solar-plus-storage installations per year over the past few years – far below the 6 GW pace needed to reach the 2045 goal of 100% carbon-free power.
Del Chiaro said she believes that goal will be impossible to reach with a utility-scale-only energy storage model that the state seems to be hurling itself toward.
Policy changes
The Intersolar panelists in San Diego warned that California may only be the beginning for the fall of rooftop solar. Del Chiaro said 15 to 20 states are already mulling cuts to their net metering payments, including Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington. She said utilities now have the wind at their backs and are citing California’s decision to cut net metering compensation as justification for their own reductions.
As they are currently structured, utilities in California and much of the nation have a perverse incentive to inefficiently spend money on transmission projects. The more capital that utilities spend on infrastructure, the more they can get electricity rate increases approved.
Customer-sited solar is preferable to centralized, utility-scale solar, as it pertains to reducing transmission needs, system wide costs and efficiency and transmission-line energy losses. Distributed solar also cuts down on the development of land that could be used for other purposes. California’s largest solar-plus-storage facility just went online and, to power more than 200,000 homes, more than 4,600 acres of previously undisturbed land was developed into an expanse of almost two million solar panels.
“Getting the utility to stop fighting customer solar is ultimately the thing that is needed in California and around the world,” said CALSSA’s Heavner. “We’ve had it in our head for years, how do we change this perverse incentive? It’s a hard thing to undertake but I’m hearing more talk about it.

Trouble for sea freight and other logistical issues made their mark on solar stock prices at the beginning of 2024. The Invesco Solar ETF fell by 21% for January 2024, while the S&P 500 increased by 2% and the DJIA increased by 1%. Within the United States, the top three solar stocks for the month of January 2024 were Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure plc, down 11%, and ReNew Energy Global Plc and Clearway Energy Inc., which both fell by 12%.
The worst performers in January 2024 in the United States markets were Emeren Group Ltd, SunPower Corp., and Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd., which all fell 37%. Residential solar stocks, overall, fell 27% for the month of January 2024. Companies included in the residential measure were Enphase Energy Inc., SolarEdge Technologies Inc., Sunnova Energy International., and Sunrun Inc.
Utility-scale solar stocks – Array Technologies Inc., Shoals Technologies Group Inc., NEXTracker Inc., FTC Solar Inc., and First Solar Inc. – decreased by 17% in the first month of 2024.
Logistical challenges emerged within the solar market, potentially bolstering pricing dynamics. That, coupled with liquidity issues, seems to be causing unease in the solar industry, as demonstrated by the sharp decline in the Invesco Solar ETF.
Roth Capital’s checks suggest that module vendors are contemplating price elevation strategies, as security concerns in the Red Sea and a drought in the Panama Canal are presenting logistical hurdles that could additionally bolster pricing. The Panama Canal drought is forcing ships bound from Asia to the eastern United States to divert their routes, circumnavigating Africa and traversing the Atlantic Ocean instead, which could also push small-scale, “distributed-generation” PV module prices up.
Due to liquidity issues, dealers are currently awaiting payment, with some encountering liquidity challenges as a result of this delay.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/11/renewable-energy-merger-and-acquisition-opportunities-for-2024/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-11,Renewable energy merger and acquisition opportunities for 2024,"FTI Consulting released a report reviewing renewable energy merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in 2023 and provided an outlook for 2024.
Entering 2023, M&A transactions faced headwinds including sustained high interest rates, inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints, government support uncertainties, and grid reliability issues. As a result, renewable energy deal volume dropped from 2022 levels. Interest rates are driving a wedge between potential buyers and sellers on valuation, said the report from FTI.
Established renewable technologies like solar and wind comprised about 60% of deal volume, said FTI. Meanwhile, traditional nuclear energy M&A and “renewable” natural gas and biogas transactions increased, suggesting mainstream adoption for a once-niche market.
Looking into 2024, FTI anticipates various factors will drive an increase in M&A activity in the renewable energy sector. As high costs of capital put pressure on project viability, smaller developers may be forced to sell projects, portfolios, or their entire platform as they seek liquidity or an outright exit.
“Investors and established incumbents with stronger balance sheets may take this opportunity to invest, acquire and structure creative solutions, further driving consolidation in the sector,” said the report.
FTI also expects and uptick in corporate renewables adoption as decarbonization and electrification continues to come to the forefront. It expects oil and gas players to actively invest in the sector.
“Conversely, the sale of unregulated renewable businesses noted in 2022, including Con Edison’s $6.8 billion divestment of its unregulated clean energy segment, continued at an accelerated pace in 2023, with utilities such as AEP, Algonquin, Avangrid, Eversource and Duke Energy announcing their intentions to sell their renewable portfolios,” said the report.
FTI said supply chain constraints, increasing development costs, permitting issues, interconnection delays and shorter tenor offtake agreements have all contributed to an increase in the risk profile of unregulated renewable energy investment.
FTI recognized that a higher interest rate market may persist for some years. This may lead to smaller developers selling off assets, while on the demand side, larger players with greater operational diversity or public equity may be more creative, taking on risks and offering different value proposition to capital-stared developers that cannot achieve scale.
The report shared that government support from the IRA and other programs has begun to roll out, including $110 billion in available grant money made available through the 2022 law. FTI said the incentives could cause a “seismic shift on the U.S. energy sector and the economy as a whole over the next 12 to 24 months.”
Further pushed along by investment from corporate America, and “big oil” will continue to diversify its energy mix with strategic investments and acquisitions.
“Early developments in the new year indicate that these predicted market trends are taking hold, and 2024 will make up lost ground from the relatively low level of M&A activity seen in 2023,” said FTI Consulting.
FTI Consulting provides tailored services for strategic and financial investors, creditors and corporates, and has deep experience with renewable energy platforms, projects and portfolios.

The project’s full capacity will be tied to Microsoft via a long-term power purchase agreement. The 408 MW project, though becoming more commonplace in Texas, would represent the largest solar project in most states in the U.S. 
Ash Creek solar is located near several existing fossil fuel plants and near high energy demand sites. Once complete, the project is expected to generate the equivalent electricity demand of 90,000 homes per year, though it will be fully dedicated to Microsoft.
“Ash Creek aligns with Primergy’s mission to invest in well-located projects that offer regional diversity to our portfolio and serve the needs of leading corporate customers,” said Ty Daul, chief executive officer, Primergy.
Primergy acquired Ash Creek Solar in 2021, purchased from original developer Orion Power Generation, a partnership between Orion Renewable Energy Group and Eolian.
The project was financed via a construction loan, tax credit transfer bridge loan, and related letters of credit. Investment was led by MUFG Bank, Ltd. and SMBC as lead structuring arrangers. Seven additional firms operated as coordinating lead arrangers, and Latham & Watkins LLP acted as Primergy’s legal counsel, while Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom served as lender’s counsel.
SOLV Energy, among the leading utility-scale solar contractors, was engaged as engineering, procurement, and construction partner. Construction has commenced and is supporting approximately 350 local full-time construction jobs. Six full-time permanent positions will remain to maintain the plant.
Primergy worked alongside local leaders, school districts, and over 20 landowners in the development process. Over its life, the project is estimated to provide $100 million in tax payments to Hill County while substantially increasing the tax base of local school districts.
“Large-scale solar projects have a ripple effect that strengthens communities,” said George Hershman, chief executive officer of SOLV Energy. “Ash Creek Solar represents a long-term investment in Hill County that will generate revenue for local schools and services.”

The project to be built in Montezuma would include a 3 MW solar installation with a battery energy storage system as well as two electric vehicle charging stations. The plan for the microgrid is to replace aging substations, load monitoring and control systems. The utility expects that the microgrid will lower energy costs for residents by as much as 18%. It is also expected to reduce transmission costs for the utility by 34% and reduce its energy purchases.
Montezuma, population 1,400 is a manufacturing and farming community and, according to Anne Kimber, director of the Electric Power Research Center and a co-leader of the project, “people depend on it for city and county services, schools, health care, shopping, and employment”.  She noted that during a major wind storm in 2020, the town used diesel generators to keep the power on. The microgrid solution, however, will be a clean energy solution.
Kimber said the design of this project design being replicated by other communities. There’s also an educational and training aspect as the Research Center will use a digital twin of the microgrid that will be tested with partners that include schools and an area Tribal Nation. The hope is to “build an energy workforce that can design, build and operate other resilient systems like this,” Kimber said.
“This project will make the entire town of Montezuma the very first utility-scale microgrid in Iowa with the best reliability and resilience,” said Zhaoyu Wang, project leader and a Northrop Grumman associate professor at Iowa State. “The Montezuma microgrid will revolutionize and modernize the Montezuma Municipal Light and Power system by integrating smart grid technologies. It will be a model for other rural utilities.”
The $9.5 million from the DOE is part of the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas program managed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. The program recently announced total funding of more than $366 million for 17 projects across 20 states and 30 Tribal Nations and communities.
This funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is intended to support community-driven energy projects, such as microgrids for community health centers, which strengthen energy security and delivers economic opportunities in rural and remote regions.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/11/what-happens-to-the-ira-under-a-new-administration/,"BUSINESS,EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-03-11,What happens to the IRA under a new administration?,"A live podcast by Norton Rose Fulbright drew an audience of over 4,000 people to listen to three tax and legal experts discuss how a Republican administration would handle the Inflation Reduction Act.
Participants included the moderator, Keith Martin, co-head of projects, U.S.; John Gimigliano, principal-in-charge, federal tax and regulatory services, KPMG; Joe Mikrut, partner, Capitol Tax Partners.
As background, since passage of the IRA in August 2022, over $240 billion has been invested in clean energy manufacturing and infrastructure projects, according to a White House report. This includes over $86 billion invested in nearly 300 new solar, wind, and battery energy storage projects. A recent report from Intersolar North America and Energy Storage North America indicates that the resulting job growth has been strong, with over 170,000 direct jobs created and as many as 1.5 million new jobs in clean energy that can be expected by 2030.
Former President Trump has said that, if elected, he plans to scrap the Inflation Reduction Act on day one. Mikrut pointed out that for that to happen, other Republicans would also have to control the legislative process, the House and the Senate. While that may happen, he said Republicans are “likely to have a pretty slim majority in either body or both bodies.” He noted that a slim majority doesn’t mean the legislation will move forward.
However, supposing that the IRA is on the table, Mikrut said several provisions have bipartisan support, including carbon capture, hydrogen, fuel credits and possibly domestic manufacturing tax credits.
Gimigliano added that a major motivation for Republicans to repeal these provisions would be to reduce spending to support tax cut extensions. Tax cuts enacted in 2017 under Trump are set to expire in 2025.
The panelists agreed that Republicans will be hard pressed to win an effective majority in the Senate where anything controversial usually requires 60 votes to pass, as that would require winning at least 11 Senate seats. However, some form of rollback is possible by using a budget reconciliation process. Mikrut said he thinks the major focus, regardless of the outcome of the election, will be on the expiration of the tax cuts and Jobs Act provisions.
Martin summarized that the panelists don’t see an IRA rollback as a standalone debate; it would be in the context of extending the 2017 tax cuts, which would become the top priority, and that debate would probably stretch into early 2026.
Mikrut expects the electric vehicle provisions in IRA to be reexamined. “They have been the most controversial both when they were enacted, as well as the way they’ve been implemented,” he said. And if you’re reexamining EV credits, he sees an examination of 45X, which provides tax credits for batteries and critical minerals that go into EVs.
The panelists noted that much of the new factory construction that is resulting from the 45X tax credit offered to manufacturers that make components for solar, wind and storage projects, is in Republican districts.
The group said repeal of the IRA may not be an all-or-nothing scenario, and a potential new administration may tweak or remove the things they don’t like. Republicans have already given a glimpse of what they would do in the Build it in America Act introduced in the Ways and Means Committee.
The panel said that the clock is ticking on legislation, particularly guidance released by the Treasury, because a new administration and Republican Congress could use the Congressional Review Act to roll back any regulations that go into effect in the last 60 legislative days of the current Congress. Treasury just released final regulations on the direct-pay program for state local governments and tax-exempt entities that own renewable energy projects.
