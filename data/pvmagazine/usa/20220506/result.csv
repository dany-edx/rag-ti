It is home to several prestigious universities that are at the forefront of research combatting climate change and improving science-based approaches to a more sustainable future. 
The state houses many innovative companies working on the problem, and hosts Greentown Labs, a hub for cleantech startups and researchers, which, along with its 2021-established chapter in Houston, hosts over 180 startups targeting human sustainability. 
The state was also instrumental in the 2007 landmark case Massachusetts vs. EPA, which opened the door for states to have standing to sue based on climate-related damages. It also required EPA to determine if human-emitted greenhouse gases led to climate-related harm, and if so, established that EPA must regulate those emissions. 
Solar in Massachusetts 
Solar PV is a big part of Massachusetts climate and energy goals. It is ranked as a top-10 solar state by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), with over 3.6 GW installed through 2021, and over 400 businesses in the industry. This ranking is impressive considering it ranks 16 in population, has limited open land availability, and is in the lower half of the nation in terms of solar irradiance. 
It has a wide mix of projects across sectors, particularly making significant gains in residential, commercial, and community solar. 
Incentives and programs 
Massachusetts is a leader in incentive design in the nation. On the Database of State Incentives for Renewables (DSIRE) it has 114 distinct incentive programs listed. 
One of the most significant incentives for the state in recent years is Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program. The program is capped at an aggregate 1.6 GW of deployment and provides per-kWh incentives for PV projects 5 MW or less. About 20-35% of the allotted capacity is designed for projects 25 kW or less, essentially a residential solar carve-out.
The SMART program works on a declining-block program in 80 MW blocks, meaning that earlier projects will be more heavily incentivized, and as the program passes through the blocks, incentive values will drop by 4% per block.
The calculation for the SMART program incentives is complex, designed intelligently to steer the profile of projects in the state toward goals of energy equity, distributed generation, energy storage, and reliability. It integrates value adders for projects based on size, income levels, technologies used including energy storage, and more. A spreadsheet to calculate SMART program incentives can be found here.
Net metering, another essential policy for residential and commercial solar projects, is alive and well in Massachusetts, though there are some limitations. Projects of 60 kW or less are credited a full 100% value for their excess solar generation, and projects ranging from 60-2,000 kW are paid 60% of the retail rate of energy, as determined by Massachusetts law.
There are capacity caps to net metering in Massachusetts, suggesting that projects installed in the future may receive lower payments unless the state replenishes the program. More details on net metering can be found here.
The state provides a personal income tax credit of up to $1,000 of 15% of qualified project costs, whichever is less.
Community solar programs have steadily been on the rise in Massachusetts in recent years. A comprehensive guide run by the state’s Clean Energy Center can be found here.
Landmark project
A breakthrough project in the state that may serve as a model for the evolving, distributed energy grid would be Sunrun’s contract to participate in the ISO New England wholesale capacity market. In a first-of-its-kind project, Sunrun was granted the ability to aggregate 20 MW of energy capacity across its solar and energy storage customers, selling power on the wholesale market.

As part of the bid, Sunrun will deploy distributed solar and battery storage to about 5,000 customers in Massachusetts. It will be required to offer the grid 20 MW of power, 24 hours a day for the one-year period. In return, Sunrun will be paid $3.80/kW/month, representing a $912,000 total contract value. Homeowners who signed up for the program agree to allow their battery to be discharged overnight. In exchange, they receive an upfront cash incentive as either a payment or a reduction in the upfront cost of their system.
This kind of project may be a signal for how energy is managed in the future. There are many benefits to installing solar and energy storage in a distributed fashion, and those grid/societal benefits are amplified when resources are pooled and dispatched intelligently.
A study run by New Zealand’s University of Otago found the collective use of batteries across several neighborhoods had dramatic effects on both load smoothing and peak demand shaving. Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90% for peak shaving. As an example, if peak shaving occurred for demand above 3 kW per house, deploying batteries individually for 20 houses would require 120 kWh of storage. By contrast, deploying batteries collectively would only require 7 kWh, the researchers said.
Looking ahead
Massachusetts has set sector-specific goals, with targets every five years to stay on track, to reduce carbon emissions across the economy. By 2050, the state aims for an 85% reduction of emissions below 1990 levels. This upcoming July, the state has set a deadline for adopting 2025 and 2030 emissions limit and mandates the creation of a comprehensive plant to achieve those limits. A presentation on the development of those plans can be found here.
Last time, we reviewed the solar incentive profile of Massachusetts’ northern neighbor, New Hampshire, a state with differing philosophies and much more limited support of solar buildout. Our next stop on the 50 states of solar incentives tour will take us south to the neighboring state of Rhode Island.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/06/doc-clarifies-scope-of-anti-circumvention-investigation-but-whats-actually-new/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,COST AND PRICES,EMPLOYMENT,LEGAL,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 6, 2022","DOC clarifies scope of anti-circumvention investigation, but what’s actually new?","The Department of Commerce (DOC) released a memo that provides some significant clarifications on its ongoing investigation into solar cell and module manufacturers in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
While much of the memo is reiterated and more clearly-defined information than we have had since it was first announced, the memo includes two key developments:
The first conclusion means that, so long as manufacturers are using non-Chinese polysilicon in their products, they are in no violation (more on how this changes the US available module supply outlook to follow), while the second provides considerable clarity as to how tariffs would be instituted and at what rate: a significant unknown prior to this memo.
American Clean Power Association (ACP) CEO, Heather Zichal, put out a statement saying that the memo “perpetuates the market confusion that is currently stifling the US solar industry.” ROTH, in an industry note, reiterated this point, saying that it provided little clarity and qualified as “no news at all.”
Zichal continued to offer her two main takeaways:
How much non-Chinese polysilicon is there?
So manufacturers are free to continue exporting modules to the US, so long as those modules use wafers and ingots manufactured outside of China. Great, simple enough. So how much available polysilicon manufacturing is there outside of China?
To answer this, pv magazine spoke with Joseph Johnson, manager of Market Intelligence at Clean Energy Associates (CEA). The reality, at least so far, is not an optimistic one.

“It’s not a good picture at all,” said Johnson, who went onto estimate that around 97% of all ingots and wafers manufactured today are being made in China, a percentage demographic that he does not see changing in the near future.
“Today, if you’re looking at the market by the end of this year, we’re tracking around 16.5 GW of nameplate, non-China ingot and wafer manufacturing. A large bulk [7 GW] is only going to really be usable by the end or later to this year from Jinkosolar… So when you look at it, it’s essentially around nine to 10 GW of capacity that’s likely to be operable this year. And that figure starts to get even smaller when you look at how long some of these older capacities have been on the market.”
These older capacities that make up a large portion of the roughly 10 GW pool of modules available to the US are not applicable to the new industry standard 182 mm cell size, meaning the available capacity for use in modern utility scale installations shrinks even more.
While the outlook is certainly less than optimal, all of the capacity set to come in the near future will be from tier-1 manufacturers making modules for modern utility applications. As referenced earlier, Jinkosolar will soon have production up and running at its $500 million, 7 GW ingot and wafer manufacturing facility in the coastal economic zone of Vietnam’s Quang Ninh province. In addition, JA Solar is expected to increase its module and ingot manufacturing operations in Vietnam to 6 GW by 2023. The company also has 1.5 GW of cell capacity in Malaysia. Longi also has some capacity that is expected to be usable for export to the US.

Johnson went on to assert that many of these tier-1 Chinese manufacturers were already looking to move their ingot and wafer operations outside of China, partially triggered by the alleged use of forced labor in China’s Xinjiang province and resulting fallout. While that move was already in progress, the DOC investigation has begun to serve as a further catalyst.
Johnson said that, in the short term, existing tier-1 manufacturers will be able to mobilize quickest to fill capacity needs, but the investigation also opens to door for more prominent ingot and wafer manufacturing operations across Europe and in India.
“So in India, there’s certainly a pretty big push to get some base ingot and wafer production online,” said Johnson. “There’s also a pretty big resurgence in Europe. MoreSun and Norwegian Crystals, both of those suppliers have announced some pretty aggressive ramp up timelines to get multi-gigawatt scale and get ingot production online and up from just one gigawatt today.”
Once you get away from the largest players with the most resources, Johnson said, timelines increase:
“The timelines for those are probably going to be pretty long, four to five years, since a lot of this know-how has to be either purchased, or researched, or developed in house, which is likely to really prolong that timeline of actually bringing non-China options to the market.”
Calling for an end
Nationally, sentiment is rising against the DOC investigation, as 22 Senators and two governors have officially called on DOC to deliver an expedited and negative preliminary decision.
Joining Governor Newsom’s call is Indiana Governor, Eric Holcomb, who wrote to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo saying:
I urge the Department of Commerce to reach a determination as quickly as possible to restore clarity and certainty regarding solar products, so the State of Indiana, our utilities, and other private sector partners can better understand and plan for an economical energy transition, in which solar is poised to play a key role.
Indiana has been one of the states hit hardest by the DOC investigation’s fallout. Northern Indiana Public Service Company uncertainty and delays brought to the solar panel are forcing the utility to delay the closure of two coal generation plants from to 2025, back from an original date of 2023. According to NIPSCO, most solar projects that the utility originally scheduled for completion in 2022 and 2023 will experience delays of approximately 6 to 18 months. In total, NIPSCO’s project uncertainties represent roughly $2 billion in delayed investment.
Indiana was one of 13 states in the Solar Energy industries Association’s (SEIA) most recent publication of its anti-circumvention investigation impact survey to have 100% of respondents share that they were experiencing delayed or canceled module supply. It also joined Idaho as the two states to have respondents report that 100% of the state’s development pipeline has been delayed by the DOC investigation.
Those who responded to SEIA’s survey with specific project data outlined that, so far, 3.6 GW of solar projects have been delayed or canceled as a direct result of the investigation, the fourth-most of any state in the country. SEIA projected Indiana to add 6.7 GW of solar over the next 5 years, meaning that over half of that pipeline is already in jeopardy.
As for hopes of a speedy resolution, a letter that Secretary Raimondo sent to 14 legislators offers DOC’s perspective as to why the investigation can’t be dropped like a hot and highly unpopular potato
First, let me assure you that the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to addressing climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. We stand ready to work with you and Congress to advance legislation that would provide incentives to bolster renewable energy. In addition, the Department of Commerce stands ready to work with Congress to diversify our supply chains and develop greater domestic solar manufacturing capacity here at home.
After some case background, Raimondo assures each of the 14 legislators that “like all trade remedy proceedings, Commerce will conduct these circumvention inquiries in a fair and transparent manner, and in accordance with all applicable US laws and regulations.” As Raimondo puts it, DOC is required by statute to investigate a claim that companies operating in other countries in the region are trying to circumvent existing duties. DOC is merely doing its job.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/06/perovskites-studied-as-potential-material-for-producing-hydrogen-in-a-renewable-way/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 6, 2022",Perovskites studied as potential material for producing hydrogen in a renewable way,"Hydrogen is increasingly the focus of research on using renewable resources for energy storage, especially in light of the Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Energy Earthshot, a goal to cut the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per kilogram in a decade. With hydrogen from renewable energy currently at about $5 per kilogram, researchers are looking at many ways of cutting those costs.
At the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), researchers are looking at perovskite materials, which could be used in a process to produce hydrogen in a renewable manner. The focus of their study is an emerging water-splitting technology called solar thermochemical hydrogen (STCH) production, which can be potentially more energy efficient than producing hydrogen via the commonly used electrolysis method. The researchers evaluated the performance of various STCH materials in the context of a system platform to assess techno-economic benefits and what the challenges would be to scaling up STCH production.
“It’s certainly a very challenging field, and it has a lot of research questions still unanswered, mainly on the materials perspective,” said Zhiwen Ma, a senior engineer at NREL and lead author of a new paper, “System and Technoeconomic Analysis of Solar Thermochemical Hydrogen Production,” which appears in the journal Renewable Energy. His co-authors, all from NREL, are Patrick Davenport and Genevieve Saur.
The paper complements ongoing materials discovery research by examining how different materials may bring costs down. One of the challenges in the research was in identifying perovskites capable of handling the high temperatures required while hitting performance targets. Another challenge is that in STCH, the PV cells used only capture a part of the solar spectrum, and STCH uses the entire spectrum. Research to identify the best materials for STCH is critical to the success of this method for hydrogen production, the scientists noted.
“The material has not necessarily been found,” Saur said, “but this analysis is to provide some boundaries for where we think the costs will be if the materials meet some of the targets and expectations that the research community envisions.”

The PPAs were signed with developer AES.
Amazon is ahead of schedule of its original plan to reach 100% renewably powered operations in 2030 and may now hit that target in 2025. It is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, and it aims for net zero carbon by 2040.
AES was ranked by Bloomberg New Energy Finance as the top developer selling clean energy to corporations through PPAs. The company inked 5 GW of new PPAs in 2021 alone.
“Together with Amazon, we’re showing how customized energy solutions and innovative thinking can help organizations of all kinds to decarbonize their operations and the grid,” said Andrés Gluski, AES president and CEO.
AES has been busy meeting the clean energy needs of tech giants of late. This week, it was announced AES will supply Microsoft with 110 MW of solar, and 55 MW / 220 MWh of storage, all of which will be constructed in California.
Battery energy storage provider Fluence is contracted to supply its technology for one of the projects.
It builds a storage product called the Fluence Cube, a modular battery that can scale from 1 MW to 500 MW or more. The battery is designed around bankability, pitched as a product that is cost-effective, able to be quickly procured, designed, delivered, constructed, and commissioned.
A single Fluence Cube houses its lithium-ion sealed cells in a 2549 x 2578 x 2160 mm casing. It has flexible discharge durations from 30 minutes to four hours and is equipped with a solid aerosol suppression agent.
All the new projects included in the PPA will assist Amazon operations in California’s CAISO grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/06/how-grid-forming-inverters-may-enhance-grid-synchronization/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 6, 2022",How grid-forming inverters may enhance grid synchronization,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder have sought to assess how advanced control architectures and grid-optimization methods could ensure network synchronization in energy systems dominated by intermittent renewable energy sources.
In “Synchronization in electric power networks with inherent heterogeneity up to 100% inverter-based renewable generation,” recently published in Nature Communications, the US group analyzed how grid-forming (GFM) or grid-following (GFL) inverters can act as primary mechanisms to improve grid synchronization, especially during low-inertia operating conditions. They approached this in three main ways: heterogeneous coupling damping factors related to real-world power networks; a parametric sensitivity analysis highlighting the significance of the damping component; and the feasibility of grids operated by 100% inverter-based energy technologies with enhanced synchronization capabilities. They found that mechanical networks with small inertial mass and great damping characteristics show a higher capability for stable natural synchronization.
“This notion is intuitive as although the mass provides an inertial resistance to the acceleration of a body when subjected to force, it also creates an inertial resistance to slowing down the mass once moving,” they stated. “In addition, the higher damping capability allows the network to more effectively dissipate the kinetic energy produced by an external force.”
They also found that kinetic energy induced in the mechanical network is directly proportional to the inertial mass. The ability to dissipate the kinetic energy is also proportional to the damping coefficient.
“The assumption of homogeneity in the characteristics of subsystems, subnetworks, or components of an interconnected network is rarely valid for real-world large-scale networks; embedding such assumptions into an analytical model to study real-world, complex, interconnected networks may distort the findings,” they said.
The researchers said power systems based on GFM inverters ensure that the inertia and damping coefficients can be adaptively adjusted. But with power systems based on GFL inverters, inertia and damping coefficients are dependent on the machine design, they said.
“The GFM technologies can be generally categorized into virtual synchronous machine (VSM) and multi-loop GFM. Both technologies have a frequency response with dynamics that can be described by a second-order differential equation,” they said, noting that the multi-loop devices can provide damping support independent of the inertial contribution.
The researchers claimed to have provided a basis for the development of a control solution that could ensure the reliable, safe and stable operation of future power networks.
“To this end, it is pivotal to reconsider the control and automation systems currently in place, both the structure and algorithms, and perhaps design and implement modern control systems that are designed and tuned in accordance with the dynamic behaviors and characteristics of power networks with high levels of inverter-based generation,” the scientists concluded. “In future power networks dominated by grid-forming inverters, new concepts such as adaptive protection that follows the grid inertia to adjusts its settings in real-time, and generators’ available headroom reserve are factored into the determination of the droop value in real-time, making the grid a dynamically adaptive network and to do so, various control schemes can be utilized, especially highly distributed control systems.”
