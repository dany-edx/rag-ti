The solar project is expected to begin delivering electricity in June 2024.
“The McDonald’s team was determined through their use of innovative contracting structures to execute a major solar procurement that would significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and they found a great partner with EDF Renewables. We are proud to have supported them in this effort and congratulate all parties involved for reaching this exciting outcome,” said Walid Norris, vice president, client solutions for Customer First Renewables, an advisory group that helps organizations capture the social, environmental, and economic value of renewables.
Once complete, the Apollo Solar project is expected to generate 619,000 MWh of low-carbon energy annually, enough to meet the consumption of over 1,200 U.S. McDonald’s restaurants. This is equivalent to avoiding over 439,000 metric tons of CO₂ emissions annually, or the equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions from over 95,000 passenger vehicles driven over the course of one year. Approximately 300 jobs are expected to be created during the construction phase with more than $30 million generated in new tax revenue over the operating life for taxing entities.
“We applaud McDonald’s for taking action on climate change and are honored to partner with them to address their restaurant electricity carbon footprint,” said Matt McCluskey, vice president development, South Central Region for EDF Renewables.  “Through the purchase of clean energy from Apollo Solar, McDonalds will be able to reduce GHG emissions in support of their sustainability goals while the project construction phase will provide the local community with a boost to the economy through job creation, local spending with vendors, and an expanded tax base.”
“We are thrilled to add EDF Renewables and the Apollo Solar project to our U.S. renewable energy portfolio as part of our continued commitment to climate action,” said Elaine Strunk, Sr. Director Global Sustainability, McDonald’s. “Apollo Solar plays a significant role in our science-based emissions reduction target for 2030 and brings a considerable amount of new renewable generation to the grid. Together with EDF Renewables, this project furthers our shared goal of making a more sustainable planet for generations to come.”

Signing on for 15 years of solar from the Apollo Solar project is not the company’s first foray into solar energy. Two years ago McDonald’s announced its commitment to achieving net zero emissions across its global operations by 2050. The company joined the United Nations Race to Zero campaign and signing on to the Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign.
The first net zero McDonald’s was opened in 2020 at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The building is covered with 55.8 kW of Onyx Solar photovoltaic glass, and also has vertical gardens to absorb the CO2 already present in the atmosphere.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/13/carbon-intensity-of-energy-in-the-u-s-is-falling-but-progress-varies-widely-by-state/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2022","Carbon intensity of energy in the U.S. is falling, but progress varies widely by state","Carbon intensity, or the amount of emissions per unit of energy, of power generation in the United States has fallen 18% nationwide from 2016 to 2020. As the nation has shifted the generation mix away from coal and towards renewable energy and natural gas, emissions have come down considerably, though there is a wide variance among the states.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) tracks carbon intensity data, and found that in 2020, the nationwide average was 854 lbs. of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity generated. Coal averaged 2,274 lbs. of CO2/MWh, while natural gas averaged 980 lbs. of CO2/MWh. Nuclear power plants and non-emitting renewables, such as hydroelectric, wind, and solar power, produce little to no CO2 emissions.
The EIA map above provides an outlook into opportunities for development. States like Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico have relatively high carbon intensity, but also high levels of solar irradiance, making them attractive areas for solar development. Northern states with high carbon intensity like North Dakota, Wyoming, and Nebraska overlap with the United States wind belt, highlighting the opportunity for wind energy development.
Despite wide variances in carbon intensity by state, 43 states and the District of Columbia recorded lower carbon intensity of power generation in 2020 relative to 2016. Wyoming ranked as the most carbon-intensive energy generator in 2020 with an average emissions of 1,970.8 lbs. of CO2/MWh. The state generated 79% of its power from coal.
Notably, the EIA report on carbon intensity is based on the power generated in the state, but not necessarily what was used. States purchase out-of-state generation and sell it to other states. In 2020, Vermont had the lowest carbon intensity of power generation at 8.4 lbs. of CO2/MWh, close to zero emissions. Almost all of Vermont’s in-state electricity generation came from renewables, and Vermont brings in about 60% of its electricity from Canada.
From 2016 to 2020, the five states with the largest reductions in carbon intensity were:
Tennessee benefitted from the retirement of coal plants and an increase in nuclear and solar over the four-year span. It had a large boom in solar from 2016 to 2019, though in recent years deployment has slowed. In Maryland, coal’s share decreased from 37% to 9%. Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma all relied on wind energy to displace retiring coal plants.
Another important part of decarbonization efforts is recognizing the carbon “backpack” of a given energy source, which is the amount of carbon that was emitted to create that energy-producing component. For example, a solar panel manufactured in a region that uses heavy amounts of coal to power its factory would have a much different carbon backpack than one that was built using a cleaner energy source.

The Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance is an organization that is focused on bringing attention to these differences in energy production. The Alliance consists of companies across the solar PV value chain and other stakeholders committed to expanded market awareness and deployment of ultra low-carbon PV to accelerate reductions in solar supply chain GHG emissions.

US storage system manufacturer Yotta Energy has unveiled a new dual-power, three-phase microinverter for commercial rooftop PV applications.
“The new DPI microinverters will be available in both 208 V and 480 V versions and will incorporate several key features, including integrated phase monitoring/phase balancing, NEC 2020 690.12 rapid shutdown compliance, and UL 1741-SA (Rule 21) compliance,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Each DPI supports four high-capacity solar modules.”
The inverters measure 359 mm x 242 mm x 46 mm and weigh 6 kg. They have a peak efficiency of 96.5% and a nominal maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency of 99.5%.
The operating voltage range is between 26 V and 60 V and the maximum input voltage is 60 V. The maximum continuous output power for the 208 V device is 1,728 VA and 1,800 VA for the 480 V product. The inverters also feature cooling systems based on natural convection and come with 10-year warranties that are extendable to 25 years, the manufacturer stated.
“This utility-interactive microinverter has Reactive Power Control (RPC) technology that exceeds recent NEC Rapid Shutdown requirements” the company said. “Microinverters are a safe bet over high-voltage string inverters and eliminate the risk for DC arc faults.”
The inverters are manufactured in Taiwan for Yotta Energy under a strategic original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partnership with Seattle-based microinverter specialist APsystems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/13/canadian-solar-to-unveil-all-in-one-residential-battery-and-inverter/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CANADA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2022",Canadian Solar to unveil all-in-one residential battery and inverter,"Canadian Solar announced it is launching a new residential energy storage unit called EP Cube, a lightweight all-in-one battery and hybrid inverter with stackable battery modules. The product will be shown during RE+ in Anaheim, California, the largest solar and clean technology event in the United States, and officially launched on September 21.
The battery features stackable battery modules, adding customizability and minimizing wall space needed for installation. It is compatible with both new and retrofit systems, and both AC and DC-coupled solar arrays.
One unit can scale from 9.9 kWh to 19.9 kWh in capacity, and up to six units can be connected in parallel, achieving 119.9 kWh of storage and 45.6 kW output, said the company. This is more than enough to fully power the average home with high-surge-current appliances and AC units.
EP Cube is designed to be lightweight and easy to install, featuring all-inclusive components and self-configuration for fast commissioning. Each battery module weighs less than 70 lbs., significantly lower than many residential units, which can weigh upwards of 300 lbs. The battery module measures only 6.25 inches thick and is NEMA 4X rated for both indoor and outdoor use.
The battery is compatible with the EP Cube app, which allows homeowners to monitor production and consumption in real time. Homeowners have access to their energy management through the app, and installers use the app to set up and troubleshoot the system. Updates are made remotely to the battery management system.
EP Cube operates with Canadian Solar’s “Smart Gateway”, a platform that enables automatic and seamless energy transfers for on- or off-grid use without user disruption.
“We are pleased to expand our clean energy offering into the residential energy storage market by launching the EP Cube, leveraging our existing partnerships and channels. The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will help the U.S. market transition faster towards clean power by increasing renewable energy accessibility through tax breaks and rebates. The EP Cube is a perfect solution for homeowners to use these incentives and invest in clean energy,” said Shawn Qu, chair and CEO of Canadian Solar.
Over the past two decades, Canadian Solar has delivered over 76 GW of solar modules to customers across the world. Since entering the project development business in 2010, the company has developed, built and connected over 6.8 GW in over 20 countries across the world. Currently, the company has about 311 MW of solar projects in operation, 5.3 GW of projects under construction or in backlog (late-stage), and an additional 21 GW of projects in pipeline (mid- to early-stage).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/13/transfer-payments-vs-tax-equity-a-utility-scale-analysis/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2022","Transfer payments vs tax equity, a utility-scale analysis","As part of the newly signed Inflation Reduction Act, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) includes a nuanced change that allows for the tax credit to be sold for cash, to parties that are in no way associated with the solar project.
This is a significant departure from the former structure of the ITC, which originally required a complex, often expensive tax equity process in order to meet IRS standards. Those standards required parties buying into a project for a tax benefit to prove that they took on real risk and responsibility.
An article released by Segue Sustainable Infrastructure, a principal investment firm providing development capital to renewable energy projects, compares this new tool – transfer payments – to tax equity in a technical financial writing.
The author, who provides tax equity related services for solar projects, gives credit to US Bank as the American company that has “done the most to support clean energy” over the last 15 years via their tax equity work.
Segue describes the factors that favor each type of project finance when using a tax inefficient partner (one who cannot take advantage of depreciation) to buy transfer payment credits:

The author sees an opportunity for large scale solar power plants to take advantage of the less complex transfer payment structure, however, industry nuances still complicate this decision. Factors like depreciation, as well as the price paid for tax credits versus expected transfer payments, and basis step up opportunities, can get tax equity to within 40-60 basis points of the weighted average cost of cash for a transfer payment project.
The author believes this is a price gulf that a hungry tax equity professional can work through if they really want the deal.
One important question is – how much should our tax credit be sold for? What’s a fair market price?
LIHTC pricing over time:

The author compares transfer payment to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHT”) market, as it’s “the largest and longest-running transferable credit market”. Segue notes that none of the many professionals they spoke to on this topic would give an opinion on whether solar transfer credit would trade at a premium or discount to the LIHTC.
There are some upsides to the solar transfer payment. The payment is delivered all at once, whereas the LIHTC is distributed over ten years. Also, the LIHTC carries an occupancy risk – whereas solar does not. One drawback to the solar transfer payment is that it is still new. And of course, LIHTC investments are motivated by a number of factors other than tax credit revenue.
The author also put together a “control case” to look at differences between 100 MW projects, which changes certain variables so that a developer may ignore tax equity and transfer payments. One of these variables includes soft costs – specifically, lawyer and accountant fees. The estimated spread between the tax equity and transfer payments was $2.7 million – which speaks to how transfer payments should be easier, and cheaper (though not easy/cheap as the author notes).

The author also estimated how much more a developer might earn on this 100 MW “control case” project if they were to sell via transfer payments, and found a significant increase of $0.0143/W.
Among the closing thoughts is the question of whether a solar project can change hands within the first five years. The current assumption is that the transfer payment owner will likely be entirely disconnected from the solar facility, and would not be affected by a project transfer of ownership. In the tax equity world, the buyer of a tax credit is part of the project, so they would have to remain an owner for five or more years.

The company is also beginning to delve into electric vehicle chargers–both on grid and off.
Among Yotta’s new product announcements are the DPI-208 and DPI-480 are native 3-phase microinverters for commercial solar and storage applications that can accommodate up to four high-capacity PV modules, each up to 525W+. The Dual Power Inverter also integrates directly with Yotta’s SolarLEAF Energy Storage Technology and is UL-1741 (SA) compliant.
This utility-interactive microinverter has Reactive Power Control (RPC) technology that Yotta says exceeds recent NEC Rapid Shutdown requirements. The company said its DPI can be installed 300% faster than other products on the market and has a maximum continuous output of up to 1800VA. Micro-inverters are a safe bet over high-voltage string inverters and eliminate the risk for DC arc faults, said the company.
“Our goal was to create the most aesthetic products that make solar energy extremely easy to use and functional,” said Emilio Collado, head of design at Yotta Energy. “To develop each of these products, we leaned on exhaustive customer feedback and user experience of consumers and businesses considering the purchase of EVs, needing to meet an increased demand for electricity, or seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This launch establishes Yotta as the single, go-to resource for clean energy products as the company grows and transitions into the e-mobility space.”
Yotta’s new line of commercial EV chargers offers what Yotta calls a “simplified” level 2 charging experience designed for fleets.  Yotta REV is a solar-powered EV charging station that can be deployed in less than 48 hours and deliver up to 510 miles of solar-powered charging daily and is grid optional. REV is an integrated, scalable charging solution designed around solar production capacity that can be grid-connected or operate completely off-grid.
REV has an East-West bifacial panel design that optimizes direct and indirect sunlight for maximum solar energy optimization. The charger is always connected and monitored via 4G or satellite and is designed to work year-round in all weather conditions due to Yotta’s patented core battery thermal technology.
This customizable solar-powered EV station has the ability to be deployed in remote, off-grid locations as well as within urban areas because of its 48-hour rapid deployment. Users have access to between 240 and 510 miles of solar charge daily and 50 to 300 kWh battery capacity. REV also qualifies for the recent Inflation Reduction Act incentives with its combination of solar + storage + e-mobility charging that uses Yotta’s power conversion and solar system design.
Each REV station has a 10-year warranty and is operated via a remote fleet monitoring system. Due to the fact that the electric vehicle charging stations use solar power, they are eligible for incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Yotta’s commercial line of EV chargers includes the single port and dual port charger designed for ease of installation, functionality, and reliability. These commercial charging solutions are rated at 48A (11.5kW) but can be adjusted to 40A, 32A, and 16A to accommodate more chargers into existing electrical infrastructure saving on costly upgrades.
The single charger can be wall mounted or pedestal mounted using Yotta’ custom mounting solution. The dual charger comes with a 4.3” full LCD and robust mount with retractable cord system. Using Wifi or 4G, the chargers seamlessly connect to Yotta’s software management platform to reduce demand charges alongside solar plus storage.
“With the e-mobility market projected to grow to more than $1.5 trillion by 2028, we believe that the future of EV charging, solar, and energy storage will be synergistic for businesses,” said Omeed Badkoobeh, CEO of Yotta Energy. “To meet this demand and to strengthen the existing grid, Yotta is rolling out a suite of products, including commercial EV chargers and rapid EV charging solutions, to support these electrification goals and create a one-stop shop for all of our customers’ renewable energy needs. By introducing these solutions to the market, we are creating an ‘Energy Made Simple’ ecosystem.”
