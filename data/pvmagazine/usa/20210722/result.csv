The company signed a three-year deferred prosecution agreement that could potentially result in dismissal of the single charge.
The charge and agreement stem from the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s ongoing public corruption prosecutions. In court filings, FirstEnergy admitted it conspired with public officials and other individuals and entities to pay millions of dollars to public officials in exchange for actions for FirstEnergy Corp.’s benefit.
Steven E. Strah, FirstEnergy president and CEO, said in a statement, “Moving forward, we are intently focused on fostering a strong culture of compliance and ethics, starting at the top, and ensuring we have robust processes in place to prevent the type of misconduct that occurred in the past.”
In October 2020, First Energy fired Chuck Jones as its CEO. A statement issued by a public relations firm after the plea agreement was announced said that Jones “did not engage in any unlawful activity or violate any of FirstEnergy’s policies.” The statement said that Jones “did not make or authorize any payment of any money” to any public official in exchange for any official act.
“Whether one agrees with it or not,” the statement continued, “the First Amendment and campaign finance laws allow the use of 501(c)(4) entities for appropriate political activity; allow individuals and corporations to support political candidates in a lawful manner; and allow individuals and corporations to lobby on behalf of legislation and government policies.”
The federal complaint said that the money transfers took place through an entity set up through Section (501(c)(4) of the U.S. Tax Code.
The PR firm’s statement said that Jones was “very disappointed that FirstEnergy would falsely implicate so many hard working and dedicated employees in wrongdoing who were committed to implementing the Board’s stated goals.”
In July 2020, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Ohio charged the Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, the former chair of Ohio’s Republican Party, three other people and a “501(c)(4) entity” with a federal public corruption racketeering conspiracy involving $60 million.
The politician, Larry Householder, was arrested and charged in an alleged conspiracy to pass and then defend a billion-dollar nuclear plant bailout. The U.S. Attorney’s office alleged at the time that Householder and the “entity” conspired to violate the federal racketeering statute through the use of wire fraud, receipt of millions of dollars in bribes and money laundering.
According to the criminal complaint, from March 2017 to March 2020, the “enterprise” received millions of dollars in exchange for Householder’s–and the enterprise’s–help in passing what was known as House Bill 6. The bill was described in the complaint as a “billion-dollar bailout” crafted to save two failing Ohio nuclear power plants from closing.
The defendants also allegedly worked to “corruptly ensure” that HB 6 survived a ballot initiative aimed at overturning the legislation. The “enterprise” received around $60 million from an unnamed energy company and its affiliates.
In June, state lawmakers voted 75-21 to expel Householder, who had been Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives. Some Republicans argued that ousting him from office violated his right to due process.
In the most recent court filing, FirstEnergy admitted that it paid millions of dollars to an elected state public official in return for that official pursuing legislation to benefit FirstEnergy’s nuclear power plants.
The company also acknowledged that it paid $4.3 million to a second public official, who acted in their official capacity to further First Energy’s interests related to passage of nuclear legislation and other company priorities.
With 60 days, FirstEnergy must pay $115 million to the United States and $115 million to the Ohio Development Service Agency’s Percentage of Income Payment Plus Plan, a program that provides assistance to Ohioans in paying their regulated utility bills.
As part of the agreement, FirstEnergy admitted to the facts alleged in the statement of facts, which detail actions by FirstEnergy Corp. executives to pay money to public officials in return for official action. The U.S. Attorney’s office said that as a corporation, FirstEnergy Corp. is “responsible for the acts of its current and former officers, directors, employees, and agents.”
Vipal J. Patel, acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Chris Hoffman, special agent in charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cincinnati Division, announced the charge and agreement. Deputy Criminal Chief Emily N. Glatfelter and Assistant U.S./ Attorney Matthew C. Singer are representing the United States in this case.

France-based organic PV module maker Armor solar power films and Dutch designer Marjan van Aubel crafted transparent organic PV modules for the Netherlands’ pavilion at the Expo 2020 Dubai, the universal exposition that will take place in the United Arab Emirates in October.
Van Aubel specializes in incorporating solar cells into furniture, windows, and other objects. In this project, she used Armor’s “ASCA” organic transparent solar cells to create colored modules in which the lines and patterns are interacting with each other.
The transparent panels produce electricity for the pavilion and simultaneously allow sunlight into its spaces and filter the light’s spectrum to enable the photosynthesis of the plants located inside the building.
“Van Aubel demonstrates that solar panels, whilst collecting energy, can be beautiful and a form of art too,” Armor said in a statement, adding that the graphic design is made with a colored Moiré effect, which is an interference pattern produced by overlaying similar, but slightly offset, templates.
The ASCA cells have a power of up to 40 W/m², a weight of 500g/m², and a thickness of 400 μm. The manufacturer can produce them in colors including red, blue, green, and gray. Dimensions and design are customizable, as well as maximum current and maximum voltage.
In October 2020, Armor said its flexible and semi-transparent ASCA film had reached an efficiency of 26%. Its solar technology is mainly used to supply electricity to small connected objects indoors in environments where the light is low (from 200 lux), such as temperature sensors, presence detectors, and trackers for the geolocation of goods, medical equipment, or people.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/22/will-renewables-be-able-to-meet-bidens-clean-energy-goals/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 22, 2021",Will renewables be able to meet Biden’s clean energy goals?,"Unless current deployment trends are accelerated, the U.S. appears on track to fall short of the White House’s goal of 80% clean energy supply by 2030.
Analysis done of a decade of data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggests that renewables penetration will land somewhere between 33% to 50%.
EIA’s most recent electric power monthly report reveals that renewable energy sources provided 22.5% of U.S. electrical generation during the first quarter of 2021. A decade ago, that figure stood at 13.75%. That means renewables have grown at a pace of less than 1 percentage point of the total energy mix each year in 10 years.

Nearly all of the growth can be attributed to solar and wind, which grew from 3.3% to 13.9% of the mix. Biomass, geothermal, and hydropower remained relatively level.
FERC forecasts high-probability additions and retirements during the upcoming three years for each energy source. The next three years are estimated to see 14 GW of fossil fuel and nuclear retirements, and 64 GW of solar and wind additions. If that occurs, domestic generating capacity of renewables would reach nearly 29% by April 2023, growth rate of 1.35 percentage points each year.
From 2015 to 2020, wind has achieved a growth rate of 10% per year, and solar has averaged 30%, though it has slowed to 21% in the past three years. Assuming a 10% and 20% growth rate for wind and solar, respectively, both sources would produce roughly the same amount of power by 2030, each contributing 20% to the overall mix. Add in the steady 10% from biomass, hydro, and geothermal, and renewable penetration reaches 50% by 2030.
FERC’s short-term outlook supports these figures, as it anticipates in the next three years “high probability” additions of 42.8 GW of utility scale solar, a 74% addition to the current 57.9 GW of capacity in this market segment. As much as 58.2 GW could be in the three-year pipeline for solar, said FERC. Wind “high probability” projects stand at 20.5 GW.
EIA’s historical growth data suggest a faster growth rate is possible for renewables. But to do so, annual growth would need to  hit top-line numbers from previous years. In 2016, 2017, and 2020, wind energy grew at a rate of 12% or more. And solar surpassed an average 30% growth rate from 2014 to 2020.
If these rates could be sustained each year over the coming decade, wind would account for 25% of U.S. generation, and solar would provide nearly 45%. Adding 10% from bio, hydro and geothermal means that the Biden administration goal of 80% by 2030 could be met.
This outlook did not include the impact of nuclear power, which the White House said would play a role in decarbonization as well, but the plans only expressly mentioned operating existing plants, not building new capacity. Carbon capture technology was also highlighted in the Biden fact sheet.
FERC said that a national clean energy standard could make such a scenario realistic. A clean energy standard could follow the tried-and-proven model set by state-level Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), but would work at a national level, addressing states that have not yet enacted RPS, or states that have relatively weak RPS established.

The move comes in the very same year as ACP’s foundation, and is the association’s second merger in that time, having merged with the American Wind Energy Association in January of 2021.
The intent of the merger is to combine the membership and team members of ESA with the resources and reach of ACP, while also enhancing the American Clean Power Association’s ability to advocate for the economic and environmental advantages of a clean power economy and further position the renewable energy and storage industries for success.
ESA’s resources include strong relationships with more than 200 companies involved in manufacturing, deploying, and operating energy storage systems in the U.S. and globally, which now gives ACP significant partnerships across both storage and wind. The 200 companies connected with ESA comprise the full diversity of energy storage technologies and business models needed for a more resilient, efficient, sustainable and affordable electricity grid.
The merger will take effect on January 1, 2022, pending final approval from ESA’s members.

The 10 zones correspond to the nine color bands on NREL’s map of global horizontal solar irradiance. In this case, zones 9 and 10 represent split of the map’s northernmost color band.
NREL developed the baseline products to develop and document transparent, normalized technology cost and performance assumptions; document potential pathways for impacts of R&D on renewable energy technologies; enable consistency in technology assumptions across analysis projects; facilitate the tracking and sourcing of input assumptions; and reduce the lead time required when conducting scenario analysis.

In the latest update, zones 2-8, representing all but the northernmost states in the continental U.S., solar installations have a capacity factor that is at least 70% of that in the desert Southwest’s zone 1, the data show.
The solar capacity factor for each zone is provided in NREL’s tables for utility-scale, commercial and residential PV.
Each of those web pages also projects the levelized cost of electricity for solar projects, with projected cost declines through 2050 across all 10 zones.
One participant in a recent NREL-sponsored webinar on the updated data said that the baseline utility-scale PV costs for 2020 seemed too high, and noted a lower price attached to a recent solar power purchase agreement. NREL’s David Feldman, a senior financial analyst, responded that the levelized costs shown by NREL assume no tax credits. He said that “would explain a lot of the difference between market PPAs and our calculated levelized cost of electricity.”
NREL’s cost projections are available in the Tableau table at the top of each of NREL’s three PV web pages. Users may select the appropriate zone from a drop-down list for “technology detail.” Cost projections are also available in downloadable files.
For cases where NREL’s map is not fine-grained enough to determine the zone for a particular site, users may enter the site’s location in NREL’s PV Watts Calculator, said Feldman. The site’s capacity factor is then shown and its zone can be determined from the relevant NREL table. This step is necessary for distinguishing between sites in zones 9 and 10, as the two zones are combined on NREL’s map.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/22/start-up-unveils-3-6-kwh-portable-battery-for-independent-power-supply/,"BATTERY,UNITED STATES",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 22, 2021",Start-up unveils 3.6 kWh portable battery for independent power supply,"From pv magazine Global
Start-up EcoFlow presented its latest portable battery, for which it started a crowdfunding campaign on its Kickstarter platform.
According to the California-based company, the EcoFlow Delta Pro system can be expanded to a capacity of up to 25 kWh and can be fully charged in less than two hours. The device is claimed to be the first battery in the industry that can be linked to multiple energy sources. The emergency power consumption of an average family can be covered for a week with one charge, according to the manufacturer.
The basic version of the portable battery has a capacity of 3.6 kWh, which can be increased to 10.8 kWh by coupling two additional batteries, the company said. By linking it with other smart home products, the capacity can be increased to 12.5 kWh or 25 kWh, making the storage system an emergency power solution or suitable for an independent power supply.
EcoFlow names photovoltaics, wind power and gas as possible charging sources for its product. With the right accessories, the possible uses could be expanded and the home battery could be linked to several power sources and the power supply controlled.
In addition, charging of electric vehicles with up to 3,000 W is supported via the charging station, the EcoFlow Smart Home Panel, or via a 230 V socket. The input power can be increased to up to 6,000 W if the EcoFlow Delta Pro is connected to a “smart extra battery” and is additionally charged with a photovoltaic system and a “smart generator,” according to the company.
EcoFlow specified the original AC output power is 3,600 W, which can be expanded to 7,200 W. Then the battery could also be used to supply devices such as refrigerators or air conditioning systems with electricity.

The company also launched a green financing framework intended to guide its investments in new and existing projects that have environmental benefits.
The securitization consists of $106.2 million in AA- (sf) rated 1.62% notes and $106.2 million in A- (sf) rated 2.01% notes. The notes carry a weighted average life to the Anticipated Repayment Date of July 20, 2028, approximately 5.07 years, and have a final maturity of July 20, 2048.
The notes are backed by a portfolio of 6,435 solar rooftop systems distributed across 19 states and territories. The weighted average customer FICO score of the related customers at the time of origination was 735. The transaction is expected to close by July 28, subject to customary closing conditions.
On this 2021-B transaction, the company said it achieved spreads of 80 basis points (bps) and 120 bps for the AA- and the A- tranches, respectively, over the interest rate benchmark. The company said this represents its best pricing to date for a solar and storage loan asset securitization.
Credit Suisse was the sole structuring agent and bookrunner for the securitization, and Popular Securities acted as co-manager.
The Green Financing Framework is expected to allow Sunnova to demonstrate its qualifications to investors who seek third-party-assessed renewable energy investment opportunities, and will diversify Sunnova’s access to capital.
Under the framework, financings will be required to meet internal eligibility criteria that align with the International Capital Market Association’s Green Bond Principles. Net proceeds from any financings may be used for the capital investment, research, development, acquisition, manufacturing, distribution, maintenance, and operation of solar energy and storage systems and enabling technologies for solar energy storage and optimization.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/22/heres-how-a-solar-friendly-infrastructure-bill-may-get-through-congress/,"ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 22, 2021",Here’s how a solar-friendly infrastructure bill may get through Congress,"The calendar may read mid-summer, but congressional watchers are looking ahead to December as the end-game for action on an infrastructure bill that likely will have long-term benefits for the solar industry.
In the thread-the-needle world of the evenly divided Senate, success or failure may hinge on the actions of two senators and one gatekeeper whose name you may have never heard.
“This is a once-in-a-generation type of bill” in terms of its dollar size and scope of issues, said Rhone Resch, president and chief revenue officer for Solarlytics, and for 12 years president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. The infrastructure bill — really a handful of separate bills — “will suck the air out of Washington for an extended time,” he said. Resch made his comments during a June 20 webinar hosted by Roth Capital Partners.
(Read “SEIA issues a call to advocate for the Biden infrastructure bill.“)
The bills include a $1.2 trillion version that a bi-partisan group of Senators agreed to in principle in June, along with the Biden Administration. Earlier, the House of Representatives passed a $715 billion bill. And, depending on what happens over the next several weeks, a so-called “reconciliation bill” could come up for a vote sometime in December.
The high stakes started to play out July 21 when Senate Republicans blocked moving forward on a bipartisan infrastructure bill that was still being negotiated. They turned back a “cloture” vote to which would have opened the door for the bill to come up for debate. Negotiators said they may be able to provide the 60 votes needed for cloture as early as July 27, when they said they think discussions over the bill will wrap up.
Politico quoted Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) as saying, “We’re a no today because we’re not ready.” Portman, the lead Republican negotiator, sent a letter from 11 Republican senators to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer indicating that within a few days Republicans would be in a position to put up the votes to beat a filibuster.
If a cloture vote fails a second time, all is not lost for the infrastructure bill and key provisions that benefit the solar industry. Resch said that infrastructure spending likely would be rolled into a much larger bill. And here the strategy becomes more complex.
A strategy known as reconciliation was created by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. It allows for expedited consideration of certain tax, spending, and debt limit legislation. In the Senate, reconciliation bills aren’t subject to filibuster and the scope of amendments is limited. These features give the process an advantage in terms of enacting controversial budget and tax measures. Reconciliation may only be used two times a year, so the White House and Schumer will be laying it all on the line by turning to this approach for infrastructure.
Because a bill under reconciliation is not subject to filibuster, it can pass the evenly divided Senate with 50 Democratic votes and the tie-breaking vote by Vice President Kamala Harris. That’s no easy feat, however, because all 50 senators who caucus with the Democrats need to be kept in line.
As has been the case since the new Congress took office in January, attention has focused on Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) as a key vote on reconciliation. He, along with Sen. Sinema have publicly insisted that any infrastructure bill be clearly paid for, and Sinema is leading the infrastructure negotiations.
“The big challenge is how to work with Manchin and Sinema,” Resch said. “They want it paid for.”
A bill likely would include an eight-year extension to the ITC, raising it to 30%.

Then there’s Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, who plays a pivotal role in the final contours of a reconciliation bill. The Parliamentarian advises the Senate, interpreting its own rules as well as on parliamentary procedure. It will largely be up to her office to decide what may and may not be included. That makes it unlikely that policy-related items like a Clean Energy Standard would be included.
As it looks now, a reconciliation bill that contains spending for infrastructure would offer several benefits for solar.
Resch said that a bill likely would include an eight-year extension to the Investment Tax Credit, raising it to 30%. Under reconciliation, a specific item may not add to the federal deficit beyond a 10-year time-frame. To be on the safe side, negotiators  are looking to an eight-year extension. Resch said that talks also look favorable for including a 30% ITC for energy storage and a credit for electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
Also likely to be included is a direct pay incentive, a financial tool that has grown in popularity given some of the drawbacks with tax equity finance. The final version of what that incentive may look like is being discussed by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a special committee made up of House and Senate members.
With Congress out of town for much of August and with its long-standing tradition of not acting on much of substance in September and October, a reconciliation bill may not come up for debate before November with a final vote likely sometime in December.
The high-stakes game over infrastructure continues, and the solar industry stands to gain mightily from passage of a bill.
