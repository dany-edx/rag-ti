The company posted revenues of $302 million in Q4 2023, down from $724 million in Q4 2022.
Revenues have been damaged significantly in both the United States and Europe, which are both having widespread struggles in the rooftop solar sector. In the U.S., high interest rates and regulatory changes have dropped the financial attractiveness of rooftop solar. Enphase reported a 35% drop in U.S. revenues in the fourth quarter.
As for Europe, unexpected lowered demand from stabilizing energy prices and an influx of inexpensive alternatives from China have slowed sales. This, combined with a glut of inventory in distributor channels, has led to reduced shipments and a loss of 70% revenues quarter-over-quarter in Europe.
Enphase made some improvements to its gross margins, reaching 50.3% in the fourth quarter, compared to 48.4% in Q3. Enphase also cut its operating expenses from $99 million to $86.6 million quarter-over-quarter.
The company said capital expenditures occurred due to reduced manufacturing operations spending in the U.S. It also announced the layoff of about 10% of its workforce in December 2023.
The company exited 2023 with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. It generated $35.5 million in cash flow from operations in Q4, 2023.
Enphase continues to operate a share repurchase plan that was authorized in July 2023. The program authorizes up to $1 billion of repurchases of the company’s common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported repurchasing 1,183,246 shares of common stock at an average price of $84.51 per share for a total of approximately $100 million.
Looking ahead
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, Enphase expects revenues to continue to fall, landing in a range between $260 million and $300 million. This includes the shipment of 70 MWh to 90 MWh of its IQ Battery.
Enphase expects to ship roughly 500,000 units of U.S.-manufactured microinverters, leading to a net Inflation Reduction Act benefit of $12 million to $14 million.
In a December interview with pv magazine USA, Enphase co-founder Raghu Belur said that he expects 2024 to be “a year of recovery” for residential solar. He said that California’s market may be a quarter or two from reaching the bottom trough in demand, and Europe has started to stabilize and clear out channel inventories.
Belur noted that while demand has dipped in major markets like California, the fundamentals of rooftop solar remain strong. In California, for instance, what used to be a four-to-five-year payback period, or return on investment, for rooftop solar, is now about seven to nine years under the NEM 3.0 rate structure.
“But you’re buying a 25-year asset, so you’re still coming out way ahead,” he said.
He points to the financial fundamentals of rooftop solar, storage and EV charging. Interest rates are eventually going to come down, and meanwhile, utility rates are rising far faster than inflation. This is particularly true in California, where the Public Utilities Commission approved a 13% bump to electric utility rates in 2024. Couple these changing forces with diving solar module prices, and suddenly the payback period looks strong, and demand recovers.
While solar and storage shoppers typically use a rule of thumb of about 3% to 4% annual rate increases from the utility company to estimate long-term savings, Belur said this assumption no longer applies. “Double-digit rate hikes are common now,” he said.

The solar projects in the new portfolio will average about 3 MW and will use bifacial solar modules mounted on single-axis solar trackers. The majority of these projects will be designed with pollinator-friendly habitats.
Summit Ridge reports that Castillo Engineering will provide design and engineering services on the portfolio, with many of the projects beginning construction in Q1 2024. All 26 are expected to be completed by Q4 2024, at which point Costello and Summit Ridge Energy together will have completed over 120 projects totaling over 375 MW combined. By the end of the year, the two will collectively have a community solar portfolio of over 500 MW in Illinois.
“We chose to work with Castillo Engineering on this portfolio of projects due to their extensive community solar experience within Illinois, their Project Management Office, as well as their highly customized solutions,” said Pradeep Mohanraj, vice president of engineering at Summit Ridge Energy.
Illinois has a strong and growing solar market mainly as a result of the state’s renewable portfolio standard that requires that 25% of its energy comes from renewable sources by 2025. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the state had 2.35 GW of solar installed as of 2023 and that is expected to grow by more than 1,700% over the next five years.

Illinois is now ranked as the fourth largest U.S. state in terms of community solar operating capacity, according to the Institute on Local Self Reliance, with approximately 220 MW installed. Collectively, Summit Ridge Energy and Castillo Engineering will have a community solar portfolio of over 500 MW in Illinois by the end of 2024.
Overall, community solar capacity in the U.S. is expected to increase from about 6 GW in 2023 to 14 GW by 2028, according to Wood Mackenzie

Microsoft Corporation agreed to purchase 100% of the energy and renewable energy credits produced by Bayou Galion Solar to support its goal of being carbon negative by 2030. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be operational by fall 2024.
The Bayou Galion project is located on 1,080 acres in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana and is expected to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of approximately 20,500 homes. Recurrent estimates the project will employ 300 people during construction. The company said it is committed to supporting local community organizations in Morehouse Parish through donations and sponsorships, in addition to the increased tax revenue for Morehouse Parish public services.
Recurrent Energy began development of Bayou Galion Solar in 2018 and started construction in December 2023. Primoris Renewables Energy, Inc. is the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. Once construction is completed, Recurrent Energy will be the owner and operator.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. acted as Coordinating Lead Arranger for the financing of the Recurrent project.
Louisiana has lagged far behind other states in its adoption of solar, one reason being the lack of a renewable portfolio standard. As of 2023 Louisiana ranked 39th in solar installed, with the state generating 0.59% of its electricity from the sun. There are currently several large utility-scale solar projects under construction including the Oxbow Solar project, which will be the largest in the state at 345 MW.

Recurrent Energy reports that it has built approximately 9 GW of solar and 3 GWh of battery storage power plants across six continents since 2009. As of Q4 2023, Recurrent Energy had a global development pipeline of 26 GW in solar and 55 GWh in storage, of which 13 GW and 12 GWh respectively are projects with interconnections. The company anticipates having 4 GW of solar and 2 GWh of storage in operation in the U.S. and Europe by 2026.

Like Paired Power’s other products, PairTree is a solar-powered EV charger; however, it doesn’t need the electric grid connectivity to function. The off-grid product can provide backup power in remote areas and military sites. 
The solar canopy takes up a standard 9- by 18-foot parking space. It features bifacial solar panels available in 4.6 kW units combined with a UL 9450-listed battery energy storage system and one or two level 2 EV chargers. The solar panel’s bifacial design means reflected light can reach the bottom surfaces of each panel without shading from mounting systems or other infrastructure obstructing it.
Paired Power said its bifacial panels can increase PairTree’s energy yield by as much as 15%, allowing its 4.6 kW units to perform as effectively as a 5.3 kW solar array. 
Depending on the capacity of its battery energy storage system, which the company says maxes out at 42.4 kWh, the product provides between 75 and 230 miles of daily range. PairTree’s operating temperature ranges between -20° F and 120° F. It is designed to withstand wind speeds up to 130 mph and 40 psf snow loads.
Users can control charging via a software app they install on their phones. Tom McCalmont, CEO of Paired Power told pv magazine USA that each PairTree is connected to the cloud using similar commercial security services that protect online banking systems.
“All traffic between the charging stations and the data in the cloud is encrypted, as is all access to the data that we provide for monitoring system performance,” he said. 
The base price for a unit ranges between $28,000 and $78,000 based on the battery size and number of chargers. Installation generally costs up to $5000 per system, with exact numbers dependent on location. However, Paired Tree states that customers may be eligible to claim a 40% tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act’s Investment Tax incentive.

The report tracks venture capital funding, public market, and debt financing into the solar sector, which totaled $34.3 billion raised in 160 deals in 2023. This compares to the 2022 total of $24.1 billion across 175 deals. Mercom said 2023 had the most corporate funding in solar in a decade.
“Despite high-interest rates and challenging market conditions, corporate funding in the sector was the highest in a decade,” said Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer, Mercom Capital Group. “Debt financing also hit a decade high, and venture capital investments and public market financing recorded the second-highest amounts since 2010. Driven by the Inflation Reduction Act, the global focus on energy security, and favorable policies worldwide, solar continues to attract significant investments.”

Global venture capital (VC) reached $6.9 billion in 2023, with 26 VC funding deals of $100 million or more in 2023. This was down 1% from the $7 billion raised in 2022.
The largest global VC deal was for 1KOMMA5°, a Germany-based solar installer, which raised $471 million in a Series B funding round.
In the United States, project developer Silicon Ranch announced that it conducted a $600 million equity raise. An initial $375 million in funding closed in December 2022, with an additional $225 million closing in 2023.

Public market financing for 2023 totaled $7.4 billion, up 45% from the 2022 total of $5.1 billion raised.
Debt financing took an even larger leap, growing 67% year-over-year to $20 billion, up significantly from the $12 billion raised in 2022, and the highest amount since 2010. Mercom said securitization activity was a key contributor, adding $3.4 billion over 11 deals.
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) declined over 2023, with 96 transactions over the year, down from 128 corporate M&A transactions in 2022. The largest transaction was by Brookfield Renewable, which agreed to acquire Duke Energy’s unregulated utility-scale commercial renewables business in the U.S. for approximately $2.8 billion.
As for project acquisitions, over 45.4 GW of projects were acquired in 2023 across 231 projects. This slowed down from 2022, when 268 projects totaling 66 GW were acquired.
Mytilineos, a Greek industrial conglomerate, acquired 1,410 MW of a solar portfolio from Westbridge Renewable Energy for $1.2 billion. The portfolio included over 1.2 GW of solar capacity.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/06/the-impact-of-climate-based-pv-panel-degradation-rates-on-inverters/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,BELGIUM,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-06,The impact of climate-based PV panel degradation rates on inverters,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at Belgium’s Hasselt University have discovered that climate-based solar module degradation rates could have a significant impact on power electronics in PV systems.
In the study “Assessing the impact of PV panel climate-based degradation rates on inverter reliability in grid-connected solar energy systems,” which was recently published in Heliyon, the academics warned that using similar climate-based degradation rates for PV systems in all climate zones worldwide represents an “unrealistic approximation” that can lead to misleading results. “This can result in the over- or underestimation of PV lifetime and subsequently impact the power electronics reliability estimations,” they added.
The research group evaluated the panel degradation rates based on climatic stresses in three distinct geographical locations: Genk in Belgium, Accra in Ghana, and Kabd in Kuwait. These locations represent moderate, hot and humid, and hot and dry climates, respectively.
It used a physics-based approach that considered meteorological data such as ambient temperature, irradiance, wind speed, and direction, as well as material properties like optical, thermal, and electrical constants, and thicknesses of each layer in the module. It also took into account panel parameters such as temperature coefficients, external quantum efficiency, and interconnect layout.
The researchers explained that insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), which are the switching devices in the PV inverter, are extremely sensitive to high temperatures and, without proper management, can lead to failures or reduced lifespan.
“Every time that an IGBT is turned on, there will be power losses generated inside the material layers, and these power losses can generate heat inside the IGBT,” they explained. “Consequently, each activation induces a thermal cycle attributed to these power losses.”
The team analyzed the potential degradation rates in a standard 4 kW PV system including a DC-DC boost converter and a single-phase inverter using four IGBTs with a voltage rating of 700 V and a current rating of 40 A. It considered a scenario without solar module intrinsic degradation rate and a scenario taking into account intrinsic PV degradation rate.
Through a series of simulations, the researchers found that the inverter in the PV system located in Kabd has a much shorter lifespan than inverters located in Genk and Accra.
“The PV inverter in Kabd experiences substantial thermal stresses without the effects of PV degradation, and the IGBT may fail in just 5 years, leading to PV inverter failure in just 3.8 years,” they stressed. “With the introduction of linear PV degradation, the PV inverter’s lifespan in Kabd will increase to 5.8 years, but still falls short of the other two locations. The physics-based PV degradation model will raise Kabd’s lifespan to around 6.5 years.”
The group concluded that deploying PV systems in hot and arid climates could require different parameters for inverter design. “These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating various factors and parameters when assessing the reliability of a PV inverter and its switching device,” it stated.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/06/alaskan-tribal-communities-form-independent-power-producers-for-renewables-projects/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,ALASKA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,2024-02-06,Alaskan tribal communities form independent power producers for renewables projects,"Alaska’s Northwest Arctic Borough is working with nine tribal communities located near the Arctic Circle that have renewable energy systems to create a legal structure for each system converting it into an independent power producer (IPP). Forming an IPP will give each community access to a state subsidy that will lower the cost of renewable power, said Ingemar Mathiasson, the borough’s energy manager, on a webinar sponsored by the Alliance for Clean Energy.
As he spoke, he said the temperature was -45 F in the tribal community of Ambler, and “under those circumstances it’s really hard to keep holding on to renewable energy systems with batteries and everything else involved.”
The communities’ renewable energy systems were built over the past 15 years to reduce the need for costly diesel fuel. As a point of reference, Mathiasson said that the price of stove oil and gasoline in Ambler just went up to $18 per gallon.
Early renewables systems built by the communities relied on wind and hydropower, while newer systems rely more on wind and solar power, Mathiasson said. The year-round average solar capacity factor in the area is 11%, based on the borough’s own measurements.
Unfortunately, although the renewables projects have reduced each community’s use of diesel fuel, the communities have also received a lower subsidy under the state’s Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program, which provides a per-gallon diesel subsidy to support remote utilities dependent on diesel fuel.
Fortunately, however, those working on the renewables projects learned that a tribal community could form an IPP and sell the renewable power to the local utility, in which case the utility’s purchase of the power is considered a fuel cost, thus qualifying for the PCE subsidy.
The Northwest Arctic Borough has helped three communities form IPPs since 2021. One of these, the community of Noatak, recently completed an IPP project with 281 kWdc of solar (250 kWac), and 2-hour lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery storage with 442 kWh capacity.
The six other communities could also add solar and storage and form IPPs if a pending borough grant proposal to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations secures funding.
Mathiasson shared a projection that the nine Arctic tribal communities plus the nearby town of Kotzebue would have, “at full build-out” of solar IPP projects, a combined 5 MW of solar capacity and 16 MW of battery storage. Those projects would reduce diesel consumption by 328,000 gallons per year and yield annual IPP revenue of $1.8 million.
The grant proposal also requests funding for heat pumps for all households in the region, which would further reduce annual diesel consumption by 223,000 gallons.
The opportunity for similar renewables IPPs across rural Alaska is “very widespread,” said Brian Hirsch, founder and president of Deerstone Consulting. The 15-person consulting firm works primarily in rural Alaska, providing multiple services to support renewable project development.
Hirsch said that achieving 50% renewable penetration on an annual basis “is a big deal, so if you’re at 50%, you’re way ahead of the pack.” Because “the other 50% of your power is still coming from diesel fuel, it’s a partial solution,” but “if you can create a job, you can put some revenue back into the community, that’s great.”
Mathiasson countered that “there is a money restraint, right? Everybody is competing for these monies that are coming out. And it’s not inexpensive to put these systems in. We have a lot of communities out there that could do the same thing. But where would the funding come from for all of them?”
The Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy sponsored the webinar to provide a platform for considering the formation of IPPs within the context of Alaska’s PCE program.
