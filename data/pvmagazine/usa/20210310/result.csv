The bills, SB 52 in the Senate and HB 118 in the House, would require renewable energy project developers to share their application with township trustees 30 days before applying for a certificate from the Ohio Power Siting Board. HB 118 currently awaits referral to a House committee.
Township trustees, after reviewing the application, could then move to call for a referendum petition. If that petition receives signatures representing at least 8% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election, then the project must be voted on at the next primary or general election before moving forward.
Bill advocates said the measure is an expansion of community rights, and that it is only permissive in nature. They said the bill would not  hinder townships that want to host renewable energy projects from doing so.
Renewable energy advocates, however,  argued that the bills would have a chilling effect on renewable projects that are expected to be developed in the state. They also argue that utility-scale electric generation must be regulated at the state level and not at the township level.
The Solar Energy Industries Association projects Ohio to install 1,904 MW over the next 5 years, good for 14th in the nation over that period.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/10/duke-faces-pushback-over-north-carolina-brownfield-solar-project/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,COST AND PRICES,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 10, 2021",Duke faces pushback over North Carolina brownfield solar project,"A brownfield solar project proposed by Duke Energy just outside of Asheville in western North Carolina has brought together some unlikely alliances. The utility and a collection of climate activists, clean energy advocates, and community leaders face off against state officials who have argued that the project is costly and unnecessary.
The 5 MW project in question was set to be constructed on a former landfill in Buncombe County, as part of the county’s goal to reach 100% renewable energy by 2030. Because of the project’s location and the fact that it would bring the county roughly 20% closer to achieving its goal, the land was offered to Duke for next to no charge, providing significant cost reduction on an already cheap resource.
The project was initially announced in late July 2020, with completion expected for the second half of 2021.
The project was also set to be part of a 2015 compromise between Duke and the community and environmental leaders it is now allied with. The utility agreed to support a 45-mile proposed transmission line through the Blue Ridge Mountains with two gas peaker plants, 15 MW of solar, and 5 MW of battery storage in or near Asheville, rather than its initial plan of a 680 MW gas plant, with all of the capacity being used to replace a coal plant being retired in the city.
These plans now face opposition from North Carolina’s Public Staff, the state entity charged with advocating for ratepayers. The staff is opposing the project, arguing that the installation would be a significant and unneeded burden on ratepayers, when compared to generating electricity from one of Duke’s existing natural gas plants.
The issue now sits before North Carolina’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The PUC is the same body that approved the 2015 transmission line and generation proposal, while advising the utility to start work on the renewable projects sooner rather than later.
Since then, Duke has completed a 9 MW battery in Asheville, begun development on a solar + storage microgrid in nearby Hot Springs, North Carolina, and announced plans to develop an 8-10 MW solar facility at the site of its former Asheville coal plant, once the ash dump site has been cleaned and sealed.
According to a Duke representative, the cost of building the project would cost the average residential customer 2 cents a month on a $100 utility bill. Public Staff argued that the cost should not be incurred by all of Duke’s ratepayers, since only a select few will directly benefit from the project. The entity also argues that building the plant would be well above avoided cost, which is how much Duke would spend producing a kilowatt-hour of electricity from a gas power plant.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/10/underperforming-solar-assets-shade-the-entire-industry-here-is-how-to-fix-it/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,GUEST POST,MONITORING,O&M,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,NORTH AMERICA",,"MARCH 10, 2021",Underperforming solar assets shade the entire industry. Here is how to fix it,"Underscoring what some call the solar industry’s “systemic overestimation bias,” kWh Analytics found that the average solar asset underperformed its target weather-adjusted production by 6.3% between 2016 and 2019 (early life); one-quarter of the projects that were studied missed their production targets by more than 10% after accounting for weather.
These data points are unsettling, but are they surprising? After all, what accounts for the industry’s overly optimistic bias towards over production?
In short, self-interest. When the developer, EPC company, and long-term owner are all financially motivated to assume generous production, they generally will. The inevitability of real-world data crashing this party was bound to happen.
A recent IEA renewables report reiterates how solar has evolved beyond being an accessory in the nation’s energy mix to being the lowest-cost, highest-growth energy generation source going forward.
This inflection point represents an opportunity for the industry to shift its attention away from constant cost-out and toward putting our collective effort into building projects that reliably generate cost-effective clean energy.
The ever-increasing deployment of solar assets can’t be contained. For the health of the whole industry, we owe it to ourselves to deploy better projects.
Beyond the kWh Analytics tools, there are three main areas every solar industry participant needs to be mindful of to help assure that projects meet projections.
Production Estimates – or why 0.5% annual degradation rates are almost always wrong. Early in my solar career, I proudly said that products from the company I worked for out-performed production estimates by 10%. Someone wisely told me that if that was true, we should fire our modeler.
If your production estimates are consistently wrong, regardless of the direction of the error, they’re inherently flawed.

While many independent engineers and owners rep services provide third-party validation of production models, the single-input, single-output principle of any analytic tool holds true for solar. If everyone uses the same flawed project assumptions, then the outputs will be flawed. Reality always has a way of showing up poor models.
Although made more challenging due to the pandemic, site visits are critical to validate not just shading and azimuth, but also actual site conditions.

I’ve seen unshaded rooftop arrays vastly underperform models thanks to exhaust from a neighboring factory that was not worked into project model’s soiling rate. I’ve also seen the production model on a utility-scale field not account for a high-voltage transmission line that ran right over the center of the array because it wasn’t visible on Google Earth.
Some of the most common production estimate mistakes come from relying too much on system defaults. It doesn’t matter if those estimates are produced by PV Syst, Helioscope, or even PV Watts. Module and inverter companies publish data sheets and simulation files – often audited by third parties – informed by real-world performance and test data. And those third-party-validated simulation files must be used for accurate modeling.
For example, in the majority of system simulations, they assume too often that every module degrades at 0.5% per year, including the first year. Specifying a high-efficiency module could improve that degradation rate from 0.5% to as little 0.35 or 0.25% per year.
So, what may seem like an incremental improvement at best may result in end-of-life performance as much as 10% higher than with a typical commodity solar module, and that translates into real production value.
Performance Risks in Construction. While large-scale arrays are typically closely inspected around PTO (permission to operate), these inspections may miss damage caused during installation that’s not otherwise visible.
An extreme example is construction crews walking on modules, leaving micro-cracks. Trust me, this happens more than anyone wants to admit.
Then there are easily found but often missed inter-mating of mismatched connectors and poor wire management, which can cause arcs and faults. Or, torque a clamp too tightly on a module and it can create compression on the frame, leading to a premature failure that isn’t typically covered by a warranty and which might not manifest itself as a visual failure until after a year or two of production.

A significant construction-related risk factor in system underperformance is the selection of lowest-cost components whose performance doesn’t match model expectations. While independent factory auditors can help assess and mitigate this risk, they often are looking more for adherence to quality standards and a certain bill of material. These factory audits don’t entirely mitigate the risk of a serial failure in a sub-component, such as a backsheet or connector.
I don’t know the extent to which the system underperformance tracked by kWh Analytics was due to premature component failure, but it likely was more than failing to properly quantify soiling rates.
No one knows what component will fail in 5 or 10 years. But everyone can assess the viability of the manufacturer to be able to honor warranty claims. Metrics such as BNEF’s “Tier 1” are an important tool to help guide companies toward reputable firms. Those metrics, however, shouldn’t be used as a reliable predictor of product quality or a company’s financial health without further validation and due diligence.
O&M — or, how we can learn to love the OpEx.  If a project’s upfront modeling was accurate and if the EPC built a quality project using high-performance material, then it’s operations and maintenance (O&M) that may make or break an array’s long-term performance.
We’ve all stared at the same Excel spreadsheet trying to hit a certain hurdle rate. And we’ve all worked to squeeze every penny out of the CapEx. Now it comes time to shaving dollars off the OpEx by reducing the scope of work on your O&M provider.

The likely result of reducing the O&M expense is reducing the O&M service, which may have an outsized impact on long-term power generation.
Frankly, saving a dollar on O&M that impacts system performance by a percentage point for the last 10 years of an array’s service life doesn’t really make sense for the long-term asset owner.
Long-term owners need to invest in quality O&M, and they should audit to ensure the work is done to agreed-upon standards. Good O&M is more than cleaning off modules and running inverter checks. It extends to performing preventive maintenance to ensure long-term reliable clean power generation from the asset.
Reliable solar asset performance for the long term relies on three disciplines: proper project development, quality EPC work and thorough O&M. All should be spot-on to ensure solar assets reliably perform for their contractual lifespan.
“…now is the time for the industry to focus on delivering a cost-efficient, reliable, and high quality product.”

While remaining mindful of cost, the industry must now pivot from focusing on short-term cost reductions to developing, building, and maintaining long-term value and performance.

Solar MAP is designed to help towns and cities navigate the process of installing solar at their public buildings and achieve energy savings. The Green Bank said the program provides support throughout the development process, from identifying viable sites to soliciting installation services and arranging financing.
The first participating municipalities–Manchester, Mansfield, Portland, and Woodbridge–will install 14 solar systems adding up to 3.2 MW, with $3.6 million in estimated total savings.
Manchester Mayor Jay Moran said it would have been “much more difficult” for the town to go solar without the program.
To complete the projects, the Green Bank chose Greenskies Clean Energy, a national solar developer based in North Haven, Connecticut, through a competitive bid process. By aggregating multiple solar PV systems across the four municipalities in its solicitation for solar developers, the Green Bank said it was able to achieve competitive pricing through economies of scale.
To support Solar MAP, the Green Bank also partnered with CSW Energy for technical support to evaluate buildings, such as town halls, emergency services buildings, and schools, for their solar potential.
The Green Bank also arranges for project financing through a power purchase agreement (PPA). Since 2014, the Green Bank Solar PPA has facilitated solar projects at municipal buildings with no upfront installation costs, no new debt to incur, and no operations and maintenance costs. The Green Bank said the PPA allows municipalities to lock in low electricity prices so the project cash flow is positive in year one.

No problem, RMI report says","New reports from RMI offer ways to rapidly decarbonize the U.S. power system while also maintaining reliability.
The first report, Cutting Carbon While Keeping the Lights On, said that more than half of the country’s coal fleet can be retired and replaced with renewables without compromising reliability reserve margins.
RMI, formerly Rocky Mountain Institute, found that 27% of the coal fleet, mostly in the Northeast and Southeast, could be retired by 2025 without replacement. Another 29% could be replaced with lower-cost wind and solar, which would reduce electricity costs and help decarbonize the U.S. power system.
The second report, How to Build Clean Energy Portfolios, said that utilities need to invest $300 million-$750 million through 2030 in clean energy to support changing demand, primarily in terms of electric vehicles and buildings. The report also said that “outdated utility procurement processes” favor coal- and gas-fired power plants.
The report said “outdated utility procurement processes” favor coal- and gas-fired power plants.

In a separate report published in early March, consultancy ICF said that utilities have been slow to respond to the threats that climate change poses to energy systems. The report cited what it said was an overall “lack of insight” into the degree of infrastructure exposure; the complexity around how to measure vulnerabilities, hazards, and stressors; and uncertainty about appropriate timing and level of investment for adaptation measures. What’s more, utilities face difficulty in securing funding for proactive resilience investments.
The report found a $500 billion gap in capital investment. It said that gap needs to be closed for U.S. investor-owned utilities to “effectively address” climate change risks.
The City of Nashville will install 3.2 MW of solar PV at three water treatment plants. The Metro Council unanimously approved the plan (BL2021-613) in early March. The vote also supported another ordinance (BL2019-1600) requiring the city to get 35% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025; roughly 2.5% of that must be solar. Under the measure, all of the city’s energy must be sourced from renewable energy by 2041, and 10% of it must be solar power.
In 2020, Nashville became the first local government to pursue access to utility-scale solar power in the Tennessee Valley Authority service territory. The city also modernized its building codes to promote greater energy efficiency in residential and commercial buildings.
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) said it exceeded California’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) goal requiring energy providers to deliver 33% renewable energy by the end of 2020.
The utility estimated that it delivered more than 35% of its electricity from eligible renewable resources last year. It said that more than 88% of its electricity came from greenhouse gas (GHG)-free resources, including eligible renewable, nuclear, and large hydroelectric sources.
The utility said that large-scale solar energy made up 45% of its total renewable energy power mix. The company added that it it has 239 RPS-eligible power purchase contracts, representing more than 6,700 MW of renewable energy; of that, more than 4,100 MW is solar energy. PG&E also owns 445 MW of RPS-eligible generation, including 13 solar power plants, which generate up to 152 MW of energy.
PG&E said that rooftop solar in its service area represents about 20% of all rooftop solar in the country.
The utility currently has contracts for battery energy storage projects totaling more than 1,400 MW of capacity to be deployed through 2023. It said that more than 19,000 customers have installed and connected behind-the-meter battery energy storage systems to the grid totaling more than 230 MW of capacity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/10/hosting-capacity-maps-a-gold-mine-for-solar-developers/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESIDENTIAL PV,RHODE ISLAND",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 10, 2021",Hosting capacity maps: A gold mine for solar developers,"A decade ago, resources for scouting viable locations for new distributed energy resources (DER) simply did not exist.
That meant solar developers had zero access to critical power grid connection information, substation status, and other local solar plant connections. We were flying blind.
In practice, this is how it worked from a solar sales perspective:
1. Find a viable business owner interested in solar
2. Owner signs deal, $2,5000 payment made for PE-stamped one line & interconnection application
3. Developer submits the interconnection request…and hopes for the best.
The risks could be mitigated somewhat by knowing the power grid well, or by tracking down an insider willing to answer specific questions. However, the developers’ obligation to take on power grid risk slowed efficient markets from forming.
Since then, multiple states have created legal requirements forcing electric monopolies to share their power grid data with solar developers via what are known as Hosting Capacity Analysis (HCA) maps. States that now provide HCA maps include California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.
More recently, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council and the Clean Coalition of California have made large contributions to the maps.
With the evolution of these HCA maps, developers now have access to something that previously was elusive: useful data. As outlined in an earlier pv magazine USA article, these still-young hosting capacity maps haven’t always shown the most accurate information, meaning that solar developers might not have reached out to customers in these regions.
Utility National Grid operates in Rhode Island and illustrates local line capacities with its HCA map. Surplus availability for solar capacity — always listed in AC/inverter sizing terms — is determined by the utility and based on the minutia inherent to each circuit. The highest capacity locations are seen in dark blue.
Additional information includes total solar already on the circuit, the circuit’s voltage, whether the circuit is three phase or single phase, and a range of substation bank information.
Each utility has a set of rules and disclaimers governing the information they release, and what that information represents on their maps. Adding complexity, there’s still the human factor involved, because the numbers aren’t entirely accurate in all places; think of them as a guide.
For example, a recent 200 kWac project in Rhode Island learned when the interconnection application was submitted that no additional solar power was on either the local circuit or at the substation.
But by the time the project’s interconnection was returned, a 5 MWac solar project had won approval at the substation. As a result, the smaller 200 kWac project was told that the substation was full, and that it would have to share a roughly $650,000 upgrade cost, potentially delaying the project until the upgrades were complete.
As it turned out, the larger-scale ground mount project was moving slowly due to local resistance. Without offering an explanation, when the final interconnection for the 200 kW project was approved, the utility assessed no new fees.
As of today, that big solar power plant is still pending, but the small one is complete.
Properly designed, the hosting capacity maps offer the ability to look closely at our power grid resources.
Southern California Edison’s hosting maps contain a built-in function enabling users to filter sites based on available capacity above a certain threshold. As a solar developer and individual cheering for a strong power grid, few pieces of data are as useful as site data sorted by grid demand.
Knowing exactly what circuits can handle – and which circuits are arguably in need of solar power – is like a treasure map.
Here are links to several Hosting Capacity Maps intended for solar developers. If you have more to contribute, please comment with a link.
