With these dates in mind, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) rang the bell for a grassroots and industrywide push to persuade Congress to pass a sizable — and solar-friendly — bill.
(Read “SEIA outlines solar priorities in the federal infrastructure bill.”)
In a recent webinar, SEIA advocated for an expansive, lengthy extension of the federal solar investment tax credit, the inclusion of a separate tax credit for energy storage systems, and the creation of a direct-pay system.
Given the current executive and congressional makeup, SEIA called this an urgent “generational opportunity” for the industry to grow.

With proper support, SEIA said the next decade could witness solar expand from a $25 billion-a-year industry to one that creates hundreds of billions in revenues, strengthens the economy, addresses the climate crisis, and paves the way for hundreds of thousands of jobs.
The Hill reported that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) vowed that Republicans would wage a “hell of a fight” over attempts by Democrats to pass the multitrillion-dollar infrastructure plan along party lines. He reportedly said that there would be a “big argument” about Democrats’ plan to use reconciliation, which would allow them to bypass Republicans in the Senate.
“This is going to be a hell of a fight over what this country ought to look like in the future and it’s going to unfold here in the next few weeks,” McConnell was quoted as saying. “I don’t think we’ve had a bigger difference of opinion between the two parties.”
Solar-supportive people and business members were given three steps to get involved:
1) Email your member of Congress, ask them to support a robust solar presence in the bill, and invite them to make a site visit to a local solar facility.
2) Download SEIA’s Hot Solar Summer Campaign toolkit to access solar data, talking points and messages, a guide on how to find your legislators, as well as advocacy strategy guides, graphics and other assets, and contacts for support.
3) Sign the solar industry sign-on letter for strong clean energy infrastructure policies.
As a first step, SEIA said it sees value in driving support of a high top-line budget for the overall infrastructure bill. Then, as the solar portion of the bill is considered, its main priority is support for a long-term investment tax credit.
The group highlighted the support of U.S. manufacturing as being essential to achieving the administration’s clean energy targets. Recently introduced legislation by Sen. Jon Ossoff does well to support module manufacturing, SEIA said, but a more comprehensive, full suite of solar technologies will need to be included. The SEIA vision for the bill includes features like inverters, racking, monitoring, and so on.

To support this growth in manufacturing, SEIA called for the bill to include at least a 30%, 10-year solar investment tax credit, including storage. The organization said it is critical that the extension is made long term, so the industry has greater demand certainty.
Also called for during the webinar was capital expenditure support, including the creation of a U.S. manufacturing tax credit. In addition, SEIA said it sees value in the bill including ongoing production support in manufacturing. Specifically, U.S. manufacturing could benefit from growth in the production capacity of wafers, cells, and inverters, areas where SEIA said the nation currently lags.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/09/federal-clean-energy-standard-one-of-the-best-ways-to-reach-decarbonization-goals-report-says/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 9, 2021","Federal clean energy standard ‘one of the best ways’ to reach decarbonization goals, report says","Seven studies on achieving a high level of renewables show that a federal clean energy standard “is one of the best ways to achieve deep decarbonization of the power sector,” says a report from Energy Innovation, a policy advisory firm.
A federal clean energy standard of 80% by 2030 is the focus of current federal policy discussions, said the report’s author Dan Esposito. He wrote that tax credit extensions alone, while helpful, “would fall short” of deep decarbonization goals.
The studies included in the overview report by Energy Innovation included research from Harvard University, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and Resources for the Future.
The technology-neutral policies considered in the seven studies would achieve 80-90% clean energy by 2030-2035. That would be accomplished by deploying 50-100 GW of U.S. solar and wind power, plus 9-23 GW of battery storage, per year. Other technologies were not found to be economical.
Electricity in the high-renewables scenarios would cost roughly the same as it does today. Meanwhile, health and climate benefits would be worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.
All seven studies were completed since March 2020, and reflected recent cost declines for solar, wind and storage, “which are largely responsible for the models finding that such a goal is achievable at minimal cost—a conclusion not reached by older studies,” the Energy Innovation report said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/09/in-high-tide-or-low-tide-solar-plus-storage-by-your-side/,"ENERGY STORAGE,PRODUCTS,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 9, 2021","In high tide or low tide, solar plus storage by your side","Silent Yachts released an upgraded version of its solar-powered Silent 60 yacht, which now comes with an optional kite, adding wind power without shading the panels.
The vessel is 59 feet long, has a 29.5 foot width at the beam, and displaces 29 tons of water. Pricing for the Silent 60 starts at $2.58 million. The full range of products range from $2.34 million for the Silent 55 through $6.54 million for an 80-foot, three-deck model.
The vessel comes with 42 solar panels, outputting around 16.8 kWdc. The SunPower solar modules – probably a 400W Maxeon – are offered with a standard 25-year warranty. A 10 kW inverter is included, along with an 80 amp charge controller coupled to the energy storage system.
The lithium-ion battery ranges from 143 kWh for the Cruiser, through 286 kWh for the E-Power+. Yachting World magazine noted two years ago that a previous model’s batteries were manufactured by Panasonic.
The electric motor size and top speed increase with the battery size. The E-Power+ can cruise up to 100 miles per day on solar power alone, reports claim.
And while its sister ship, the SILENT 64, was “the first fully solar powered production yacht in the history of nautical travel” to cross the Atlantic Ocean, the luxury yacht comes with liquid fuel resilience, just in case.
The ship can sail all day at 6-8 knots, but it’s only able to travel at its top speed for about 30 minutes before running out of juice. In order to outrun storms or return to shore quickly after the sun sets, a backup generator at 100 and 150 kW is powered by two 300-liter diesel tanks.
But with good planning (and even a little luck), the generator isn’t necessary. In an interview with Yachting World, the builder noted a customer’s proud proclamation of having enjoyed his yacht for two years without using the generator at all.
The solar panels are not just responsible for the craft’s locomotion, but also for its reverse osmosis water makers, a full kitchen, LED lighting, and TV. Laminates were used where possible to reduce weight. The hull has extra layers of thermal insulation to keep heating and cooling loads down, and many windows have been deliberately placed out of the direct sun.
The already-silent and energy-efficient vessel has now added an option of a WINGit kite boat system. The wind kit manufacturer has a video showing the wind pulling a boat at just over 6 knots. The nearly 60-foot-long Silent Yacht is said to be able to reach 4-5 knots with the kite alone.
The manufacturer of the wing kit suggests that it generates up to 10 times more power per square meter than a conventional sail. The 140-square-foot unit attaches to a two-foot mast via four Kevlar ropes. After the kite fills with air, it’s let loose to drift up off the yacht, eventually reaching nearly 400 feet.
The sail traces a figure eight above the boat, and the captain can steer it with a joystick or an app on an android phone, says Köhler, the company’s founder.
The solar yacht may be cool, but it represents part of an emerging trend in the transportation sector.
Starting in 2016, transportation emissions in the U.S. were greater in volume than those produced by power generation.
Globally, S&P suggests that the shipping industry represents 2-3% of all emissions.
A.P. Møller – Mærsk A/S, one of the world’s largest shipping companies, plans to launch its first carbon-neutral vessel by 2023, and hopes to have a zero-emission vehicle by 2030 as part of its broader 2050 zero-emissions goals.
Some of the first large battery powered ships started in the ferry industry, mostly in Scandinavian nations. Currently, one of the world’s largest ferries is the largely autonomous 7 MW/4 MWh Bastø Electric, which is capable of  making two dozen 30- minute trips per day.

The priorities were included in a letter that SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper sent to Chairman Richard Neal of the House Ways & Means Committee and that was shared with pv magazine USA. The letter highlighted policies to help fully decarbonize the electric grid, including a long-term investment tax credit (ITC) extension with direct pay, a storage ITC, domestic manufacturing incentives, grid upgrades and workforce development provisions.

When the infrastructure bill was introduced at the end of March, Ross Hopper called it a “significant step in meeting our collective clean energy goals.” She said the plan would create jobs, spur the economy, face the climate crisis, and advance environmental justice.
In her July 8 letter to Neal, Ross Hopper wrote that solar makes up just over 3% of electricity generation nationwide. To modernize the grid and meet climate goals, she said that solar “must account for at least 20% of U.S. generation” by the end of the decade and 40-50% by 2035, a scale that would require quadrupling the current pace of installations by 2030. “We are in a race against time,” she wrote.
Her letter on behalf of the industry outlined six priorities, including:
Jinko Solar signed a cooperation agreement with Maersk (China) Shipping Co. to develop what it said would be “flexible and convenient solutions” to manage a shortage of containers due to the pandemic and to improve transport efficiency. Jinko said it expected that expanding its shipment capacity will support its growth over the next few years. It said its goal is to share more timely shipping information and provide “long-term logistics solutions” to customers.
New legislation introduced in both the Senate and House would permit clean energy generation, high-speed internet transmission, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure on highway rights-of-way.
The Senate bill, introduced by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) would allow state transportation departments to use interstate highway rights-of-way for renewable energy generation projects; electrical transmission and distribution projects; broadband internet projects; and electric vehicle or other clean alternative fueling stations. The bill is similar to legislation introduced by Georgia Congressperson Carolyn Bourdeaux in the House.
The bill also would encourage states to manage highway rights-of-way with environmentally sound vegetative practices, like growing native grasses or pollinator meadows instead of turf grass.
