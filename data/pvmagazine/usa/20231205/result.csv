The Goleta Energy Storage facility is a 60 MW / 160 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system. It stores enough power for the equivalent of about 30,000 California households. This is enough to supply the city of Goleta’s municipal customer base.
The system is comprised of 44 containerized Tesla batteries manufactured in state in Lathrop, California. NORD/LB provided $55 million of project debt financing to GridStor to complete the development of the facility.
“California has an urgent need for grid reliability as it decarbonizes its economy, and battery storage is the critical resource that meets both challenges,” said Chris Taylor, chief executive officer of GridStor.
The project is the largest power resource in Santa Barbara County and the second battery facility in the region. It was constructed with support from IBEW Local 413 laborers.
“The transition to clean energy takes the support of many partners, from developers and utilities to skilled tradespeople and the local leadership who oversee zoning and permitting, said Taylor. “We could not be prouder to work with the City of Goleta and other stakeholders to bring this facility to life and support California’s goals for clean, reliable energy.”
The facility is expected to help support the existing 900 MW of solar and wind operating in the region for the planned buildout of thousands of megawatts of renewable power over the next decade. GridStor will provide resource adequacy services from the facility to Southern California Edison under a contract while operating the facility in response to market signals from the California Independent System Operator.
“GridStor’s Goleta Energy Storage project will secure grid power for one of our most climate-vulnerable regions as California continues to deploy new, clean power infrastructure in pursuit of our climate and energy goals,” said Rohimah Moly, deputy director of energy & climate at the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development.

The initial application deadline is December 13, 2023, followed by an eligibility application deadline a week later, and the final bid proposal due January 31, 2024 – what awards expected in April.
Details of the RFP are available on NYSERDA’s website.

This RFP mirrors the structure of the state’s standard energy procurement process, which annually awards approximately 1 GWac of solar power. The latest round of this program procured 6.2 GW of renewable energy, including three offshore wind and 22 land-based projects. The land-based projects include 14 new solar facilities, six wind repowering projects, one new wind project, and one hydroelectric project returning to service.
NYSERDA told pv magazine USA that this specific RFP, dubbed ‘RESRPF23-1’ (2023 Tier 1 Solicitation), aims “to keep New York State apace toward achieving New York’s Climate Act goals in the face of financial pressures on New York’s portfolio of projects. No specific quantity is targeted in this solicitation, given the dynamic status of the portfolio and the potential for a subset of active contracts awarded under previous solicitations to be terminated.”
This procurement round is part of the state’s “10-Point Renewable Energy Action Plan”.
The RFP mandates prevailing wage payments for laborers, with bid submission fees in the following range:
Successful projects will receive an Index REC Strike Price, balancing the risk of low power prices for plant owners without overcompensating them in high energy price scenarios.

The strike price is composed of the environmental value, based on New York’s social cost of carbon, and the wholesale value of electricity. The state sets a floor price, historically $75.19/MWh, which combines these values. If wholesale electricity prices increase, the state incentive reduces to a floor value.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/05/ensuring-equitable-access-to-influx-of-clean-energy-jobs/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"DECEMBER 5, 2023",Ensuring equitable access to influx of clean energy jobs,"With less than twelve years to develop and scale a carbon-free electricity sector, stakeholders continue to deploy solar and storage technologies to help reach 2035 targets. However, building this infrastructure will require a dramatic increase in skilled labor. According to the Department of Energy (DOE), one of the most effective ways to generate such a workforce is through registered apprenticeship (RA) programs. 
RA’s allow individuals to receive training while working. As their skills increase, so does their pay, and employees receive a nationally recognized and industry-valued credential to signify program completion. 
The DOE states that RA programs will likely increase in the coming years due to the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) clean energy tax incentives. Organizations can receive an increase in credits or deductions of up to 5 times when applicable projects adhere to registered apprenticeships and prevailing wage standards. This may push companies to prioritize hiring registered apprentices for construction, renovation or maintenance work. 
The Interstate Renewable Energy Council states that 85,858 people worked clean storage jobs in 2022, with 85% of those employed in battery storage. Moreover, there were approximately 432,000 individuals who held positions in solar energy or clean storage last year. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), we’ll need to double that figure to ensure that solar makes up 30% of domestic electricity generation by 2030. “The solar and storage industries will need 800,000 new workers for a total workforce of more than 1 million.” 
Disparities within the workforce must also be addressed, particularly ensuring equitable access to leadership roles regardless of race or gender. According to SEIA’s U.S. Solar Industry Diversity Study 2019, Men are more likely to hold positions at the Manager, Director and President (MDP) level than women, “37% of men hold MDP-level positions and only 28% of women do,” the study reports. According to SEIA, these findings have stayed the same since its last diversity study published in 2017. The organization is currently conducting a 2023 study. 
SEIA’s U.S. Solar Industry Diversity Study 2019 also found a 26% gender wage gap, with 37% of men making between $31 and 74% per hour compared to only 28% of women.
“The median wage reported for men was $29.19, and for women, it was only $21.62,” the study reports. 
This was even though women exhibited higher value than their male counterparts in networking to advance their careers.
“Over half of women indicate that professional connections and networking are vital to their successful career navigation, while only 30% of men consider their connections and networking opportunities vital,” the study reports. 
When comparing wages by race, findings suggest further disparities as 39% of Hispanic or Latino participants made between $31 to $74 per hour compared to 50% of Black or African American participants and 36% of white participants who reported making the same wage. 
Moreover, Hispanic or Latino participants were more likely to hold MDP-level positions than non-Hispanic participants. Black or African-American participants were slightly less likely to have MDP-level positions than their white counterparts. However, white individuals held 88% of executive-level MDP positions, and 80% of those participants were white men. 
The DOE states that RA programs will play an important role in building a large and diverse clean energy workforce. This is because they provide more women and non-white individuals with a viable approach to becoming an apprentice, completing the program and securing a quality career in the clean energy industry.
“I go to school every Monday and Tuesday night, it’s very welcoming. They’re guiding me and teaching me all I need to know,” says Amber Jones, a sheet metal apprentice at SMART Union. “Now I can pay my bills and feed my kids.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/05/m10-solar-cell-prices-dive-to-new-record-low/,"COST AND PRICES,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHINA,WORLD",,"DECEMBER 5, 2023",M10 solar cell prices dive to new record low,"From pv magazine global
The FOB China prices of both PERC and TOPCon Mono M10 cells, the mainstream size of solar cells in the current solar market, continued their downward trajectory and were assessed at $0.0550 per W and $0.0616/W this week, respectively. This marks their lowest prices ever, according to OPIS data, amid falling prices of the entire supply chain and weak demand in China and its key export market.
Cell prices were negatively impacted by the ongoing price decline of the supply chain in China. Prices for China polysilicon and Mono PERC M10 wafers both decreased this week by 4.07% and 0.40%, respectively. The price of Mono PERC modules is approximately CNY1.011 ($0.14)/W, which is extremely close to the industry’s psychologically low value of CNY1/W, while the prices of TOPCon modules are slightly higher at CNY1.077/W.
OPIS learned from its market survey that cell manufacturers are making every effort to lower production costs as they are experiencing losses. One of the approaches is to buy wafers of reduced quality. According to a cell supplier, the Mono PERC M10 wafers with reduced quality are available on the China market for CNY1.7/pc while good quality wafers are still priced between CNY2.2/pc and CNY2.3/pc. This may resonate with a few downstream users who have been worried about the impact that this competition to cut production costs may have on module quality for 2024.
Another strategy for cell manufacturers to cut production costs is to outsource their production to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). OPIS has learnt from the marketplace that a major cell manufacturer has an extremely high operating rate, as it has won numerous contracts from other cell companies that have outsourced their cell production.
According to OPIS’ market survey, manufacturers who outsource cell production benefit from the low cost brought by the high operating rates of OEMs, and could provide Mono PERC M10 cells at lower than CNY0.43/W in the China market. Those who continue to produce at low operating rates in their own production facilities are still offering it at around CNY0.45/W.
Sentiment in China remains bearish. According to the National Energy Administration, China deployed 13.62 gigawatts (GW) of solar in October, which presents a month-to-month decrease of 13.69%. This is the third straight month that China’s newly installed solar capacity has declined.
China’s key export markets continue to offer little sunshine. A state-owned cell manufacturing enterprise claims that sales of its cells have been hindered since the second half of the year, especially in the cell export market. Purchasing Chinese cells has become a rare occurrence for their Southeast Asian consumers, although formerly they did so regularly.
“The module producers cannot use Chinese cells if they want to ship their products to the US market; the local Southeast Asian market has a very limited solar capacity to digest Chinese cells and modules,” this supplier explained.
Looking ahead, the industry anticipates that the price of Mono PERC M10 cells will continue to decrease, with industry discussions suggesting that it may drop to approximately CNY0.4/W very soon in the Chinese domestic market. This indicates that the sentiment in the cell market will remain subdued.

In the first eight months of 2023, utility-scale solar capacity additions reached almost 9 GW, outpacing additions from other generation sources and growing 36% over the same period in 2022, the report notes. By the end of this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects utility-scale solar to more than double compared to 2022, which the Deloitte report attributes to the combined force of the demand for decarbonization along with federal investments such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).
The industry outlook report identifies five trends:
Caveats
As solar installations ramp up in the U.S., interregional transmission will need to more than double, while regional transmission needs to quintuple, to meet the growth projections by 2035, the report estimates.
While Deloitte is expecting solar and storage manufacturing to surge downstream, the report notes that the reshoring is premised on balancing the 40% price premium of U.S.-made solar modules with the 40% tax incentive that manufacturers can receive if they use 40% domestic components. This will be a challenge because of the lack of cell manufacturing capacity in the U.S.  Another challenge is seen in the rising rate of imports, as global solar prices drop.
Moving forward
Expect to see renewables move forward at a rapid pace once the U.S. Treasury releases final tax guidance, the report says. With only 10% of the IRA grant funding release so far, not only will solar and storage (and other renewable) installations soar, but the manufacturing renaissance will develop more resilient clean energy supply chains across the U.S.
The challenges to this growth, the report concludes, include the need for a smart grid that can handle the influx, along with the need for a skilled workforce to manufacture and install the clean energy systems of the future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/05/how-to-convert-iec-standards-into-actionable-procedures-for-your-team/,"MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 5, 2023",How to convert IEC standards into actionable procedures for your team,"IEC standards set by the International Electrotechnical Commission are a valuable reference point for ensuring consistency and are commonly used in new construction projects where the circuits to be tested are accessible and have not yet been energized.
However, when it comes to the Operations & Maintenance of existing and up-and-running systems, blindly following these standards without considering the specific context of the work can be counterproductive. In some cases, performing electrical tests as described in the standard can even result in system damage and pose a safety risk to personnel. Therefore, it is crucial for solar deployment teams to translate these standards into actionable procedures that take into account real-world considerations.
IEC 62446-1 (see the table at the end of the article) establishes the standard for testing, documenting, and maintaining grid-connected PV systems. The standard specifically outlines protocols for direct current (DC) testing, which is used to assess the health of the system at various points of asset life.
In order to make these standards more actionable, the Department of Energy has funded a collaborative research initiative between solar software provider illu and the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). The program aims to adapt NREL’s published best practices guidance for solar PV O&M into digital, operational, and publicly accessible procedures.
Initially, the guidelines were in the form of lengthy PDF documents, which made them challenging to use on-site. The team has now converted them into digital and interactive flows, specifically designed for mobile devices. These resources are now publicly accessible and free-of-charge in illu’s Workflow Library.
In addition, IEC standards are utilized in a range of situations throughout the lifecycle of a system. These may involve equipment in different physical states and be performed for varying objectives. To meet the specific objectives of each use case more effectively, the team developed case-specific applications of the IEC standards.
Adapting procedures for each use case
Practically speaking, PV system testing and inspections are conducted in three situations: commissioning, preventative maintenance and recommissioning. In each of these cases, the system may vary significantly in terms of age, physical condition and operational status. The primary objective of the activity would also differ depending on the situation.
During the commissioning process, the objective is to confirm that the system is fully constructed, aligns with the designs and contract terms, and is ready for handover and operation. In this context, conducting a thorough and meticulous evaluation of the system is ideal. Comprehensive inspections and testing are carried out to identify any issues or defects prior to the Commercial Operation Date (COD), in order to prevent problems from arising after the contractual handover, when it may be too late to address them. This process also helps to eliminate any workmanship issues and identify any faults from the manufacturer.
Therefore, all tests within the IEC standard apply if the appropriate equipment and PPE are available. Since the system is not yet energized, testers can take open circuit measurements and perform tests that would otherwise require taking the system out of operation.
Commissioning testing workflow
In preventative maintenance (PM), the objective is to ensure adequate performance while avoiding disruptions that may take a system out of normal operations. Unlike commissioning, PM is not associated with a one-time handover and can be revisited if situations change. PM is often performed on older systems, and putting stress on fuse holders and connectors may increase the likelihood of failure.
A less intrusive protocol is typically sufficient, and the team has provided two tiers of testing based on intrusiveness. The first option relies solely on visual inspections and an overall system performance evaluation.
System performance workflows
The second option adds a moderate level of testing, including Vmp and string-level Imp. This allows testers to adequately evaluate if there are any abnormalities that need further investigation, without disturbing stable operations (which would occur when performing open circuit tests).
Preventative maintenance testing workflow
Specific practical adjustments
Beyond adapting standards to the objectives in each use case, there are other site-specific considerations that impact the tasks to include in your processes.
Available Equipment. Two tests depend on specialized equipment and may not be practical for many solar teams:
System Age/Condition: Systems that are older or have faced more significant degradation (such as humidity, salt mist corrosion) require consideration for their physical state, making it impractical to perform certain functional tests:
Hitting the right balance
The illu and NREL team conducted a thorough comparison between generic inspection and testing checklists based on IEC 62446-1, and context-specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) developed through illu Workflows. In collaboration with Solar Energy International, the team tested and refined processes that strike the right balance between incorporating key IEC-recommended considerations and practicality for teams on the ground.
The following processes were specifically designed for ground-mounted PV arrays:
These processes can be edited and adjusted to suit the requirements of your sites using illu’s Workflow editor.

Minnesota Line One was first installed in 2018 at 150 MW and has now doubled in capacity to 300 MW with this recent investment. Line One is situated contiguously to a second, 500MW line installed in 2022. The company reports that the upgrades will improve the efficiency of the line and enable the manufacture of TOPCon solar modules.
Heliene has a technology roadmap that calls for the manufacture of PERC modules up to December 2024, while TOPCon will be the new technology starting in February 2024. There will be an overlap of PERC and TOPCon throughout 2024 within the company’s three manufacturing lines.
“The reason Heliene and many other solar equipment manufacturers are moving into Topcon and/or HJT is to advance its product offer, to make these products more efficient,” Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene told pv magazine USA. “Not different than when everyone went into monocrystalline only, leaving polycrystalline in the past.”
The expanded line is also expected to create an estimated 130 new jobs in Minnesota’s Iron Range. When asked about the challenge in finding workers, Pochtaruk told pv magazine USA that paying more and providing full benefits for the employees and their families has shown to be a good plan. He also noted that Heliene works with the local trade colleges to design curricula to meet the company’s needs.
“We’re proud to be delivering on our commitment to grow our U.S.-based manufacturing capacity and create new clean energy jobs with the refurbishment of Minnesota Line One,” said Pochtaruk. “Recent funding and federal incentives are helping us grow our facilities and workforce to keep up with historically high demand for domestically produced solar PV modules. We’re thankful to our clients for enabling us to grow rapidly, while maintaining the customer-first approach Heliene has become known for.”
The expansion of Minnesota Line One is the latest milestone in Heliene’s continued growth and investment into the North American solar industry. In August 2023, Heliene and Nexamp, the nation’s largest community solar provider, entered into a partnership that includes a 1.5GW module order to support the development of  about 400 new community solar projects over the next five years.
Heliene has been manufacturing solar modules in Ontario, Canada since 2010, where it currently has a 300 MW manufacturing line.
