The problem was first recognized around 2012; the industry did not know the exact cause behind it, but it has been quick to develop mitigation strategies.
Understanding the effectiveness of these strategies, and ultimately eliminating performance losses associated with LETID, requires comprehensive testing. Such testing is increasingly a requirement for module buyers wary of the financial impacts of unexpected performance losses.
A collaborative effort between scientists and industrial players across Asia, Europe and the United States has tested a range of silicon PV modules for LETID, with the aim of developing a new, applicable protocol. Their findings and the testing procedures they used will likely be adopted into a formal standard published by the International Electrotechnical Commission later this year.
“Global researchers have published many promising strategies for reducing or eliminating LETID, and there is evidence both in this work and elsewhere that manufacturers in recent years have adopted these strategies,” said Joseph Karas, a researcher at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “Some modules in this work showed essentially no LETID sensitivity. Still, LETID risk is not a fully resolved matter as new wafer types and cell architectures are being adopted which might be LETID-sensitive.”
The group described the testing procedures in “Results from an international interlaboratory study on light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation in solar modules,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The procedures primarily involve subjecting modules to high temperatures, and either directly injecting a current, or placing them under simulated sunlight at different levels, either to cause LETID degradation or initiate a recovery mechanism in already degraded modules.
By fabricating intentionally LETID sensitive modules, they were able to calibrate the procedures to maximize LETID, and could distinguish such losses from other issues. Testing was conducted over a period of four weeks, but the researchers noted that in the soon-to-be-published standard, this will be reduced to two, with a doubling of the injected current to compensate.
“This work, the forthcoming TS, and the advancing scientific understanding of LETID will help mitigate the physical and financial effects of LETID,” the researchers said. “Manufacturers will be able to test for LETID and engineer LETID-free cells and modules, module buyers will be able to evaluate potential purchases with confidence, and financial stakeholders will benefit from the reduced risk that follows from that confidence.”
It might lead to effective mitigation or even the elimination of LETID effects, but the work will nonetheless continue, so the industry can fully understand the mechanisms behind the problem. In this project, the group found differing impacts on fill factor between modules, and significant variations in LETID between individual cells within single modules – neither of which it could immediately explain.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/10/california-nem-3-0-revisited-commission-seeks-industry-feedback/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 10, 2022","California NEM 3.0 revisited, Commission seeks industry feedback","This February, following several weeks of industry outcry, public protest, and political leader involvement, California’s Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 was delayed indefinitely. Now, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is revisiting the issue and seeks feedback on a structure that is agreeable to the nation’s largest solar industry, representing 50% of all US rooftop solar, and its citizens.
As proposed, NEM 3.0 would have slashed the payments made by utility companies to rooftop solar owners for exporting their excess PV production back to the grid. EQ Analysts said the proposal would lead to a 57-71% overall reduction in solar savings across the state.
A provision that was particularly under fire was the grid access charge, an $8/kW solar capacity charge per month. The charge would apply to all solar customers, regardless of whether they have grid-supporting technology like battery energy storage. A typical 7kW system owner would pay an additional $56 a month under the proposal.
At the time, SolarReviews, a residential solar informational site, interviewed about 4,000 active solar shoppers in the state, and showed them what their solar savings potential looked like under the assumptions of NEM 3.0. The results were nothing short of damning for California rooftop solar, as 95% responded they would no longer purchase under the cost assumptions. In many cases payback periods were increased to as much as 20 years, a wait many viewed as unreasonable and too risky.

After protest and industry comment, Governor Gavin Newsom said there was “work to be done” on the proposal, and CPUC President Alice Reynolds requested more time to consider changes.
Much of the foundation of the heavily protested NEM 3.0 was based on the concept of a “cost shift” created by net metering payments to solar customers. More on the utility-backed push of the cost shift, and a debunking of its core assumptions can be read here.
Feedback sought by CPUC
The NEM 3.0 policy will now open for feedback on proposed changes. Comments to the questions below are due June 10, 2022. 
Three main elements are being explored in the policy revisit, namely the “glide path” approach, non-bypassable charges on gross consumption, and community distributed energy resources. The full scope of the issues being considered can be found here. 
Glide path
The original NEM 3.0 decision structured in a “market transition credit” also referred to as a “glide path”, that would taper down payments for solar customers in increments over a four-year period, eventually reaching the “avoided cost” rate to the utility.
The new proposal mentions a boost to the value of the “market transition credit” but uses broad language and no concrete figures to explain how its new proposal, “Avoided Cost Calculator (ACC) Plus” would be implemented. Neither the length of the taper-down period, nor the value of the ACC Plus credits are mentioned in the proposal, and CPUC seeks feedback on how this could be structured.
Non-bypassable charges
The other issue at hand is that of “non-bypassable charges.” Proposed originally by the Sierra Club in an NEM 3.0 rulemaking process, the charges would be a possible alternative to the “grid access charge”, a fixed monthly fee that experts called a “tax on the sun.”
Replacing this would be a fee to offset costs for projects such as utility wildfire mitigation costs, retiring nuclear power plants, and funding energy-efficiency and low-income assistance programs. These charges would add a proposed $0.05/kWh to all customers, whether they own solar or not. The charges would even apply to power generated by the customer’s home solar system, which is unconventional considering the utility does not have ownership over the solar array, and did not invest in it.
The CPUC’s scope of issue report outlines several direct questions it will field related to these charges.
Community solar tariff
The third main issue under review is that of community distributed energy resources. Currently, the Commission offers a community solar program for low-income customers living in disadvantaged communities through the Community Solar Green Tariff (CSGT) program. The CSGT program enables residential customers in disadvantaged communities who may be unable to install solar on their roof to benefit from a local solar project and receive a 20 percent bill discount. Three major utilities are set to propose changes to the program by the end of this month.
Potential changes to CSGT include an expansion of program capacity, and eligibility requirements for customers, locations and technologies. The scope of issue report outlines several questions related to these proposed changes.
Guiding questions asked by the CPUC: 
Additionally, the CPUC asks several questions to guide the overall structure of the eventual successor to NEM 2.0. 
Comments are due June 10, 2022.

According to the company, the investment will be used to enable the manufacturing of its OMCO Origin Tracker Torque Tubes at OMCO’s Indiana and Arizona locations. In total, the company has 7 GW of true U.S. manufacturing capacity across four locations: Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Ohio. OMCO manufactures its own torque tubes in order to maintain domestic control of the supply chain and reduce distribution costs. Since torque tubes can be among of the most expensive pieces of a tracker system, OMCO said that its tubes have saved up to 25% of the tracker cost in some cases.
In addition to cost savings, OMCO also credits its factory-direct approach in allowing the company have exceptionally short lead times, sharing that the company can provide mounting or racking solutions for any project in as little as six to eight weeks.
In application, the Origin Tracker Torque Tubes are part of the system that allows the company’s Origin Tracker to operate long module rows effectively by minimizing gaps over posts, between modules and at row ends. The company shares that the trackers can support up to 120 modules in a row.
“Torque tubes are the backbone of the solar tracker, and OMCO Solar is proud to be the only tracker manufacturer to make its own in the U.S.,” said Gary Schuster, president and CEO of OMCO Holdings.
In 2021, OMCO shipped 1 GW of its factory-direct products, which were installed installed in 30 states. Combined with the 8 GW of prior contracted hardware, OMCO Solar now has delivered over 9 GW to the market worldwide.
Early in 2021, OMCO Solar announced that it would to donate racking equipment to help complete a 1 MW solar project and adjacent training lab at the University of Arkansas Hope-Texarkana.

The project is the first of the InnovateMass Resilient Service Station Challenge—the purpose of which is to ensure continuous power for service stations near evacuation routes across the state.
Enel X, the energy services arm of the Enel Group, advises large energy users on energy procurement, sustainability, and risk management, and the company’s intelligent DER Optimization Software is designed to analyze real-time energy and utility bill data. It enables customers to select the operational mode that best suits their system, allowing for response to load fluctuation, and overall storage system management.  JuiceNet is Enel X’s smart EV charging platform.
The microgrid at Alltown Fresh Ayer powers the facility with solar panels on the canopy, a battery storage unit, and a portable generator connection, all of which were designed, built, operated, and financed by Enel X. The microgrid includes an 87 kWp rooftop solar array an 87 kW / 174 kWh battery. The universally compatible 50 kW DC fast charging station uses JuiceNet software and JuicePass and can charge vehicles up to 80% battery capacity in 30 to 60 minutes. By integrating the system behind the same meter, the on-site solar will help charge EVs, and in the facility will continue to be powered in the event of an outage.
“The Alltown Fresh microgrid is attractive to EV drivers who want to power their vehicles with renewable energy, and it’s valuable to businesses to support the local grid by decreasing overall demand and reducing emissions while reducing costs,” said Surya Panditi, Head of Enel X North America. ”
The microgrid is the first project to be completed under InnovateMass’ Resilient Service Stations Challenge, which seeks to ensure continuous power for service stations near evacuation routes across the state. Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s (MassCEC) developed a request for proposals under the Resilient Stations Challenge, a special round of its InnovateMass program. The RFP focused on projects that deployed commercially viable energy resilience technologies that could provide energy resilience, risk management, clean energy and/or climate benefits to Massachusetts gas stations, enabling these facilities to stay up and running during extended power outages.
Enel X also partnered with National Grid under the EV Make Ready Program to upgrade the grid to support EV charging, power for the service station, and interconnection of the distributed energy resources co-located behind the same meter.
Enel X offers a financing solution that bundles all of the microgrid assets to support businesses in resiliency efforts. The customer pays a flat rate for the solar power generated, receives a share of the energy storage asset’s financial benefits, and keeps the EV charging revenues.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/10/emissions-free-battery-recycling-facility-will-use-electricity-rather-than-smelting/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TEXAS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 10, 2022",Emissions-free battery recycling facility will use electricity rather than smelting,"Recycling technology company ACE Green Recycling said it will construct a 400,000 square foot battery recycling facility in Texas that operates on a proprietary emissions-free system. 
The plant is expected to recycle both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries when in operation, recycling the key elements of both electric vehicles and conventional automotives, energy storage, telecommunications and mobile devices. 
Phase one of operations is pegged for Q3 202, starting with the recycling of lead-acid batteries, shortly followed by the lithium-ion operation, said ACE Green Recycling. By 2025, at full capacity, the facility may process up to 100,000 metric tons of lead-acid batteries and 20,000 metric tons of lithium-ion batteries. 
Battery recycling is typically done by a smelting process that involves extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 1000 °C, while burning expensive and pollutive fossil fuels, and exposing workers to hazardous working conditions.  
Rather than smelting, ACE’s process is fully electrified. The company said this leads to an emissions-free higher battery material yield and a safer workplace environment.
At full operation, the project is expected to recycle more than 5 million lead-acid batteries, abate more than 50,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, reduce landfill dumping of more than 10 million pounds of hazardous solid waste, and recycle more than 15 million pounds of plastics annually. The facility is expected to create 100 Texas-based jobs.
ACE said it is also exploring opportunities to power most of its key plant activities with solar energy to address its Scope 2 emissions. The plant would be truly “emissions-free” if solar PV or other emissions-free generators are used as the sole source of power. 
Due to a lack of sufficient recycling capacity, the US currently exports a large amount of its scrap batteries to Mexico and Asia while importing new materials back, leading to major value losses and an inefficient use of energy to ship these materials around the world. By establishing a large recycling center in Texas, ACE said it intends to alleviate US dependence on imports. 
“Texas sits at the heart of the world’s global energy revolution with key access to an abundant pool of top engineering and technical talent. ACE’s new facility aims to be part of that revolution and build a greener, more sustainable future for America,” said Nishchay Chadha, ACE’s co-founder and chief executive. 
“We are excited to establish our first North American facility in the state of Texas that will not only generate significant local economic activity but also contribute to a greener environmental footprint,” said Dr Vipin Tyagi, co-founder and chief technology officer. “By contributing to America’s battery recycling capabilities, we also aim to strengthen the country’s energy independence and build a more resilient future for the nation.”
ACE Green Recycling is an American technology company with global operations across Southeast Asia and India. It is set to announce new facilities in Asia, Europe and the Middle East by early 2023.
DOE funds
The announcement follows a Department of Energy unveiled plan to inject $60 million into second-life opportunities for batteries once used for EVs. The $60 million comes in addition to the $3.1 billion funding for battery manufacturing, processing, and recycling nationwide.
“Positioning the United States front and center in meeting the growing demand for advanced batteries is how we boost our competitiveness and electrify our transportation system,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic investment in battery production and recycling will give our domestic supply chain the jolt it needs to become more secure and less reliant on other nations—strengthening our clean energy economy, creating good paying jobs, and decarbonizing the transportation sector.”

The project, with a capital cost of $750,000 will be powered by more than 1,000 Cat solar modules and is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.
Cat solar modules are sold through Caterpillar’s Power Systems division after partnering with First Solar and SunPower. The Kentucky project is the latest to be built in partnership with Boyd Cat, the authorized dealer of Cat solar equipment for businesses and contractors across Kentucky, Southern Indiana, West Virginia, and Southeastern Ohio.
The 500 kW solar project makes a significant impact on the state’s total deployment, as Kentucky currently has only 71 MW installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, and it ranks 47th in the nation for solar installations.

Solar Alliance also partnered with Boyd Cat on the completed 1 MW solar project for Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company and a 1 MW project for the Knoxville Utilities Board that will be constructed this year
“With the addition of this project, Solar Alliance’s backlog of projects under contract now exceeds $5,000,000. This growth is driven by our shift to larger solar projects with commercial and utility customers over the last two quarters,” said CEO Myke Clark.

Common’s energy management platform provides project owners with a sophisticated, cloud-based software as a service solution that enables them to manage and monetize complex, multi-tenant distributed generation projects.  Common Energy’ asserts that the financial and collections visibility provided by the platform results in higher project ROI for its clients. The platform can also be customized to facilitate reporting and accounting. 
“Community solar plays a valuable part in the United States’ national energy strategy because it advances clean energy deployment in a way that allows many households to promote solar energy while reducing energy costs,” said Dr. Ernest Moniz, U.S. Secretary of Energy under President Obama and Common Energy advisor. 
DOE reports that by year’s end 2020, about 3GW of community solar in the US was active, enough to power about 600,000 homes. The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation.
In February, the National Community Solar Partnership, a Department of Energy (DOE) program, set an ambitious goal of enabling enough community solar projects to power the equivalent of 5 million households, and achieve $1 billion in combined energy bill savings. This goal aligns with the DOE’s greater target of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and places a focus on ensuring that American citizens can meaningfully access the benefits of the energy transition.
This target would entail a jump from 3GW installed capacity to 20 GW by 2025. DOE estimates customers enrolling in community solar will save an average of about 20% on energy bills.
