It is the first utility-scale battery energy storage project in the state and the Power Authority’s first utility-scale battery project.
The storage plant consists of five 53-foot walk-in enclosures, each with more than 19,500 batteries grouped in modules and stacked in racks. Each container pulls in and can disperse 4 MW of power, enough to power roughly 3,000 homes. The system, constructed by O’Connell Electric Company of Victor, New York, includes a lithium-ion battery system, inverters, transformers, a control house and backup generator, connected to the Willis Substation. The facility will be maintained and operated by the St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project.
The project is located in northern New York state, about 40 miles northwest of Plattsburgh. The region generates more than 80% of its electricity supply from renewable resources, including the Power Authority’s St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project, which generates more than 800 MW of hydropower and more than 650 MW of wind generation.
“Deploying energy storage technologies make our power supply more reliable and resilient, further enabling New York to build a robust clean energy grid,” said Governor Hochul. “The completion of the Northern New York Energy Storage project marks an important step to reaching New York’s energy storage and climate goals.”
Earlier this year, New York state released a roadmap to deploy 4.7 GW of additional energy storage projects by 2030. The Empire State is seeking 3 GW of “bulk storage,” 1.5 GW of retail storage, and 200 MW of residential storage. The state’s modeling predicts that it will cost $0.46 per month per electricity bill to incentivize developers to deploy this capacity.
“This is a first-of-its-kind project for the Power Authority and with it we are breaking new ground as we actively help lead New York State’s decarbonization efforts,” said Justin E. Driscoll, president and CEO of New York Power Authority (NYPA). “By demonstrating large-scale battery development and operation, we are showing our ability to execute forward-thinking strategies and new technologies.”
While fires at energy storage facilities are rare, Governor Hochul announced the creation of a new Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group. The New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Office of Fire Prevention and Control, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Department of Public Service, New York Power Authority, and the Department of State will lead the Working Group to independently examine energy storage facility fires and safety standards.
The decision to convene the Working Group was prompted after several lithium-based battery projects faced thermal issues in New York State this summer.
NYPA’s engineers were involved with the planning, development and permitting of the project and the project team met with local fire departments for training on the battery storage technology used at the facility. NYPA’s engineers have ensured that the Northern New York Energy Storage Project met all fire safety and permitting requirements.
As lithium-ion battery technology can suffer from fire-causing thermal runaway, NYPA is also testing other types of battery technology like advanced lithium-ion and zinc-air technologies. Earlier this month New York announced four demonstration projects to receive funding through NYSERDA’s Renewable Optimization and Energy Storage Innovation Program  to test and scale different long-duration energy storage technology proposals.
NYSERDA’s initiatives are financed through the state’s ten-year, $6 billion Clean Energy Fund. An additional $8.15 million is available to support more applicable long-duration energy storage solutions and other complementary technologies yet to be commercialized.
Project submissions should advance develop or field-test hydrogen, electric, chemical, mechanical, or thermal-electric storage technologies that will address renewable integration challenges, including grid congestion hosting capacity constraints and siting in New York. The last day to submit a proposal is October 17 by 3 p.m. ET. For more details, visit NYSERDA’s website.

German-headquartered Dryad Networks has released its Silvanet Wildfire Sensor to help detect wildfires within minutes, alerting first responders so they can take action to mitigate damage.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “wildfires and volcanic activities” affected 6.2 million people between 1998-2017 with 2,400 attributable deaths worldwide from suffocation, injuries, and burns.
A study by University College London showed that California’s 2018 wildfires alone cost the U.S. economy $148.5 billion. Capital losses and health costs within California totaled $59.9 billion, while indirect losses through economic disruption to 80 industry sectors within the state came to $42.7 billion. Power transmission was affected, as well as road and rail freight transport, pipelines and other infrastructure-dependent sectors.
“Wildfires are responsible for up to 20% of global CO2 emissions,” said Carsten Brinkschulte, chief executive officer, Dryad. “Unless the increasingly severe wildfires we experience every year – and which wreak havoc on our health and our economies – are given sufficient attention and investment, global temperatures will rise by more than 1.5 C.”
The Dryad sensors are small, off-grid plastic devices with a solar cell built into the surface as a power source. The device measures temperature, humidity and air pressure, and contains a low-power air quality sensor with a gas sensing mode. 
It can detect hydrogen, carbon monoxide and other gases that occur during early stages of pyrolysis at the at the ppm level. Each sensor can detect fires in a 100 meter radius for 60 minute detection of a 2 meter by 2 meter fire. The sensor is typically mounted on a tree at 3 meters high. Each device measures 19 cm by 8.2 cm and has a 6 cm by 6 cm solar panel on the surface. The enclosure is IP 67 rated and is weather and UV-proof.
The device is pre-built with artificial intelligence to reliably detect fire and avoid false positive alerts. The sensors connect to a gateway, and each gateway hosts about 100 sensors, depending on topography. LoRaWan wireless data transmission send data from the device to first responders.
Dryad said the device can run maintenance-free for up to 15 years, requiring no batteries and avoiding the use of lithium and other toxic or rare materials. Energy is instead stored in supercapacitors.
The emissions caused by wildfires create a vicious cycle of a hotter, dryer climate in some regions, leading to more wildfires. Data from the UN Environment Program show that burned areas will increase by 62% if global temperatures increase by 2 degrees Celsius, and if the world heats three degrees, that figure rises to 97%.
What’s more, emissions from wildfires are often inaccurately reported or omitted altogether from nations’ carbon reports, written off as natural phenomena.
“With 80% of wildfires caused by humans, added to the fact that carbon neutrality is reliant on forest regrowth – which can take over 100 years – this means that omitting wildfire emissions from global CO2 inventories is inaccurate, and worse, it’s cynical,” said Brinkschulte.
Dryad estimates that deploying 120 million of its sensors worldwide by 2030 could save up to 3.9 million hectares of forest from burning and prevent 1.7 billion tons of CO2 emissions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/28/arizona-approves-cut-to-solar-compensation-rates/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ARIZONA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 28, 2023",Arizona approves cut to solar compensation rates,"The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) voted on August 24, 2023 to cut the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP) in the state, a metric that is used to determine the market value of exporting rooftop solar production to the grid. The Commission voted to step down the RCP by 10%, adhering to a 2017 rule that capped value reductions at that level.
While the 10% reduction in exported solar harms rooftop solar customers, things may have ended up much worse. Arizona Corporation Commissioner Nick Myers filed an amendment that would cut net energy metering (NEM) rates to $0.053 per kWh, a reduction of 37%, which would have taken effect suddenly in September.
“The stability provided by the RCP is the fundamental reason solar has continued to thrive in Arizona. Stable, predictable rates give solar companies and consumers certainty about the future and the confidence to invest in their homes and businesses,” said Kate Bowman, interior west regulatory director, Vote Solar.
Vote Solar, a nonprofit advocating for equitable access to solar energy, filed comments on the RCP, emphasizing a need for a gradual approach to changes to let the market adapt. It commented that utilities have not filed transparent, publicly available data to support their RCP ratemaking calculations. The use of non-transparent internal utility data as the guideline for ratemaking is a problem that has been highlighted nationwide in similar such rulemaking battles. Investor-owned utilities appear to be digging moats around their business by squeezing out rooftop solar.
Vote Solar said Arizona’s RCP values put forth by utilities for 2023 have not undergone transparent scrutiny, potentially leading to unfavorable customer outcomes.
“Arizona families and businesses are facing rising energy prices, inflation, and high electricity bills following a summer of record-breaking heat. Rooftop solar is a solution that can help consumers take control of their energy costs, and any reductions to the RCP undermine the affordability of solar energy and hinder the expansion of solar adoption in the state,” said Bowman.
The proposed cuts to solar compensation rates are justified based on “cost-shift issues,” a utility-backed argument that non-solar customers were cross-subsidizing rooftop solar customers by increasing utility system costs. Utility Arizona Public Service (APS) provided data to the Corporation Commission claiming, “the magnitude of cost shift within the residential ratepayer class is within the range of $800 to $1000 per year.” This would amount to an $18 million cross-subsidization.
However, numerous studies by national labs and state groups have debunked utility claims of such a significant cost-shift. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that at current levels of rooftop solar adoption, the cost shift is negligible. At solar adoption rates of 10% of electricity generation mix or more, the cost shift was found to be a miniscule $0.005 per kWh.
While rooftop solar comes with many system-level benefits to efficiency and resource use, environmental footprint benefits, and social gain, the ACC has shown that these metrics are unimportant when evaluating the value of a good or service.
The ACC wrote it did not support “inclusion of societal and environmental factors and other externalities in valuing solar DG exports, which are speculative and inappropriate for ratemaking purposes.”
The adherence to a 10% reduction was a temporary win for rooftop solar, but the ACC stated it has interest in revisiting the foundations of Arizona’s solar compensation structures entirely. It is taking public input on the RCP prior to its October 11 meeting.
“Consumers and businesses rely on Commission decisions to make important decisions about their budgets and future investments, and dismantling the measured transition approach that the Commission initially championed creates destabilizing uncertainty,” concluded Vote Solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/28/utility-pnm-shares-data-with-gridlab-for-a-100-clean-reliable-grid-study/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW MEXICO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 28, 2023",GridLab 100% clean reliable grid study uses scrubbed data from utility PNM,"New Mexico utility PNM contributed data, scrubbed of sensitive information, to a study that identified three possible pathways to reliably providing 100% clean electricity.
All three pathways would greatly expand PNM’s solar, wind and storage capacity, but each would take a different approach to reliability at 100% clean energy. One pathway would integrate “emerging clean firm technologies,” the second would take advantage of expanded regional coordination, and the third would “upsize” wind and solar deployment.
“Given the complexity of modern resource planning as PNM’s system moves toward 100% carbon-free electricity,” said Nick Phillips, the utility’s director of integrated resource planning, “we appreciate that independent studies are placing a higher focus on decarbonization to ensure a safe and reliable energy transition.” He said that PNM may use the study results “as data points for comparison to existing modeling results.”
New Mexico’s Energy Transition Act requires utilities to reach 40% renewables by 2025, 50% renewables by 2030, and 100% clean energy by 2045, with the final target subject to considerations of safety, reliability and customer bill impacts. PNM has set a goal to be emissions-free by 2040.
To launch the study, PNM provided the database it had used with the EnCompass resource planning model to prepare its most recent integrated resource plan.
The consultancy GridLab, with help from a team of experts, then used that database and the EnCompass model to develop possible 100% clean resource portfolios, which were tested for resource adequacy using the GridPath model, in an iterative process shown at the bottom of the flow chart below.

Image: GridLab
The study found that the lowest-cost approach for PNM to serve its 525,000 customers with a 100% clean reliable grid, given the current extent of regional coordination, would be to add 660 MW of utility-scale solar, 770 MW of wind, plus 620 MW of wind and solar to power electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen. The study assumed that distributed solar capacity in PNM’s service area would grow from 270 MW last year to 765 MW in 2035, based on distributed solar’s recent growth rate in New Mexico, continuing at a slowing trend over time. Those amounts of added capacity would be adequate assuming a baseline level of electrification—that is, substitution of electric vehicles and other electric equipment for fossil-fueled equipment.
The hydrogen produced would fuel hydrogen combustion turbines, a clean “firm” generation resource that would substitute for fossil gas turbines to achieve reliability. Hydrogen combustion was expected to be less costly than other “emerging” clean firm resources such as geothermal or multi-day storage.
The GridLab team also modeled a 100% clean reliable grid with a high level of electrification that would require additional renewable generation. Either way, PNM’s annual capacity builds of solar, wind and storage would need to increase substantially from the pace over the last decade, the study found.
Land use requirements for the added renewables capacity was calculated to range from 0.05% to 0.28% of New Mexico’s total land area. Water requirements for hydrogen production would equal 5-6% of the water currently used by PNM’s thermal generators.
Expanded regional coordination
Having modeled that “emerging clean firm technologies” pathway to reliable generation, the study team evaluated a second pathway: “expanded regional coordination” across 11 Western states. This analysis, using the SWITCH model, found that regional coordination would yield a substantial reduction in investment and operational costs compared to a scenario in which PNM was “electrically islanded.”
The study says that PNM participates in the Western Resource Adequacy Program, an emerging coalition of utilities serving Western states “to coordinate on resource adequacy planning and share capacity.”
“Upsized” renewables deployment
A third pathway to reliable generation, relying on “upsized” wind and solar deployment “above what is needed most of the year,” was also modeled using the SWITCH model. Surplus wind and solar energy could either be sold to neighboring regions if it is economical to do so, used for electrolysis and hydrogen production, or ultimately curtailed, the study said, adding that “while curtailment is viewed negatively, it may be a preferred, lower cost alternative” to building additional clean firm resources.
The study team used the SWITCH model to conduct a sensitivity analysis representing a scenario in which PNM was electrically islanded, which the authors said “represents an extreme condition,” but which showed that a combination of upsized solar, wind and battery storage, with small amounts of biomass generation, could reliably provide 100% clean electricity in that scenario. The study noted that PNM as a regulated utility is currently unable to build resources or take on market risk associated with export revenues, “limiting the portfolio options available for PNM to reach a 100% clean grid.”
Flexible demand
Across all the pathways, the study found through sensitivity analyses that load flexibility from electric vehicles and electrified building end uses, a strategy being pursued in California, “can offset significant battery storage needs.”
“Urgent priority”
The study emphasized that “these three pathways are not mutually exclusive,” adding that some combination of these options is “essential” for PNM to reliably and economically reach a 100% clean electricity goal.
The GridLab team “intended that the findings can bring value for other jurisdictions,” the study says. GridLab Program Director Priya Sreedharan said that to the extent other utilities “are facing similar goals of reaching decarbonized systems, in a load growth/electrification condition, and concerned about reliability, our findings provide insight into the types of solutions and analysis they might want to pursue.”
Planners, the study advised, should focus on the “urgent priority” of investment in clean resources and adoption of integrated planning approaches that can “refine and inform” the longer-term choices.
The GridLab team’s study is titled “The Moonshot 100% Clean Energy Electricity Study: Assessing the Tradeoffs Among Clean Portfolios with a PNM Case Study.” The study project was led by Priya Sreedharan and Telos Energy Founding Partner Derek Stenclik, and involved staff from Blue Marble Analytics, Energy Futures Group, Evolved Energy Research, Moment Energy Insights, Telos Energy, and University of California San Diego.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/28/coalition-urges-biden-administration-to-scrap-hydrogen-hub-plans-advocates-push-back/,"HYDROGEN,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 28, 2023",Coalition urges Biden Administration to scrap hydrogen hub plans; advocates push back,"A coalition of more than 180 conservation, social justice, Indigenous and other organizations last week pushed the Biden Administration to reject applications to build out regional clean hydrogen hubs, warning that building out hydrogen infrastructure will lead to additional greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.
In the letter, the groups – which include the Center for Biological Diversity and Food and Water Watch – said that 95% of hydrogen produced today is from fossil fuels, and all forms of hydrogen production require large amounts of water. 
“To address the climate emergency, the United States must phase out oil and gas production by 2030, – yet nearly all hydrogen production is from fossil gas,” they wrote. 
Hydrogen advocates, however, pushed back against the letter, saying that the U.S. Congress has made a serious commitment to hydrogen hubs through its Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
“The development of clean hydrogen worldwide is essential to achieve decarbonization, and the U.S. hydrogen hubs are a key step to achieving U.S. decarbonization and climate goals,” Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, told pv magazine USA. 
Building out the hydrogen market has been an area of priority for the Biden Administration. The resource is expected to be a critical tool to decarbonize sectors that would otherwise be hard to decarbonize, such as industrial and chemical processes and heavy-duty transportation. 
While the U.S. currently produces about 10 million metric tonnes (MMT) of hydrogen per year, this largely comes from fossil fuels that aren’t paired with carbon capture technologies. The administration is aiming to produce that same amount of hydrogen entirely from clean energy sources by the end of the decade, and is looking to invest $7 billion to create regional hydrogen hubs across the country. Earlier this month, the administration also launched an inter-agency hydrogen task force, to bolster its “whole of government” approach to the sector. 
But these investments have raised concerns among the groups behind the letter. Hydrogen hubs will require a massive buildout of pipelines, and even the slightest rupture could cause explosions, they wrote in the letter. Constructing these pipelines could disrupt ecosystems, and contaminate soil and water, they added. And even in the case of green hydrogen, produced with renewable energy, the amount of water required – 5000 liters per megawatt-hour, according to the letter – would make it unsustainable, especially in areas affected by drought, they said. 
“Calling hydrogen clean energy is a scam to prop up the oil and gas industry,” Silas Grant, a campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, said. 
Hydrogen advocates disagree. Investments in hydrogen hubs will be a central driver in scaling the hydrogen economy and helping communities across the country benefit from clean energy investments, good-paying jobs and improved energy security, Kendall Stephenson, manager of policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute, told pv magazine USA.
“Not only would rejecting applications for these hubs completely disregard bipartisan Congressional direction, it would also deprive hard-to-abate sectors of adequate and affordable hydrogen supplies needed to decarbonize,” said Stephenson. 
“No serious stakeholder committed to net zero would take clean hydrogen off the table — it is just too important of a pathway,” she added.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/28/make-it-burn-and-other-lithium-ion-first-responder-guidance/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,ARIZONA,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 28, 2023",“Make it burn” and other lithium-ion first responder guidance,"Following a spate of thermal runaway incidents this summer, American Clean Power (ACP) has released its “First Responders Guide to Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) Battery Energy Storage System Incidents.”
The release coincides with New York state’s convening of an expert panel to reevaluate energy storage installation guidelines. The decision was prompted after several lithium-based battery projects faced thermal issues in New York State this summer, including the Three Mile Bay incident in the header image. And while it was not explicitly stated, the convening is presumably also influenced by the Moss Landing energy storage facility incidents.
The ACP’s guide specifically targets energy storage systems (ESS) that use Li-ion batteries, highlighting hazards like fires, explosions, arc flashes, electric shocks, and exposure to toxic chemicals. The guidance is based on the 2023 NFPA 855 revision, whose requirements apply to an ESS housed in multiple outdoor enclosures with an aggregate energy capacity surpassing 600 kWh. For systems of this scale, ACP highlighted requirements include a hazard mitigation analysis, fire and explosion testing in accordance with UL 9540A, emergency planning, and annual training sessions.
Insights from the McMicken facility’s thermal runaway and explosion in Arizona are reflected in the current code.
Pre-incident planning
Facilities with a capacity over 600 kWh must submit a comprehensive set of pre-incident documentation to both local authorities and firefighting departments. Key documents include fire and explosion test results, a hazard mitigation assessment and a detailed emergency response plan. 
While the fire and explosion test results primarily focus on smaller components like battery cells, packs, and racks, the hazard mitigation report focuses on larger scale scenarios that could lead to a full-blown enclosure fire. The guide cites examples such as insulation loss leading to arcing or mechanical damages from vehicle impacts or flying debris.
Following the incident at McMicken, first responders now have mandated access to the battery management system data. During that Arizona mishap, adequate sensors and data would have alerted the first responders to the accumulating gasses in the battery enclosure. Knowing the temperatures of adjacent energy storage units can guide fire departments on any added protective measures.
Incident response
Emergencies involving fires, explosions, arc flashes, and toxic chemicals require quick assessments and appropriate protective gear upon arrival.
If there’s an active fire, allowing it to burn out thoroughly ensures the consumption of all fuel sources, reducing reignition risks. Monitoring neighboring enclosures to curb fire spread is paramount.
When there is no evident fire, the data from battery management systems proves invaluable insight into the enclosure’s internal situation and whether a thermal runaway event has occurred. During these types of events, accumulated gasses and mounting pressure within the battery unit create a volatile mix, risking explosions if unchecked.

Source: APS DNVGL
The McMicken event was triggered by gas accumulation. Responders, uninformed due to a lack of data, breached the enclosure, introducing large amounts of oxygen and driving an explosion that injured eight of them. One was thrown 73 feet from the container upon trying to access it.
Through any incident, the dangers of arc shock and toxic chemical exposure must be considered. Energy units, irrespective of the damage extent or visual status, should always be treated as fully charged. Combusted materials can release toxic gasses like hydrogen fluoride and carbon monoxide, demanding caution.
Hazard discussions
Concluding the guide, ACP sheds light on emerging industry views on incident management. Lithium-ion discussions oscillate between robust systems that curtail thermal events – risking explosions – and the “make it burn” approach:
Some ESS designs employ a ‘make it burn’ strategy, in which a sparker ignites flammable gas when the lower flammable limit is exceeded but before the lower explosive limit is reached. Such designs do not include fire suppression, on the basis that the loss of an enclosure through controlled burning is preferable to increasing the risk of an explosion.
In potential explosive scenarios, the wisdom of active venting enclosures is reiterated. If a first responder is unsure about an enclosure’s venting status, merely opening it can be useful – but perilous. Simple venting actions might not suffice in all cases, with active gas extraction deemed a more effective risk-mitigation strategy.
