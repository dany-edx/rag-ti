Xcel Energy is a large utility serving 1.3 million electric and 1.2 million gas customers in Colorado. Following negotiations with environmental justice groups, the utility has agreed to a 2022 to 2025 Renewable Energy Plan.
The agreement calls for a dedication of $32.8 million toward renewable energy programs and incentives for income-qualified customers and disproportionately impacted communities. The plan calls for lowered costs for solar installation, expanded access to community solar, and increased community engagement and education.
The settlement also sets aside $6.5 million for approximately 10 MW of energy storage. An additional $1.6 million is dedicated to create incentives for low-income and historically disadvantaged communities. Xcel will use the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s mapping tool EnviroScreen to identify these communities and propose programs.
Community solar projects under the plan are estimated to receive up to $52.6 million from the settlement. The plan also calls for $250,000 annually to support workforce training and development.
Xcel Energy also plans a $4.75 million flexible budget for community engagement and outreach programs. The utility has committed to working with environmental justice nonprofits to tailor culturally and linguistically appropriate outreach efforts.
“The settlement is a major step forward towards a more equitable renewable energy future in Colorado and helps even the playing field for who has the opportunity to benefit from renewable energy access in our state. It also represents an important step towards establishing community engagement processes to increase the diversity of voices and perspectives considered by the Public Utility Commission, which will strengthen PUC decision making to the benefit of all Coloradans,” said Tom Figel, senior director of policy and business development with GRID Alternatives.
The Environmental Justice Coalition, which spearheaded the settlement, consists of Vote Solar, GRID Alternatives, Cultivando, Colorado Latino Forum, GreenLatinos, Womxn from the Mountain, NAACP Denver, and Mothers Out Front–and is represented by Earthjustice. The Colorado Public Service Commission approved all aspects of the settlement program.
“Low income and community solar has a major role to play in an equitable energy transition, and it’s incredibly exciting to see Xcel recognize that,” said Juan Roberto Madrid, GreenLatinos Colorado clean transportation and energy policy advocate.
Colorado has enormous solar potential with a rapidly growing population and over 300 sunny days per year. It currently has enough solar installed to power almost 450,000 homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA projects the state may install nearly 4 GW of solar over the next five years, as compared to the 2.2 GW installed cumulatively thus far.
The state was one of the first to enact a Renewable Energy Standard, which has paved the way to help create a market for the 330 solar companies in operation and nearly 7500 Coloradans employed in solar. To date, SEIA estimates that $5 billion has been invested in solar in the Rocky Mountain State.
“We’re so thankful to everyone who engaged in Xcel’s Renewable Energy Standard Plan process,” said Claudine Custodio, senior regulatory manager at Vote Solar. “Coloradans made it clear that they are ready to move further and faster toward a resilient, clean energy future that prioritizes environmental justice.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/24/chinas-solar-cell-production-capacity-may-reach-600-gw-by-year-end/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 24, 2022",China’s solar cell production capacity may reach 600 GW by year-end,"From pv magazine global
China’s total annual solar cell and module production capacity may increase from 361 GW at the end of last year to up to 600 GW at the end of 2022, according to the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA).
“Since January, 20 companies disclosed to expand module production totaling 380 GW, planned to be executed within the next few months or up to 1,5 years,” the analyst firm said, noting that most of this capacity relates to n-type modules produced with tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cells or panels based on cells with a heterojunction (HJT) design. “Reportedly, TOPCon related expansion plans exceed 220 GW, whereas HJT is nearing the 150 GW mark. As an example, recently one HJT company conducted an online pitching and according to them almost 800 people joined that call,” it added.
So far this year, the output of polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules has already beaten the achievements of the Chinese PV industry in 2021 by some 50%. “By June, module shipments of the TOP 10 manufacturer crossed the 100 GW and by the end of September may have reached 140-150 GW (2021: 133 GW),” said the AECEA. “Just five of these top 10 have set shipment targets of between 183-205 GW.”
Furthermore, the AECEA revealed that the country’s polysilicon capacity should grow from around 530,000 MT at the end of 2021 to up to 1.2 million MT in 2022, jumping to 2.5 million MT in 2023, and up to 4 million MT in 2024.
“In the near term, the overall industrial landscape won’t fundamentally change. Incumbent companies are further consolidating their market positions through backward/forward integration,” the AECEA stated. “By and large, vertical integration remains their favored business model, which in times of external supply constraints or external supply dependencies has gained ever more weight.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/24/georgia-power-proposes-to-slam-customers-with-200-rooftop-solar-interconnection-fee/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 24, 2022",Georgia Power proposes to apply $200 rooftop solar interconnection fee to its customers,"Georgia Power company, an electric utility, has announced a proposal to impose an interconnection fee to rooftop solar customers in its territory. The proposal would include a $200 charge to attach renewable energy to the electric grid.
Also included in the proposal is the plan to increase bill rates that would increase monthly costs by an average of $16.29 per month.
Georgia Power cited a “cost shift” on non-solar customers by rooftop solar customers as the reasoning behind the new proposed interconnection charge. The “cost shift” is a utility anti-rooftop solar concept that utilities keep in their playbook as a justification for raising rates and increasing profits. The argument is that rooftop solar programs lead to a cross-subsidization of solar customers by those who have not yet adopted the technology.
It has been demonstrated in numerous state and national level studies that the “cost shift” is negligible, and that rooftop solar instead provides cost and resilience benefits for the grid at large. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LNBL) determined that distributed solar “entails no more than a 0.03 cent/kWh long-run increase in U.S. average retail electricity prices, and far smaller than that for most utilities.”
The analysis also found that at 10% of the energy mix, distributed solar yields between a 5% decrease and a 5% increase in retail electricity prices. Georgia is nowhere near this figure, as the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that solar in all forms in the state represents only 0.05% of electricity generation in the state.
“When utilities feel threatened by customers choosing solar and exercising their energy freedom, all ratepayers get squeezed,” said Kevin Lucas, SEIA’s senior director of utility regulation and policy. Lucas is the lead author on a joint testimony released by SEIA and Vote Solar.
The testimony calls for Georgia’s Public Service Commission (PSC) to reject the $200 interconnection fee for solar customers. It also encourages the PSC to strengthen its oversight of utilities to prevent over-collection from ratepayers and empower customer choice.
“Georgia Power Company has been over-collecting from Georgian’s electric bills by an average of $26 annually over the last 11 years. These excessive charges add up to $1.87 billion in additional revenue for the utility at the expense of all Georgia residents and businesses. If that wasn’t enough, GPC is now asking state regulators to approve more rate hikes and rate structure changes that will penalize solar customers and eliminate choices for ratepayers to control their bills,” wrote Lucas.
SEIA’s analysis showed that Georgia Power’s over-collection charges peaked in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to nearly $500 million in additional revenues. Alongside the mid-pandemic rate hikes was Georgia Power’s decision to disconnect 131,000 customers from electric service.
“Georgia families are already feeling the strain of inflation, and Georgia Power’s rate hikes are both needless and exorbitant,” said Allison Kvien, Southeast regulatory director at Vote Solar. “The Public Service Commission has an opportunity to protect the rights of ratepayers to choose solar for their homes of businesses.”
The U.S. Department of Energy cited solar soft costs as a major barrier to the clean energy transition. Soft costs represent any part of a solar project not directly linked to hardware costs, and include costs like marketing, permitting, inspection, and interconnection. Soft costs are significantly higher in the U.S. than much of the world, and Georgia Power’s proposal would only exacerbate this problem further.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/24/vertical-solar-on-high-rise-building-to-produce-58-mwh-annually/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WISCONSIN",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 24, 2022",Vertical solar on high-rise building to produce 58 MWh annually,"Dominion Properties turned its vision to reality by transforming a brick façade into a generative asset. An 83-foot solar array was installed on the side of the company’s seven-story building near Milwaukee, Wisc. by Arch Solar. The array, which is now operational, is expected to produce about 58 MWh of electricity annually and will help defray the cost of electricity for tenants in the office building.
“Solar represents a huge market opportunity for commercial office locations,” explains Mike O’Connor, Co-Founder, Dominion Properties. “Being an office building – where typical working hours are when the most energy is used – a proportion of the building’s energy will come from solar. This means our tenants can enjoy savings on their energy bills, particularly important today as the cost of energy continues to skyrocket. This project is the first of many, and we hope that it will encourage other developers to make use of otherwise wasted space on high-rise buildings by embracing solar as a clean, cost-saving energy source.”
Vertical solar is uncommon but not unheard of–two recent examples include transportation and agrivoltaic designs. Canadian BIPV firm Mitrex is creating photovoltaic highway noise barriers that are currently in a pilot phase in North America. The sound barriers have 1.2 MW of capacity per kilometer.
And German-based  Next2Sun has designed vertical racking for bifacial solar modules meant to be installed in between rows of crops or as a fencing structure.

Attaching traditional solar modules on the side of a high-rise building takes some innovation and Arch Solar used masonry anchors to secure the modules to the side of the building in an array that’s 83 feet high by 23 feet wide. Because the building is in a populated area, the challenge was to avoid reduced output due to shading from surrounding buildings. Arch Solar attached SolarEdge’s Power Optimizers to the modules technology as well as three SolarEdge Inverters with Synergy Technology to ensure maximum power generation.

“This far North in Milwaukee, the ideal installation for modules is at a 23° angle for maximum sun exposure and to help snow clear. However, for wall installations such as the vertical high-rise array with Dominion Properties, this is a more complex challenge, as the modules need to be mounted at a 90° angle. If you don’t want to lose power efficiency, then really SolarEdge’s inverters and Power Optimizers are the only choice,” said JD Smith, head of business development at Arch Solar. “For Dominion Properties, maximizing power generation to ensure maximum savings for tenants was a non-negotiable, so having access to this technology is what made this project possible.”
Smith noted that the Synergy inverters can be oversized by up to 200%, so Dominion has the option to add more modules without additional investment in power electronics.

“In less than a year,” stakeholders came together to “create a workable pilot and pathway,” said Amy Heart, vice president of public policy at Sunrun. Heart envisions distributed systems that combine rooftop solar and batteries to be prime candidates for aggregation.
“Amazed at how quickly a group of private sector folks designed the bones of Texas’ first distributed energy resource (DER) export program,” said Arushi Frank, U.S. energy markets policy lead at Tesla and co-chair of ERCOT’s DER Task Force. In May, Tesla rallied owners of its home-scale batteries to demonstrate how they could help power the Texas grid. Both Heart and Frank made their comments on LinkedIn.
No utilities in Texas offer net metering for rooftop solar, according to nonprofit group Solar United Neighbors, although some Texas customers have options for a lower level of retail compensation for energy sent to the grid.
The pilot project, ERCOT says, will enable premises with any combination of generation, energy storage, or controllable load with the capability of 1 MW or less to participate in ERCOT’s wholesale markets.
The project will at first enroll up to 80 MW of aggregated resources. Each local aggregation must have the capability to provide at least 100 kW of response, through demand response capability and injection capability. These aggregations will be eligible to provide up to 40 MW of “non-spinning reserve service,” or capacity that can be started or interrupted within 30 minutes as needed.
ERCOT’s goals for the pilot project are to examine how aggregated DERs can support reliability, enhance the wholesale market, incentivize investment, potentially reduce transmission and distribution investments, and support better load management during emergencies.
Following the first one-year phase of the pilot project, ERCOT expects to design additional phases that could expand participation. ERCOT will also study, using data from the pilot project, how different dispatch and pricing schemes could improve its efforts in managing transmission congestion.
Texas has 1.5 GW of rooftop and other small-scale solar, while on a per-capita basis, small-scale solar in Texas trails most of the other ten sunniest U.S. states. Research has found that rooftop solar adoption rises sharply as the value of PV systems to building owners increases.
Progress across the U.S.
ERCOT follows New England’s ISO-NE in enabling aggregated DERs to participate in wholesale markets. Sunrun’s aggregated DERs injected 1.8 GWh of energy into New England’s grid last summer, during peak demand hours of 1-5 p.m.
New York grid operator NYISO plans to enable aggregated DERs to participate in its wholesale capacity markets by the end of this year.
A federal order requires grid operators to open their wholesale markets to full participation by aggregated DERs, yet across the grid regions the pace of compliance is mixed. The order does not apply to ERCOT as it is not federally regulated.
Under an aggregated DER program, the aggregator is compensated for its wholesale market participation, and in turn compensates the participating DER owners.

Los Angeles-based technology start-up Nanotech Energy says its proprietary, graphene-based, nanotechnology overcomes the safety challenges of traditional lithium-ion batteries, and its latest announcement signals it might be making progress in bringing its products to the mass market.
Nanotech’s battery uses lithium-ion chemistry supported by graphene and a proprietary nonflammable electrolyte technology that improves the electrochemical properties and safety of its electrodes.
According to the company, graphene provides ideal electronic and mechanical support to increase the reversible capacity, power and cycling stability of standard cathodes. Nanotech produces its own graphene, which allows it to be vertically integrated.
On Thursday, the company announced it would supply more than 1 GWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS) to Athens-headquartered Smile Energy, acting as the distributor for Greece and the surrounding region with Nanotech Energy BESS products through to 2028. Greece has recently doubled its 2030 energy storage target to 3 GW.
Smile Energy will potentially use Nanotech’s products to develop BESS for private homes, commercial real estate, and the marine sector and building on its pipeline of 700 MWh of energy storage across Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania.
Battery tech
The startup uses a solution processing method that allows graphene to be coated on “any substrate” along with a laser process step that forms a graphene foam. The company had originally applied its graphene technology to making better supercapacitors, but now focuses on its “super battery.”
“Nanotech Energy is the first and only producer to break the 50% content barrier by reaching 98% monolayer graphene, the wonder material that powers our products. We’ve already developed groundbreaking energy storage using technology that has the high capacity of a battery and the power performance of supercapacitors in a single solution,” said Nanotech Energy CEO Jack Kavanaugh.
According to the technical data sheet for Nanotech Energy Nonflammable GOC18650A batteries, it has a cycle life of 1200 cycles before it degrades to 88%. Its gravimetric density is 215 Wh/kg, while volumetric density stands at 557 Wh/l. The operating temperature range is from -20 to 60 degrees Celsius.
In August 2021, Nanotech Energy raised $64 million in a Series D at a $550 million valuation, with total funding thus far standing at $94.9 million. The privately held company has been backed by Multiverse Investment Fund, Fubon Financial Group, and Volkswagen, among others.
Meanwhile, Nanotech has announced it is expanding its operations with a new manufacturing facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, Nevada. The first of two buildings planned will produce 2.5 GWh of batteries annually, with the plan to continue expansion to 15 GWh over the next several years, the company said.
The first building is slated to open in Q4 2022, and Nanotech is currently taking battery pre-orders. Limited production will kick off in 2023 with full production starting in 2024.
