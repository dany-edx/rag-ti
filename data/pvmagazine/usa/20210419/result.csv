Just after the company’s launch, CEO Jorg Heinemann outlined how finding large, anchor customers like Towngas quickly would be paramount to the company’s success. With this first major goal realized, pv magazine invited Heinemann to discuss how his California-based company has evolved in its first year.
“We know the technology works,” he said, adding that much of the underlying tech risk has been addressed. Engineering and operational challenges remain to be overcome in order to scale up manufacturing, “but we’re way out of the ‘science project’ mode,” he said,
Part of the science project was finding a way to cut battery costs. Nickel-hydrogen has proven to be a powerful energy storage technology for the aerospace industry for quite some time, but has always been held back from greater commercial use due to its high price.
Finding new materials to substitute for more costly traditional components was a breakthrough for EnerVenue, according to Heinemann. The costliest component to be replaced was platinum.
When theorizing about what expensive components could be replaced, Heinemann and the team expected to register a hit in battery performance. But the opposite has proven true, and Heinemann asserted that not only do the newly designed batteries perform significantly better than earlier versions, but they are being manufactured with “magnitudes” of cost reduction per battery.
Cost reduction and anchor customers like Towngas form the two prongs that Heinemann believes will help EnerVenue to overcome its biggest obstacle: the advantage of incumbent lithium-ion batteries. Although Heinemann declined to get into customer specifics, he said that the company is working on a number of projects to demonstrate their batteries on a large scale, as well as hammering out agreements for more anchor customers.
The Towngas deal represents a vote of confidence not just in nickel-hydrogen battery technology, but in EnerVenue as a company able to provide effective and cost-competitive storage solutions. It’s a confidence that Heinemann said he hopes will be recognized by other potential anchor customers that EnerVenue is pursuing.
As for meeting the product demand these large customers will bring, Heinemann said he is confident in his technology’s ability to scale.
“It’s designed for super-easy manufacturing and super-easy assembly,” Heinemann said. Expectations are that the manufacturing, tooling, and capital expenditure cost will be about one-fifth of that for equivalent lithium-ion capacity.
Heinemann credits the scale of the cost reduction to the simplicity of the battery itself, referring to it as a “stack of electrodes.” The design also makes possible features EnerVenue believes will give it an edge over lithium-ion in the long run: a 30,000+ cycle without degradation lifespan, an optimal operating temperature range from -40° to 60°C (-40 to 140°F), no fire or thermal runaway risk, no toxic materials, and easy recycling at the end of the battery’s life.
“We found a huge number of ways to get cost out of this thing, and that’s all engineering cost reduction,” said Heinemann. “That gives us huge confidence in achieving our business plan and scaling fast.”

The company said it now has 206 renewable energy projects globally. That includes 71 utility-scale solar and wind projects and 135 solar rooftops on facilities and stores.
The company also claimed that it now ranks as the largest corporate renewable energy buyer in Europe, with more than 2.5 GW of renewable energy capacity.
Amazon said it now aims to power 100% of its activities with renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its original goal of 2030.
The nine new solar and wind projects include:
Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net-zero carbon by 2040. The pledge now has 53 signatories, including IBM, Unilever, Verizon, Siemens, Microsoft, and Best Buy.

The deal finances 21 MW of solar capacity and 15 MW of energy storage. The capacity will be divided across two sites in Taos Mesa and Angel Fire, New Mexico, both towns in the northern part of the state.
When the projects are completed in late 2021 — six months ahead of their original schedules — the co-op will have achieved the 41 MW of solar and 15 MW of storage it needed to meet 100% of its daytime energy load entirely with solar.
Torch Clean Energy will develop the new solar and storage projects and sell the power to Kit Carson under a power-purchase agreement. The length of that agreement has not yet been released.
Kit Carson set set its goal after it began a partnership with Guzman Energy, a wholesale power provider. Kit Carson had secured its energy from Tri-State Generation & Transmission, but ended that business tie in 2016 in part because Tri-State was unable to transition rapidly enough from fossil fuels to renewable energy generation resources. The partnership with Guzman was designed to enable Kit Carson to meet its daytime solar goal and also cut its wholesale power costs by around 40%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/19/winners-named-in-this-years-solar-decathlon-a-showcase-for-student-led-innovation/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 19, 2021","Winners named in this year’s Solar Decathlon, a showcase for student-led innovation","A student team from the University of Colorado Boulder won the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Decathlon Build Challenge.
The team scored a total of 891.2 points out of a possible 1,000 awarded across 10 challenges. A design team from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, finished second with 809 points. The University of Nevada-Las Vegas took third place with 759.8 points.
The University of Colorado participated and won 1st place in the first two Solar Decathlon Build Challenges, in 2002 and 2005. The team competed for a third time in 2007.
Its winning 1,200-square-foot, 2 bedroom, 3 bathroom house for this year’s competition was dubbed SPARC to signify its guiding principles of Sustainability, Performance, Attainability, Resilience, and Community.
The house includes 24 Trina solar modules with a total capacity of 7.6 kW. The house emphasizes resilience by including electrical provisions for future battery storage and grid islanding capability. It also includes a building automation system that can control the space for daily energy efficiency and achieve a grid-friendly electric demand profile as needed.
With demand response functions, the SPARC house can react to signals from the utility and reduce stress on the grid as needed. Additionally, the building envelope is made of durable materials that require minimal maintenance over time and can be repaired with relative ease.

The house is located in Fraser, Colorado, a mountain community west of Denver. Located near popular ski resorts, the house is intended to help provide affordable housing for who live and work in the vicinity. Affordable housing is a major challenge for many Colorado mountain towns, where both long-term and short-term housing options are geared toward out-of-town visitors.
The Colorado design team said that under normal operating conditions, the SPARC house should be able to maintain all conventional loads of available IoT devices through manufacturer provided application programming interfaces.
In demonstration mode, the energy management system was designed to schedule loads as determined by their importance in keeping the home comfortable and also by their energy consumption. Loads in the SPARC House could be shed in the following order: domestic water heater, zone air thermal loads, lighting, and auxiliary plug loads.
In addition to the University of Colorado entry, here are two other design entrants worth noting.
The University of Illinois team built a modular house that is focused on the concepts of adaptability and affordability for first-time homebuyers.
The target market is young professionals in the Urbana-Champaign area who need an affordable entry point into the housing market. Named ADAPTHAUS, the two-bedroom, one-bath, 1,200-square-foot house is intended to give residents flexible modules that can personalize the house to suit their changing needs.
For example, the team focused on a young professional’s need for virtual communication, divisible workspaces, and convertible functions. This allows the homeowner to convert between an office space during the work week and an Airbnb space on the weekends using flexible furniture.
The design incorporates a 7.68 kW solar array with integrated storage. The owner will be able to sell back to the utility the extra energy their panels produce. Located in a lower-income neighborhood, the house’s energy-efficient measures and new technologies may serve as an example to the community, showcasing the benefits of integrating a grid-tied solar energy system.
The building’s energy system includes a grid-tied solar array that includes two-dozen 320W Mission Solar Modules, and a smart inverter that allows the user to use time-of-use arbitrage and pull from the battery storage system when grid-sourced electricity is at a premium cost.
Optimizers on each solar panel increase power generation by allowing the panels to work independently of one another. The solar panels are located on opaque areas of the roof canopy, blocking excess sunlight in the summer and allowing more sunlight in the winter. The design provides more roof space without adding to the home’s footprint.
A mobile app integrates with the building systems to offer the user energy consumption tips and graphic displays of energy consumption, while also automating home appliances.
A tankless water heater occupies less space and uses less energy. And a stormwater design allows stormwater to infiltrate on-site, helping to recharge the groundwater and support on-site vegetation, as well as easing pressure on the neighborhood’s storm drain system.
The house is being donated to Habitat for Humanity to benefit a low-income community member.
The University of Waterloo Warrior Home team worked with the Chippewas of Nawash Indigenous community and Habitat for Humanity Grey Bruce to design and build the first net-zero energy Habitat for Humanity home in an indigenous community in Canada.
The Warrior Home team’s target market was the growing community of families residing in the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation territory. Partner Habitat for Humanity used many donated materials and the assistance of local volunteers for construction, helping to keep costs low to ensure affordability for the homeowners.
An energy-efficient building enclosure and mechanical and energy systems introduced operational cost savings. A simple design—a single-story, single-family home with a basic gable roof—minimized expensive equipment and skill, facilitating construction by volunteers.
The three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,560-square-foot home was designed for a growing family and features four rooms and two full bathrooms.
Chippewa values of community and connection to nature inspired the design of the Warrior Home. A covered front porch enables conversation with neighbors, while the open-concept kitchen and living space encourages gatherings with family and friends. Additionally, the Warrior Home was designed to be adaptable to the needs of a family living for generations on the Reserve. Over time, each room can be repurposed for different uses such as an office, nursing room, or bedroom for elderly occupants.
The house includes a 10.89 kW solar array made up of 33 modules each rated at 330W. Thermal control was prioritized to minimize unwanted thermal gains and losses given the area’s cold winters and hot summers. The house is designed to use 55% less energy that a similarly sized house. Smart plugs, smart thermostats, and other technologies are used to monitor and minimize energy usage.
A central heat pump coupled with a heat recovery ventilator transfers heat from the outdoors instead of using combustion or electricity, and can switch between heating and cooling modes depending on the season.
A hybrid electric water heater tank paired with a heat pump warms water using electrical resistance. The heat pump draws heat from the surrounding air and uses a compressor and refrigerant to warm the water using ambient heat.
Building enclosure innovations include raised heel trusses to create room for additional insulation; triple-glazed windows with low-emissivity coatings to reduce solar heat gains; and an insulated concrete form foundation to provide additional thermal performance.
Other university teams that competed included Weber State University in Ogden, Utah; Kansas State University; the University of Denver; Hogeschool Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, Utrecht, Netherlands; and Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile.
