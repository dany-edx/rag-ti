The infrastructure investment is intended to increase American-made batteries and components, bolster domestic supply chains, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs. The plan is to support the creation of new, retrofitted, and expanded commercial facilities as well as manufacturing demonstrations, and battery recycling. According to a recent PV Intel report, California is an example of a burgeoning US battery market with an 8x increase in solar-plus-battery installations just in the past year.
The Department of Energy (DOE) also announced a separate $60 million to support second-life applications for batteries once used to power EVs, as well as new processes for recycling materials back into the battery supply chain. These funding opportunities are part of the government’s strategy to bolster America’s supply chain and reduce the reliance on competing nations. Currently China is the leader in the global lithium-ion battery production market, according to a Wood Mackenzie report. And while the US is supporting its battery industry, China is investing heavily to build out more manufacturing facilities to extend its dominance. Secondarily, these initiatives support the President’s goal of electric vehicles making up half the vehicle sales in North America by 2030.
“Positioning the United States front and center in meeting the growing demand for advanced batteries is how we boost our competitiveness and electrify our transportation system,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic investment in battery production and recycling will give our domestic supply chain the jolt it needs to become more secure and less reliant on other nations—strengthening our clean energy economy, creating good paying jobs, and decarbonizing the transportation sector.”
With increased proliferation of electric vehicles, the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade. In addition to ramping up R&D and manufacturing, responsible and sustainable domestic sourcing of the critical materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite, will help avoid or mitigate supply chain disruptions and accelerate battery production in America.
“I secured provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support the domestic critical mineral supply chain used in battery production,” said US Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (NV). “Nevada’s innovation economy is at the forefront of battery manufacturing and recycling, and the infrastructure law could bring vital new investments to the state.”
The “Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing” and “Electric Drive Vehicle Battery Recycling and Second Life Applications” funding opportunities are aligned with the National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries, authored by the Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries, and led by DOE and the Departments of Defense, Commerce, and State.
These funding opportunities are the first to be released as a collaboration between DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the new Office of Manufacturing and Supply Chains, created by DOE’s organizational realignment to ensure that the Department has the structure needed to effectively implement the clean energy investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Energy Act of 2020.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/02/solar-briefcase-packs-in-200-w-for-off-grid-and-mobile-living/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 2, 2022",Solar briefcase packs in 200 W for off-grid and mobile living,"FlexSolar, based in Austin, Texas, provides solar PV solutions for off-grid, travel, recreational vehicles, and more. It is known for its foldable solar modules, which can be propped up on-the-go for electricity supply wherever there is sun.
One such portable product from FlexSolar is its 200 W briefcase, which comes with two modules attached by a hinge, a kickstand to prop the array, and a handle for easy carrying. Included with the portable modules is a 10 A, 12/24 V solar charge controller, and necessary connection cables.
The 200W panel charges everyday items rated 12V or below. Users can connect and charge a smartphone, tablet, laptops, cooler, car battery, etc. If charging a 24V device, the kit may require an MPPT (maximum power point tracking) controller, said FlexSolar.
The monocrystalline modules have a combined output of 200 W, an open-circuit voltage of 22.8 V, and a rated module efficiency of 21.5%. The water-resistant kit is rated to operate between -40°F to 180°F. The product weighs 38.6 lbs., including the junction box, and unfolded it measures 55.2 x 36.5 x 1.3 in. The kit comes out to a price per Watt of about $1.85.

The charge controller is equipped with an LED display with adjustable modes and parameters, dual USB outputs and overcharge and overload protection for charging batteries. The briefcase features an intelligent chip for automatically identifying connected devices, optimizing output current to supply the fastest possible charging speed.
The product is warranted for 2 years. FlexSolar also builds a more portable 100 W briefcase, which weighs 23.2 lbs and has the same maximum power voltage as the 200 W model.
Also built by FlexSolar are several models of highly portable modules linked by numerous hinges for high adaptability. The devices are aimed at charging small USB devices and are small enough to be packed in a day backpack on a hike. There are two-module, 10 W models, three-module 15 W models, and 6-module 40 W models with USB and DC charging ports.
And for RV owners, the company sells 100 W and 200 W kits made-ready to be integrated with the vehicle. The kits are compatible with most 12V batteries (Lead-acid, Gel) and portable power stations (Lithium, LiFePO4).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/02/for-the-first-time-in-history-california-was-100-powered-by-renewable-energy/,"MARKETS & POLICY,SOFTWARE,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 2, 2022","For the first time in history, California’s demand was 100% matched by renewable energy generation","According to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), California hit a big milestone in its energy transition, achieving a 100% renewable energy supply on Saturday afternoon. For about fifteen minutes, the state’s energy demand was matched by a 101% supply availability of renewable energy, a majority of it supplied by solar PV.
This is a glimpse into the state’s emissions-free future that it envisions, and a huge accomplishment when considering California as a sovereign nation would represent the fifth largest economy in the world, larger than Germany.
At about 2:45 PM on Saturday, CAISO reported that 12,391 MW of the 18,000 MW demand was supplied by solar PV. The remainder was picked up by generation from wind, geothermal, and other sources. After fifteen minutes of peak solar irradiance, the supply dipped down to about 97% renewable energy. The peak renewable production broke a previous record of 96.4%.
“Twenty years ago no one thought we could get to 100% renewable energy. But bit by bit, bill by bill, and solar panel by solar panel we did it,” said Dan Jacobson, senior advisor to Environment California. Jacobson and his colleagues watched the CAISO tracker closely, expecting the possibility of the milestone being reached that day. Jacobson was instrumental in the promotion and passing of California’s 2018 SB 100 bill, which mandates 100% emissions-free retail electric sales to end-use customers by 2045.
While environmentalists and solar energy developers are excited by Saturday’s milestone, disappointment is strong related to recent federal actions that have directly contrasted with stated clean energy procurement goals. Particularly, the antidumping investigation launched by the Department of Commerce that has pinched off the bulk of the nation’s solar module supply is of concern. 
California’s Governor Gavin Newsom said in a letter to Commerce that the tariff inquiry has delayed at least 4.4 GW of solar and energy storage projects. It has led him to reconsider the closure of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear plant, which has a capacity about half the size of the delayed solar pipeline. In the letter, he encouraged Commerce to, “take immediate action to resolve this issue as soon as possible.”
“This Department of Commerce tariff issue is one of the biggest stories in the country,” said Newsom to the New York Times editorial board.
Despite these headwinds, the solar industry is pushing hard to achieve the state’s procurement mandates to decarbonize the grid. The climate-conscious eagerly look ahead to a day when no more carbon is emitted to power the economy.
“California has shown that, for one brief and shining moment, we could do it! Now we need to get our state running on 100% clean energy for the whole day, the whole week, and the whole year. It’s time to move to 100% clean energy, 100% of the time,” said Laura Deehan, executive director of Environment California.
 This article was changed to reflect that though renewable energy generation was 101% of the current level of demand, it does not mean California was actively “100% powered” by only renewable energy sources. Natural gas, nuclear, energy storage, and other resources also contributed to the grid at this time.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/02/california-governor-calls-on-doc-to-end-anti-circumvention-investigation-doc-says-it-cant/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 2, 2022",California Governor calls on DOC to end anti-circumvention investigation. DOC says it can’t,"California Governor has sent a letter to the Department of Commerce (DOC) Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, laying out the devastating impact the ongoing investigation into solar cell and module manufacturers in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam will have on California’s development market and ability to reach its climate goals. In the letter, Newsom asked the DOC to “resolve this issue as soon as possible and restore certainty in the market.”
According to Newsom’s letter, uncertainty regarding the investigation has already delayed at least 4,350 MW of solar and storage projects set for deployment between 2022 and 2024. In 2022 alone, Newsome is anticipating delays of over 400 MW of hybrid solar and storage projects, including 163 MW of storage that the state had anticipated to come online in September of this year.
Last week, the Solar Energy industries Association (SEIA) released updated data anticipating that the case will result in a drop of 24 GW of planned solar capacity over the next two years, which is more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021. By 2025, imposition of tariffs will cause solar capacity to fall 75 GW short of the pace needed to reach the president’s goal, equal to the size of the entire US solar market prior to 2020.
More important than just progress towards a benchmark, Newsome explains that the anticipated lost capacity will also hinder the state’s ability to deliver energy reliably, especially in light of the 6 GW of mostly gas-fired generation that California is anticipated to retire in the coming years. These retirements will further contribute to grid reliability stress, which is already an issue for the state.
Previously, California looked to tackle its issues of an overloaded grid, rotating outages, and structural damage due to extreme weather events (wildfires) by ordering a procurement of more than 11.5 GW of clean, zero-emitting energy resources by mid-decade for a total of 14.5 GW ordered since 2019. Delays have already put nearly one-third of this procurement in jeopardy.
In recognition that the initial probe was made as an effort to boost the US’s role as a manufacturer of clean energy good, Newsome’s letter also includes a promise for “unprecedented funding commitments and new avenues for permitting projects.”
While the governor’s letter and rhetoric echo much of what those across the renewable energy landscape have been saying for more than a month, a letter that Secretary Raimondo sent to 14 legislators, including Senator Jacky Rosen (NV), just a few days ago offers DOC’s perspective as to why the investigation can’t be dropped like a hot and highly unpopular potato.
The letter starts off by addressing one of the biggest criticisms of the investigation: that it is oxymoronic for an administration that used renewable energy expansion as one of its key platforms to then pursue an investigation that would essentially halt those same expansion efforts.
First, let me assure you that the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to addressing climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. We stand ready to work with you and Congress to advance legislation that would provide incentives to bolster renewable energy. In addition, the Department of Commerce stands ready to work with Congress to diversify our supply chains and develop greater domestic solar manufacturing capacity here at home.
After some case background, Raimondo identically assures each of the 14 legislators that “like all trade remedy proceedings, Commerce will conduct these circumvention inquiries in a fair and transparent manner, and in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations.” As Raimondo puts it, DOC is required by statute to investigate a claim that companies operating in other countries in the region are trying to circumvent existing duties. DOC is merely doing its job.
SEIA is still calling on companies of all sizes across every aspect of the solar supply chain and related industries to complete its Auxin Solar investigation impact survey.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/02/milwaukee-startup-claims-hydrogen-output-for-0-85-kg-or-less-via-new-water-vapor-electrolyzer/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WISCONSIN",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 2, 2022",Milwaukee startup claims hydrogen output for $0.85/kg or less via new water vapor electrolyzer,"Milwaukee-based Advanced Ionics has launched a new water vapor electrolyzer that is designed to operate in conjunction with commonly available waste or process heat from industry. The Symbiotic Electrolyzes system runs at temperatures below 650 C, and is reportedly able to produce hydrogen for $0.85/kg or less.
“This electrolyzer is the first to work across a wide range of temperatures, from 100 C to 650 C,” Chad Mason told pv magazine. “Our Symbiotic technology is a new class of electrolyzer. It is not alkaline, PEM, or Solide Oxide (SOEC).”
Alkaline, anion exchange membrane (AEM), and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) are cold electrolyzers using liquid water. Solid oxide electrolyzers are hot electrolyzers working with heated steam, corresponding to higher efficiency. As said, the company’s electrolyzer operates with temperatures in between. The idea is that temperatures in between allow for high efficiency, while also using cheaper materials for the large-scale assembly, including the stack.
The industry is currently trying to step away from platinum. Just last week, two different research teams (the first led by Imperial College London, the second by Clemson Nanomaterials Institute) presented ways to substitute the metal.
Russia is currently the second-largest platinum producer in the world, accounting for more than 15% of world production. Similarly, Advanced Ionics does not use platinum and iridium metals.
“We use common materials more regularly found in an alkaline electrolyzer, but in a unique configuration,” Mason said. 
The technology uses engineered porous metal electrodes and composite ionic materials for its electrolyte. It does not require “delicate” perfluorinated membranes or “expensive” ceramics, said Mason. Advanced Ionics did not provide any additional details about the membrane. 
Andras Perl, a scientist at EnTranCe Centre of Expertise Energy at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, explained that the charge carrier in the membrane would be a pivotal element in understanding the future of this technology. 
“Our electrolyzer works in tandem with process and waste heat already being produced at industrial sites. By tapping into this existing energy source, we are able to dramatically reduce the electricity requirements for electrolysis, which is the dominant factor in the cost of green hydrogen production. Other electrolyzers require a minimum of 40 kWh per kilogram of hydrogen, and usually closer to 50 kWh. We can produce hydrogen for below 35 kWh, and that results in a dramatically lower cost,” Mason said, noting that this assumes that economies of scale have been achieved.
Economies of scale are now key for competing technologies. The timing of funding is also essential. Last week, Advanced Ionics announced the closure of $4.2 million of initial financing, led by Clean Energy Ventures. 
“Leveraging this new funding, Advanced Ionics will be developing a series of demonstration projects during the next year with partners before expanding to deploy larger-scale projects. In the near future, they will also build a large-scale electrolyzer manufacturing facility to serve key markets such as Europe and North America,” Mason said. 
The company is currently in negotiation with private pilot deployment partners. It expects to take commercial orders in 2024 and ship in 2025. 
“We are being very aggressive on our timelines to match the desperate need for green hydrogen supply to decarbonize all aspects of our economy,” a spokesperson told pv magazine.
Clean Energy Ventures said it is optimistic about the technology.
“After more than five years of evaluating the sector, we backed Advanced Ionics because we believe this leadership team can scale a highly competitive technology to produce the lowest-cost green hydrogen at a scale,” said Daniel Goldman, co-founder and managing partner of Clean Energy Ventures.
According to IHS Markit, the levelized cost of green hydrogen produced through electrolysis was around $4/kg  to $5/kg in 2021. Advanced Ionics claims to be able to provide clean hydrogen without the green premium, for less than $1/kg using Symbiotic steam electrolysis in many industrial locations. 
“The levelized cost of the hydrogen will depend roughly on the cost of heat, electricity, and the capital cost of the setup. If they get cheap heat, almost free electricity, and no expensive materials, then it seems feasible,” said Perl.
He noted that the results of their first demonstration projects would test the feasibility of the technology at a larger scale and in industrial environments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/02/using-soot-from-biomass-for-solar-thermal-absorption/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORTH AMERICA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 2, 2022",Using soot from biomass for solar thermal absorption,"Researchers at the University of Houston (UH) and Mexico’s Universidad Intercultural Indígena de Michoacán (UIIM) have teamed up to test the use of an unlikely replacement for more expensive materials in solar thermal applications: soot.
Soot is a readily available material that is generally considered waste, produced by the burning of biomass, carbon, and hydrocarbons. It is generally considered an environmental pollutant, and a culprit in human-driven climate change when it is emitted into the atmosphere as black carbon. Biomass, coke and other emitting materials are still burned regularly in 2022, so the researchers decided to find a way to make use of the byproduct.
Francisco Robles-Hernández of UH started by creating flat pellets and coatings made of the soot and found that it surprisingly had better properties than most materials commonly used to absorb solar irradiance as heat, outperforming graphene, fullerene, and carbon nanotubes.
“There is no energy involved in producing soot because it is an abundant byproduct, and its circular-reutilization can only reduce carbon footprints. The cost is near-zero, which makes it cost-effective and ideal for solar to heat conversion,” said Robles-Hernández.
The coating was tested in solar stoves that can reach 400 degrees F, coating the surface with a material that only costs $1 per square meter to produce. It has small-scale applications in solar stoves, stills, heaters, household heating, water purification, and other technologies, said the researchers.
While the team doesn’t expect this technology to be used widely large-scale, high-power industrial applications in the United States, they believe it could be used in industrial scale drying, which is one of the most energy intensive and costly industrial processes. The coating could be applied to large heaters or boilers to cost-effectively dry large quantities of industrial products.
“The next step for this project is to mass produce solar-to-heat convertors for food processing, ultimately, the motivation for this project is to benefit the environment, using carbon waste or byproducts for household and industrial processes,” said Luis Bernardo López-Sosa of UIIM. “The language of the local communities where I work is Purepécha. In Purepécha we say ‘Jaroajperakua’ which can be translated as climate change prevention or awareness.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/02/lack-of-trained-workers-itc-uncertainty-supply-chain-woes-cited-as-challenges-for-us-solar-installers-2/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 2, 2022","Lack of trained workers, ITC uncertainty, supply chain woes cited as challenges for US solar installers","EnergySage and NABCEP released the results of the seventh annual Solar Installer Survey. Over 500 residential and commercial installers across the country participated in this year’s survey, and it captures key observations about the current state of the US solar industry, offering the perspective of local, regional, and national solar installers. Some of the key challenges noted include supply chain constraints, a lack of trained workers, and uncertainty around the investment tax credit (ITC).
Three out of five of installers reported that supply chain constraints harmed their businesses in 2021. These constraints manifested themselves primarily as freight delays, decreasing the availability of solar panels and batteries in particular: 57% of installers reported difficulties in purchasing and receiving solar equipment necessary for completing projects.
Lack of trained labor as the largest barrier to growth cropped up for the first time in the seven years of the survey. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the number of jobs in the solar industry has grown from 93,000 to 230,000 in sales, distribution, construction and development, manufacturing, and O&M.  The need for workers is increasing in response to the Biden administrations climate goals and increase in consumer demand for solar. SEIA, NABCEP, and GRID Alternatives are just a few of the organizations offering training programs to expand and diversify the solar workforce.
A further impediment to growth is the uncertainty surrounding the ITC. Half of survey respondents say they will hire more workers if Congress extends the ITC for 10 years. According to the Wood Mackenzie/SEIE US Solar Market Insight Q4 2021 report, extending the ITC would increase capacity installations over the next decade by 66%. Survey respondents said a complete phase out of the ITC would lead most installers to scale back their businesses or business-related spending. The best scenario appears to be the direct-pay option for the ITC (an upfront cash rebate as opposed to a tax credit post installation), with 70% of installers anticipating that direct-pay would result in greater consumer demand for solar.
“2021 saw supply chain disruptions, a global pandemic, and more regulatory headwinds. These challenges remind me of how very proud I am to be part of an industry that continues to overcome such hurdles in an effort to combat climate change while helping millions of Americans save money with renewable energy,” said Vikram Aggarwal, CEO and founder of EnergySage.
EnergySage fielded this survey from January through March 2021. In addition to EnergySage, NABCEP, the leading certification organization for renewable energy professionals, as well as several large manufacturers, distributors, publications (including pv magazine), and industry associations sent the survey to their own installer networks. In total, 501 solar installers participated across 43 states and two territories: Washington DC and Puerto Rico.
“It cannot be overstated how important this information is to the solar industry and the future of the renewable energy sector,” said Shawn O’Brien, President & CEO of NABCEP. “We feel that our organization can play a significant role in meeting the nearly one million solar jobs needed to meet President Biden’s clean energy target by 2035. This report contains crucial data that credentialing bodies like ourselves can use to bolster our current programs and continue our devotion to grow the solar workforce.”
The latest report can be downloaded for free here. Installers who download this survey will be invited to participate and have their voice heard in the 2022 edition.
