And while renewable energy comes in a litany of forms and sizes, the most immediate impacts and greatest investments are being realized through the development and construction of large, utility-scale generation projects, like the Montague Solar Facility, a 162 MW project being constructed in Oregon, which is among the largest ever proposed in the state.
That project’s developer is Avangrid Renewables, a subsidiary of Iberdrola, and a major player when it comes to large-scale renewable in the United States. Headquartered in Orange, Conn., Avangrid owns approximately $40 billion in assets and operations in 24 US states, with more than 7 GW of owned and controlled wind and solar power facilities.
And while the company’s strength has historically been in wind development, this philosophy is evolving, as Avangrid’s new Onshore President and CEO, Jose Antonio Miranda, shared with pv magazine.
 
“Our expectation, in the next five years, is that we will be adding an important amount of solar projects, in order to balance our fleet,” Miranda said. “Our current solar pipeline is 14 GW, while our new, onshore wind portfolio is 3 GW, which is okay, but we also want to enlarge it, because wind has always a part of also our strength.”
While wind has been the company’s developmental bread and butter historically and solar has been a recent, strong addition to its US portfolio, Miranda shares that Avangrid is always looking to diversify, and to separate itself from any scenario where it leans on one resource far more than others.
“What we see in the future is more than just new megawatts absorbed, built and, operated. It is incorporating more battery storage and starting to incorporate hydrogen,” outlined Miranda. “Hydrogen is something that we are very, very keen on being the next frontier of renewables in the next few years.”
Hydrogen has become a top-down focus for both Avangrid and its parent company, Iberdrola, which is currently developing more than 60 projects in eight countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and the United States. Iberdrola recently began operations at the company’s 20 MW green hydrogen plant in Puertollano, the largest facility of its kind currently operating in the world. The Puertollano plant will be able to produce up to 3,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, and includes an on-site solar facility.
On the battery storage side of things, Miranda said that his company is not so much interested in developing standalone solutions as it is pairing storage with other generation resources, a trend that is becoming the predominant one in many areas across the US, especially California.

“We are living in a very specific point in time, in terms of the cost of the lithium,” explained Miranda. “Essentially, the cost of lithium has increased quite a lot, and the industry expectations from some years ago regarding the production capacity we were supposed to have today, well, they are not coming to fruition because of these spiking costs. So that is something that is going to challenge the economics of battery storage, but it’s not changing the fundamentals of the battery storage. What’s fundamental is that we need to pair battery storage with our renewable resources in order to be able to even be more dispatchable and reliable.”
Miranda joined Avangrid in September 2021, and certainly could not have fully expected some of the turbulence that his tenure has already been greeted with. In addition to rising raw materials and component costs, the DOC anticircumvention investigation slowed large-scale solar development to a crawl. And while President Biden’s recent action to enact a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, while also invoking the Defense Production Act, are expected to get development and construction back on track, Miranda shares that, even before this action, Avangrid was able to mitigate the potentially harmful aspects of investigation uncertainty.
“In our case, the impact of anticircumvention is not as deep as other players, because our approach to final investment decisions is very, very prudent and disciplined,” he explained. “And we do not approve investments and PPAs until we have all the pieces of the puzzle together. So yes, of course, we will see some projects, that were expected to be completed in 2023, may be impacted and delayed by anticircumvention, as is true with anyone in the industry, but in general terms, nothing material.”
Miranda joined Avangrid after leaving his role as CEO of onshore in the Americas region for Siemens Gamesa and chairman of its boards in the US, Mexico, and Brazil, an opportunity that he and those close to him feel gives him unique advantages in his new position.
An electrical engineer by trade, Miranda spent much of his early career in the transmission and distribution space, which helped give him an fundamental understanding of the grid and electric system at large. This understanding has helped to influence his overall strategy regarding renewable development.
“I’ve worked in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and North America, which I think is pretty unique and I’m very proud of,” said Miranda. “Thinking and working in these different places and recognizing their needs allows you to tackle the issues in a different way. You have ways to correlate things and respond to situations. I have been lucky enough to see the industry across almost all the value chain. I had the opportunity to understand how the grids are operated and what they need. I went to the next step in the supply chain, which is the generation equipment, right, and now I see things as a developer and operator.”
This diverse knowledge of the global renewable energy landscape was recognized by Juan Ignacio Garcia de Motiloa, current senior vice president with Iraeta Energy in China and former Siemens Gamesa employee who worked under Miranda, as one of the critical aspects for Miranda’s success at Avangrid, coupled with his background in engineering.
“It’s very difficult to find someone with a combination of technical and management expertise,” explained Motiloa. Most of us, we are not technical people. We know general things about the machines, but Antonio, he’s an engineer himself: he fully understood the wind turbines, the generator, the gearbox, the blades, from day one. It’s very hard to b.s. him. I think this is very important, especially when you’re in front of clients, being able to defend products and strategies, from a technical point of view.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/13/electric-vehicle-battery-capable-of-98-charge-in-less-than-ten-minutes/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 13, 2022",Electric vehicle battery capable of 98% charge in less than ten minutes,"Enovix, based in Fremont, California, announced that it demonstrated in electric vehicle (EV) battery cells the ability to charge from 0% to 80% state-of-charge in as little as 5.2 minutes and to achieve a greater than 98% charge capacity in under 10 minutes. The cells also surpassed 1,000 cycles while retaining 93% of their capacity.
The achievement shattered the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) goal of achieving 80% charge in 15 minutes.
Other goals for USABC at the cell level include a usable energy density of 550 Wh/L, a survival temperature range of -40 to +66 degrees C, and a cost of $75/kWh at an annual output volume of 250,000 units. A full set of USABC targets can be found here.
The company demonstrated the fast-charge ability in its 0.27 Ah EV cells in its silicon lithium-ion batteries, which it said contain a novel 3D architecture and constraint system. The cells contain a 100% active silicon anode. Enovix said the material has long been heralded as an important technology in the next generation of battery anodes.
Silicon anodes can theoretically store more than twice as much lithium than the graphite anode that is used in nearly all Li-ion batteries today (1800mAh/cubic centimeter vs. 800mAh/cubic centimeter).
“Fast charge capability can accelerate mass adoption of EVs and we’ve been able to demonstrate a level of performance that meets and exceeds many OEM roadmaps,” said Harrold Rust, co-founder, CEO and president of Enovix. “EV manufacturers are in pursuit of batteries that support longer range, while the public and private sectors work to increase EV driver access to fast chargers. We’re proud to support these goals to help electrify the automotive industry and demonstrate our batteries are an exciting option to power long-range, fast-charging EVs.”
Silicon’s high energy density, however, creates four significant technical problems that Enovix has addressed with its technology:
“Our unique architecture enables a battery that not only charges in less than 10 minutes, but also maintains high cycle life,” said Ashok Lahiri, co-founder and CTO of Enovix. “We can improve battery performance today using the same chemistries, but more importantly, we can accelerate the industry’s roadmap.”
Lahiri will speak at the 12th International Advanced Automotive Battery Conference (AABC) Europe in Mainz, Germany. His presentation at 11:20 a.m. CEST (5:00 a.m. EST) titled “Silicon-Anode Lithium-Ion Batteries for EV Applications,” will provide an update on the company’s EV program. The slide deck can be found here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/13/mo-current-mo-problems-as-higher-wattage-solar-modules-increase-risk-of-thermal-runaway/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 13, 2022","Mo’ current, mo’ problems as higher wattage solar modules increase risk of thermal runaway","Due to increases in efficiency and size, higher wattage solar panels are generating higher electrical currents – and thus an increased probability of heat events. LONGi Solar has taken note of this as they develop solar modules, and they have released a brief analysis of their modules and junction boxes..
Junction boxes are placed on the back of solar panels, and are the interface that connects the panels to the outside world. LONGi was the world’s largest seller of solar panels in 2021, so naturally they sold more junction boxes than any other manufacturer. (They also predict that global solar installations will reach 1 TW each year by 2030.)
The company notes that the ‘hot spot durability and diode thermal performance testing’ logic is designed in accordance with the IEC 61215 & 62790 standards.

LONGi compares their bifacial Hi-MO5 solar modules series, which has a lower front side short circuit current value of 13.9A, to a unit with a current of 18.5A. The company said lower currents produce long term product stability by lowering module temperatures, and associated temperature swings. LONGi asserts that higher currents increase the chance of a fire.
Glass-glass bifacial solar panels do have an opportunity to reach 50 year useful lifetimes.
LONGi’s analysis states that a competing 18.5A module can simply upgrade its junction box to 30A protection and meet a safety margin of 1.25 (accounting for bifacial gains). However, reducing current can limit the number of modules that can be wired on a string, due to lower voltage allowances.

Additionally, the temperature range of this higher current module would place it outside of LONGi’s suggested potential thermal runaway zone. Higher temperatures carry higher risks.
LONGi explains that hot spots and thermal runaway can occur when modules are shaded while operating outdoors (as opposed to highly controlled lab conditions). This shading can be caused by fallen leaves, an accumulation of dust, or anything that blocks enough light to stop and reverse current, leading to thermal runaway. These hot spots can occur under fairly normal conditions, meaning these conditions must be accounted for as a design standard.

Since higher current panels tend to produce higher temperature hot spots and increased heat build up, LONGi concludes that heat dissipation gear must be improved, particularly in equipment that doesn’t meet certain standards.
When these local current leaks occur regularly over decades of expected electricity generation, they silently, and permanently, reduce system output. While manufacturers could potentially mitigate the challenges of high currents with fuses and thicker copper wiring, LONGi believes that starting with lower currents is the better solution, for now.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/13/boviet-solar-wins-255-mw-solar-module-order/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 13, 2022",Boviet Solar wins 255 MW solar module order,"Boviet Solar announced it signed a contract to provide 255 MW of solar modules to a leading US-based renewable energy developer. The modules will power a utility-scale solar project in the United States.
Boviet’s Vega Series 550 W PERC monocrystalline bifacial double-glass PV modules were selectedd for the order. The company said its panels feature high-purity monocrystalline wafer technology combined with PERC, half-cut, multi-busbar, and large cell design modules.
“That combination of technologies means our modules capture more photons, produce more energy, and ultimately pack more power per module. And it means developers can rely on our modules to perform reliably regardless of the installation scenario and environmental conditions,” said Sienna Cen, president of Boviet Solar USA.
The Vega Series 550 W module features 10 busbars, 144 cells, a silver frame, and a transparent backsheet. It holds a module efficiency of 21.1%, and a system voltage of 1000/1500 V DC. It has a maximum power output of 433 W, and is rated to operate between –40 degrees F to 185 degrees F.
Each module measures 90.40 x 44.65 x 1.38 inches and weighs just under 64 lbs. It has a 25-year linear output warranty with 2.5% degradation in the first year and less than 0.6% from the second year until the end of the warranty. It also comes with a standard 12-year product warranty. Full specifications can be found here.
The solar modules have been a PVEL top performance product on its scorecard since 2019, and BloombergNEF Tier 1 status since 2017. BloombergNEF’s tiering system for PV module manufacturers is primarily based on bankability, the most important feature of a utility-scale solar module for most developers.
“Our Monofacial and Bifacial PV modules are designed with better technology in mind, made from robust products components under stringent quality control steps and using high-tech manufacturing processes. As a result, clients can mitigate their project risk, lower their balance of system (BOS) cost, lower the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), receive a great return on investment (ROI), and realize long-term, reliable energy generation and savings,” said Cen.
The order for modules produced by the Vietnam-based manufacturer may be a sign that pressures onset by the Department of Commerce’s investigation into Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand for alleged antidumping violations by Chinese companies are now lifting. The uncertainty caused by the investigation led the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) to cut in half its deployment projections for utility-scale solar in the United States, but an executive order by the Biden administration last week eliminated the possibility of any tariffs, which could have ranged 50% to 250% of shipped module prices, for two years.

The portfolio spans 10 states (California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Virginia), and includes a significant portion of projects already under commercial operations. The entire portfolio is expected to be active by the end of the year.
Forefront Power said it will provide energy asset management services for customers of the projects, and for Hannon Armstrong. The portfolio acquisition now brings the company’s total capacity of owned and developed solar projects to more than 800 MW of capacity across more than 1,000 projects.
“We are pleased to be an equity capital partner with ForeFront Power and support the continued expansion of their C&I solar business across the U.S.,” said Manny Haile-Mariam, Hannon Armstrong’s managing director, Structured Investments Team lead. “This high-quality portfolio of behind-the-meter solar projects further diversifies our investment in the distributed generation market, which is critical for reducing carbon emissions and strengthening energy security and resilience at the same time.”
The deal with Forefront Power also marks Hannon Armstrong’s first major co-ownership agreement of 2022. At the end of Dec. 2021, Engie North America announced the completion of a 2.3 GW portfolio of wind and utility-scale solar projects that the company jointly owns alongside Hannon Armstrong.
The entire portfolio is comprised of 13 renewable projects in 15 counties spanning five states, including 1.8 GW of onshore wind and 0.5 GW of utility-scale solar projects. The portfolio is estimated to produce enough renewable energy on the grid to provide power to the equivalent of over 500,000 homes. Each project was constructed between the end of 2019 and the second half of 2021.
Earlier that month, Hannon Armstrong saw another of its notable assets enter service: a 9.2 MW community solar project located on a commercial warehouse northwest of Baltimore, Maryland. Developed by Summit Ridge Energy, the project is among the largest rooftop community solar installations ever developed.

The project is part of a $36 million contract that focused on energy resilience and security at Fort Bragg.
Fort Bragg will own and operate the solar system, which is paired with a 2 MW battery energy storage system. The system will supply power to the fort from the local grid and provide power during electric service outages.
“With this system, the largest floating solar array in the Southeast, we will be able to provide energy resiliency to Fort Bragg operations through sustainable resources,” said Col. Scott Pence, garrison commander for Fort Bragg. “With this partnership, Fort Bragg not only has renewable electricity, but energy security that will be critical with continuing the installation’s mission during a power outage.”
The US Army recently announced a commitment to be carbon free by 2030, and a plan to build renewable energy projects on its bases, as well as purchasing clean electricity. By 2035 the Army aims to install a microgrid on every installation, with the goal being able to “self-sustain its critical missions” on all its installations by 2040.
“This project fulfills the commitment made in our Army Climate Strategy to increase resilience while delivering clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said the Honorable Rachel Jacobson, assistant secretary of the Army for installations, energy and environment. “When we collaborate with local utilities and industry to promote energy resilience while powering the local grid, it is a winning solution across the board.”
With this first floating solar installation operational, Fort Bragg may put solar on its other bodies of water.
“Floating solar allowed us to provide energy security and resiliency without reducing training lands,” Audrey Oxendine, Fort Bragg’s energy and utilities branch chief said. It was estimated that seven acres of cleared land would be needed for 1 MW of traditional ground mounted solar, but the 1 MW of floating solar only required two acres of water surface area, she explained.
Fort Bragg has the largest population of any US military installation, with approximately 49,000 military personnel, 11,000 civilian employees and 23,000 family members. It covers over 251 square miles in four counties in Duke Energy’s territory in North Carolina. The state was ranked fourth in the United States for installed solar, obtaining just over 8% of its electricity from solar energy. Duke Energy owns and operates more than 40 solar facilities in North Carolina, one of which is a 13-MW facility at the Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Onslow County.

Japanese car and battery manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation has launched a new residential storage system based on its proprietary vehicle battery technology.
“The O-Uchi Kyuden System uses electrified vehicle battery technology such as Toyota’s battery control to provide a rated capacity of 8.7 kWh and a rated output of 5.5 kW,” the company said in a statement. “This ensures safety and provides a supply of electricity to the entire home not just in normal situations, but even during power outages caused by natural disasters.”
The battery has a size of 1,142 mm x 341 mm x 432 mm and a weight of 142 kg. It can be installed in outdoor environments and with operating temperatures ranging from -20 C to 45 C. It is equipped with a hybrid power conditioner, a DC-to-DC converter, and a vehicle power supply adapter with a maximum output of 1.1 kWh.
Toyota explained that the system supports supplying power from hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) at 100 V. The technology utilizes “many years of electrified vehicle development as well as on-board parts,” the company emphasized. “It provides electricity to homes both for normal usage and emergencies, supporting a stress-free lifestyle.
The company did not disclose any more technical details about the battery.

Recent investment into REC Silicon by the Hanwha Group, in conjunction with Hanwha’s subsidiary Qcells, was the impetus for the MOU.
REC Silicon is a producer of advanced silicon materials, supplying high-purity polysilicon and silicon gases to the solar industry worldwide, and it was producing silicon in its Moses Lake, Washington facility until mid-2019 when China imposed steep tariffs on US-made polysilicon, in retaliation for tariffs imposed on Chinese-made solar panels in 2013. In the REC Silicon audiocast Q4 2021 James May, CEO, said that investments by Hanwha in January “improves the company’s liquidity position and is expected to give us the capital necessary to restart the FBR facility in Moses Lake and make targeted investments in and improve our product portfolio in the semiconductor materials segment.” The Moses Lake facility is expected to be operational again in 2023.
Ferroglobe is a producer of silicon metal and its alloys and it supplies critical materials for many industrial and consumer products, from silicones to solar power cells, from steel to aluminum to foundry components. The company will be a critical partner in ensuring a steady supply of fully traceable metallurgical grade silicon metal produced in the US from locally sourced raw materials.
In March, Hanwha Solutions, parent corporation of Qcells, announced that it was stepping up efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products when it became the largest shareholder of REC Silicon. Following its initial $160 million acquisition to acquire a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha announced that it was acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons in a deal valued at around $44 million. This investment will help American manufacturers secure the raw material critical to the solar supply chain.
Hanwha’s US initiative supports the Biden administration’s efforts to increase solar power generation by 40% and to decarbonize all electricity by 2035. Hanwha sees the enactment of the Solar Energy Manufacturing Act (SEMA) as critical to a US-based solar supply chain.
