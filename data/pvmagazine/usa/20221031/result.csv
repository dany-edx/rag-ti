https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/31/heliene-adds-420-mw-u-s-solar-panel-assembly-line/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MINNESOTA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 31, 2022",Heliene adds 420 MW U.S. solar panel assembly line,"PV panel assembler Heliene announced the opening of a 420 MW plant in Minnesota, adding to the Canadian company’s existing 150 MW operation in the state. The facility is set to assemble monofacial and bifacial panels with half-cut cells.
Following the hiring of 60 additional worker for the new facility, Heliene now employs 100 Minnesotans. The company began construction of the new facility prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, achieving operation without taking in the newly-established manufacturing tax credits.
To support the $21 million expansion, the Minnesota Department of Employee and Economic Development and Iron Range Resources & Rehabilitation each provided a $2.75 million loan to a local economic development agency.
In addition, Heliene received a $5.5 million grant from the State of Minnesota’s Renewable Development Account, which funds projects that boost the state’s electrification and climate change abatement efforts. St. Louis County, where the Mountain Iron plant is located, awarded Heliene a $1 million grant as well.
The factory was built in less than one year. Heliene CEO Martin Pochtaruk said the company will spend $7 million on updated equipment for the 150 MW plant, with aims to double its capacity to 300 MW. Pochtaruk said the company expects this upgrade to be complete by July 2023.
In September, Heliene announced it will source its solar glass from Canadian Premium Sand, signing on for about 40% of the glass provider’s total capacity.
“Amid exploding solar demand and trade volatility, our customers seek peace of mind that they are receiving the highest quality, competitively priced solar modules exactly when and where they need them. Having CPS supply us with a low-carbon glass, free of any geopolitical pressures is an enormous leap forward in the right direction,” said Pochtaruk.
Quantum-dot agrivoltaics modules
In March, Heliene announced it entered a joint development agreement to create transparent agrivolatic modules for greenhouses. Heliene’s partner company, UbiQD, utilizes luminescent quantum dot tinting to concentrate solar energy and generate electricity while maintaining transparency. The technology allows plant-nourishing light to pass through, while maintaining energy production.
The UbiQD “UbiGro” panels glow a spectrum of color that is optimized for plant growth, absorbing UV and blue light and emitting fruitful orange or red light.
In recent trials, UbiGro led to a 21% boost in flowering in geranium flowers, a 14 to 28% boost in winter strawberry growth, and an 8% yield increase in cannabis production. Increased crop yields are a welcome sign to any grower, and the two companies are set to take that benefit one step further, integrating productive solar PV in the greenhouse-topping modules.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/31/u-s-solar-modules-107-more-expensive-without-global-supply-chains/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 31, 2022",U.S. solar modules 107% more expensive without global supply chains,"Researchers from UCLA have developed a model that shows how much more the world would pay for solar modules if countries were to implement trade limiting policies. The group estimates that from 2008 to 2020, the United States saved between $19 to $30 billion on solar module pricing due to the free flow of capital, talent and innovation. Germany saved $5 to $9 billion, and China saved $26 to $46 billion.

The groups suggest that if the three nations had “adopted strong nationalistic trade policies”, then module pricing in 2020 would be 107% higher in the U.S., 83% higher in Germany, and 54% higher in China.
Going forward, the analysis – Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains – suggests that if the world were to localize its supply chains, we could expect the price of solar to increase 20 to 25% by 2030.
Credit Suisse estimates that structural conditions in the USA resulted in a 33% higher price for solar panels through the end of the decade, when compared to China.
The researchers arrived at these numbers by estimating what they believe would be the costs of legislative actions taken in favor of “localizing benefits such as economic growth, employment, and trade surpluses.” The variance – $50 to $85 billion in savings from 2008-2020 – is based on varying levels of isolation from the global market’s learning curves. Nearly 800 GW of solar capacity was deployed during this period.
Going forward, an additional 1.3 to 2.3 TW of capacity deployments are projected in the next decade, depending on how various policies facilitate that deployment.

The logic behind this study is as follows: if the manufacturing of a product is heavily localized within a country, then the global learning curves associated with that product will only be affected by solar modules deployed in that country. (Each doubling of deployed capacity is estimated to lower prices by 20%). Since each country is a part of the whole volume deployed, limiting trade lowers learning curves and raises prices.
When these models consider nationalized policies, they predict that by 2030, China’s price of solar modules could be 16.2¢ per watt instead of 13.5¢. In Germany, the model predicts 29.8¢ per watt instead of 25.1¢, and in the United states, it predicts 32¢ per watt instead of 26.2¢.

Researchers found that in a fully integrated global market scenario, global learning curve savings could exceed $10 billion in 2030 alone (per the chart, above). The researchers found that in a heavily nationalized market, those savings could shrink to $4 billion.
The researchers also created an online tool that visualizes these equations. On the Projections tab, it is possible to adjust the percent of a benefit a country gains from global innovation versus being more nationally focused.

Its main functions in service of this goal are driving innovation in technology and soft cost reductions to make solar affordable and accessible to all Americans; enabling solar to support reliability, resilience, and grid security; and creating a sustainable industry that supports job growth, manufacturing, and the circular economy.
One way SETO achieves these goals is through gathering data to better support the PV industry. Through the issuance of requests for information (RFI), SETO can use impactful real-world data to guide its programs. There are three active RFIs with deadlines coming up shortly.
Performance data for PV systems: acquisition, access, and sharing
SETO has issued an RFI for feedback on the cost and value of acquiring, accessing, and sharing PV system performance data.
Access to real-world performance of PV systems and their components would be highly helpful to the research and development community. However, this type of data has typically been limited or difficult to obtain. To overcome this barrier, SETO is soliciting information and opinions from stakeholders in industry, academia, government, research, system owners, data users, and more.
This RFI was issued on Oct 14, 2022, and has a deadline to submit on November 18 at 5:00 p.m. EST.
Green Proving Ground program
The DOE General Services Administration (GSA) released an RFI to identify solar technologies that will help achieve net-zero carbon buildings. The RFI specifically seeks input from industry on technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions of commercial buildings, improve grid resiliency, and have significant potential for equitable and broad adoption in the U.S. market.
The RFI comes as part of the Green Proving Ground program, which leverages GSA’s real estate portfolio to evaluate innovative, American-Made building technologies.
Past technology selections included a commercial rooftop solar tracking system from Rocking Solar in Ohio, and EV ARC, a transportable solar powered EV charging station that fits in a standard parking space.
This RFI has a deadline to submit of December 9, 2022. Technologies to be selected from the RFI will be announced in April 2023.
Energy improvement in rural or remote areas
In partnership with the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, SETO is seeking information related to boosting resilience, safety, reliability, and availability of energy. It also seeks information on environmental protection from adverse impacts of energy generation.
The $1 billion program appropriates $200 million annually through fiscal year 2026, and will award funds via grants, cooperative agreements, or other funding methods. Eligible uses include:
Applications to this program are due November 28, 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/31/all-13-states-in-pjm-grid-region-call-for-pjm-to-make-faster-progress-on-interconnection/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 31, 2022",All 13 states in PJM grid region call for PJM to make faster progress on interconnection,"The grid operator PJM would not begin processing new interconnection requests until 2026 and then would take two years to complete each interconnection study, under its proposed timelines, the Organization of PJM States, Inc. (OPSI) said in comments to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Both those timelines are “too long,” the organization said.
Calling for PJM’s timelines to be the “absolute upper limit,” in comments on FERC’s interconnection rulemaking proceeding, OPSI said it supported implementation of PJM’s proposal as “an improvement over the status quo,” and as “critical to reducing the interconnection backlog, ensuring markets remain competitive, and that states are able to achieve their public policy goals.”


But OPSI told FERC that “ideally,” FERC’s final interconnection rule “should increase” PJM’s interconnection request processing speed “and shorten” PJM’s transition to a clustered first-ready, first-served process. The organization, renewing a concern it expressed earlier, said “the possibility that resources entering the queue today would not be able to reach commercial operation until nearly 2030” was “troubling.”
Seven members of OPSI have 100% clean electricity goals, according to the Clean Energy States Alliance: the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia. The organization’s other members are Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia. All member states are wholly or partly in the service area of PJM.
OPSI’s comments were unanimously supported by its members.
Backlog
PJM has a backlog of interconnection requests
totaling more than 250 GW of renewables and storage, as shown in the featured image above, across more than 2,700 projects, as shown in the nearby table prepared by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for a presentation to OPSI, alongside the numbers for other grid regions.
PJM has suspended for two years its review of 1,200 projects in its interconnection queue, mostly solar power.
Annual capacity additions to PJM’s queue this year are running well below last year’s additions, as shown in the nearby image from LBNL. In its presentation to OPSI, LBNL asked whether this year’s decline may be due to PJM’s announced queue reform.
In the PJM grid region, according to a Bloomberg News report last month, “24% of fossil-fired generators that applied since 2017 received approval to connect to the grid, compared to a 0.4% rate for renewable projects, according to BloombergNEF.”
Cluster studies
OPSI said it supports cluster studies for interconnection requests to speed processing and to minimize the first mover disadvantage, when a project must pay for a large network upgrade that then benefits later projects. OPSI said FERC should analyze whether a region-wide, annual cluster “in a large region like PJM” could benefit from better defined subclusters, and also evaluate methods to group generating facilities based on “areas of geographic and electrical relevance.”
Annual clustering is superior to PJM’s “less structured proposal that (would) only open new cluster windows after a certain stage of the previous cycle has concluded,” OPSI said. PJM’s approach would “introduce timeline uncertainty” into the interconnection process, it added.
Timelines, batteries
OPSI asked FERC, “if it is clear that a clustered process is more efficient than the status quo process,” to “strongly consider using a clustered process as soon as feasible in the transition” from the traditional serial process, and to “analyze whether the option for interconnection customers to utilize a transitional serial process has the potential to materially delay the transition” to cluster studies.
PJM’s proposed interconnection study timeline of 710 days (about 2 years) compares to FERC’s proposed requirement, including re-studies, that would only take a maximum of 555 days, OPSI said. The organization said it “is optimistic that PJM will be able to continue to trim its interconnection process to at least the timelines” proposed by FERC “and hopefully to an even shorter timeline like those already implemented by other regional transmission organizations.”
The Organization of PJM States’ comments to FERC are available via FERC’s docket search webpage, under docket #RM22-14-000.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/31/annual-added-pv-capacity-will-more-than-quadruple-to-650-gw-in-2030-says-iea/,"MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,WORLD",ROLAND ERNST,"OCTOBER 31, 2022","Annual added PV capacity will more than quadruple to 650 GW in 2030, says IEA","From pv magazine Germany
PV and wind power are the most important way to reduce emissions in the electricity sector, the IEA said in its new “World Energy Outlook 2022” report. Their share of electricity generation will increase from 10% in 2021 to 40% in 2030, reaching 70% in 2050, according to the agency.
Solar provided more than 3% of global electricity generation in 2021.  Annual capacity addition reached 150 GW, making 2021 another record year. Solar panel prices have fallen by 80% over the past decade, thanks to economies of scale and continuous innovation throughout the supply chain. As a result, PV has become the most affordable power generation technology in many parts of the world. The IEA expects annual growth to more than quadruple to 650 GW in 2030.
By then, annual solar and wind power installations in the United States will increase two and a half times from today’s levels, thanks in part to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). New targets are also driving the massive build-up of clean energy in China, with the country’s coal and oil consumption peaking before the end of this decade. Accelerated renewable energy deployment and efficiency improvements in the European Union mean that EU demand for gas and oil will fall by 20% and coal consumption by 50% over the course of this decade, according to the report.
The average selling price of solar panels rose for the first time in 2021 – by around 20% from 2020 – due to higher freight and commodity prices, particularly for polysilicon. While module prices remained at high levels in the first half of 2022, the IEA said that continuous innovations, further improvements to materials, and energy efficiency will lead to further cost reductions.
The energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could accelerate the transition to a more sustainable energy system, according to the IEA. Although the use of fossil fuels will peak in this decade, it will then decline in the long term. The IEA forecasts that more than $2 trillion will be invested every year in climate-neutral technologies by 2030, through programs like the IRA, REPower EU, and others in Japan, South Korea, and China. This corresponds to an increase of more than 50% compared to today. However, that would still fall short of 1.5-degree target, which would require a $4 trillion investment by 2030.
“The energy markets and energy policies have been changed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and not just temporarily, but for the coming decades,” said Fatih Birol, director-general of the IEA. “Even with today’s political framework, the energy world is changing dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this an historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system.”
