But how long do panels last, and how resilient are they?
Panel life depends on several factors, including climate, module type, and the racking system used, among others. While there isn’t a specific “end date” for a panel per se, loss of production over time often forces equipment retirements.
When deciding whether to keep your panel running 20-30 years in the future, or to look for an upgrade at that time, monitoring output levels is the best way to make an informed decision.
Degradation
The loss of output over time, called degradation, typically lands at about 0.5% each year, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Manufacturers typically consider 25 to 30 years a point at which enough degradation has occurred where it may be time to consider replacing a panel. The industry standard for manufacturing warranties is 25 years on a solar module, said NREL.
Given the 0.5% benchmark annual degradation rate, a 20-year-old panel is capable of producing about 90% of its original capability.

Panel quality can make some impact on degradation rates. NREL reports premium manufacturers like Panasonic and LG have rates of about 0.3% per year, while some brands degrade at rates as high as 0.80%. After 25 years, these premium panels could still produce 93% of their original output, and the higher-degradation example could produce 82.5%.

A sizeable portion of degradation is attributed to a phenomenon called potential induced degradation (PID), an issue experienced by some, but not all, panels. PID occurs when the panel’s voltage potential and leakage current drive ion mobility within the module between the semiconductor material and other elements of the module, like the glass, mount, or frame. This causes the module’s power output capacity to decline, in some cases significantly.
Some manufacturers build their panels with PID-resistant materials in their glass, encapsulation, and diffusion barriers.
All panels also suffer something called light induced degradation (LID), in which panels lose efficiency within the first hours of being exposed to the sun. LID varies from panel to panel based on the quality of the crystalline silicon wafers, but usually results in a one-time, 1-3% loss in efficiency, said testing laboratory PVEL, PV Evolution Labs.
Weathering 
The exposure to weather conditions is the main driver in panel degradation. Heat is a key factor in both real-time panel performance and degradation over time. Ambient heat negatively affects the performance and efficiency of electrical components, according to NREL.
By checking the manufacturer’s data sheet, a panel’s temperature coefficient can be found, which will demonstrate the panel’s ability to perform in higher temperatures.

The coefficient explains how much real-time efficiency is lost by each degree of Celsius increased above the standard temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. For example, a temperature coefficient of -0.353% means that for every degree Celsius above 25, 0.353% of total production capability is lost.
Heat exchange drives panel degradation through a process called thermal cycling. When it is warm, materials expand, and when the temperature lowers, they contract. This movement slowly causes microcracks to form in the panel over time, lowering output.
In its annual Module Score Card study, PVEL analyzed 36 operational solar projects in India, and found significant impacts from heat degradation. The average annual degradation of the projects landed at 1.47%, but arrays located in colder, mountainous regions degraded at nearly half that rate, at 0.7%.

Proper installation can help deal with heat related issues. Panels should be installed a few inches above the roof, so that convective air can flow beneath and cool the equipment. Light-colored materials can be used in panel construction to limit heat absorption. And components like inverters and combiners, whose performance is particularly sensitive to heat, should be located in shaded areas, suggested CED Greentech. 
Wind is another weather condition that can cause some harm to solar panels. Strong wind can cause flexing of the panels, called dynamic mechanical load. This also causes microcracks in the panels, lowering output. Some racking solutions are optimized for high-wind areas, protecting the panels from strong uplift forces and limiting microcracking. Typically, the manufacturer’s datasheet will provide information on the max winds the panel is able to withstand.
The same goes for snow, which can cover panels during heavier storms, limiting output. Snow can also cause a dynamic mechanical load, degrading the panels. Typically, snow will slide off of panels, as they are slick and run warm, but in some cases a homeowner may decide to clear the snow off the panels. This must be done carefully, as scratching the glass surface of the panel would make a negative impact on output.

Degradation is a normal, unavoidable part of a panel’s life. Proper installation, careful snow clearing, and careful panel cleaning can help with output, but ultimately, a solar panel is a technology with no moving parts, requiring very little maintenance.
Standards
To ensure a given panel is likely to live a long life and operate as planned, it must undergo standards testing for certification. Panels are subject to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) testing, which apply to both mono- and polycrystalline panels.
EnergySage said panels that achieve IEC 61215 standard are tested for electrical characteristics like wet leakage currents, and insulation resistance. They under go a mechanical load test for both wind and snow, and climate tests that check for weaknesses to hot spots, UV exposure, humidity-freeze, damp heat, hail impact, and other outdoor exposure.

IEC 61215 also determines a panel’s performance metrics at standard test conditions, including temperature coefficient, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power output.
Also commonly seen on a panel spec sheet is the seal of Underwriters Laboratories (UL), which also provides standards and testing. UL runs climactic and aging tests, as well as the full gamut of safety tests.
Failures 
Solar panel failure happens at a low rate. NREL conducted a study of over 50,000 systems installed in the United States and 4,500 globally between the years of 2000 and 2015. The study found a median failure rate of 5 panels out of 10,000 annually.

Panel failure has improved markedly over time, as it was found that system installed between 1980 and 2000 demonstrated a failure rate double the post-2000 group.

System downtime is rarely attributed to panel failure. In fact, a study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of all solar plant downtime is a result of failing inverters, the device that converts the panel’s DC current to usable AC. pv magazine will analyze inverter performance in the next installment of this series.

Today, lithium-ion batteries dominate grid-scale energy storage deployments. This will change as solar and wind penetration exceed 30%. A bevy of pilot projects using iron-flow, nickel-hydrogen, and other technologies is giving developers, IPPs and utilities a menu of storage options beyond lithium. However, driving down the costs of grid-scale storage remains a key challenge.
At a recent webinar hosted by Reuters Events, leaders from utilities, developers and technology providers came together to discuss strategies for building cost-competitive storage systems. The speakers included Dr. Sherif Abdelrazek, director of renewable engineering at Duke Energy, Daniel Dedrick, SVP of EPC and technical operations at GridStor, and Hugh McDermott, SVP of business development at ESS Inc.
The discussion emphasized several key topics regarding technology innovation, business models, policy reforms, and supply chain optimization to reduce storage system costs.
Lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the market, especially for short-duration (2-4 hr) applications. But rising lithium prices and high penetration of renewables are driving interest in alternative chemistries. Iron-flow and nickel-hydrogen batteries are gaining traction for longer-duration needs of 5-12 hours and show promise for high cycle life and low degradation.
Abdelrazek at Duke Energy has piloted a nickel-hydrogen battery by EnerVenue, a metal-hydrogen solution provider who announced a 25 MWh project in Florida with EPC High Caliber Energy in June 2023. EnerVenue’s nickel-hydrogen battery technology, offers “ultra-long life, efficiency, and flexibility … feature[s] an expected lifetime of 30 years / 30,000 cycles, deliver 86% capacity after 30,000 cycles, and can cycle up to three times per day without rest.” EnerVenue’s battery technology benchmarked at 80% of the overall cost of ownership of lithium for 2-cycle a day use-cases, per Storlytics Energy Storage, an independent evaluator of new energy storage technologies. In the figure below, considerable cost of ownership savings can be realized with nickel-hydrogen batteries, on account of their high cycle life, despite their underperformance against lithium in self-discharge, RTE and energy density.
Duke is building community-scale microgrids – a trend which will be growing rapidly as an alternative to more transmission and distribution infrastructure. In the town of Hotsprings North Carolina, Duke installed a 2.7 MWdc solar and storage microgrid in 2019 that uses a 4 MW/4 MWh lithium-ion battery which gives the community several hours of off-grid operation in the event of a grid-outage.
On a larger scale, Gridstor developed a wholesale battery facility connected to the distribution system in Goleta CA, where outages are common and wholesale prices signal value for local flexibility. The Goleta project in Santa Barbara County uses a 60 MW / 160 MWh lithium-ion battery capable of powering the equivalent of 30,000 homes through the hours of greatest demand on the state’s power system.
Gridstor’s Daniel Dedrick commented that deployment of stand-alone storage projects has been supported by the Inflation Reduction Act stand-alone storage ITC. “As grid penetration approaches 50 plus %, the need for longer duration storage becomes vital. Figure 2 below illustrates how wind and solar penetration drives long duration energy storage.

“This is why energy storage markets have heretofore focused on 2–4-hour solutions,” explained Dedrick. As the EV industry produces innovation in lithium batteries, variations on those lithium chemistries were popularized by Panasonic, LG, Samsung, and Tesla for grid applications like peak load shaving and virtual power plants. Those ‘consumer brands’ are now being augmented with more space-aged technologies like EnerVenue’s nickel-hydrogen and ESS Inc.’s iron-flow batteries. Neither company is a household name today, but energy professionals will witness these and many other medium and long duration storage products hit a grid near them soon.
ESS’ iron flow technology was recently chosen for the Stanwell Clean Energy Hub in Queensland Australia where a 1 MW/10 MWh iron-flow battery will be part of a solar, wind, battery and hydrogen storage pilot on the campus of a 1.4 GW coal plant, Stanwell Generating Station. The project is reminiscent of Vistra Energy’s Moss Landing facility, which recently achieved 3 GWh of capacity.
Achieving cost-competitive storage is not just about cheaper batteries. Developers like Gridstor are quick to point out that interconnection wait times drive up project development costs. Utilities like Duke Energy say they welcome more collaboration with both developers and manufacturers alike to reduce the hard and soft costs of energy storage.
The value stack of storage is one of the main drivers of both technology adoption and project economics. Revenue streams remain limited today, focused on capacity, resiliency, energy arbitrage and ancillary services (e.g., frequency regulation). Policy reforms to enable additional value streams will be critical, as will co-locating storage near load centers (urban centers) rather than generation assets (mostly rural). Behind-the-meter storage for C&I customers also offers a fast-growing opportunity.
Collaboration between utilities, developers and manufacturers on transparent and accurate modeling of BESSs, standardized permitting and aligned production capacity will help optimize supply chains and manufacturing. This can reduce soft costs and prevent component shortages.
Safety and degradation risks of lithium-ion remain a concern. Alternate chemistries like iron-flow and nickel-hydrogen (which despite its name has an extremely low fire-hazard rating and has been used by NASA for decades) may ease some of these growing pains.
In summary, the industry must continue working together across the value chain to maximize storage technology performance, ensure equitable policy treatment, and deliver reliable, cost-effective systems. The growth opportunities for storage are tremendous, but realizing the full potential will require persistent innovation, open collaboration and aligned incentives.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/08/sunpower-foundation-announces-new-grants-to-increase-clean-energy-access/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2023",SunPower Foundation announces new grants to increase clean energy access,"SunPower, a solar technology service company, says fewer than 5% of domestic homes are solar-powered today. The business lists presumed high installation costs as one of the primary deterrents in a pool of 2,005 consumers surveyed.
Even with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, the residential solar storage marketplace and informational site, a report by EnergySage suggests that solar prices have steadily increased over the past two years. According to the online clean energy comparison marketplace, energy storage batteries cost slightly over $1,000. Moreover, interest rates for a 25-year loan covering a $30,000 residential solar system have doubled from 2.99% to 4.99% between the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, according to the report.
Community solar programs like Summit Ridge Energy’s rooftop project in Maryland, Va., are one way stakeholders try to make residential solar a realistic option for low-income consumers. In line with this effort, SunPower announced three new grant programs to fund 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations advancing domestic clean energy equity. 
They include: 
The grants are funded by SunPower Foundation, which is the organization’s philanthropic sector.
According to the charity, Habitat for Humanity and We Share Solar are among previous recipients. SunPower Foundation donated solar panels volunteers and money to help Habitat for Humanity design permit and install 140 panels across 13 homes in Sacramento at the start of spring this year.
In 2021 and 2022, the organization partnered with We Share Solar. This Berkeley-based nonprofit provides health workers in developing countries with solar-powered lighting communication and medical devices. The tools are intended to reduce maternal mortality. SunPower Foundation’s grant went toward teaching low-income Filipino youth how to assemble and use a suitcase solar kit during a disaster. This meant kids could light up schools community centers or refugee camps. The program was called “We Share Solar Suitcases”. 
The SunPower Foundation grants build on SunPower’s 25×25 commitments. The solar provider states the program was launched in 2021 to make clean energy accessible to all, “We want to ensure the benefits of home solar and battery storage serve American families job-seekers and businesses representing underserved communities.” The organization hopes to achieve this mission by meeting the following goals by Fiscal Year 2025. 
SunPower has identified three projects intended to actualize these goals. They include implementing a workforce development program to support domestic residential installation teams. Moreover, the company is looking to develop alternative financing options so solar is accessible to more consumers. Lastly, SunPower will establish a dealer diversity accelerator program to leverage new partnerships with women and minority-owned businesses. 
SunPower Foundation reports that it has awarded over $1 million in grants to expand domestic access to solar. Each year, qualified organizations can receive between $5000 and $100,000. 
Applications for the new grants will be accepted through October 20, and awardees will be announced at the end of this year. Those applications for clean energy education and workforce training programs targeted at underrepresented groups are encouraged to petition. Visit the SunPower FoundationJerusha to learn more.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/08/ls-energy-solutions-to-construct-large-scale-energy-storage-to-serve-caiso-market/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2023",LS Energy Solutions to construct large-scale energy storage to serve CAISO market,"LS Energy Solutions (LS-ES), a specialist in grid-connected energy storage solutions, is deploying 200 MW/400 MWh of energy storage to a site in Southern California.
Construction of the project, called Big Rock, will soon be underway and is expected to be online in the second half of 2024. The project will use 137 of the company’s AiON-ESS units, which can store energy for two-hour duration, LS-ES reports.
The AiON-ESS Energy Series is all-in-one integrated system, according to LS-ES, which uses the company’s third-generation string inverters, together with lithium-ion batteries in a single, scaleable enclosure. The AiON integrated solution is also available with lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry.
The Big Rock units have a power rating of 1.5 MW and can store 3.5 MWh. Along with tier-1 lithium-ion batteries, the 137 containers include over 1,300 of LS-ES’s modular 140 kVA AiON-SIS string inverters installed inside an air-cooled section of the container, together with a liquid-cooled DC battery compartment. LS-ES reports that the DC battery strings are aggregated in small groups to keep the DC bus voltage at lower, safer levels, and that system can operate from 200 VDC up to 1500 VDC.
As with other AiON-ESS Energy Series installations, the Big Rock installation will integrate DC and AC components inside each container and provide AC output ready to be fed into medium voltage transformers.
The Big Rock energy storage project, located in Imperial County, will provide resource adequacy (RA) and ancillary services to the CAISO market, adding to the 5.6 GW of energy storage already in place. Big Rock will be operated at 100 MW of deliverability to supply 400 MWh and meet the four-hour discharge needs of an RA contract.
The project is being developed by Gore Street Energy Storage Fund, which acquired the site in February 2023 from Avantus, which will continue to provide administrative and development services for the installation. Big Rock joins other energy storage investments by the Gore Street Energy Storage Fund in Texas, Ireland, Great Britain, and Germany.
“The Big Rock project marks GSF’s most recent acquisition, and the company’s biggest to date,” said Alex O’Cinneide, CEO of Gore Street Capital. “As the company’s first project in California, Big Rock will be an important addition to the CAISO grid, helping to deliver stability to a rapidly decarbonising energy system.”
In addition to supplying AiON-ESS containers, LS-ES also expects to provide commissioning support and operations and maintenance services for the life of the project.
LS-ES currently has over 1.5 GW and 2.5 GWh deployed across 300 projects. One of those projects, which also uses AiON-ESS storage systems, is located at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, also home to a 18.6 MW  solar installation. The U.S. Army contracted with LS-ES to help further lower the garrison’s total electricity spend, achieved through participation in frequency regulation, demand response, and energy supply markets within PJM, a wholesale electricity market. The storage system was designed to be microgrid-ready to support Army’s resiliency goals.
Visitors to RE+ 2023, taking place September 11-14 in Las Vegas, can see one of the AiON-ESS containers being used in the Big Rock project. The unit will be on display at the ACE Engineering booth at 17114, with representatives of Gore Street Capital also onsite during the event.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/08/ohm-analytics-details-a-complex-distributed-solar-market/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2023",Ohm Analytics details a complex distributed solar market,"Ohm Analytics’ second-quarter report on distributed solar generation paints a complex picture across the residential, commercial & industrial (C&I), and community solar sectors. Overall, the market expanded by 6%, buoyed by an 11% increase in residential solar, but hampered by a 24% decline in community solar. The C&I sector held its own with 7% growth.
The rise in residential solar can be attributed to two key factors. The first is a resurgence of third-party ownership, partially resulting from enhanced value stemming from the Inflation Reduction Act, but also from increasing interest rates. Additionally, California’s NEM 2.0 program, which ended on April 14 this year, led to a surge in applications and installations.

In Massachusetts, third-party ownership of residential solar projects jumped from 37% in October 2022 to 57% in July, marking a 54% increase. On a national scale, third-party entities own 25% of all residential solar installations. This number is somewhat deflated by California’s NEM 2.0 program, which had motivated private ownership.
Ohm Analytics reported an addition of 1,466 MW of residential solar capacity. In California, the growth rate was 23% year-over-year. Complementing California, the combined growth for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts stood at 29%. These gains counterbalanced sluggish markets in Arizona (down 4%), Texas (down 20%), and Florida (down 5%). The backlog from California’s NEM 2.0 is anticipated to bolster installation rates through the end of the Q4.
California’s NEM 3.0 appears to have kickstarted the energy storage attachment rate that the state envisioned, with current sales recording a 70% attachment rate.
Joseph Wyer of Ohm pointed out the rising interest rates for residential solar, with a current median APR of 4.49%. This is a significant increase from the 1.99% median APR reported in 2022. Wyer suggested that these rising finance costs are eroding the value proposition for residential solar:
I think the most interesting and clear story right now looking at the raw data is the regional financing trends, especially in the northeast.
Outside of the residential market, installation volume is more muted.
The C&I market witnessed the installation of 385 MW, marking a 7% year-over-year growth. Declines in major markets like California and New Jersey were partly offset by single digit growth in states such as Arkansas, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. Drawing on permit growth and industry feedback, Ohm Analytics projects encouraging installation figures for the C&I sector in the upcoming quarters.
Despite a 9% rise in prices to $1,093 per kWh, energy storage installation volumes in the C&I sector grew, albeit from a small base, by 52% year-over-year.
In the distributed solar sector, community solar lagged with a 24% decline in Q2. However, this was still an improvement, as it recorded 185 MW, outperforming the previous quarter’s more dismal numbers. Ohm Analytics cited interconnection challenges in Massachusetts and Maine as growth roadblocks but remains optimistic for the tail end of 2023 and the trajectory into 2024-2025.
Another challenge for the community solar market is its “solar coaster” nature; it relies on programs with limited capacity that are subject to slow-moving political developments. For example, Illinois has a lottery-based community solar market, and installations based on last year’s lottery result are just getting underway. Meanwhile, New Jersey’s community solar program has been stagnant for a year as the state prepares to launch a more permanent initiative.
These challenges suggest that the community solar market may fall short of the Biden administration’s target of 27 GW of solar by 2025.
