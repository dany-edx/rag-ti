U-M is targeting carbon neutrality for Scope 2 emissions (purchased electricity) university wide by 2025 and eliminating all Scope 1 (direct) emissions by 2040. Additionally, the City of Ann Arbor has declared a climate emergency and set a Scope 1 and 2 carbon neutrality targets for the entire city boundary by 2030.
The university is seeking information from parties that are qualified to either design, build and transfer the PV installations or to design, build, own, operate and maintain them through an energy-as-a-service model. It seeks a 20-year contract and requests to retain the right to remove or relocate installations at its own cost.
The RFI calls for 15 MW to 20 MW at its Ann Arbor campus, 1 MW to 5 MW at the Dearborn campus, and 1 MW to 5 MW at the Flint campus. Providers are welcome to bid on the entirety of the MW volume or smaller portions therein. Projects are expected to be constructed in a phased approach, with the entire portfolio planned to reach commercial operations no later than December 31, 2025.
For the Ann Arbor Campus, the University of Michigan owns and operates its own 13.2 kV and 4.8 kV electrical distribution systems. Individual building electrical usage data can be found here.
Preference will be given to goods or services manufactured or provided in the U.S. if they are competitively priced and of comparable quality, said U-M. Additional preference will be given to competitively priced goods or services manufactured or provided by Michigan businesses.
In addition to the 25 MW RFI issued by U-M, the City of Ann Arbor is seeking to procure an additional 1 MW to 2 MW of capacity through a separate request for proposals (RFP).
Campus maps identifying buildings, parking structures and lots for each university campus can be found on the following websites:
Project proposals will be selected based on the proposals alignment with scope and project objectives; relevancy and success of company’s comparable projects; individual proposed team members’ experience in working on similar projects; demonstrated adequate financial, planning and execution resources; proposed phasing of the project; transfer cost or energy purchase cost as applicable; and the firm’s philosophy regarding installation locations and interconnection to the campus system.
“This action marks the start of a process — toward renewable, sustainable power generated right here on campus — that the entire community can rally behind,” said Santa J. Ono, president, University of Michigan.
In addition to on-campus solar efforts, U-M was recently recognized by the EPA Green Power Partnership for its renewable energy use. The organization ranked U-M eighth on its quarterly Top 30 College & University List and 89th on its National Top 100 List.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/24/puerto-rico-supermarket-chain-to-add-rooftop-and-carport-solar/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,PUERTO RICO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",Puerto Rico supermarket chain to add rooftop and carport solar,"A San Juan, Puerto Rico supermarket chain has made a commitment to renewable energy by signing an energy-as-a-service agreement to install on-site solar at its eight store locations. Plaza Loíza, based in San Juan, this week became the first supermarket on the island to move forward with a rooftop solar portfolio to reduce energy costs, hedge against future electricity rate increase, and cut its carbon footprint.
Loiza’s first rooftop solar system sized at 520 kW will be installed over the coming months by Delta Energy Partners, LLC and ESCOPR, a local energy efficiency engineering firm. James Tu, chief executive officer of Delta Energy Partners, the project developer, told pv magazine USA the first solar system in Carolina, Puerto Rico uses a 290 kW rooftop array with additional carport PV systems providing 230 kW, bringing total onsite generating capacity to 520 kW.
With a number of Plaza Loiza’s markets located in shopping malls not requiring carport systems, Tu said the supermarket portfolio could see up to 5 MW total solar installations using both rooftop and carport systems.
Delta Energy is using Boviet Gamma mono bifacial PERC solar modules and Hoymiles HM series microinverters across the supermarket portfolio, Tu said.
The developer applied for a net metering permit from PREPA, Puerto Rico’s grid manager and power authority, as well as construction permits for carports at the Carolina project site, and expects to complete installation by May, with other projects across the San Juan portfolio to follow.
Including energy audits, installation, and a 25-year maintenance agreement, the Carolina, P.R. supermarket project requires no upfront capital investment from Plaza Loíza, which will pay for solar energy at a significantly lower rate than what local power company Luma Energy currently charges, according to Delta Energy Partners. Luma is a consortium made up of Canadian firm Atco Energy and Quanta Services.
“We are thrilled to work with DEP and ESCOPR to bring solar power to our properties and stores, starting at the Metropolis shopping center in Carolina,” said Ferdysac Márquez, president of Plaza Loiza. “This project, using the EaaS model, will significantly reduce our carbon footprint, helping us achieve our goal to be more friendly to our environment and decrease our energy cost, at a time when Puerto Rico’s power rate is already high and continues to increase.”
Puerto Rico could be an epitome of what’s coming for the global energy transition, Tu told pv magazine USA. The island relies heavily on fossil fuel for its power source and following increased frequency and severity of climate change-linked storms, creates a huge opportunity for distributed generation resources such as rooftop solar and energy efficiency solutions.
In addition, Puerto Rico’s electric rate costs continue to rise, with a seven time increase over the last 18 months due to the privatization of Puerto Rico’s transmission and generation assets, which now reflect the true cost of maintenance and upgrade for the power infrastructure, Tu said.
The Puerto Rico commonwealth’s January 2022 bankruptcy exit led to the U.S. Financial Oversight and Management Board overseeing its finances, making it harder for the local government to continue to subsidize utility cost increases across the island. Climate change and the island government’s solvency have forced residents and businesses to seek energy efficiency and solar energy.
Delta Energy Partners, based in Fort Lee, N.J., has provided energy as a service solutions to Puerto Rico commercial and government entities since 2014, though its business saw multiple disruptions between 2018 and 2022 due to Hurricane Maria and the COVID-19 pandemic, Tu said.
The company chose Puerto Rico to provide Net Zero Building solutions, from energy efficient LED lighting to distributed energy such as rooftop solar projects, Tu said.
With a no-money down cost structure, Delta Energy and ESCOPR are paving the way for more island grocery stores and retailers to deploy onsite solar systems. The partnership between Plaza Loíza, Delta Energy and ESCOPR is just one of many examples of collaboration in the island aimed at promoting clean energy and reducing energy costs.
Energy Resilience Relief
This week the U.S. Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office released a Request for Information (RFI) to gather feedback from stakeholders in Puerto Rico on how to allocate $1 billion managed through the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF).
After recent hurricanes and decades of underinvestment in the island’s electric grid, the new funding will be developed to increase energy resilience and reduce the energy burden on the Caribbean island’s vulnerable residents. The investment also aligns with Puerto Rico’s public energy policy to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050 as well as the Biden Administration’s commitment to improving the island’s energy system.
The PR-ERF package will be managed by the Grid Deployment Office in consultation with the Federal Energy Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
The agency is requesting information from Puerto Rican stakeholders about both short- and long-term energy solutions including residential rooftop solar deployment, community and critical service energy resilience, non-profit partnerships, and workforce training to sustain the island’s clean energy economy.
Feedback for the PR-ERF process, including identifying priority energy technologies and solutions, eligibility, funding structure, and timing, can be provided to government stakeholders by April 21 at 5 p.m. ET by emailing: PuertoRicoGDO@hq.doe.gov. Initial funding from the program is expected to be administered by the end of 2023.
**A Luma Energy spokesman responded to pv magazine USA by e-mail on Feb. 27, 2023, saying the company has not raised or proposed to raise customer rates in Puerto Rico. The spokesman said Luma Energy  has no control over how rising fuel prices may directly impact customer rates or bills, which are exclusively set by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau (PREB).  Additionally, Luma Energy supports renewable energy growth in the Puerto Rico commonwealth, including connecting 42,000 P.R. residents to rooftop solar, adding over 270 MW of renewable electricity to the grid, among other initiatives which include shorter interconnection times, distributed energy systems and connecting a 27 MW wind farm to the P.R. grid following Hurricane Maria.

The Silfab Elite 410 BG features a proprietary x-pattern technology that combines an integrated cell design with a conductive backsheet, leading to gains in efficiency and power. The module provides 410 W, a module efficiency of 21.4%, and a max system voltage of 1000 Vdc.
The mono-PERC module measures 73.4 in x 40.5 in x 1.4 in and weighs about 45 lbs. It is rated to handle a maximum surface load for wind and snow of 112.8 lbs. per square foot and a 1-inch hail impact resistance of 52 mph.
The frame is an anodized aluminum black frame, and it contains a multilayer, integrated insulation film and electrically conductive backsheet with strong demonstrated hydrolysis and UV resistance.
The product comes with a 25-year product workmanship warranty and a 30-year linear power performance guarantee. Performance is guaranteed at ≥ 97.1% at the end of year one, ≥ 91.6% by the end of year 12, and ≥ 82.6% at the end of year 30.
“With its all-black sleek look, Elite provides the aesthetics homeowners have been looking for,” said Paolo Maccario, chief executive officer, Silfab.
Silfab also introduced the Elite 380-BK, a module with back-contact technology that minimizes front-cell metallization, cutting down on conductive losses, mechanical stress, and shading, improving production. The 380 W module has a 21.4% efficiency and a sleek black-on-black look.
Maccario said the modules are a result of the company’s 40-year record of technological and engineering experience. “Elite puts American solar products back on top,” said Maccario.
In August 2021, a year before the announcement of the domestic manufacturing incentive-packed IRA, Silfab announced it will double down on its manufacturing footprint in the United States. The company announced it began shipping products from a Burlington, Washington, production facility north of Seattle. The company said the facility doubled its manufacturing capacity, bringing the total to 800 MW.
Silfab said that cell sorting, glass washing, soldering, and cell alignment are all automated processes, something that the company said leads to its products having low defect rates. The company is primarily known for its back-contact and mono PERC PV modules for North American residential and commercial markets.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/24/the-extended-value-and-growing-importance-of-community-solar/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",The extended value and growing importance of community solar,"On average, Americans paid 14.3% more for electricity in 2022 than in 2021, and the Energy Information Administration believes those costs are only going to go up. Turning to solar is a viable path for some to power their home and cut costs. But, putting solar on your roof isn’t an option for everyone – some might live in apartment units or crowded cities, or simply can’t afford the upfront costs required.
Community solar presents a promising way for residents, companies, and municipalities alike, to reduce their carbon footprint and electricity bills costs, while promoting a clean energy transition.  As such, awareness around community solar continues to increase in cities across the country, so much so that President Biden hopes for 700% community solar growth by 2025.
Let’s take a look at where community solar has evolved, and how it can continue to flourish in the future.
Adoption in urban areas and municipalities
Even with its realized potential, community solar still faces headwinds, especially land use concerns in various markets. Most projects are currently developed in greenfield settings, since it’s easy to site and is more cost effective to deploy arrays of ground mounted canopies. States with more mature programs, such as New York, incentivize more difficult and cost-intensive developments on brownfield sites or canopies over parking lots in order to diversify site design and encourage the incorporation of community solar into urban landscapes.
Normally, community solar deployed in urban environments – such as multiple rooftop, garage top, carport, and ground mounts spread across a city – is costly to implement and permit, and requires more diligence and engineering. But, for states and local governments who are opening their eyes to this idea, the value is significant. These projects not only provide energy cost savings to local residents, businesses, and the municipality, but it also helps them reach sustainability targets, increase reliability for facilities powered by these systems, and avoid developing on land that can be used for other applications. Additionally, with these projects generally owned and maintained by the solar developer, it can offer the municipality a revenue stream through lease payments received from the developer/asset owner for hosting the system.
Take the recently completed project for the City of White Plains, New York – 6.8 megawatts (MW) of community solar were deployed at nine different sites across the city, including rooftop, garage top, ground mounts, and a landfill solar installation. The project provided local residents and businesses a 10% discount on their energy bills, while also providing the city with a projected $1M of value annually through the discounted energy and lease payments. Urban community solar deployments may be more rare to come by now, but will no doubt grow in adoption as their value is realized and land use concerns continue to take hold.
More inclusive of low-to-moderate income groups
Historically, accessibility of community solar for low-to-moderate income (LMI) residents has been a roadblock. LMI residents are often renters or aren’t able to put solar on their roof due to high upfront costs or the unwillingness for residential developers to lease panels. Community solar seems like the obvious solution, but LMI residents oftentimes aren’t eligible to subscribe to community solar projects because programs have traditionally used FICO scores – with minimum score requirements in the 650-700 range – to determine eligibility.
However, recent advances in community solar programs and policy are changing this. The Inflation Reduction Act will also include specific incentives for community solar located in LMI communities and serving a majority of LMI residents. California recently passed a bill to create a community solar program that ensures at least 51% of subscribers are low-income.
Not only is there incentive to cater projects to LMI residents, but financial structures of projects are also shifting to become more inclusive and accommodating of these communities. FICO scores have been the most comfortable underwriting criteria for banks funding these projects, but the industry is realizing that it’s an imperfect metric that doesn’t fairly determine whether a resident will be a good community solar customer. More developers are educating investors to get them comfortable with alternative data-driven methods of determining eligibility, such as historical default rates or prior utility bill payment history, that ultimately increase eligibility across the potential subscriber pool.
Big businesses are hopping on board
More retailers, including big-box stores, and corporations have been eager to take part in community solar. T-Mobile, Dollar Tree, and Walmart are just three examples of large  businesses realizing the numerous benefits community solar has to offer.
Cost-effectiveness certainly plays a role, but it’s also practically a business imperative to commit to cleaner practices. More than 90% of S&P 500 companies publish environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reports in some form. Although companies can host their own project on-site, not every store location or office building is big enough to support a community solar program. Being the first major U.S. telecom to sign the RE100 commitment, T-Mobile turns to community solar – helping develop and subscribing to off-site projects as an anchor tenant – to help meet the company’s ESG benchmarks, offset energy usage, and offer clean energy to surrounding communities.
It is also a clear indicator of how large retailers are supporting the community around them. Oftentimes, with large retailers or companies serving as an anchor tenant in a community solar project, it not only helps get the project off the ground and implemented, but it also provides financial security to investors, opening the door for more lenient eligibility requirements for other subscribers, such as LMI residents.
How to keep community solar growing
Incentives for implementing community solar are dropping, and that needs to change. Many newer community solar markets are heavily scrutinizing incentives or are looking to cut them drastically. Those incentives are critical for the future of these programs, and without them, it is more difficult for states to reach the energy goals they want to achieve, while building creative, aesthetically pleasing projects that they value.
To continue growth, local policymakers need to start incentivizing the types of installations their communities want to see. The IRA will help with that — it created the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that will set aside billions of dollars to provide competitive grants for clean energy projects like community solar, with an emphasis on those that benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities.
To sustain the buzz around community solar, solar developers will need to continue educating their customers (retailers, commercial real estate, corporations, etc.) on the value it provides. Municipalities will also need to continue to lead the way in developing and creating projects that allow everyone to realize the potential of solar. It is an exciting time for community solar, but strategic cost incentives will be necessary to help the market expand and bring economic and environmental benefits to communities and businesses across the nation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/24/u-s-solar-developers-take-on-module-manufacturing-risk/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",U.S. Solar developers take on module manufacturing risk,"Since the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), more than ten companies have announced roughly between 50 and 80 GW of solar silicon, wafer, cell, and module manufacturing capacity in the United States. The Solar Energy Industries Association’s roadmap optimistically targets 50 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity. As a result, some analysts see the potential for the USA to emerge as a strong export market for solar panels.
This is hard evidence that just a bit of refined industrial policy – the IRA in this case – can have a massive effect on local business, and national security.

One new development is the participation of solar developers in solar module assembly factories. Their involvement is motivated by the need to secure module capacity, as well to meet the ‘Made in America’ criteria for products. Meeting this criteria is important, because projects that meet the requirement are eligible for the Inflation Reduction Act’s 10% Investment Tax Credit adder.
This is the opposite of what has happened in the past, when module manufacturers like Canadian Solar, First Solar, and Hanwha got into the development side of things.
Here are a few examples of developers that will soon be partnering with manufacturing modules:
Meyer Burger expanded its Arizona facility to 3 GW/year of manufacturing capacity, signing a deal for 3.75 GW of modules from 2024 to 2029 with one of the USA’s largest developers – DE Shaw Renewable Investments. It was specifically noted that DE Shaw will pay a “substantial annual down payment” to help Meyer Burger fund the production capacity required to meet such delivery requirements. The facility – prior to this partnership – had a proposed capacity of 1 GW/year.
It seems that First Solar is investing mainly as a result of being in such high demand. As of Feb. 2023, we believe they are sold out through the end of 2025. The company recently announced a new factory that can manufacture 3.5 GWdc of modules per year, and will come online in 2025. That’s in addition to an expansion of 0.9 GWdc/year at existing facilities.
A few months after the announcement, the company signed a deal – starting in 2025 – for 4.9 GW of capacity over a five year period. That deal would account for 28% of the factory’s output for its first five years.
 

Active (not planned) solar manufacturing sites. Source: Department of Energy
In 2022, a few months before the signing of the IRA, six solar developers – AES, Clearway Energy Group, Cypress Creek Renewables, and D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments – put out a Request for Proposals for USA based manufacturers of solar modules to supply 7 GW of solar modules per year starting in 2024.
In October 2022, we even saw a solar panel manufacturer,  Solaria, merge with a solar installation company, Complete Solar, to form a new company called Compete Solaria. This news was met with disdain by some in the residential solar installation market as access to Solaria’s products was made more complex, but the move makes sense for a residential installation company that wants to lock in high-quality product at a reasonable price.
Even back as far as 2018, we saw the developer-module connection happen when Jinko Solar built a manufacturing facility in Jacksonville, Florida, signing a deal with the nation’s largest renewable energy firm, NextEra, for the entire output of that factory.
Different economic models are driving solar panel manufacturing in the United States than in China, so it is no surprise to see these sort of hybrid relationships developing. Partnerships like these are about more than helping the manufacturing companies finance the factories, they also help energy development firms lock down the modules they need – at a reasonable price, and without the challenges or risks of importing.

This report tracks quarterly and annual volumes of orders, wafer material shipments and customer allocations.
REC Silicon
REC Silicon (Oslo: RECSI) posted lower Q4 2022 revenue of $31.6 million revenue compared to $43.2 million in Q4 2021 revenue, while the company’s negative EBITDA of $23.6 million widened from negative $400,000 in the previous year’s quarter.  EBITDA is a common business financial earnings metric that represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are calculated.
The company’s widening loss is attributed to record high energy costs and decreases in polysilicon production combined with lower shipments of Silicon Gases.
REC Silicon gas sales volumes for the quarter were 515 metric tons, down 31.3% from 750 metric tons sold a year ago. Total polysilicon sales volumes for the quarter were 302 metric tons, down 37% compared to 481 metric tons a year ago.
On its earnings call, chief executive officer Kurt Levens said the relaunch of REC’s Moses Lake, Wash., first production target remains unchanged with production on schedule for Q4 2023, with all required activities progressing on schedule.
REC Silicon recently executed a binding term sheet with Hanwha Solutions for the supply of polysilicon silane from the Moses Lake facility. The term sheet calls for a 10-year take or pay fixed agreement for 100% offtake of prime granular polysilicon produced at the facility. Under the agreement, the company will have a minimum and maximum price threshold, providing “pricing flexibility and guardrails” under the supply agreement, as well as prepayment for contract security, Levens said on the earnings call. The company has more than 50% of project execution commitments in place, with the project advancing through construction through the middle of this year.
REC Silicon projected $100 million to $300 million run-rate EBITDA for the Moses Lake facility, which if launched would bring the company back to positive EBITDA generation.
Sunrun
Sunrun’s (Nasdaq: RUN) revenue increased to $609.2 million in Q4 2022, up 40% from $435.2 million in revenue produced a year ago. The solar installer also placed 33,359 customers into service this quarter, with its total count of 797,296 customers representing a 21% year over year growth.
Total revenue increased to $2.32 billion in FY 2022, representing a 44% increase from $1.61 billion of total revenue generated in FY 2021.
In the recent quarter, Sunrun added 275.4 MW of solar capacity, an increase of 25.2% from the 220 MW of solar capacity brought online in Q4 2021.
For 2023, management expects solar capacity installed growth to be in a range of 10% to 15% for the full year.
Sunnova Energy International
Sunnova’s  (NYSE:NOVA) revenue increased to $195.6 million in Q4 2022, up 200% from $65 million in revenue produced in the year ago quarter. The solar installer also placed a record number of 33,000 customers into service this quarter, bringing its yearly total to 87,000 for FY 2022.
The company more than doubled its revenue year over year, to $558 million for FY 2022, from $242 million in 2021.
“This strong growth trend has carried into 2023, increasing our confidence in our ability to meet or exceed our 2023 guidance targets,” said John Berger, chief executive officer. “We continue to increase our total addressable market and market share.”
Sunnova reaffirmed 2023 guidance of adding 115k – 125k customers.

But with the intermittency of renewables like wind and solar,  energy storage systems are required to ensure reliability. As states increasingly declare decarbonization goals, they will need to create new policies, rules and regulations that will enable the deployment of an unprecedented amount of energy storage, according to the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA), which just released its States Energy Storage Policy: Best Practices for Decarbonization report.
CESA published the report jointly with Sandia National Laboratories, and it highlights best practices, identifies barriers, and underscores the urgent need to expand state energy storage policymaking to support decarbonization in the U.S. The report is based on findings in a 2022 survey of the states leading in decarbonization goals and programs, and it looks at key state energy storage policy priorities and a series of case studies show the challenges encountered by some of the leading states.
The state survey distribution resulted in 22 responses from 14 states plus the District of Columbia. The following states were represented in the survey responses:

An industry survey was also completed by representatives of six energy storage development companies, plus one industry consultant who formerly worked for an energy storage development company:  Enel North America, Key Capture Energy, New Leaf Energy (formerly Borrego), Nostromo Energy, Sunrun, and Tesla.
At the time the study was conducted, 22 states (plus the District of Columbia) adopted decarbonization goals, however, not all have set policy for energy storage deployment. California and New York are cited as examples of states with “very advanced and sophisticated policy measures”. Many others are beginning to assess energy storage policy needs.
What motivates a state to develop energy storage policy? The Best Practices report says it varies. Regulated utilities may request regulatory action because they are seeking to recover the costs of their investments in energy storage. Third-party developers may have found gaps in interconnection rules or valuation standards that the regulatory commission needs to address. And also the process of energy planning at the executive or legislative level may require policy decisions in order to meet the state’s clean energy goals.
The report outlines the four steps to policy development from Level 1, which is demonstrated interest in storage up to the fourth “maturity level” of including storage in strategic plans, and ranks the states by level of maturity. California, Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey and New York had all achieved Level 4.
Those states that are just beginning the process have cited a few reasons for their delays in developing storage policy and programs. These include lack of clarity as to which cases are best suited for storage, a belief that storage may become more important later in their process, ongoing best practices assessments, and cost.
Another observation of the study shows that even states with advanced decarbonization goals still struggle with whether and how to deploy storage, especially with the challenge of bringing it to scale within the state’s decarbonization timeframe.
The report found commonalities as to what the states will include in their future energy infrastructures:
The authors caution that this report “highlights early stage results in a highly changeable field.” The study found, for example, that different states face different challenges. Some operate in very different energy markets and regulatory environments, for example. The consensus among respondents is that energy storage is key to hitting decarbonization goals. With fewer than half the leading decarbonization states having set an energy storage procurement goal, there is much more work to be done. But as more states develop energy storage programs to support their decarbonization goals, best practices are emerging that other states can emulate.
A March 23 webinar will summarize findings from the survey. Developed on behalf of the Energy Storage Technology Advancement Partnership (ESTAP), which is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity, managed by Sandia National Laboratories, and administered by the Clean Energy States Alliance.
