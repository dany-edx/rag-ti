The incentives to drive hundreds of gigawatts of renewable energy generation capacity nationwide remain hampered by cumbersome, lengthy permitting processes. Environmental permitting and community engagement still prove tricky, say industry insiders, as developers bid to scale 50 MW projects to 500 MW.
Groups ranging from the White House to rural electric cooperatives are lobbying the Senate and Congress to streamline permitting for big solar and electricity transmission infrastructure.
The concerns regarding permitting and approvals were echoed by Sarah Ladislaw, senior director for climate and energy at the U.S. National Security Council, speaking at the 2023 BloombergNEF Summit held in New York in April. She noted up to 75% of new renewables projects entering permitting don’t reach the interconnection queue due to antiquated, overlapping permissions processes.
On May 10, the White House submitted a memorandum calling on Congress to pass comprehensive federal permitting legislation, backing up the IRA’s $369 billion of clean power spending with a move that will, however, also speed fossil fuel plant permitting.
The memorandum calls for community engagement in project siting, removing redundancy and duplication in environmental permitting, and reforming the interconnection process which can leave facilities waiting four years or more for a grid connection.
Carol Ho, an environmental engineer at Denver-based technical adviser E3 Consulting, says the memorandum proposes increasing the permitting workforce to reduce waiting time and would also include data compilation measures to speed permitting across similar asset classes.
“I think many agency personnel would say that they have been trying to implement these types of measures for a long time, and have been successful to an extent but require more staff and funding,” she says.
The White House move followed an open letter to Senate leaders Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell calling on the upper house to conduct hearings and draft legislation to modernize federal US infrastructure permitting. The call was made by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), a collective of more than 900 rural electric providers.
Impact statements
The lobbyists are targeting the framework of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) which implements environmental impact statement (EIS) for large power transmission and generation projects.
A 500 MW solar project on federal land or an interstate high voltage, direct current power line typically requires four and a half years to obtain an EIS and a quarter of such projects need six years.
Not all solar projects require a federal EIS but E3’s Ho says state and local permitting is equally drawn out. Six months can be needed to get agency responses and arrange biologist, archaeologist, and conservation site visits to check for rare bat species, bird migration routes, wetlands reviews, consider historical site preservation concerns, and compile vegetation management studies, says Ho. That means the resulting back and forth can take 12 months to 18 months for a multi-thousand acre site, she adds.
Most eastern seaboard regions require a mandatory year to secure wetland permits at a state level, Ho says, stretching permitting to two years-plus before federal and municipal requirements.
“It’s because utility scale solar development is a new technology and this (NEPA) is an existing law that’s been around since the 1970s,” explains the environmental engineer. “These laws weren’t written when 50 MW wind turbines or solar farms were being sited. E3 has not seen any type of permitting reform that could expedite these steps.”
Cities and counties are responding, Ho says, with local authorities updating urban-planning zoning maps and community development plans to identify where solar infrastructure would be permissible.
Streamlining efforts
In 2020, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo streamlined permitting for renewables projects in New York state with a generation capacity of at least 25 MW. The Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act provided a single forum – run by the Office of Renewable Energy Siting – for early-stage community engagement; state and municipal consultation; application reviews; draft permitting; and hearings, decisions, and compliance.
Hecate Energy – with its 3,000-acre, 500 MW Cider Solar farm in the towns of Elba and Oakfield – in June 2022 became the first applicant to benefit from the process. The application was filed in May 2021 with the 13-month permitting process dubbed “light speed” by Hecate Senior VP of Environmental and Permitting, Diane Sullivan. Just over 12 months was needed to get from permitting to the interconnection stage, even if Sullivan pointed out the process remains challenging and costly in New York.
Hecate engaged early on with community members in the two towns in the west of the state, Sullivan said, something developers can be prone to overlook. From day one, the developer had open dialogue with town supervisors and held open house events and one-on-one meetings with officials to address concerns such as visual impact and potential “change in community character.”
Developers can pay $250,000 in annual fees for “critical issues analysis” environmental reports for projects that never take shape, according to Robin Laine, co-founder and CEO of environmental permitting data software specialist Transect. Hecate’s Sullivan says community engagement is a small price to pay for the success of big projects in states that are “open for business” for solar.
Community approval
Convincing a myriad of state and town residents that a multi-hundred-megawatt capacity solar project is right for their town or county is no small feat. Across many farming communities, residents see solar projects as industrial-scale intrusions that could shake up community character, chiefly around agriculture land use, Sullivan adds.
Solar continues to be a tough sell to farmers. Sullivan says the incentive available from co-locating utility scale solar on land shared with a farmer presents a 30-year shared revenue source with the landowner. Not including the rise in agrivoltaics or shared farming-plus-solar generation techniques, Sullivan presents the opportunity of returning the land to the farm owner in better condition than when the project was installed, which is a driver to successfully winning over rural stakeholders in the permitting and early stages of project development.
The software developed by Transect removes most of the “what-if” variables at the environmental permitting stage which could preclude a solar company from proceeding to site development, according chief executive Laine. “The folks we see interacting most with communities are our community and utility solar partners,” she says. “Once the developer has chosen a site and gets to land permitting, our package covers all the grounds for moving forward to interconnection. It’s about open communication and candor with the community.”
Transect’s automated environmental reports and early-stage solutions can save developers up to 18 months of the permitting process cycle, Laine says, enabling developers to stick with project sites because the multitude of permitting boxes have already been checked.
A former environmental consultant, Laine said one wish-list item would be to have a “low-impact” designated region, or map system, for renewable projects and their supporting infrastructure, highlighting areas of lower permitting friction, with programmatic NEPA reviews. This would put the onus on the federal NEPA framework as well as the Bureau of Land Management and other federal land agencies to identify areas where they would prefer to develop renewables projects and essentially “pre-permit” facilities in those areas.
A process like that could fast-track renewables in a proactive way by focusing proposed development in areas with the least environmental and permitting friction, Laine adds.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/16/rapid-growth-in-u-s-solar-market-requires-new-approaches-to-project-delivery/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 16, 2023",Rapid growth in U.S. solar market requires new approaches to project delivery,"According to recent forecasts, the solar market will triple in size over the next five years, amounting to a total installed solar capacity of 378 GW by 2028. However, this rapid growth brings some challenges, as noted in “Build Together: Rethinking solar project delivery,” released by McKinsey. The report notes that the solar industry faces significant construction and labor shortages that could worsen over the next three to five years, and demand for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) will also grow rapidly.
Based on McKinsey’s analysis, to serve utility-scale solar projects, EPC capacity would have to almost triple to meet the anticipated demand of approximately 50 GW installed in 2027. Instead, the report suggests rethinking traditional practices around project delivery.
To capture the potential value of U.S. renewables, estimated at $700 to $800 billion in capital investments to build onshore wind and solar projects through 2030, EPCs “should establish new approaches to partnerships, risk ownership and contracting, workforce development, and digital and technology adoption,” the report contends.
EPC and labor shortages are a top challenge for renewables players. The report notes that these challenges have overtaken other obstacles such as limited access to land and permits, inflation and commodity price volatility, and interconnection. As a result, collaboration is key and will be achieved through strategic partnerships, risk ownership and contracting, workforce development, and digital and technology adoption. One recommendation in the report is for EPCs and developers to work more closely together, integrating engineering times and promoting transparency on pricing and risk.

By making such changes, the market could shift to new contracting structures where EPCs and developers could pursue portfolio partnerships. Both parties would be incentivized to take on supply chain and workforce challenges. According to the report, leading developers have locked in capacity with two or three core EPC partners on average, which brings benefits to both sides. Such partnerships can range from nonbinding relationship-based commitments to formal master service agreements with bilateral contractual commitments. But the overall benefit is that both partners share common objectives, such as increased visibility and joint planning of project pipelines, early engineering involvement and continuous improvement of designs, and collaborative workforce attraction and development programs.
The McKinsey report indicates that rapid market growth opens the door to new players in the renewables industry. For example, regulated utilities are increasingly interested in developing renewables to take advantage of the alternative Solar Production Tax Credit within the Inflation Reduction Act. Diversified EPCs are also expanding into solar. And local and regional contractors of all types are being retrained as solar installers, thus entering the woefully deficient solar workforce.
As partnerships are formed and both risk and opportunity are shared, stakeholders will have to shift their contracting approach to streamline project delivery and reduce disruptions to agreements. Contracting itself will become more collaborative as the stakeholders adjust to sharing the responsibilities and challenges. The report notes that collaborative contracting is used in other capital-intensive industries, where pilots have improved both costs and schedules by 15% to 20% versus traditional contracts, according to prior McKinsey research.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/16/with-18-gw-solar-southeast-us-nears-us-average-solar-generation/,"MARKETS,RESEARCH,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 16, 2023","With 18 GW solar, Southeast U.S. nears U.S. average solar generation","The seven-state Southeast region now has 18 GW of operating solar, providing 4.4% of generation, and is projected to reach almost 40 GW of solar by 2026. Three states in the region are projected to reach solar generation of 9% to 13% by 2026.
The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) presented the data in its “Solar in the Southeast” report and an associated webinar.
The Southeast is almost level with the 4.7% solar generation for the U.S. as a whole, as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Utility-scale solar in the Southeast, both historic and forecasted, is shown in blue on the chart below, and dominates distributed solar, shown in yellow.

The seven-state region covered by the report consists of Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia  and Florida.
Florida leads
Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina are projected to reach solar generation of 13%, 10% and 9% by 2026, respectively. The growth trends and forecasts for all states are shown in the image below.

Florida’s sharp solar growth trend reflects the “Real Zero” plan of Florida utility FPL and its parent company NextEra Energy, said SACE Executive Director Stephen Smith on the webinar. FPL has “put on the table” 93 GW of solar by 2045, Smith said, representing “the most ambitious commitment to solar of any utility in our region, and we think in the country.” That plan “has completely changed what everybody thinks is possible, and I think it is going to become the norm” for solar.
The region’s best market for distributed solar is also Florida, because the state still has net metering, said SACE Solar Program Director Bryan Jacob on the webinar. Other Southeastern states do not have net metering, or at least not “true” net metering, he said. Duke Energy is instituting netting for solar customers within time of use periods, he noted, while Alabama Power “charges a penalty” to customers with solar.
“Net metering is the right policy mechanism to drive distributed solar in its infancy,” Jacob said. Countering a “cost shift” argument that says distributed solar increases costs for non-solar customers, Jacob said that won’t become an issue until “we get around 10%” solar generation, referencing a Berkeley Lab study.
Jacob said federal policies under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) had “turbocharged” the Southeast’s solar progress, as some utilities have already reflected the IRA’s tax credits for renewables in their resource plans, and others would do the same. Jacob said the IRA’s New ERA program, which provides the equivalent of renewable tax credits to nonprofit rural electric co-operatives, “could be the most transformational program for rural America since the Rural Electrification Act in 1936.”
Not keeping pace
Still, some Southeastern states “are not keeping pace,” said Jacob, pointing to Alabama, Tennessee, and Mississippi.
Smith explained that several Southeast utilities are not yet considering solar “as a workhorse resource.” When solar is combined with storage, “the numbers are absolutely in the money for solar going forward,” he said. “This is where planning is so important,” he said, noting that some utilities are planning to build peaking gas plants and use “assumptions around that,” or are pursuing small modular reactors. Once early investments are made in such technologies, “it’s really hard to claw some of those decisions back,” he said.
“They’re making the wrong bets,” Smith said. “We saw it with [Georgia’s nuclear plant] Vogtle, we’re going to see it again with TVA and their small modular reactors,” and with utilities that “are still building gas plants, even though we know we’ve got to move away from fossil gas. And until those utilities have that shift in leadership thinking, and properly plan, they’re going to continue to miss the mark, and customers are ultimately going to suffer.”
Jacob said customers would suffer “because the utility commissions tend to let the utilities get rate recovery for their mistakes. They’re basically making those big bets with other people’s money.”
Smith challenged the “inappropriate” planning process of Tennessee’s federal utility TVA, saying that TVA does not follow the standard practice for integrated resource plans (IRPs) of allowing outside parties to challenge planning assumptions and submit expert testimony. Instead, TVA is “self-selecting a very narrow group of players” to participate, he said, and “most of the folks that serve on the IRP review group for TVA are not technically able to deal with the detail associated with the planning assumptions.”
Looking ahead
SACE Research Director Maggie Shober said on the webinar that in the coming year Duke Energy will file its first IRPs for North Carolina and South Carolina to be aligned with the utility’s carbon plan. Shober added that transmission planning initiatives, which could enable interconnection of more solar to the grid, are being conducted by Duke Energy’s North Carolina utility, by the North Carolina Transmission Planning Collaborative, and by the Southeast Regional Transmission Planning initiative.
SACE included data on more than 400 Southeastern utilities in an appendix to its report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/16/virtual-power-plants-roll-out-across-the-u-s/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 16, 2023",Virtual power plants roll out across the U.S.,"VPP pilot programs have run for years in the United States. The market is maturing as the technology competes with centralized utility scale power plants as a low-cost alternative with benefits to the grid and end-users alike.
A VPP is a virtual aggregation of small-scale, distributed energy resources (DERs) including PV, energy storage, electric vehicle chargers, and demand-responsive devices such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances. VPP technology has shown immediate promise in replacing natural gas “peaker plants” on grids, offering additional capacity during times of peak electricity demand.
Over the last decade, the US has spent more than $120 billion on 100 GW of new generation capacity, mainly for resource adequacy. A study by Boston-based consultancy Brattle Group estimates utilities could save $35 billion by 2033 by focusing on VPPs for peaker capacity.
“By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants,” says Jigar Shah, the director of the US Department of Energy (DoE) Loans Programs Office.
Brattle Group’s 400 MW resource adequacy study considered a utility with 1.7 million residential customers. The power company had 5.7 GW of gross peak demand and 3.6 GW of net peak demand from solar and wind resources. Its aim was to generate half its electricity from renewables by 2030. The study found VPP peaker usage would be 40% to 60% cheaper than alternatives, including gas peakers and grid-scale batteries.
Brattle Group estimated 60 GW of VPP deployment could meet US resource adequacy needs through 2033 for $15 billion to $35 billion less than the cost of alternatives. That level of VPP deployment could also provide more than $20 billion worth of emissions and resilience benefits over the decade.
“VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large scale and utility grade alternative to new generation and system buildout, through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives,” says Shah.
Project Hestia
The DoE Loan Programs Office has supported VPPs, recently proposing a $3 billion conditional loan to energy-as-a-service provider Sunnova to roll out its “Project Hestia” nationwide. The plan aims to increase solar and VPP service access for disadvantaged communities that could otherwise be unable to secure residential solar loans. Sunnova will receive indirect, partially guaranteed cash flows for loans backing customer accounts.
Eligible households must use Sunnova’s energy management system, accessible via smartphones or other electronic devices. The system will recommend demand response behavior, enabling customers to reduce energy costs while helping balance the grid during peak demand.
If issued, the DoE package would support loan origination for solar, storage, and other Sunnova adaptive home technology with VPP capability. The guarantees could drive up to $5 billion in loan originations, saving on interest and reducing the weighted average cost of capital.
“Project Hestia would make possible a historic private sector investment in disadvantaged American communities and energy infrastructure,” says Sunnova CEO William J. Berger.
Market tailwinds
Shifting US market conditions are further driving VPP adoption. The $369 billion of climate and energy spending in the Inflation Reduction Act includes many requirements for serving energy communities: disadvantaged communities crucial to an equitable energy transition. Projects in designated energy communities are eligible for an additional 10% investment tax credit, supplementing the 30% base credit for renewables projects.
Other states are beginning to follow California in trimming back or removing net energy metering (NEM), a rate mechanism instrumental in launching the US residential solar market. Older NEM rates offered customers the full retail value for every kilowatt-hour of electricity fed to the grid. California’s NEM 3.0 rate essentially kills the value of exported energy and other states will follow suit. Solar installers have warned this could prompt a market based on self-consumption from batteries, with resulting grid defection doing little to help network flexibility. VPPs, however, offer grid services including demand response, peak demand shaving, and more. Customers can be incentivized to trim energy use or export power during peak grid hours, making for a nimbler network.
Resilience
VPPs also reinforce grid resilience in zones affected by climate change-related extreme weather. Residential solar installer Sunrun has been selected to deploy a 17 MW network of solar-plus-storage VPPs in Puerto Rico.
In the wake of 2017’s Hurricane Maria, the Caribbean island’s government created a framework for DERs with 2019’s Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act.
Sunrun will enroll Puerto Rican customers this year to begin VPP operation next year. The company says customers will bank power cost savings and be compensated for offering battery storage capacity to the grid now run by US-Canadian joint venture LUMA Energy. The 10-year VPP program enables customers to opt out, Sunrun says.
“We’re solving energy insecurity on the island by switching the model so that solar energy is generated on rooftops and stored in batteries to power each home and then shared with neighbors, creating a clean, shared-energy economy,” says Sunrun CEO Mary Powell.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/16/solar-plus-storage-microgrids-minimize-power-shutoffs-during-wildfires/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,CALIFORNIA,OREGON,WASHINGTON",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 16, 2023",Solar-plus-storage microgrids minimize power shutoffs during wildfires,"Recent studies have proposed using solar-plus-storage microgrids to minimize public safety concerns from power shutoffs (PSPS) during the wildfire season for communities located in  wildland-urban interfaces, such as California and much of the West Coast.
A comprehensive assessment of microgrids had not been performed to evaluate the potential to enhance resilience for up to 46 million Americans living next to forests, or a wildland-urban interface, where wildfire risk is acute. To address this research gap, a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory looked at a novel modeling framework and assessed the potential of solar and batteries for districts where power can be turned off based on wildfire warnings.
LBNL’s modeling framework consists of:
LBNL defines a microgrid as a controllable and localized energy grid that can be disconnected from the regional grid and operate independently.
An optimization tool was introduced to model microgrids in forest-bordering regions, and subsequently, an assessment was performed focusing on seven localities in California with different climate conditions.
The study revealed that microgrids with solar-plus-storage systems can keep the average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and annual public safety power shutoffs below 30 cents per kWh and 2 to 3% of annual energy demand, respectively. Californians pay about 25 cents per kWh on average for residential electricity.
“This is the first detailed, state-level study that’s looked at how clean energy microgrids can minimize outage impacts on vulnerable communities, and how much it would cost,” said Tianzhen Hong, a co-author and senior scientist at LBNL.
Additional findings include that renewable energy penetration can be kept at 60% or above of the annual energy demand while considering microgrids, which creates a more wholesome picture for solar plus battery systems to reduce the adverse impacts of wildfires and increase grid resiliency during seasonal patterns of increased wildfires.
The study notes that microgrids cannot completely eliminate the PSPS concern completely, as the LCOE and renewables curtailment  become higher when attempting to eliminate public safety power shutoff completely.
A reduction in the cost of deploying energy storage systems is essential to achieving zero public safety shutoffs altogether, and further cost declines in storage technologies is anticipated in the coming years.
The LBNL study recommends solar-plus-storage microgrids for communities situated alongside wildfire risk areas of California to enhance energy infrastructure resiliency and to protect vulnerable residents.
More than 46 million Americans living in 70,000 individual communities are at risk for wildland-urban interface fires, the study reports. Such neighborhoods are created by population growth that pushes property development into wildfire-prone regions.
While utilities implement PSPS emergency power shut-offs on red flag warnings days, modern grid infrastructure upgrades are necessary to keep up with the increases of climate change occurrences and wildfires. At least five of the 20 most destructive California wildfires have been attributed to faulty power line problems, including the 2018 Camp Fire.
The immediate cut-off of power during wildfire season causes disproportional difficulties to disadvantaged communities with limited access to internet, mobility or medical systems.
“We’re really talking about equity here,” Hong said. “The technology can be really good, but at the end of the day, if people can’t afford it then nothing happens.” Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, federal support has been directed towards the type of community energy installations the study describes.
PG&E, a California utility provider previously at fault for wildfires spreading during the 2018 Camp Fire, recently introduced microgrids to support areas in its service territory surrounded by wildfires. Such microgrids operate in standalone mode during wildfire seasons, and supply electricity for consumers without being dependent on the grid. These microgrids also enable the integration of more dispatchable renewable energy sources with minimal impact on the grid.
The study first appeared in an April issue of Applied Energy, and was co-authored by Dasun Perera from Princeton University, Bingyu Zhao from TU Wien, Zhe Wang and Kenichi Soga from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
