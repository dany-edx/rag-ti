The benefits of the electricity generated will be delivered under long-term agreements with a regional supermarket as well as local community solar customers under the Massachusetts DOER SMART Program.
The Holliston project was developed in partnership with REA, one of Altus Power’s long-standing channel partners, and adds to the 116 MW of solar arrays currently owned and operated by Altus Power in Massachusetts.
“Battery storage is an important tool for local utilities to ensure grid stability as they increase their reliance on renewable electricity,” said Gregg Felton, co-CEO and co-founder of Altus Power. “In addition, we expect storage will increasingly be paired with Altus Power solar arrays for customers interested in clean, on-site backup power and electric vehicle charging.”
Altus Power, headquartered in Stamford, Conn., recently announced first quarter 2023 revenues of $29.4 million, a 53% increase as compared to first quarter 2022. In the fourth quarter 2022, the company grew its portfolio in part due to the acquisition of an 88 MW commercial solar portfolio in Arizona, Nevada, Indiana and Pennsylvania, from D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments, and 9 MW of New Jersey assets acquired from a local developer.
New York City ESS
Summit Ridge Energy commissioned the 15 MWh Arlington and 15 MWh Littlefield energy storage systems (ESS), the first two of its four in New York City.
When the final two projects are energized in the coming months, Summit Ridge Energy’s four ESS will provide 58 MWh of energy storage capacity to New York’s electric grid and reduce the need for diesel-powered peaker plants, the company reports. Summit Ridge Energy financed, developed and constructed the projects, in partnership with Qcells, and serves as the long-term owner-operator.
The Arlington and Littlefield projects came online under the New York State Public Service Commission’s (PSC) Value Stack (VDER) program. The Value Stack compensates projects such as solar-plus-storage, based on when and where they provide electricity to the grid and compensation is in the form of bill credits.
“These energy storage projects are providing critical grid resilience for New York City and supporting the state’s transition to renewable energy,” said Brian Dunn, chief operating officer at Summit Ridge Energy.
New York University’s (NYU) Langone Health partnered with Summit Ridge Energy to purchase all of the bill credits from these first two projects. Summit Ridge reported that the hospital is demonstrating the important role large end userscan play in the move toward a low-carbon future. These agreements support the health system’s sustainability goals, which recognize climate change as a threat to public health, and includes a carbon neutrality goal by 2050.
“As we pursue opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our facilities, it is equally as important for us to support efforts to harden and decarbonize New York City’s energy grid for the benefit and resiliency of the communities we serve,” said Paul Schwabacher, senior vice president, facilities operations, NYU Langone Health.
In the past five years, Summit Ridge Energy, which specializes in community solar, has deployed over $1.6 billion into clean energy assets. With a development pipeline of more than 2 GW, Summit Ridge Energy will have more than 400 MW of PV online by the end of 2023, providing solar power to 50,000 homes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/31/stiff-competition-predicted-for-usda-9-7-billion-focused-on-renewables/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,GEORGIA,KENTUCKY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 31, 2023",Stiff competition predicted for USDA $9.7 billion focused on renewables,"The Oglethorpe Power Corporation that provides generation and transmission for Georgia’s rural electric distribution cooperatives could cost-effectively replace much of its fossil generation and meet projected demand growth through 2032 with 12 GW of solar and 4 GW of battery storage, with support from a $9.7 billion U.S. Department of Agriculture program, says a report from the nonprofit Sierra Club.
The Sierra Club found that the added solar and storage capacity for Oglethorpe’s system would reduce customer costs by nearly 25%, saving almost $640 million per year by 2030. The group relied on a modeling assessment conducted by researchers at University of California, Berkeley that used the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s free ReEDS model.
Across Oglethorpe and four other rural generation and transmission cooperatives, the Sierra Club modeled cost-effective additions of 19 GW solar, 7 GW storage and 5 GW wind power. A total of 63 generation and transmission (G&T) cooperatives serve the nation’s rural electric distribution cooperatives.
The USDA is making $9.7 billion available to rural electric cooperatives under its New ERA program to deploy renewable energy systems, zero-emission and carbon capture systems. To apply, eligible entities must submit a letter of interest by September 15—a new, extended deadline.
“We fully expect” the USDA subsidy program “to be oversubscribed,” said Jeremy Fisher, senior strategy and technical advisor for the Sierra Club. Assuming that the USDA program is “maxed out” at $9.7 billion in 25% grants, Fisher said the program could support 24 GW of renewables and 10 GW of storage. But the Sierra Club found that just 11 G&T cooperatives could cost-effectively add 50 GW of renewables and 23 GW of storage with USDA grant support.
Many rural cooperatives might not pursue cost-optimal clean energy investments in the absence of the New ERA program, Fisher said. He added that the program makes battery storage for near-term capacity replacement “attractive” relative to maintaining coal or adding new gas for capacity purposes.
Yet even though modeling shows a large deployment of storage is cost-effective, Fisher said reaching that scale within the New ERA timeframe “may be logistically challenging.” He predicted less storage and more transmission investments than shown by the modeling used by the Sierra Club.
For two of the G&T cooperatives that it assessed, the Sierra Club relied on modeling using the EnCompass model from Anchor Power Solutions, conducted by Energy Futures Group. For another G&T cooperative, the Sierra Club relied on modeling using the free GenX model developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, conducted by an independent contractor.
The nonprofit group Union of Concerned Scientists has used the ReEDs model to validate 100% renewables by 2035 for 24 states whose governors support climate action.
The nonprofit group RMI has used the GenX model to develop a resource plan for two Kentucky utilities.
Rural electric cooperatives serve 42 million people, and operate in 92% of persistent poverty counties, says the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association on its website.
The Sierra Club describes itself as the nation’s largest grassroots environmental organization.

July witnessed record-breaking heatwaves globally, severely impacting lives and livelihoods. In North America, high pressure led to unprecedented minimum overnight temperatures and clear sky days in the South and West. Consequently, temperatures and irradiance outperformed the long-term July average. However, in contrast, Canada and the Eastern US experienced reduced irradiance due to low pressure and unsettled rain, resulting in a three-month rainfall total in just 24 hours in parts of Nova Scotia.

Unprecedented heatwaves swept across western North America this month, with daily lows reaching record-breaking highs. Phoenix, Arizona, saw an all-time high daily minimum temperature exceeding 36 C (97 F), while midnight temperatures in Death Valley, California, soared to a staggering 49 C (120 F). North America’s northernmost town, Utquiagvik, Alaska, recorded its warmest single day, surpassing the previous record by almost 4 C (39 F). In Mexico, tragic heatwaves resulted in more than 200 deaths since June, with over 100 in July alone.
July’s high pressure in the southwest and trough in the northeast dramatically influenced North America’s solar energy production. Persistent high-pressure systems in the southwest led to frequent clear skies and warm air masses, driving up solar irradiance and enhancing
potential solar power generation.
Conversely, the northeast experienced numerous cold fronts and unsettled weather. The ensuing cloud cover and rainfall significantly reduced sunlight and solar energy output. Eastern Canada faced devastating floods due to the heaviest rainfall to hit Nova Scotia in over 50 years, with three months worth of rain falling in just one day.

According to Solcast data collected via the Solcast API, solar irradiance across most of the southern and western United States soared to 10% to 25% higher than long-term July averages. However, solar generation will have been severely affected by high temperatures, leading to
decreased panel efficiency and increased heat losses.
Solcast generates this monthly total data before the month-end through a mix of historic data and modeled forecasts from the Solcast API, with the total summary for July including forecast data for the final four days.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

Aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor Blue Origin announced it received $35 million in funding from NASA to develop the company’s technology to produce solar cells from lunar regolith.
Lunar regolith is made of dust, broken rocks, and other related materials and is present on the Moon, Mars, and Earth.
“Based on a process called molten regolith electrolysis, the breakthrough would bootstrap unlimited electricity and power transmission cables anywhere on the surface of the Moon,” Blue Origin said in a statement. “Today’s investment will result in a demonstration of autonomous operation in a simulated lunar environment by 2026.”
The technology of the company owned by Jeff Bezos consists of a scalable and contactless process for melting and moving molten regolith. It consists of a reactor that produces iron, silicon, and aluminum through molten regolith electrolysis via regolith simulants. The system uses electrical current to separate those elements from oxygen.
“Our proprietary transport subsystem moves and separates molten material at temperatures above 1600 C in a controlled and power-efficient manner while withstanding the high-temperature, corrosive environment,” Blue Origin said in a statement released in February. “Molten regolith electrolysis extracts iron, then silicon, and finally aluminum by passing a current through the molten regolith. The rising oxygen bubbles in one of our reactors show metals and metalloids being separated from oxygen. Our reactor geometry, metal extraction approach, and materials selection will enable sustained lunar operations.”
The company claims this process enables the production of silicon with a purity of 99.999%, as well as that of highly resistant solar glass by utilizing only molten regolith electrolysis byproducts.
“Blue Origin’s goal of producing solar power using only lunar resources is aligned with NASA’s highest priority Moon-to-Mars infrastructure development objective,” the company said.
The first research conducted by NASA for the development of solar cells from regolith dates back to 2005. This work provided a conceptual design for a solar-powered robotic rover able to build solar cells directly on the lunar surface.
“The lunar surface possesses both the elemental components needed for the fabrication of silicon solar cells and a vacuum environment that allow for vacuum deposition of thin film solar cells directly on the surface of the Moon without the need for vacuum chambers,” the paper reads.
The University of Houston built the first silicon and cadmium sulfide/cadmium telluride thin film photovoltaic diodes deposited on lunar regolith substrates in 2005. “The fabricated solar array is like a macroscopic version of an electronic device on a chip,” the scientists said. “The chip must be insulating so that the different elements can be made and then connected together in appropriate circuits.”
Estonia’s Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) is currently also working on the development of solar cells from regolith. Last year, it unveiled a sandpaper-like solar cell relying on a monograin-powder technology. The device consists of thousands of small crystals, with a diameter of 50 micrometers, embedded into a polymer in one continuous layer.
“To complete the solar cell these microcrystals are coated with a buffer and window layers,” TalTech said in a statement. “In this way, each crystal works as a small individual solar cell and generates electricity.” It also said low-cost roll-to-roll techniques may be used to produce cells and panels.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/31/one-research-teams-approach-to-scaling-a-domestic-circular-lithium-ion-battery-economy/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JULY 31, 2023",One research team’s approach to scaling a domestic circular lithium-ion battery economy,"From blowing up batteries to designing possible models for hybrid and EV components, National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) distinguished researcher, Matt Keyser, and his team have spent decades studying how to scale clean energy safely. 
Most recently, NREL researchers have been looking at different recycling methods for EV batteries, particularly those made from lithium-ion (li-ion). Commonly used because of their performance energy density cost and life cycle, li-ion batteries are the go-to option for EVs and make up more than 90% of the domestic battery energy storage market. 
However, China’s dominance over the world’s li-ion supply chain and human rights violations from Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo, means the government and manufacturers are looking for ways to scale a circular EV battery and infrastructure economy at home.
So Keyser and his team are researching methods to reuse some or all degraded materials in a Li-ion battery. Particularly cathode, which he suggests is the most valuable metal. “The cathode materials are heated for 8 to 12 hours at temperatures exceeding 1,472 F to get the proper crystalline structure and particle size for a Li-ion battery to work,” he said.  
This exploration decreases dependence on critical cathode metals like cobalt. It also allows researchers to experiment with different compositions of various materials throughout the re-engineering process — an essential component of adapting to – or steering – evolving consumer EV-battery markets. 
“What’s used in today’s batteries isn’t the same as even five years ago—and will change a year from now as the technology matures,” Keyser said. 
He hopes manufacturers can recycle every part of a li-ion battery. NREL researchers are currently looking at how to reuse materials like hydrophilic and coated graphite that hold metals together and help generate electricity. 
Keyser also supports starting a potential battery hub with national laboratories. He is interested in how multivalent chemistries using noncritical materials can help decrease reliance on traditional li-ion battery metals. This is one possible way to better accommodate EV and battery storage needs.

The company currently has manufacturing operations producing 800 MW of modules in Minnesota and 300 MW in Ontario, Canada.
The privately held company plans to invest about $145 million in the new facility, driven by the additional production tax credit and domestic content adder available through the Inflation Reduction Act. The investment comes from Orion Infrastructure Capital (OIC), which contributed $5 million in equity to Heliene and $150 million in credit for the new facility.
The plan is for the new factory, which is expected to be in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, to begin producing modules in 2024 and cells in 2025. Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene, told pv magazine USA that today the company is producing PERC modules, 80% of which are bifacial and 20% industrial rooftop large format. It plans to begin producing TOPcon modules by March 2024.
The new factory will be the company’s first to produce solar cells, and one of only a few that have announced plans to manufacture cells in the U.S. Pochtaruk noted getting cell production up and running requires the civil work to prepare the building, then the permitting process, which takes 6 months, then they’ll receive the equipment to start installation and testing…ultimately taking a total of 24 months. When asked how soon the company will ramp up to the 1.5 GW of cell production, Pochtaruk said that the company plans to start cells by July/August 2025, and it will take “a good 6 to 7 month to ramp up to 85% utilization”.
While the Inflation Reduction Act has a domestic content tax adder, pv magazine USA asked how much module content is currently sourced domestically. “Today we already have frames, encapsulant and back sheet, by December junction boxes and frame sealant. We still need ribbon and glass,” said Pochtaruk.
In October 2022 the company announced the opening of a 420 MW plant in Minnesota, adding to the company’s existing 150 MW operation in the state.

Today, we have a pipeline of roughly 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects in various stages of development. This includes projects in early stage diligence in our current backlog and is supported by roughly 145 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions.
NextEra also discussed their unique approach to interconnection challenges. The company says that the 145 GW of their pipeline with secured interconnection positions is likely unparalleled in the nation. Moreover, the company noted that wherever it is feasible, they are taking control of these interconnection issues through their subsidiary, NextEra Transmission. The company disclosed a $400 million transmission development opportunity in the California ISO region.
As of the end of 2022, the total U.S. interconnection queue was approximately 1,700 GW.
NextEra noted that the pricing and supply chain challenges from 2022 have largely subsided, allowing projects that were held up in 2022 to be brought online in 2023.
The company further reported that two of their deploying entities, Florida Power & Light (FPL) and NextEra Energy Resources, have rolled out 225 MW of solar and 1.8 GW of renewable assets, respectively, since the first quarter presentation of 2023. Year to date, FPL has implemented nearly 1.2 GWac of solar capacity, and over the past two years, it has deployed 1.6 GWac. FPL plans to add approximately 3.1 GWac of solar through 2025.
NextEra also added 1.215 GWac of solar, 150 MW of wind, and 300 MW of energy storage to its project backlog, bringing the total to over 20 GW of capacity.
The company explained that its backlog is different from projects in the queue, as queue projects may become backlog projects if they become economically viable.
NextEra finalized the purchase of a 690 MW portfolio of operating wind and solar assets, which raised its operating portfolio of projects under NextEra Energy Partners to more than 10 GW, making it the world’s seventh-largest producer of electricity from wind and solar.
The company also closed the deal on its first standalone battery, a 65 MW unit, to be installed in the Southwest Power Pool region and co-located with a wind farm. The company emphasized that its national cumulative portfolio of 29 GW of capacity offers considerable potential for co-located storage deployment.
NextEra shared its ongoing communication efforts with the U.S. Department of Treasury regarding “green hydrogen.” The company is seeking annual rather than hourly accounting for clean energy under the Inflation Reduction Act. This method would enable an electrolyzer to operate continuously from the grid while being associated with a solar facility that offsets the total electricity used. In this scenario, the electrolyzer would not be 100% powered by emission-free electricity, but by the local power grid mix.
NextEra indicated that it maintains a substantial hydrogen pipeline.
