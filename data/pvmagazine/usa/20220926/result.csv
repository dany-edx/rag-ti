Shoals specializes in American-made electrical balance of systems (EBOS) for utility-scale solar installations, energy storage and e-mobility, while Nextracker provides smart solar tracker solutions, also American made.
To enhance site access, the two companies collaborated on the new North-South BLA trunk product, which is optimized for NX HorizonT tracker rows. The main advantage of the BLA solution is that it does away with combiner boxes, reducing both installation times and O&M costs further down the line.
In this North-South BLA product, the trunk bus runs parallel, rather than perpendicular, to the torque tube and transition boxes along the North-South row step down the size of the trunk bus along the tracker rows. The companies said O&M is simplified without any structure impeding site access.
Compared to conventional in-field North-South wiring methods, Shoals estimates that its North-South BLA delivers a 43% savings in PV wiring installation labor, a 60% savings in DC wiring O&M, and a 0.25% increase in energy yield due to less DC wiring voltage drop.
“We are proud to partner with Nextracker to make our leading solar ecosystems work optimally together, resulting in utility-scale solar that is more cost effective for our customers,” said Jason Whitaker, chief executive officer of Shoals.
“This collaboration with Shoals provides a critical solution to an industry-wide challenge,” said Dan Shugar, founder and chief executive officer of Nextracker. “We are excited this North-South BLA product is now available, helping more projects realize the long-term benefit of our independent row trackers.”
Shoals developed its BLA in 2017, which the company says enables a faster, safer, more reliable and more cost-effective installation. Nextracker is best known for its first single-axis tracker, the NX Horizon, which features independent rows that the company reports allows personnel and equipment to traverse freely.

EDP Renewables North America developed and will construct, own, and operate Cattlemen Solar Park, to be built in two stages, which will represent capital investments of approximately $320 million and $220 million. The company estimates that $55 million in taxes will be paid to support area schools and community services, and millions of dollars will be spent locally during the project’s construction and operational life, which is expected to span decades.
The installation will provide 400 employment opportunities during construction and the several full-time team members who will be employed to safely run and perform routine maintenance on the park during operations.
Cattleman Solar Park will sit on approximately 2,600 acres of land, and is expected to be operational in 2023, at which time it will generate enough electricity equivalent to the consumption of more than 37,000 average Texas homes. Cattlemen will also save more than 304 million gallons of water and avoid more than 271,000 tons of CO2 each year.
Cattlemen has two long-term commercial agreements in-place for the project: a 156 MW power purchase agreement (PPA) with Meta and a 60 MW PPA with Bristol Myers Squibb. Cattlemen Solar Park is the second PPA that EDP Renewables and Meta have executed; the companies’ first PPA was a 139 MW contract for EDPR NA’s 200 MW Headwaters II Wind Farm in Indiana.
Headquartered in Houston, Texas, with 58 wind farms, nine solar parks, and eight regional offices across North America, EDPR NA has developed nearly 9 GW and operates more than 8.2 GW of onshore utility-scale renewable energy projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/26/trina-introduces-two-topcon-solar-panels/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2022",Trina introduces two TOPCon solar panels,"Trina Solar, China-headquartered global leader in solar module manufacturing, introduced two new series of products featuring an N-TOPCon configuration.
The company announced the Vertex N for commercial, industrial, and utility-scale applications, and the Vertex S+, for residential rooftop PV systems. The two products were introduced at the RE+ conference in Anaheim, California.
Trina marketing manager Melissa Cavanagh told pv magazine that it will soon exclusively produce TOPcon modules. The company said it is also mulling the potential to set up manufacturing capacity in the United States now that the Inflation Reduction Act has been passed. The Act packs in numerous incentives for solar manufacturing at every leg of the module supply chain as well as balance-of-system components.
The Vertex N is a 210Rmm N-TOPCon module with a maximum output of 595 W. It has a bifaciality factor of 80%, up from the 70% that traditional polysilicon solar cells produce.
The Vertex S+ is a 430 W module designed for residential rooftop applications. It has a max efficiency of 21.9%. The module features a lightweight dual-glass design for enhanced safety, lifespan, and durability.
The product is backed by a 25-year product warranty and a maximum annual degradation of 0.4%. S+ includes all Vertex series technologies such as 210mm multi-busbar triple-cut cells, non-destructive cell cutting and high-density interconnection for low voltage and maximum string power.
TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contacts) solar modules are a focus for Trina as they provide higher efficiency, lower degradation, and a better temperature coefficient when compared to conventional modules.
“TOPCon is not new to Trina, we built our first pilot project four years ago – a 400 MW solar plant under China’s Top Runner program,” Helena Li, president of the company’s global cell and module business, told pv magazine Smarter E event in Munich, Germany. “We utilized our own n-type TOPCon technology in that project, but when we built that customers were not ready to buy these products, as prices were too high, although we had a production line of a certain size. However, we built on this experience for our current approach.”
In March, Trina Solar said that its 210 mm × 210 mm TOPCon cell had achieved an efficiency of 25.5%.
“Our shipments have already grown 40% year on year, maintaining a high market share, despite all difficulties. Trina Solar will keep developing TOPCon tech rapidly and is planning to raise its capacity for new n-type products from 500 MW currently to 20 GW by the end of 2023,” said Li.
The company has launched a number of joint ventures or partnerships to diversify its polysilicon, ingot and wafer sources over the past year, especially in Southeast Asia. Trina said it is confident in the high degree of traceability of its products and supporting supply chains.
“We realized supply chain can not be centralized in one place and customers also want independence. Our mid-term strategy is to have a clear fragmentation of products and markets, as well as geographically diversify our supply chain. Different markets require different supply chains,” said Li.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/26/solliance-hits-30-1-efficiency-on-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cell/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2022",Solliance hits 30.1% efficiency on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell,"From pv magazine global
The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), the Delft University of Technology, the Eindhoven University of Technology, and Belgian research institute Imec have achieved a 30.1% power conversion efficiency with a semi-transparent perovskite solar cell, combined with a crystalline silicon solar cell in a four-terminal tandem configuration.
In November 2021, the consortium achieved a 29.2% record efficiency for the device, from an efficiency rate of just 28.7% in March 2020
“The development of the cell will continue until practical limit for two junction devices are reached, however it is key to bring the technology to the market to benefit from a faster learning curve to devices that are actually mass produced,” Gianluca Coletti, TNO’s program manager for tandem PV technology, told pv magazine. 
The research institutes, which are all part of the Solliance consortium, were able to increase the cell’s overall efficiency by raising the efficiency of the perovskite cell –  a highly near-infrared transparent perovskite device built by TNO with TU Eindhoven and imec.
“This result was achieved by first implementing highly transparent contacts and then working on improving one by one the absorber layer and each of the transport layers,” Coletti explained.
According to the researchers, the efficiency rate of the 3 mm x 3 mm perovskite cell used for the tandem cell increased from 17.8% to 19.7%, a result which was certified by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra, Italy.
“This type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93% of the near-infrared light to reach the bottom device,” said TNO researcher Mehrdad Najafi. “This performance was achieved by optimizing all layers of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using advanced optical and electrical simulations as a guide for the experimental work in the lab.”
The scientists placed the perovskite device on top of a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell developed by TU Delft.
“The silicon device is a 20×20-mm2 wide, heterojunction solar cell featuring optimized surface passivation, transparent conductive oxides, and copper-plated front contacts for state-of-the-art carrier extraction,” said TU Delft researcher Yifeng Zhao.
In a recent paper, the researchers said that the cell was used in 24.5 mW/cm2 bifacial tandem mini-modules with an area of 100 cm2 in combination with a PERC bottom cell. The panels exhibited a 3 mW/cm2 gain compared to the same device with a monofacial architecture. According to the scientists, outdoor results have shown that the module can outperform the monofacial counterpart by more than 25% in a 10% albedo environment.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/26/26-million-acres-needed-to-achieve-zero-carbon-goals/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2022",26 million acres needed to achieve zero-carbon goals,"In conversations about energy, terms like “carbon neutral” and “net-zero goals” are often thrown around. Frequently, these discussions center around grid infrastructure, incentives and the viability of reaching a renewable energy future. But typically overlooked is another critical question: what do these goals actually mean for the land of America, i.e., how much acreage will be required for the country to achieve a grid with zero carbon emissions.
According to our calculations, assuming fossil fuel and biomass energy would be replaced with green energy, it would take approximately 13 million acres of land to power today’s grid solely from solar facilities. It should be noted, however, that this amount would likely need to double to account for energy storage, electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, and the necessary increase in electrical infrastructure. But by dedicating about 26 million acres or 1% of the country’s land to solar energy—an area roughly the size of Kentucky—we could enable the nation to power itself with no carbon emissions.
Figure 1 shows the country’s current electricity production broken down by source (as of May 2022). “Green” energy includes solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal electricity. “Nuclear” energy is considered a zero-carbon electricity generation method. “Low-carbon” energy is natural gas, which the European Union is trying to include, amid controversy, as a type of green energy, meeting the carbon goals. “High-carbon” electricity is produced from coal, petroleum, and biomass sources. (Even though biomass is a renewable energy source, it requires burning wood and plants, creating problematic carbon emissions.)

To calculate the electricity demand for the United States, both infrastructure electricity and land transportation data were incorporated into this study. According to an EIA study, on-road passenger transportation accounts for 62% of transportation energy use in the U.S., with the rest being freight transportation (19%), marine (12%), air (5%), and rail (2%).
Assuming that only land transportation (on-road passenger, freight, and rail) can be completely electrified, we took driving statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation and estimated the average yearly car mileage per driver for each state, which ranges from 7,013 miles per year for the District of Columbia to 24,069 miles per year for Wyoming. Combined with the number of licensed drivers for each state, we derived the yearly mileage per state for on-road passengers.
Since EVs in the U.S. account for less than one percent of all vehicles and we are not modeling an increase in the number of drivers, we will assume for our calculations that all vehicles are petroleum-based. Using an average EV energy consumption of 350 Wh (Watthour) per mile, and with more modeling, we converted this to a total energy consumption to turn the entire passenger vehicle fleet, along with freight and rail transportation, to electric (See Figure 2.)
 
LandGate
Utility-scale generators in the United States currently generate around 4.7 million GWh per year, with 1.8 million GWh produced from high-carbon emission sources of energy and 1.6 million GWh from low-carbon emission natural gas. The electricity needed to make land transportation totally zero-carbon is estimated at 1.6 million GWh per year. To bring the current electricity production and land transportation to zero-carbon standards will require five million GWh per year of additional electricity generation from green energy. (Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the breakdown of this additional green electricity required for each state to have no carbon emissions.)
LandGate
A key question in determining how much land is needed is what source of green energy will be used to produce these five million GWh per year of additional electricity. Growing calls for removing hydroelectric dams combined with increasing droughts — such as the one at the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona’s Lake Powell where water levels have dropped to a historic low — do not make new hydroelectric dams likely. Wind farms take more acreage than solar to produce the same electricity, but they allow use of the land.
 

To simplify this analysis, we will assume that all the additional electricity from green energy sources will come from solar farms. Using the solar irradiance, topography, exclusion zones and buildable acreage specific to every state, we calculated the acreage required to generate this additional electricity on a per-state basis. (Figure 5)
 
Solar farms in the U.S. built and being built to date currently occupy an estimated half million acres. Adding up the required additional acreage across all 50 states, we would need an additional 13 million acres of solar farms in the next decade to meet the zero-carbon goals, over 25 times more than what has been built to date (Figure 6.). Reaching this reality would also require additional energy storage and infrastructure like transmission lines, substations, and distribution lines, which could be roughly estimated at another 13 million acres. This Kentucky-size acreage required for green electricity production, transportation, and storage represents around one percent of the land in the continental United States.

The first step in this energy transition is replacing the high-carbon energy sources: coal and fossil fuels. The next step will be replacing the low-carbon energy sources, like natural gas.
Although there’s no denying the substantial acreage that will be required for green energy production, we believe these zero-carbon goals can be met. Stakeholders across the spectrum are championing the cause, from government and climate advocates to an increasingly vocal contingent of investors who are focused on clean energy. With landowners also poised to benefit from renewable royalties or leases, all indicators are pointing to solar’s continued growth in the years ahead.
