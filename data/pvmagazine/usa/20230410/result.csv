Construction is expected to begin in the third quarter of this year, with operations coming online by the summer of 2024.
The Megafactory will manufacture Megapacks, offering 3.9 MWh of storage capacity each, and available with a power rating of either 1 MW or 1.9 MW. The 4860-sized battery cells within the Megapack are expected to be manufactured in a collaboration with China’s CATL.
Recently, the battery chemistry of Megapacks transitioned from a cobalt-containing, manganese, and nickel-heavy NMC cathode formula to lithium-phosphate LMP models. With this shift to LMP cells, Tesla has extended its warranty to twenty years for a “majority of the battery’s capacity.”
Tesla’s first Megafactory, located in Lathrop, California, became operational in 2022. It also boasts a declared capacity of 40 GWh of batteries per year. At 3.9 MWh each, this translates to over 10,000 units annually, or just over 28 Megapacks per day.
Dedicated Tesla observers who measured the facility’s production via drone in February suggest that the factory was producing between four and nine Megapacks per day.

Even at partial operation, the Lathrop facility’s impact is already evident. Tesla set record energy storage deployment volumes in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, with 2,100 and then 2,462 MWhs of capacity, respectively. These figures exceeded historical peaks that were averaging near 1,000 MWh/quarter.
In total, Tesla installed 6.5 GWhs of energy storage products in 2022, averaging 4.5 Megapacks deployed per day.
The Nevada facility has a manufacturing capacity of about 3 GWh. When combined with the two new Megafactories, this raises the total potential capacity to 83 GWh/year.
Should the Lathrop and Shanghai facilities reach anywhere near their 40 GWh annual capacity by the end of 2024 and 2025, Tesla’s energy storage business will have experienced greater than 1,000% growth from 2022.
The company initially saw its capacity nearly double, deploying just over 3 GWh in 2020. Then, in 2021, it grew by approximately 25%, achieving 4 GWh, followed by a 62% increase in 2022.
Assuming a 50% manufacturing capacity factor at the Lathrop facility this year, Tesla’s 2022 record capacity deployments would triple to greater than 20 GWhs deployed. Further scaling of the Lathrop facility in 2024, and adding the Shanghai facility, could result in another doubling of capacity, reaching 40 GW deployed.
Tesla’s Megapack ordering page currently lists availability for new Megapack deliveries in the first quarter of 2025.
According to Tesla’s recently released third Master Plan, 2,310 GWh/year of stationary e-chem factories, such as Megapack style batteries, are required to achieve 100% clean electricity globally. By this measure, 57 Megafactories would fulfill this goal, and Tesla is soon to be operating two of them.

Recognizing the need to understand the dynamics of a steady supply chain of these materials, the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed a software tool called the Lithium-Ion Battery Resource Assessment Model (LIBRA).
Ongoing NREL research elucidates the need for supply chain strength for a clean energy future. The LIBRA model is helping researchers better understand the numerous factors that impact the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery materials supply chain, a key to the energy transition.
“Li-ion batteries offer performance, energy density, cost, and cycle-life benefits. However, electrification efforts are complicated by various intersecting factors, including differences in markets, operations, and policies. In addition, Li-ion batteries may contain critical materials in short supply, such as cobalt, with few natural resources available domestically,” said NREL.
LIBRA uses system dynamics modeling to analyze the supply chain and evaluate the economic viability of Li-ion battery manufacturing, reuse and recycling. The tool considers changes in costs, battery adoption scenarios and international actions, and how these factors influence long-term trends in the battery supply chain.
“Although LIBRA can’t predict the future, this model allows researchers to ask and answer ‘what-if’ questions to gain insights into a complex and rapidly evolving industry. LIBRA offers a detailed and consistent approach to guide research and investments to secure the Li-ion supply chain, optimize recycling processes, and ensure resiliency and sustainability for nationwide grid and vehicle electrification,” said NREL.
The system dynamics analysis in LIBRA track the supply and flow of materials and costs over time for manufacturing and recycling. It includes advanced feedback loops that inform changes throughout stages of the chain. As a result, LIBRA can offer insights into material availability and demand for lithium.
“For example, if we extend the lifetime of EV batteries to reduce the overall environmental impact of Li-ion batteries, how might that lower the availability of recycled materials? There are many factors at play,” said Dustin Weigl, a mobility research analyst at NREL.
The tool tracks the movement of lithium, cobalt, nickel and other elements through the supply chain. The model has repeatedly shed light on the economic viability of recycling of these materials. It has highlighted an opportunity for regional potential of recycling to offset mineral imports.
Among other insights, LIBRA offers useful data and analysis for:
“We are constantly updating LIBRA’s model structure and data based on the latest developments within the transportation and recycling industries,” said Weigl. “Technological advancements move quickly, but LIBRA is designed to adapt with next-generation cell chemistries, battery designs, and storage systems.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/10/u-s-costs-are-too-high-for-new-chinese-solar-polysilicon-factory/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 10, 2023",U.S. costs are too high for new Chinese solar polysilicon factory,"A major solar-grade polysilicon producer, GCL Technology Holdings, said it is looking to expand its first factory outside China. However, the company said it will likely pass on the United States due to high costs, reported BloombergNEF.
GCL’s joint-chief executive officer Lan Tianshi said that while the Inflation Reduction Act helped make developing in the U.S. market more appealing, it is still at least five times more expensive than in China, and construction times are bogged down by regulatory requirements.
“U.S. policies are attractive, but not attractive enough,” said Tianshi.
Polysilicon is the key material in conventional photovoltaic solar cells. In 2021, GCL was the second-largest producer of the material, turning out over 104,500 tons that year. Along with GCL, Tongwei (109,300 tons) and Daqo (86,600 tons) comprise the top three largest global producers.
Tianshi said the company is seeking new shores for its factory in order to capture higher prices in other markets. Meanwhile, nations around the world are working to develop their own solar component supply chains in an attempt to compete with China, which dominates the sector.
GCL told BloombergNEF that it is now focusing its search on Europe, the Middle East and BRICS countries. While no decision has been made, the U.S. remains an unlikely suitor.
However, GCL’s competitors have taken a different stance. Three major Chinese solar equipment makers have announced plans to set up shop in the U.S. following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which comes with significant tax credits for clean energy manufacturing.
GCL said it plans to form a joint venture with local industry leaders in the foreign market it ultimately selects for the new factory. The decision is expected this year, said Tianshi.
Due to the higher price polysilicon can fetch outside China, the new factory could reap double or triple the profit of existing facilities, he said.
GCL has a polysilicon plant in Xinjiang, the region under enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which places a rebuttable presumption that goods made in the region are made with forced labor practices. China has consistently denied the allegations, claiming that the allegations are an attempt by foreign nations to suppress domestic industries.
“We greatly respect others’ views on us and their choices of supply chain,” said Tianshi. “Wherever we build our factories and wherever our products go, in a broader scale, they are all efforts to fight climate change.”
China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said the nation’s manufacturers combined for 827 kilotons of polysilicon production in 2022. The U.S. Department of Energy reports eight polysilicon or silicon metal facilities active in the U.S. with a combined capacity of producing 244.4 kilotons of refined material each year. The largest silicon metal facility is a 73 kiloton fabrication in run by WVA Manufacturing in West Virginia. The largest active polysilicon site is the 32 kiloton-per-year Hemlock Semiconductor, operated by Siemens AG.
Leading producer Daqo said in 2022, the yearly average selling price for polysilicon was $32.54/kg, up from $21.76/kg a year earlier. Prices have fallen this year as new factories come online, and could drop to as low as $10 to $13 per kg in the second half compared to about $39 at last year’s peak, according to BloombergNEF.
Tianshi said that he expects prices to remain more resilient than the Bloomberg projections, estimating the price to hover between $17 and $20 per kg this year due to high demand.
“Polysilicon makers will return to a relatively normal profit margin this year as the unbalance between supply and demand begins to ease,” he said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/10/solar-powered-cannabis-cultivation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA,CANADA,GERMANY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 10, 2023",Solar-powered cannabis cultivation,"From pv magazine Global 
Solar energy and cannabis cultivation are old bedfellows. PV pioneer John Schaeffer has even credited solar with facilitating the northern California cannabis industry, which in turn supported the nascent PV sector. Now, as the legalization of medical and recreational cannabis gathers pace, solar continues to perform a key role.
In the weeds
Cannabis cultivation can take place outdoors, indoors, or in greenhouses. While outdoor cultivation worked for millennia, the growth of the industry and increased demand for higher-quality product, plus tight profit margins, have prompted producers to go indoors, where ideal environments can be replicated. Indoor growth gives control over environmental factors and flowering periods. More importantly, it means consistent, year-round harvests.
However, the high-powered lights and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment needed to control temperature and humidity come with a Sasquatch-sized carbon footprint. A 2022 report from the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated climate control measures represent more than 80% of the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production.
UNODC estimated that the carbon footprint is 16 times to 100 times larger than for outdoor cultivation. Indoor “factory farming” is incompatible with environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards, says Evan Mills, principal at engineering consultancy Energy Associates and a former senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Mills spelled out the problem in a paper published in “Energy Policy” in 2012, the year Colorado and Washington state legalized cannabis and spurred a domino effect elsewhere. Even then, he estimated indoor cultivation accounted for 1% of total US electricity use, for a carbon footprint equivalent to three million cars.
The scientist estimated 42% of cultivators grew exclusively indoors by 2020, often in multiple sprawling, Walmart-scale factories with energy consumption comparable to data centers.
Unfortunately, installing large scale solar on site isn’t an easy solution. According to Mills’ recent research into a proposed indoor cannabis industrial park in Blythe, California, the amount of solar needed to achieve net zero energy supply would cover 1,400 acres, far more land than would be necessary if the cannabis were grown outdoors.
While entirely valid, Mills’ research suggests an erroneous equivalency between indoor- and outdoor-grown cannabis. After all, anyone can brew up a big batch of moonshine in a bathtub but it’s not so easy to produce a fine single-malt Scotch at scale. Indoor cannabis is a premium product and in a state like California, where people can still easily access a black market at least double the size of the regulated (and taxable) industry, commercial cannabis companies are incentivized to produce premium products only cultivable in a climate-controlled environment.
Large-scale outdoor farming is also fraught with risk. In October, or “Croptober” as it is known, all of California’s outdoor-grown cannabis is harvested. This single harvest, if it has not been spoiled by environmental impacts such as wildfires, is only attractive for consumers for several months. If the crop fails or people decide to use cannabis in the other nine months of the year, well, they’ll turn to an indoor site or greenhouse.
Through the roof
Despite the alarming energy intensity of indoor cultivation, the sheer roofspace of grow houses is an ideal solar platform.
California-based Canndescent boasts more than 100,000 square feet of indoor cultivation space and annually produces almost 17 tons of cannabis. In 2019, Canndescent installed a 282.5 kW solar system at its facility in Desert Hot Springs.
Canndescent Senior Director of Compliance Andrew Mochulsky told pv magazine the Colorado Desert’s unrelenting sunshine and limited cloud cover make solar a no-brainer. “We’re in the heart of solar and wind country so it made sense to bring solar online,” he says. “We also think it’s just the right thing to do.”
Indoor cultivation, Mochulsky says, is “not trying to replace the sun but improve upon it to create rigid 12-hour midday sun conditions which are physically impossible outside. Because of that you have to control the environment so it’s very thirsty for electricity.”
Canndescent’s solar offsets 25% to 35% of the company’s electricity consumption, according to Mochulsky, depending on the time of year. “It’s a great investment,” he adds. “And if we can get closer to a 1:1 ratio of canopy space, it would have a substantial impact on our power costs.”
The inclusion of solar shades and carports also provides a “quality of life benefit” for employees, Mochulsky says. “So people have a nice, shaded place to sit.”
Cash-flow conundrum
Despite such benefits, only a small minority of North American indoor growers have gone solar.
“We are an outlier,” says Mochulsky. “I cannot say that it is the norm. Even here in Desert Hot Springs we are the only one, and that is in sharp contrast to the residential market where every rooftop has solar on it. Solar makes abundant sense but it entails a cost upfront.”
The Canndescent director says tight cannabis margins are a factor. “Even with an ROI [return on investment, for solar] of five years, the market is soft, [costs]are low – except to operate – and the liquidity is very tight.”
While cannabis legalization in the US is progressing state by state, and president Joe Biden has directed his secretary of health and human services, and the attorney general, to review cannabis scheduling under federal law, the market remains in legal limbo at national level, making financing solar difficult.
“There are a lot of prevailing headwinds for cannabis to adopt more solar,” says Mochulsky. “Access to a lot of financial instruments is just not available. We cannot get a standard loan from the standard banks. We can’t, for example, mortgage a company. Cannabis companies don’t have availability to things like bankruptcy. Federal illegality also means we don’t have access to state and federal tax-credit programs [such as the Inflation Reduction Act]. Investors are much more attuned to that degree of risk. After all, if a company can’t restructure, it has to fail.”
There are more examples of solar adoption, however. Much further north, Freedom Cannabis tapped AltaPro Electric to design and install a 1.83 MW system atop its facility in Acheson, Alberta, in 2020.
“It’s Canada’s largest operational rooftop PV installation,” says AltaPro Chief Financial Officer David DeBruin.
Freedom Cannabis is reaping the rewards from betting on solar. “The margins in the indoor grow operations are very competitive and chopping down one of the largest opex [operating expenditure] items is a great way that Freedom Cannabis has been able to be a leader in the industry,” DeBruin tells pv magazine.
He says other cannabis companies have made inquiries about solar but, as in the US, “it seems the clients are held back due to financing becoming harder to attain from lenders. It’s too bad because the cost of borrowing is dwarfed by the savings many times, making any loan to install solar cash flow positive in year one.”
Agrivoltaics and greenhouses
Cannabis is not limited to medical and recreational use. Hemp is one of the most versatile crops on the planet – and it’s making a big comeback. As hemp is not grown for psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), its farming is far less intensive and finicky than, for example, the high-THC flower grown by Canndescent in California. This makes hemp a potentially ideal agrivoltaic crop.
In Melz, Germany, agrivoltaic developer SunFarming is currently trialing the cultivation of hemp under solar panels. “All the plants, without exception, have grown well and developed excellently,” says Rafael Dulon, founder and managing director of Hanf Farm. Dulon says the panels also help with mold, a key concern for hemp farmers. Mold becomes a problem in autumn as temperatures cool and precipitation on the plants fails to dry. “The rain protection for the plants provided by the PV system works wonderfully,” Dulon says.
Another less-energy-intensive growing option is a greenhouse. However, the need for natural sunlight makes rooftop solar less attractive on such structures. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are improving rapidly but products such as solar facades for greenhouses may be years away. In the meantime, US-based nanomaterials innovator UbiQD’s agricultural arm, UbiGro – and solar panel manufacturer Heliene – have entered a joint development agreement for light-optimizing, energy-producing modules designed for agrivoltaic greenhouses.
UbiGro’s translucent greenhouse film is integrated with photoluminescent particles that convert light into a preferable wavelength and can easily be combined with a solar module. UbiQD founder and CEO Hunter McDaniel told pv magazine that if the panels only partially shade the greenhouse, the yield lost to shading can be made up by the spectrum improvement provided by the film.
McDaniel adds that while indoor growers have thus far managed to keep the scope of their energy intensity quiet – as opposed to similarly emergent energy-intensive industries such as crypto-mining – indoor growth is likely to shrink. Scientist Mills’ research supports this idea, as the number of growers who operate primarily indoors fell from 80% to 60% between 2016 and 2020. With outdoor growth too inconsistent and indoor growth shrinking, the hybrid option of greenhouses is likely to proliferate in the future.
Emerging markets
The cannabis industry trend of solar uptake is continuing in U.S. states where the plant has been legalized more recently, such as New York. Nate VerHague, market development manager at New York-based installer Solar Liberty, told pv magazine the new cannabis market “is going to have a ton of potential for solar.”
VerHague notes cannabis operations in New York state (NYS) are only just getting up and running. “There is going to be some extreme utility costs when it comes to electricity for these large operations,” he says. “It is an ideal customer for solar, as these facilities typically have a lot of roof space to utilize.”
While the nascent nature of the NYS market means Solar Liberty is yet to install PV for a cannabis company, VerHague confirms the installer is “in the quoting process with some organizations,” with the market looking promising from this year onward.
National and regional governments the world over are shaping to follow in the footsteps of the Canada, Mexico, Thailand, Uruguay, some U.S. states and others. Germany could legalize cannabis completely within a few years, a development that would not only make it the world’s single largest legal market but also, considering its European centrality, the world’s “dankest” domino, as neighbors would be expected to follow. Cannabis is becoming big business and, given its energy needs, could be big business for solar, too.

Scientists from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom created a triple-junction perovskite solar cell with a record efficiency of 24.3% with an open-circuity voltage of 3.21 V. They shared their findings in “Suppressed phase segregation for triple-junction perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Nature.
The NREL has certified the cell’s quasi-steady-state efficiency as 23.3%.
“This is, to our knowledge, the first reported certified efficiency for perovskite-based triple-junction solar cells,” the academics said, adding that triple-junction perovskite solar cells have so far demonstrated a maximum efficiency of around 20%.
The team started by using the perovskite ABX3, which is made from a mix of different substances, including cesium, lead, tin, iodine, bromine, and small organic molecules. Its top layer is composed of mixed halide perovskites with a particularly high proportion of bromine (Br) and iodine (I).
“What happens in light-induced phase separation of these mixed perovskites is that the bombardment of high-frequency photons causes the phases that are richer in bromine to get separated from those that are rich in iodine,” said Dr. Hao Chen, co-lead author of the study. “This leads to an increase in defects and a decrease in overall performance.”
To overcome this challenge, the academics used solid-state magnetic resonance spectroscopy to simulate the effect of altering the composition of the crystals. They found that replacing the organic molecules for an all-inorganic perovskite structure and replacing cesium (Cs) with the element rubidium (Rb) suppressed light-induced phase separation (LIPS).
“We find that Rb, with a smaller cation radius than Cs, can be doped into the inorganic perovskite lattice and that the upper limit of Rb doping content is positively correlated with Br content,” the scientists said. “The around 2.0 eV [band gap] Rb/Cs mixed-cation inorganic perovskites with a larger degree of lattice distortion than their Cs-based counterparts show suppressed LIPS because of the decreased average interatomic distance of the [Cs or Rb]-site cation and I, and the increased energy barrier of halide ion migration.”
The triple-junction cells reportedly retained 80% of their initial efficiency following 420 hours of operation at the maximum power point.
The team includes researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada and Northwestern University in the United States.
