The prototype is a 1/6 scale version of its 1 MW wave energy device. 
The goal of the pilot project deployment is to confirm the design and performance of the Triton wave energy converter. A full-scale device is planned for 2024. 
Triton is designed on a three-tendon architecture that enables the device to capture all degrees of freedom in a wave (heave, pitch, surge, roll, and yaw.) The device holds a multi-mode point absorber that consists of a geometrically optimized surface float connected to a ring-shaped, vertically asymmetric heave plate by three taut, flexible tendons. This unique architecture leads to greater average annual energy production and increased energy capture over a wide range of ocean conditions. 
The device uses flexible tendons to connect the float to the reaction ring. This allows the use of simpler and lower-cost installation strategies than other wave energy devices, said Oscilla.  
The Triton will be towed to deployment sites with the heave plate hard-mated to the bottom of the surface float. After mooring the surface float, the system is lowered to the deployment depth using temporary onboard winches. The winches are employed in reverse for heave plate recovery. 
These self-deployment and self-recovery functions remove the need for specialized vessels or heavy lift equipment during installation and recovery operations, said Oscilla. Only a regular tug boat is required to tow the system and supply hydraulic power for winch operations. 
Due to the unique wave conditions in the Castine Harbor testing area, the 1/6 scaled prototype unit will operate in the same manner as a full-scale unit during this 12-week test, said Oscilla. Winter wave conditions in Castine Harbor are approximately 1/6 the size of waves experienced on the U.S. west coast, providing a useful test scenario for the full-scale units. 
A goal of the testing is demonstration of the ability of Triton to withstand extreme weather events and harsh wave events. The device has a unique feature where it can submerge beneath the water to protect itself from damage.  
The testing will also be used to enable Oscilla to accurately predict the power that the full-scale system will generate in different wave conditions. 
“While we have excellent design and computer-driven simulations, there is no substitute for running the unit through its paces in a real operating environment,” said Tim Mundon, chief technology officer for Oscilla Power. “Thanks to the partnership with Maine Maritime Academy and the University of Maine, we’re able to complete this testing to validate our assumptions and numerical models to ensure our commercial production unit will perform as designed.”
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office has supported the company throughout its history with research grants. Ocean wave power is explored for its potential to pair with other intermittent renewables like solar and wind. DOE representatives were on-site during the launch of the prototype model.
“Marine energy technologies have tremendous promise to provide clean, reliable power to remote and coastal communities as well as for offshore work,” said Jennifer Garson, director, U.S. Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/06/over-half-of-solar-facility-loss-claim-costs-are-due-to-hail-damage/,"INSURANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 6, 2023",Over half of solar facility loss claim costs are due to hail damage,"GCube Insurance, an underwriter for renewable energy, said despite being only 1.4% of total number of claims filed, about 54% of incurred costs of total solar losses can be attributed to hail. This is based on data collected by Gcube over the past five years. Average costs totaled $58 million per claim.
The underwriter said this risk is being underestimated by solar asset owners, causing a gap between insurance requirements for solar projects and what is available in the market and leading to project delays and cancellations.
GCube insures more than 100 GW of renewables projects in 40 countries.
Other leading insurance risks include fires (16% of claims and 20% of total costs) and electrical failures (19% of total claims and 3.5% of total costs), based on five years of GCube data.
The insurance underwriter said in pursuit of a reduced levlized cost of electricity (LCOE), solar manufacturers have adopted larger, thinner modules with more fragile surface glass, leading to increased hail risk.
“Hail damage risk is undermining the security of solar power as a prominent clean energy solution,” said Fraser McLachlan, chief executive officer, GCube Insurance. “We therefore have an overriding imperative to develop solutions to this challenge and restore our ability as insurers to provide the sector with long term risk underwriting.”
Insurers have begun reducing coverage for solar businesses as hail risk intensifies, said GCube. The company has partnered with Solar Defender Technologies to move forward two patented technologies to address hail risks issues and make projects more palatable for risk underwriters.
The first solution is the Hail Strike Defender, a low-cost, capital expenditure neutral catchment net that protects single-axis solar installations while maintaining power output.
The second is called Solar Shield, designed for fixed-tilt solutions. It attaches a panel face protector that deflects the impact of hailstones.
“We can’t move quickly enough as the ability of insurers to cover solar’s global growth becomes increasingly constrained. Therefore, the unity of manufacturers, developers, operators, and insurers will be a vital part of softening the widening gap in insurance coverage,” said McLachlan.
Hailstorms, often unpredictable in nature and destructive to solar panels, pose a challenge to solar infrastructure. In 2021, hail related losses exceeded $1 billion across the United States.
Research suggests that hail begins to damage solar modules at starting at diameters of 3 cm, causing both invisible and visible damage to occur. Starting at 4 cm, the percentage of visible damage increases significantly.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/06/u-s-virgin-islands-cover-30-of-electricity-needs-with-six-solar-plus-battery-facilities/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"DECEMBER 6, 2023",U.S. Virgin Islands cover 30% of electricity needs with six solar-plus-battery facilities,"Honeywell Process Solutions announced it will provide Massachusetts-based renewable energy developer VIElectron with its first installment of battery energy storage systems (BESS) to accommodate six solar facilities across the U.S. Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John).  
All six of the Virgin Island installations use SEG solar modules. Three of the projects are in Saint Croix, two in St.Thomas, and one project is on St John. All projects use fixed-tilt, ground mount tracking, which VIelectron told pv magazine USA was engineered to withstand 185 MPH wind speeds. Construction has begun on the first three sites, and VIelectron expects the first project to be complete in late April or early May 2024.
The lithium-ion based BESS will add 124 MWh of energy storage co-located with the solar facilities. Grid-scale storage solutions can absorb fluctuations in demand, further stabilizing the grid by absorbing excess power during low usage and then releasing it during peak hours. The adjoining solar facilities will provide a total of 140 MW solar capacity.
The solar-plus-storage system is expected to fulfill 30% of the islands’ energy consumption needs.
According to the Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Virgin Islands have heavily relied on fossil fuels to generate electricity in the past. This means residents accrued expensive electricity costs that fluctuated with global oil prices.
“In 2009, the U.S. Virgin Islands were almost 100% dependent on imported oil for electricity, water desalination and transportation, resulting in electricity costs nearly four times the U.S. national average,” the DOE said. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration states that at the start of 2022, U.S. Virgin Island residents paid an average of ¢0.41 kW/h, down from ¢0.47 kW/h in 2015. However, this was almost three times more than the average U.S. power price of ¢0.15 kW/h in 2022. 
Since then, the U.S . Virgin Islands have set a goal to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels for energy production by 60% by 2025. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) adds that the U.S. Virgin Islands also want to generate 30% of peak capacity from renewables by 2025. According to the DOE, the territory is well on its way to reaching these goals due to its growing portfolio of renewable energy projects that include: 
“As we embark on a transformative journey toward renewable energy, Honeywell’s battery storage expertise aligns seamlessly with our vision,” said Gov. Bryan. Pramesh Maheshwari, president of Honeywell, added that the solar-plus-storage project will reduce the cost of energy for residents of the U.S. Virgin Island and function as an example of how sustainable technologies can make renewables more affordable for islanders everywhere.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/06/four-community-solar-projects-to-serve-lmi-residents-in-new-york-city-area/,"COMMUNITY,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 6, 2023",Four community solar projects to serve LMI residents in New York City area,"Ampion, a community solar subscription and revenue management company, is partnering with UGE, a developer that owns and operates community and commercial solar and battery storage projects, to bring four rooftop community solar projects to the greater New York City area.
The four projects total 2.76 MW and include the Spare Cube site in Peekskill, New York, the Feldco site in Staten Island, the Conduit Ave. site in Queens, and a 1.3 MW project on a high-profile development in Queens. About half of the sites’ electricity production will benefit commercial subscribers, while the other half is reserved for low- to-moderate income (LMI) subscribers. Ampion reports that subscribers to these sites will receive a 10 to 15% discount on their electric bill
The Spare Cube solar installation sits on top of a self-storage facility in Peekskill, N.Y. with wireless provider T-Mobile serving as the project’s anchor energy off-taker, with 50% of the project’s energy output reserved for low- to middle-income (LMI) subscribers.
“For the vast majority of New York City residents and businesses, installing solar panels is not an option,” said Nate Owen, Ampion’s CEO. “These sites address this issue of access while bringing meaningful cost savings.”
The Staten Island project is owned by Feldco, a real estate developer, and it will be built on top of the Expressway Plaza shopping center. At just over half a megawatt, the project is expected to offset roughly 700 metric tons of CO2 emissions each year and will produce enough electricity to power approximately 140 homes. Subscribers to the Expressway Plaza community solar project will save a minimum of 10% on their electricity bills.
The Conduit Ave. project will be built atop a 116,725 square foot modern warehouse under construction located near John F. Kennedy International Airport that is owned and developed by New York City-based real estate developer Wildflower Ltd LLC.
The 1.3 MW project, which is located in New York City, is located on a building that will be the anchor energy off-taker, with remaining energy generated reserved for residents and businesses in LMI communities. The project is expected to offset roughly 1,700 metric tons of CO2 each year, or the equivalent of what would be generated by burning 200,000 gallons of gasoline.
“These projects not only generate clean energy but also provide tangible financial benefits to underserved communities,” said Nick Blitterswyk, CEO at UGE. “We’re proud to be part of this initiative and look forward to further advancing the transition to renewable energy in the region.”
The way the subscription works begins with ConEdison customers enrolling in community solar. They are then assigned to a solar farm and are allotted a share of clean energy based on their electricity usage. The amount of energy produced by their share of the solar farm appears on their ConEdison bill as credits, which replace their current charges on their ConEdison bill. Ampion reports that the subscriber receives a discount on these credits compared to the standard offer rate.

New draft rules from the U.S. Department of Energy state that enterprises “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction” of China, Russia, North Korea or Iran, will not be eligible for subsidies under the nation’s USD 369 billion ($550 billion) IRA, nor the USD 550 billion Infrastructure and Jobs Act.
The upper limit of both direct stakes or “cumulative” investment is 25%, according to the draft guidance.
China is far and away Australia’s biggest trade partner, including for lithium and other critical minerals. China’s dominance in the sector has meant that a number of Australian projects have substantial Chinese ties. These ties come in the form of Chinese project ownership, investment, and off-take agreements.
For instance, Western Australian project Greenbushes, which produces most of Australia’s lithium, is owned by Chinese company Tianqi and U.S. giant Albermarle. Tianqi also holds a majority stake in the Kwinana lithium hydroxide refinery, which produced Australia’s first commercial quantities of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in 2022.
