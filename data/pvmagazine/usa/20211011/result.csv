But since both states began requiring smart inverters for new distributed solar, that problem has all but disappeared.
That’s because smart inverters can regulate voltage, and are configured to do so in both states. Smart inverters can also provide other grid services, setting the stage for customers to be paid for those services.
Recognizing the benefits, three other states will soon require smart inverters for new distributed solar and storage, and nine more have an open inquiry or docket to consider smart inverters.
Before smart inverters were required in California, each new solar installation on a distribution circuit would “nudge voltage up slightly,” said Brad Heavner of the California Solar & Storage Association. Once a circuit reached a certain level of solar installations “it became a grid issue” often resulting in a PV project delay or stoppage.
Now, not only are new PV systems in California not causing a problem, “they’re correcting any existing grid problems with voltage rise,” Heavner said. “I haven’t heard any complaints about voltage rise in at least a couple of years.”
Echoing his observations was Rocky Mould with the Hawaii Solar Energy Association, who said that voltage issues there once caused interconnection delays of more than a year and “potentially thousands of dollars of upgrade costs.” But now with smart inverters, “to our knowledge, no customer has been required to pay for a utility upgrade in nearly three years.”
While smart inverters in the two states provide voltage control autonomously through the “volt-var” function specified by regulators in each state, Heavner also said he looks forward to the communications-enabled functions of smart inverters.
For example, California has 690 MW of customer-sited energy storage. Heavner said that represents “a huge virtual power plant that can be tapped into at any time.”
Distributed battery storage could be directed to provide energy to the grid either by utility distributed energy resource management (DERM) systems, he said, or through aggregators “like the inverter companies, that are responding to price signals as they manage fleets of batteries.”
Heavner said that one approach using smart inverter capabilities could be opt-in dynamic pricing for customers that are set up to respond to pricing that changes every hour of the year. Another approach could be an emergency response program, whereby the independent system operator CAISO could issue a signal when “supplies are super tight, then everyone can discharge their batteries and get compensated for it.”
Likewise, the Hawaii Solar Energy Association and allied groups, said Mould, want customers who own solar and battery storage to be compensated for providing energy on an emergency response basis.
Mould would also like all customers with smart inverters to be eligible to provide frequency response grid services, and to be compensated for doing so.
Next year California and Hawaii are expected to adopt the smart inverter standard IEEE 1547-2018. Minnesota, New York, Maryland, and the District of Columbia also plan to adopt the IEEE standard. In nine other states, the utility regulatory body either had an inquiry or an open docket regarding the smart inverter standard, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

Each state that requires smart inverters for new distributed solar and storage will also consider which autonomous inverter settings should be activated. A new document from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory details the smart inverter settings for voltage control that are available in inverters compliant with IEEE 1547-2018, as well as the different functions of each setting. These voltage control settings are commonly known as volt-var, volt-watt, and watt-var.
Where there are major voltage problems in California, Heavner said that smart inverters can be directed to provide even more voltage support. That could make a big difference in locations where new voltage stabilization equipment otherwise would be required. With smart inverters “everywhere,” Heavner said, the devices could provide voltage support where it’s needed, and quickly.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/11/solar-deployed-on-rooftops-could-match-annual-u-s-electricity-generation/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 11, 2021",Solar deployed on rooftops could match annual U.S. electricity generation,"The United States has enough usable rooftop space to deploy an amount of solar equal to its current nationwide generation levels, according to recent research on global photovoltaic potential. Researchers at Ireland’s University of Cork leveraged big data, machine learning, and geospatial analysis to reach their findings, which were published in Nature Communications.
In the report, about 77,000 square miles of rooftop area worldwide was demarcated as usable PV surface area (for context, the state of Florida is roughly 65,000 square miles). The researchers said this area could result the production of 27 petawatt-hours, or 27 million GWh, if completely covered by conventional photovoltaics.
This level of potential energy would exceed 2018 total global electricity consumption, a year in which 6 petawatt-hours (PWh) of electricity was consumed by homes alone, and over 23 PWh consumed in total globally, per Statista.com.
The report further said that rooftops in the United States could host enough capacity to produce an annual 4.2 PWh per year, effectively matching the nation’s current total energy output of about 4 PWh per year.
In 2020, about 60% of U.S. electric generation came from fossil fuels, and roughly 20% each from nuclear and renewable energy sources, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). EIA estimated that the U.S. additionally produced 42 billion kWh of electricity from distributed, small-scale solar, about 1% of total generation. Large-scale solar accounted for 2.2% of total generation that year.
The authors of the paper in Nature Communications said there are mitigating factors in this potential PV outlook, including constraints around transmission, and the need for storage due to the intermittent generation cycles of solar energy.
This high potential for rooftop solar may come as good news for American ratepayers, as it may put some savings back in their pockets. Recently, it was estimated by Local Solar for All that collectively $109 billion in utility bill payments could be avoided by 2030 if rooftop solar were to scale up 2-4 times faster, vs. an all-utility-scale solar  deployment scenario.
The report is an important talisman to wield for those who are concerned about energy sprawl, or the development of land for energy generation. A study by Clemson University showed that in the U.S., including spacing and zoning requirements, roughly 500,000 square miles of land would need to be dedicated to new energy development by 2040, an area larger than Texas. Rooftops represent an alternative to using up otherwise useful lands.

“The open data generated in this research helps to quantify, locate and prioritize investment in zero-carbon electricity systems,” said study coauthor James Glynn, senior researcher at Columbia University.
Potential costs for rooftop solar across the globe were also evaluated in the Nature Communications paper, and it was found that costs range  depending on location. The lowest per-megawatt-hour costs were in China ($68) and India ($66), and the highest costs were in the U.K. ($251) and the U.S. ($238).

Reliance New Energy Solar (RNES) is acquiring Norway-based module manufacturer REC Group from China National Bluestar Group for $771 million and will move forward with plans to develop a 1 GW module facility in the U.S.
RNES is an arm of Indian multinational company Reliance Industries Ltd. Earlier this year, it announced plans to invest close to $10 billion to establish a “fully integrated, end-to-end renewable energy ecosystem.” The company also announced it acquired a 40% stake in engineering, procurement, and construction supplier Sterling and Wilson.
RNES plans to integrate REC’s production technology in its plans for a vertically integrated, silicon-to-module manufacturing site in Jamnagar, India. REC Group additionally stated that its new owner’s financial strength will help it to realize plans to expand its current base of around 2 GW PV cell and module production capacity located in Singapore to 5 GW over the next two to three years, add  new 2 GW cells and module facility in France, as well as the planned 1 GW module facility in the U.S.
Currently, REC has three manufacturing facilities – two in Norway for making solar-grade polysilicon and one in Singapore for producing PV cells and modules, and a global workforce of over 1,300.
Reliance Industries is led by Mukesh Ambani, currently ranked by Bloomberg as the 11th richest person in the world. The group reported net profits of $7.4 billion for the year ending March 31, primarily from activities in the fossil fuel segment. In June, Ambani announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in a new venture across the renewable energy sector, including plans to span the entire solar supply chain, as well as make investments in energy storage and hydrogen.

The bill passed the legislature by a 90-20 vote, sending it to Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk, where many renewable energy advocates hope for a veto. Although the bill covers early coal plant closures, investment in new renewable generation, and multi-year rate plans, those against it argued that those provisions don’t outweigh its flaws, namely the new gas additions and reduced oversight of the state’s utilities.
North Carolina Department of Transportation
The bill looks to put many of the state’s coal plants on an accelerated retirement schedule, at a schedule to be determined by state regulators.
The bill also calls on state regulators to develop a plan for the state’s utilities to achieve the emissions reduction goal, mandate if passed, through power generation, transmission and distribution, grid modernization, storage, energy efficiency measures, demand-side management, and emerging technology, no later than the end of 2022.
That plan would be reviewed every two years and may be adjusted if deemed necessary by regulators and the state’s utilities.
The new solar generation capacity brought on by the proposed bill would be divided so that Duke would be allowed to build 55% of all new renewable capacity, with no limit on single-project capacity.  Independent power producers would sell Duke the remaining 45% via power purchase agreements, all coming from projects 80 MW or less in capacity.
The bill would also allow Duke to implement multi-year rate plans (MYRP), a rate structure that the utility has been pursuing for some time. The MYRP is a process by which the utility can start charging customers for projected future costs. The current process that looks backward at costs actually incurred.
For the first year of the plan, however, there would be no limit and regulators would not be allowed to make changes to a proposal from Duke, just approve or deny such a plan, curbing their traditional jurisdiction.
The MYRP outlined in HB 951 would take place over three years, limit possible rate increases in the second and third years to 4%, and allow Duke to institute performance-based ratemaking (PBR) and standby charges.
PBR would allow regulators to incentivize or penalize utilities’ performance based on certain public policy goals, like emission reductions. However, in this instance, the bill calls for a “minimum system method” which experts have argued unfairly places costs on residential customers and “low-use” users.
The standby charges would apply to customers who install more than 100 kW of solar on their property. It is the same type of discriminatory rate that has been instituted in other parts of the country in an effort to deter private investment in solar.
In response to the bill’s passage in the legislature, Vote Solar released a statement calling on Gov. Cooper to veto HB 951. It said the bill as a whole “erodes critical oversight of powerful utility companies and should not be signed into law.”
The statement called the bill a disappointing result of what was an opportunity for Duke and legislature to craft “strong and equitable” energy legislation that meets the needs of North Carolina families
