The Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded $7.4 million to seven projects to develop medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicle (EV) charging and hydrogen corridor infrastructure plans that will benefit millions of drivers across 23 states.
“A clean transportation sector requires vast investments across the entire industry, including to decarbonize the trucks that move our goods and building more charging ports to get those trucks from coast to coast,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic clean energy laws are making it possible for us to get more EVs on the road by expanding charging infrastructure into underserved communities, while reducing range and cost anxiety among drivers who want to go electric.”
Freight corridor focus
The projects will advance the President’s decarbonization goals by accelerating the deployment of medium- and heavy-duty EV charging and refueling infrastructure to reduce emissions from freight corridors and the depots, ports, and other facilities those corridors service. The freight corridors include those serving Northern and Southern California, the Eastern Seaboard, the Northeast, Southwest, and much of the Midwest.
Selected projects support DOE’s Justice40 priorities by demonstrating the impacts and benefits of these freight corridors plans on underserved communities. The projects would also help improve air quality in underserved areas of major American cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, San Francisco, Oakland, and Salt Lake City.
The selected projects are:
Charging infrastructure
The Joint Office of Energy and Transportation issued a funding Notice of Intent to address challenges to achieving an equitable clean transportation future. The funding is expected to expand charging infrastructure in underserved communities.
Anticipated topic areas include:
These announcements will help companies implement the requirements included in the recently published minimum standards developed by DOT with DOE input for federally funded EV infrastructure. They will also support the forthcoming $2.5 billion in competitive grants to build alternative fueling infrastructure in communities across the United States.
The combined measures will move the U.S. closer to achieving the goal of 500,000 EV chargers along with the plan for half the new light-duty vehicles sales being electric by 2030 and a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/16/mcdonalds-signs-on-for-180-mw-of-louisiana-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,LOUISIANA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",McDonald’s signs on for 180 MW of Louisiana solar,"McDonald’s corporation announced it signed a power purchase agreement for the entire production of a 180 MW solar project in Louisiana. The Prairie Ronde solar project is expected to produce 327 GWh of electricity each year, equivalent to the energy demand of 30,700 U.S. homes.
Lightsource bp will finance, build, own and operate the facility, while McDonald’s will purchase all of the electricity generated by the project. The output is equivalent to about 630 restaurants’ energy demand each year.
Construction of the project is expected to begin in early 2023, with commercial operations starting in late 2024. Approximately 250 construction jobs for 18 months and $20 million in new revenues are expected to be brought to the local community. The privately funded solar facility is expected to cost in excess of $170 million and will require $3.9 million in annual investment to maintain the facility and its land.
“This deal marks McDonald’s second solar project in Louisiana in partnership with Lightsource bp, bringing our statewide total of solar assets to 525 megawatts representing a cumulative half billion-dollar private investment,” said Kevin Smith, chief executive officer, Lightsource bp, Americas. “McDonald’s is a great example of a corporate buyer whose commitment to sustainability is driving massive investment in new clean energy infrastructure for America’s energy security and clean energy future.”
In 2021, McDonald’s and eBay both reached agreements with Lightsource bp to purchase power from the 345 MW Ventress Solar project, which is slated to finish construction this year. Lifetime operations are estimated to generate a $30 million dollar boost to Pointe Coupee Parish.
McDonald’s aims for a 31% reduction in emissions intensity per metric ton of food and packaging across its supply chain by 2030 from 2015 levels.
Corporate solar
Corporate adoption of solar is on a sharp rise as large companies continue to adopt environmental, social, and governance goals, and the cost of building new utility-scale solar projects falls below the cost of fossil fuel facilities like coal plants. About half of all cumulative corporate solar capacity has been installed in the last 18 months, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Meta (formerly Facebook) increased its installed solar capacity from 177 MW in early 2019 to 3.6 GW in 2022 and now has the largest corporate solar portfolio in the United States.
Recent growth is due to the expansion of off-site corporate solar procurement, which now represents 55% of all commercial solar use. Almost 70% of all off-site corporate solar has been brought online since 2019.
“Whether it’s installed on a warehouse roof, on a carport or at an off-site facility, [corporate solar adoption is] showing the various ways that companies are meeting their needs with clean, affordable energy. From data centers to industrial freezers, the most energy-intensive business operations are turning to solar as the most reliable and affordable way to power their infrastructure,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer of SEIA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/16/three-global-trends-for-solar-in-2023/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",Three global trends for solar in 2023,"Ongoing supply chain disruptions, shifting renewable energy procurement goals, and a global energy crisis took hold in 2022. This year, some of these trends are evolving to a new stage in the energy transition. S&P Global offers three global trends to watch in 2023. 
Component prices decline 
After two years of feeling the effects of tightened supply chains, raw materials and shipping costs are declining in 2023. Global shipping costs have lowered to pre-pandemic levels. However, S&P Global said this cost relief won’t immediately translate to lower coverall capital expenditures for renewable energy projects. 
S&P Global said land access and grid connections are proving to be the biggest bottleneck for the industry. This is leading to an unintended consequence of driving up development costs, as investors rush to deploy capital in markets where interconnection availability is insufficient, and investors are willing to pay premiums for faster, construction-ready projects. 
Another change pushing prices upward is the shortage of skilled workers, causing a rise in construction labor costs. This, along with a rising cost of capital, will likely prevent any noticeable price declines in project capex in the near term, said S&P Global. 
PV module prices have fallen faster than expected in early 2023, as polysilicon supply becomes more abundant. This relief will likely trickle down to module prices, though it is expected to be offset by manufacturers looking to recover margins. 
Further down the value chain, installers and distributors are expected to increase their margins. S&P said this will likely lead to less cost relief benefits to rooftop solar end-users, while utility-scale developers will benefit from lowered costs more. S&P projects utility-scale demand to intensify globally, particularly in cost-sensitive emerging markets. 
Distributed generation 
In 2022, distributed solar consolidated its position as a mainstream electricity supply option in many established markets.  
In 2023, S&P Global expects the technology to spread to new consumer segments and gain ground in new markets. New types of households and small businesses will gain access as shared solar options become available, and PV systems are expected to increasingly be attached with energy storage. 
Among households, upfront cash payments remain the most common investment option, though electricity distributors continue to push for a more diversified landscape that includes rental, lease, and power purchase agreement contracts. These financing models are expected to spread beyond the U.S., where they have been deployed extensively over the past decade. 
As liquidity becomes a major concern for many businesses, commercial and industrial customers are expected to increasingly adopt third-party financing as well. For the providers of third-party financed PV systems, the challenge is to secure contracts with credit-worthy offtakers, said S&P Global. 
The overall policy landscape is expected to favor more distributed generation, either through cash grants, value-added tax reductions, tax rebates, or feed-in tariffs. 
Local manufacturing 
Supply chain challenges and national security concerns have led to an increased focus on local manufacturing of solar and energy storage, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. An emphasis on reducing reliance on imported gas has caused renewable energy to become the center of energy supply strategies. 
New policy like the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and REPowerEU in Europe are drawing in large investment in new manufacturing capacity. It will also lead to a boost in deployment. S&P Global expects a 2023 global buildout of close to 500 GW of wind, solar, and battery energy storage, over 20% more than the amount installed in 2022. 
“However, concerns persist over Chinese dominance of the manufacturing of the equipment—particularly for solar and batteries—and the various risks involved in being over-dependent on a single region to supply the required goods,” said S&P Global.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/16/irs-releases-guidance-on-low-income-solar-tax-credit-booster/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",IRS releases guidance on low-income solar tax credit booster,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has released guidance on the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program. The program provides an incentive that potentially increases the investment tax credit from 30% up to 40% for up to 900 MWdc of solar and wind, and 50% for an additional 900 MW of solar and wind power projects.
Projects in Category 1 and 2 qualify for a 10% increase to the Investment Tax Credit, while those in Category 3 and 4 qualify for a 20% increase.

Category 3 and 4 applications will be accepted first, sometime in the fall of 2023. The exact date will be announced via a website, which has not yet been developed. After 60 days, the IRS will switch to applications for Category 1 and 2.
If the program has more capacity applications than it has available capacity, the selection will be made via a lottery process. Projects are not allowed to be placed in service prior to being approved for the incentive.
There is a maximum individual project capacity of five megawatts (ac). The facilities must be placed in service within four years of receiving their award letters.
The program in the guidance is available throughout 2023 and 2024, and any excess capacity from 2024 may be carried forward and applied in 2025.
The document defines the four categories of project types:
Category 1 projects must either be located in areas with a 20% or higher poverty rate, or where the median family income is 80% of either the statewide or metropolitan area’s median family income. Category 2 projects must be located on federally designated Native American land. Category 3 projects must be installed on an affordable housing building, and the electricity must be shared equitably among the occupants of that building. The final grouping, Category 4, requires at least 50% of the financial benefits of a facility’s electricity go to “households with income of less than 200% of the poverty line … or making less than 80% of area median gross income”.
If a Category 1 or 2 project also qualifies as Category 3 or 4, then it will be considered a Category 3 or 4 facility, and will therefore be eligible for the 50% tax credit.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/16/maryland-bill-to-boost-adoption-of-residential-solar/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,MARYLAND",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",Maryland bill to boost adoption of residential solar,"Sponsored by Maryland Senator Brian J. Feldman and Delegate Lily Qi, Senate Bill 664 and House Bill 1239, would increase Maryland’s residential clean energy grant from $1,000 to $5,000 to boost adoption of rooftop solar and create local clean energy jobs.
This bill would fund rooftop solar grants through fees and penalties paid by companies that do not meet the state’s clean energy requirements, minimizing the cost to taxpayers and ensuring those fees are directed toward promoting renewable energy. It would also enhance clean energy incentives for low- and moderate-income residents, as well as those living in overburdened and underserved communities.
“Maryland has set some of the nation’s most ambitious goals for reducing emissions and achieving climate equity. We cannot meet our state’s ambitious goals unless we make it easier for Maryland residents to enjoy the economic and environmental benefits of clean energy,” said Maryland State Senator Brian Feldman, sponsor of SB0664. “With this bill we have an opportunity to reboot Maryland’s rooftop solar industry and create thousands of jobs in the process, while providing incentives that make solar power more accessible to lower-income households.”
Incentivizing the adoption of residential rooftop solar will be crucial to achieving Maryland’s ambitious climate goals laid out in the Climate Solutions Now Act, which passed in April 2022. The plan speeds up Maryland’s current goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 40% of 2006 levels to 60% by 2031, and net-zero emissions by 2045. The Maryland Department of the Environment is currently is working on a conceptual road map due by the end of June 2023, with the final plan is due at the end of the year. 
Rooftop solar in Maryland has slowed down considerably since its peak in 2016, and the state is only expected to install just over 1 GW of solar in the next five years, which currently projects to be 31st in the nation over that time, according to Solar Energy Industries Association.

“Expanding residential solar is an opportunity for Maryland to address the climate crisis while creating jobs and boosting our state’s economic competitiveness,” said Maryland Delegate Lily Qi, sponsor of HB1239. “This bill moves us toward Maryland’s ambitious climate goals in a way that is inclusive of households of all income levels and makes clean energy accessible to the communities who have disproportionately been affected by rising energy costs.”
A coalition of rooftop solar advocates, workforce development groups, energy equity champions, and renewable energy companies launched a campaign to advocate for legislation that would make solar power more accessible and affordable for all Marylanders. One of those groups is the Maryland Rooftop Solar Coalition (MRSC), which is comprised of companies that finance, sell, design, and install solar systems with the objective of reviving the rooftop solar market in the state. Coalition members include Solar Energy World, Trinity Solar, GoodLeap, Sunnova, Dividend Finance, Lumina Solar, IGS, SunPower, Sunrun, ADT, Solar United Neighbors, and Solar Energy Services.
“While we’ve seen growth in the utility scale solar market in Maryland since the Maryland Clean Energy Jobs Act passed in 2019, residential solar continues to lag behind despite playing a critical role in meeting the state’s climate goals,” said Ed Merrick, chair of MRSC. “We need to rebuild this industry and do it in a way that includes all Marylanders by leveraging our existing built infrastructure. Incentivizing the installation of residential rooftop solar through the state’s existing grant program will help make clean energy more accessible and affordable for all Maryland residents, regardless of their financial status.”
Supporters of the bill point out that equitable access to solar energy will also be a key aspect of expanding clean energy usage and cutting emissions in Maryland, which will require outreach and assistance for low- and moderate-income families who have been disproportionately burdened by legacy polluting fossil fuel infrastructure.
“Residential solar is a vital energy resource that empowers Maryland homeowners to reduce their utility bills, build resilience from power outages, and gain energy independence,” said Kimberly Armstrong, Maryland Program Director, Solar United Neighbors (SUN). “Rooftop solar is a shining example of how to utilize and produce homegrown clean energy that directly benefits local residents and communities. Solar is an abundant solution that will help Maryland put an end to its dependence on dirty, expensive energy that is vulnerable to inflation forces and foreign disruption.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/16/10-billion-from-the-ira-to-help-clean-up-the-industry/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",$10 billion from the IRA to help clean up the industry,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has released guidance on how it will allocate $10 billion for the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit program for “qualifying advanced energy projects” and “specified advanced energy property,” by funding the modification or establishment of certain types of facilities.
An eligible project can receive a credit of up to 30% of its cost. The document notes, “a credit is not allowed under § 48C for any qualified investment for which a credit is allowed under §§ 48, 48A, 48B, 48E, 45Q, or 45V.”
The first allocation round will be open for submissions on May 31, 2023 at https://infrastructure-exchange.energy.gov/. The Department of the Treasury and the IRS will issue additional guidance on that day. The first round is anticipated to allocate no more than $4 billion in credits; subsequent rounds will deploy the remaining funds. A portion of the award credits – approximately $1.6 billion – is slated for projects located in “energy communities”.
After applicants register, the U.S. Department of Energy will ask them to submit concept papers. After a review, the department will “encourage or discourage taxpayers” from moving forward with their applications. The final day of acceptance of the concept papers is June 31, 2023.
Upon receiving an award letter, applicants will have two years to deploy their project.
The IRS states that re-equipping, expanding, or establishing a recycling facility is also eligible for funding. To qualify, recycling facilities must process “specified advanced energy property” – a comprehensive category of eligible technologies that includes all sorts of renewable energy generation and storage, grid modernization, electrification, and decarbonization. Products of eligible recycling facilities would include batteries, solar panels, wind turbine blades, and a number of specific “critical materials” that are vital to manufacturing renewables. 
In order for an industrial, manufacturing, or recycling center to qualify for funds to re-equip their facility, the project must cut emissions by a minimum of 20%. Low- or zero-carbon process heat systems, carbon capture, and energy efficiency systems that meet the 20% emissions reduction target are eligible for the program. 
The document also specifies that funds must not contribute to any portion of a project that is used in the refining or blending of non-renewable transportation fuels.
The program was launched in concert with the $750 million Advanced Energy Manufacturing and Recycling Grant Program, which is now accepting applications. The program is funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and is designed to support industrial projects by small- and medium-sized manufacturers in energy communities.

Lightleaf has developed a new carbon fiber 110 W PV module for boat applications.
“Our latest product is aimed at the marine market, targeting sail and power boats with limited space where weight, functionality, and looks are important,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “We’ve designed a panel, the seaLeaf, with integrated hardware, but also have panels with interchangeable mounting kits designed to withstand the marine environment.”
The Canadian solar manufacturer said the seaLeaf has a rigid carbon-fiber foam foundation instead of glass. It measures 1,073 mm x 575 mm, is 9 mm thick, and weighs 2.5 kg. The curved solar panel includes two quick-release clamps installed 50 cm apart. These can purportedly attach to any one-inch rail and rotate 180 degrees to track the sun.
The new module has an open circuit voltage of 22.9 V, and a short circuit current of 6.35 A. It uses 32 SunPower Maxeon GIII Premium ME3 monocrystalline solar cells with 25.1% efficiency. The junction box is sealed and potted, uses two Schottky bypass diodes, and has IP67 protection. The device includes a 3-meter marine grade 14 AWG round cable with a plain end for simple bulkhead gland installation.

“The majority of our supply chain is North American sourced, and our panels are entirely designed and assembled in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, [Canada]” said the Lightleaf spokesperson.
The seaLeaf costs $650 and comes with a three-year workmanship, and five-year power output warranty. Leightleaf has previously developed carbon fiber solar panels for the RV market, but it has mainly targeted small trailers with limited space.
“The nature of the panels allows them to be mounted while in transport and removed/deployed when parked,” said the spokesperson.
