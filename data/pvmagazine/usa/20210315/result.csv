The Fort Green Power Plant will be built on around 500 acres in Hardee County, southeast of Tampa, and will consist of roughly 265,000 solar panels, using a fixed-tilt racking system. The Bay Trail Solar Power Plant will be built on 500 acres in Citrus County, north of Tampa, and will consist of around 197,000 tracking bifacial solar panels.
Specific manufacturers for the modules, racking, and trackers were not released.
Both plants are being developed as part of Duke Energy Florida’s commitment to quadruple the amount of in-service solar on its system over the next four years. The utility currently has more than 900 MW of solar generation under construction or in operation.
According to Duke, the Bay Trail facility is the site of a future mining operation and the Fort Green site is a former phosphate mine.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/15/muni-utility-sues-ercot-as-fallout-from-texas-electric-power-crisis-continues/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,POLICY,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 15, 2021",Muni utility sues ERCOT as fallout from Texas’ electric power crisis continues,"Municipal utility CPS Energy filed a lawsuit against the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) in a move it said was intended to protect customers from “excessive, illegitimate, and illegal prices” stemming from a mid-February winter storm.
A utility statement said that “ERCOT’s failure” during the days-long weather event and related power shortages led to “one of the largest illegal transfers of wealth in the history of Texas.”
The San Antonio-based utility alleged in its lawsuit that ERCOT “ran up $20 billion in charges” for five days of energy supply due to its “lack of oversight, preparedness, and failure to follow its own protocols.”
In early March, an Independent Market Monitor concluded that ERCOT likely overcharged market players to the tune of $16 billion, and recommended that regulators direct that the amount be reversed. Resignations have cut the number of regulatory commissioners from three to one, and that remaining Public Utility Commission (PUC) member, Arthur D’Andrea, has stood firm against such calls.
Resignations have cut the number of regulatory commissioners from three to one.

In its lawsuit, CPS Energy asked the court to act to prevent harm to CPS Energy and its customers. It alleged breach of contract, negligence, and violation of the Texas Constitution.
The lawsuit said that as the electric power crisis deepened, it became clear that there was not enough power available to meet demand. The PUC and ERCOT raised prices from $30/MWh to $9,000/MWh and “held them there for an extended period of time.”
That move was compounded by the addition of ancillary services prices, which reached as high as $25,000/MWh, a level that CPS Energy called excessive.
The lawsuit alleged that ERCOT issued a call to the market to curtail more than 10 GW of load on Feb. 15. Regulators also issued orders on Feb. 15 and again on Feb. 16 in which they said that energy prices across the system were clearing at less than $9,000/MWh, and that prices should “reflect scarcity of the supply.”
In other words, if customer load was being shed, then scarcity by definition was at its maximum. That means the market price for energy also should have been at its highest, according to the lawsuit’s explanation of regulators’ thinking.
However, according to the Independent Market Monitor, ERCOT recalled the last of its instructions to shed firm load at 11:53 p.m. on Feb. 17. The lawsuit said that prices that had been at the System-Wide Offer Cap of $9,000 “should have ended immediately at that time.”
Instead, ERCOT held market prices at that level for an additional 32 hours through the morning of Feb. 19.
On March 1, the largest power cooperative in Texas filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, saying it received a $1.8 billion bill from ERCOT that it is unable to pay. Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc. filed for reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.
In a statement, Brazos said ERCOT sent it “excessively high invoices” with payment required “within days.” The company said that it “cannot and will not foist this catastrophic financial event” on its members and consumers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/15/maryland-advances-supercharged-climate-action-bill/,"POLICY,MARYLAND",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 15, 2021",Maryland advances supercharged climate action bill,"The Maryland Senate passed a climate bill that would boost the state’s current target to cut emissions, support rooftop solar and electric vehicles, and plant 5 million new trees, among other actions.
Two Republicans joined Democratic senators in approving the bill with a 34-11 vote on March 12. However, some lawmakers voiced concerns about certain goals and funding issues.
S.B.0414, the Climate Solutions Now Act of 2021, would require the state to slash greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 60% from 2006 levels by 2030. That’s a 20 percentage point increase from the state’s existing 40% by 2030 reduction mandated by a 2016 law. It’s also above a 50% goal the Maryland Department of the Environment recently proposed in its delayed climate action plan.
The bill would electrify the state’s fleet by requiring all new buses and light-duty vehicles to be zero emission.

To help encourage rooftop solar adoption, the bill would require new commercial and residential buildings with a gross floor area of 25,000 square feet or more to be built “solar-ready.” Buildings would need to be designed so that at least 40% of the roof area is free from obstructions and capable of handling a solar installation. A state department would be tasked with adopting the regulations by July 2022, and a local jurisdiction could exempt new buildings that meet certain criteria, such as having too much shade.
These climate actions would build on the state’s current 50% by 2030 renewable portfolio standard, a mandate Gov. Larry Hogan has proposed increasing to 100% by 2040. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, Maryland ranked 17th in the country for installed solar capacity with about 1.3 GW.
The bill was championed by over 100 Maryland organizations, many of which belong to the Climate Solutions Now Coalition.
In a statement applauding the bill’s passage, Maryland League of Conservation Voters Executive Director Kim Coble thanked the senate for taking a “huge leap forward in correcting the long-standing inequity of climate pollution in communities of color and fighting climate change.”
Several Republicans, however, took issue with provisions in the bill. According to a local report, some senators argued that the 60% by 2030 GHG cut was overly ambitious, raised concerns that the tree planting could lead to deer overpopulation, and disagreed with the bill’s mandate to divert $15 million annually for the tree initiative from a fund dedicated to water infrastructure upgrades.
The Climate Solutions Now Act of 2021 goes to the Maryland House, where a committee is considering a companion bill.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/15/fpl-green-hydrogen-pilot-could-herald-a-scale-up-using-solar-and-wind-resources/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,FLORIDA",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 15, 2021",FPL ‘green’ hydrogen pilot could herald a scale-up using solar and wind resources,"Within Florida Power & Light’s (FPL) recently-filed four-year rate request with the Florida Public Service Commission is a commitment to “investments to build a more sustainable energy future.”
The pledge in the regulatory filing includes the utility’s “30-by-30” plan to install 30 million solar panels in Florida by 2030, as well as plans to build what the utility said would be the world’s largest integrated solar-powered battery and a green hydrogen pilot project.
The battery system is the Manatee Energy Storage Center, a 409 MW behemoth that could begin serving customers in late 2021. FPL’s Gulf Power unit said on Feb. 25 that it had begun construction on the project. The project is expected to help speed the retirement of aging natural gas units at a nearby power plant.
The green hydrogen pilot project was first announced by NextEra Energy, FPL’s parent company, in July 2020.
NextEra plans to invest $65 million into the pilot, which will use power from otherwise curtailed solar energy to produce green hydrogen via a 20 MW electrolysis system.
It’s worth noting that NextEra ranks as one of the nation’s largest solar and wind developers. So, although a 20 MW pilot may not initially move the needle toot much, NextEra’s vast wind and solar also comes with a lot of curtailed renewable generation. If the pilot proves successful and scalable, the company could look toward a serious buildout of more hydrogen producing facilities that could replace fossil fuels.
For now, the green hydrogen produced as part of the pilot would replace some of the natural gas combusted at FPL’s 1.75 GW Okeechobee power plant. Rather than build a new hydrogen plant, FPL is retrofitting an existing plant to accommodate the fuel source.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/15/new-optical-coating-could-extend-lifetime-of-solar-pv-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 15, 2021",New optical coating could extend lifetime of solar PV cells,"University researchers have developed a new class of optical coatings they said could make photovoltaic (PV) cells used for solar energy last six times longer, decreasing the cost of replacing worn-out cells.
The work is a collaboration between scientists at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Ohio and the University of Rochester in New York.
Optical coatings are layers of material deposited on a surface, usually the lens of an instrument, to either reflect or filter light into different wavelengths. They are an integral part of almost every optical instrument, from eyeglasses to telescopes.
The new coatings can be made to fully reflect a narrow wavelength that corresponds to the range that efficiently produces electricity by a PV cell. That means the coatings could lead to a high-performance, low-cost solution to a hurdle that faces solar energy generation, said Giuseppe Strangi, physics professor at CWRU.

The PV problem is two-fold: PV panels produce energy efficiently during the day, when energy demand is relatively low, but not after sunset, when demand remains high. What’s more, storing energy generated from PV panels can be expensive.
Strangi and his collaborators created a novel coating made from a 15 nanometer-thick film of germanium (similar to silicon or tin) that can both simultaneously reflect and transmit the same wavelength, or color, and do both with a high degree of clarity.
The researchers call this new class of coatings Fano Resonance Optical Coatings (FROCs) in a nod to Ugo Fano, an Italian-born American physicist who worked with nuclear scientist Enrico Fermi.
Shaped resonances—essentially, a phenomenon in which two light waves are superimposed—are the foundation behind light wave transport, and also the development of this new class of optical coatings.

The new coatings, in addition to their ability to be fine-tuned to reflect the perfect PV wavelength, could also be made to absorb the rest of the solar spectrum. That means they could efficiently transfer those wavelengths to heat. And storing that thermal energy is relatively inexpensive, compared to storing electricity.
The approach would also protect the PV cell from overheating, leading to the promise of that six-fold increase in PV cells lifespan, Strangi said.
The solar energy application in this new process of manipulating wave-optics at the nanoscale will take some time to develop, the scientists said. The advancement in optical coatings also could lead to other applications.
The research work is detailed in a paper in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.

The Madero and Ignacio plants will provide grid support, including frequency regulation, to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
The order was placed by Able Grid Energy Solutions, a utility-scale energy storage project development arm of MAP RE/ES. Wärtsilä has also signed 10-year guaranteed asset performance agreements for the equipment. As part of the deal, Wärtsilä will supply its GridSolv Quantum energy storage technology as well as a management platform to monitor and control energy flow.
The agreement includes maintenance services, an availability guarantee, and a flexible capacity guarantee based on usage. The systems are expected to enter service in January 2022.
Able Grid will provide construction management and asset management services for the facility, which will be owned by an unnamed privately held energy storage power producer.
Hawaiian Electric told the state’s utility regulators that it isn’t entirely responsible for delays and rising project costs stemming from current interconnection processes for renewable energy projects. The utility said that “all parties involved in the process”—including developers, their engineers, suppliers, contractors, and permitting agencies—play a role in interconnection delays.
In a filing with regulators, the utility said it had cut five months off its interconnection review timeline and said it looked forward to finding ways to further streamline the interconnection process.
The state’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) opened a docket into the utility’s interconnection processes, which the PUC said are causing “unnecessary delays and increasing project costs.” The docket called problems “pervasive” across community-based renewable energy as well as utility-scale projects.
Regulators said that the “opacity” of Hawaiian Electric’s current interconnection processes adds to the challenges encountered by project developers. It said the lack of transparency has led to the potential for “significant setback” to the state’s renewable energy goals. In particular, delays could jeopardize the retirement of a 180 MW coal-fired power plant in September 2022 and impact grid reliability on the island of Oahu.
The utility said that the 135 MW Kapolei Energy Storage project is intended to largely replace the coal-fired plant’s power capacity. It said the storage project is still scheduled for commercial operation in June 2022. It said the project’s timeline could slip to the end of that year without affecting reserve margins or grid reliability. However, a project delay past 2022 and up to mid-2023 “would prove more problematic,” the utility said.
Australian energy storage company Redflow Ltd will supply a 2 MWh energy storage system made up of 192 zinc-bromine flow batteries to Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility in San Bernardino County, California, 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
The microgrid project was funded in part by a grant from the California Energy Commission and consists of batteries, a biogas conditioning system to support a 2.0 MW biogas-fueled cogeneration unit, and a microgrid control system. The facility will convert 700 tonnes per day of organic waste and 300 tonnes per day of biosolids into renewable natural gas and Class A fertilizer.
The batteries will supply energy daily from 4-9 pm, during peak tariff period. Under the contract, Redflow will receive more than $1.2 million for the system. Redflow said that while each battery has a rated energy storage capacity of 10 kWh, in practice, each battery stores about 10.5 kWh of energy.
Florida Power & Light Company filed a four-year request with the Florida Public Service Commission for new base rates that would be phased in beginning in 2022. The filing includes a request for a Solar Base Rate Adjustment mechanism in 2024 and 2025 to recover up to 894 MW of solar projects in each year. If the full amount of new solar capacity is constructed, cost recovery through rates would total $140 million in 2024 and 2025, which would be partially offset by a fuel cost reduction on customer bills.
The plan also includes building what it said would be one of the world’s largest solar-powered batteries and a green hydrogen pilot project.
