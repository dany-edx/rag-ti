As part of the acquisition, Kore has also launched KORE Solutions, a full-service storage integrator that will operate as a division of the US-based battery manufacturer, allowing Kore Power to become a vertically integrated energy solutions provider. Kore has also shared that it will immediately add 25 positions to its Waterbury, Vermont location, and that Jay Bellows, formerly President and CEO of NRI, will become President of Kore Power
“Kore Solutions brings the full weight of NRI’s expertise and support to optimize our storage technology offerings,” said Founder and CEO of Kore Power, Lindsay Gorrill. “Full integration of our product line allows us to provide better service, superior performance and safety.”

To kick of 2022, Kore Power announced that it had come to terms with Novonix on a letter of intent to enter into investment and supply agreements, under which Novonix will acquire an approximately 5% stake in Kore Power and will become the exclusive supplier of graphite anode materials to Kore Power’s large-scale battery cell manufacturing facility in the US.
Kore currently has an annual production capacity of 2GWh and expects to expand to a total annual capacity of 18GWh by the end of 2030. This jump in production capacity is expected to be facilitated by Kore Power’s plans to build a 12GWh manufacturing facility in Buckeye, Arizona to support the local market need for battery cells and systems. This facility will need close to 12,000 tonnes per year of graphite anode material when fully operational, which will be supplied by Novonix.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/23/new-york-hits-1gw-of-community-solar/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 23, 2022",New York hits 1GW of community solar,"The ribbon cutting for DSD Renewables’ new 7.5MW community solar project in Schenectady County, New York was met with considerably more fanfare than a typical project of its capacity, as the state’s Lieutenant Governor, Brian Benjamin, used the opportunity to announce that the state has reached more than 1GW of community solar installed and operational.
That milestone supplants New York as the top community solar market in the United States, edging out incumbent Minnesota, which has installed 830MW of operational community solar capacity as of February 2022, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.
“Reaching this nation-leading milestone – with more than one gigawatt of community solar installed – is a testament to New York’s aggressive pursuit of clean-energy alternatives that will supercharge our economy and bring us one step closer to a carbon-neutral future,” Governor Kathy Hochul said.
This community solar market dominance is only set to grow, as New York’s distributed solar pipeline is now comprised of more than 708 community solar installations, all in pursuit of achieving 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and the governor’s goal to achieve 10GW of solar by 2030. According to the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie’s Solar Market Insight 2021 Year in Review report, New York is not only the national leader for installed community solar, but is installing new projects at more than double the rate of second-place Massachusetts.
Similarly impressive to the capacity of community solar installed in New York is the speed in which these projects have reached operation. Prior to 2018, New York saw relatively little activity in community solar development, according to installation data collected by SEIA.
Much of the community solar developed in the state has received benefits from the state’s NY-Sun program, a state solar incentive program for distributed generation assets. Since being launched in 2011, NY-Sun has put forth more than $1.8 billion to advance the scale-up of solar and move the State closer to having a sustainable, self-sufficient solar industry. Tangibly, this funding has supported:
Not to be lost in the celebration, the 7.5MW community solar project in Schenectady that triggered the benchmark announcement is also notable for being a brownfield solar installation, located on the site of a former landfill in Glenville. The project also features 10MWh of onsite energy storage and is part of a seven-project, 25MW portfolio made possible through a collaboration with the Schenectady County Solar Energy Consortium that provides over $400,000 in energy savings annually to the municipalities and cities of Schenectady County and enables each of the municipalities to be powered by 100 percent renewable energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/23/nexamp-adds-energy-storage-to-community-solar-projects-to-serve-peak-demand/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 23, 2022",Nexamp adds energy storage to community solar projects to serve peak demand,"Solar developer Nexamp announced it added energy storage to two of its Massachusetts-located community solar projects, providing numerous benefits to the grid. Brockelman Road solar is a 1.7MW project that was paired with a 1MW/2MWh battery system, and Clark Road co-locates 7.1MW of solar with a 3MW/6MWh battery energy storage system.
Both projects were supported by the Massachusetts SMART program, which provides financial incentives to solar projects, and has significant value adders for projects that include energy storage. The state encourages energy storage for numerous reasons, including grid resiliency, reliability, and security.
“Energy storage is critical for our ability to deploy renewable energy to broadly resolve issues of energy security and climate change. Our dozens of storage projects under development fulfill a variety of functions and use cases for a diverse group of customers. With each project that goes live we not only create value for our customers, but also contribute to a cleaner grid that is more stable and resilient.” Mark Frigo, Vice President of Energy Storage, Nexamp.
The battery systems will participate in the Massachusetts Clean Peak Energy Standard program, providing energy to congested areas of the grid in the central part of the state during seasonal peak demand. The project will also participate in ISO New England’s capacity and frequency regulation markets, promoting grid reliability and mitigating blackouts.
Nexamp developed the projects in partnership with Borrego. The two have a long history of collaborating on solar projects in the state.
Last month, T-Mobile entered an agreement with Nexamp to buy the generation provided by over 50MW of community solar across the Northeast. The ten projects serving T-Mobile broken down by state, total size and utility are as follows:
Having a large anchor tenant like T-Mobile helps guarantee the viability of the projects and opens the remaining local community solar capacity to nearby residents interested in subscribing to clean power. NRG served as project procurement consultant for T-Mobile, and Nexamp will be the long-term owner of the projects.
In August 2021, Nexamp closed a $440 million senior secured credit facility for a 380 MW portfolio of solar and energy storage assets. The portfolio covers five states and includes some 100 community solar projects, including energy storage capacity totaling 120MWh. MUFG Union Bank served as the lead arranger for the syndicated financing, which included a group of lenders. At the time, Nexamp said it has nearly 300 new solar and storage projects in its development pipeline.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/23/hanwha-commits-to-us-manufacturing-across-the-supply-chain/,"ACQUISITIONS,EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 23, 2022",Hanwha commits to US manufacturing across the supply chain,"Hanwha Solutions announces stepped up efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products. Hanwha, the Korean company that owns Q CELLS, launched this effort by becoming the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, a major US manufacturer of polysilicon.
Following its initial $160 million acquisition to acquire a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha is acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons in a deal valued at around $44 million. This investment will help American manufacturers secure the raw material critical to the solar supply chain.
“Our commitment to the U.S. is more serious than ever before,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Q CELLS. “We plan to make investments to secure capabilities across the entire solar supply chain, with the goal of supplying our partners with ‘Made in America’ products that will help the U.S. regain its leadership in clean energy solutions.”
In the announcement, Hanwha indicated that it intends to make additional investments in virtually every sub-sector of the US solar manufacturing industry, ranging from key raw materials like polysilicon to fully assembled solar modules. The company currently operates the largest module production facility in the US through its solar panel business unit, Q CELLS. The Georgia factory can produce 1.7GW of solar modules per year, accounting for nearly 20% of total module production capacity in the US.
Hanwha’s US initiative supports the Biden administration’s efforts to increase solar power generation by 40% and to decarbonize all electricity by 2035. Hanwha sees the enactment of the Solar Energy Manufacturing Act (SEMA) as critical to a US-based solar supply chain. Once passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Biden, the legislation is intended to boost America’s panel manufacturing capacity and create jobs. The SEMA Coalition, representing American solar manufacturers supporting the legislation, said in a letter to President Biden, that the bill would add more than 30GW to domestic solar manufacturing capacity in the US by 2025, creating 18,000 direct and 60,000 indirect manufacturing jobs. Hanwha stated in its announcement that once SEMA is passed, the company “will implement a multi-phase, multi-billion-dollar expansion across the full solar energy supply chain”.
“Enacting SEMA is key to fulfilling our pledge to rebuild the U.S. solar supply chain with fully ‘Made in America’ products,” said the Hanwha Solutions spokesperson. “With a long term plan to support domestic solar manufacturing, we can help America lead the clean energy revolution and win the fight against climate change.”
Hanwha’s investment is also expected to add a substantial number of well-paying, local renewable energy jobs across America. Hanwha currently employs up to 750 staff in its Q-CELL production facility in Georgia.
“We imagine a Moses Lake factory brought back to life with local workers clocking in and operating the plant,” said a Hanwha spokesperson, referring to the currently idle REC factory, which is planned to reopen in 2023. “Together with our module factory in Georgia and new planned investments, we will fulfill our pledge to create quality clean energy manufacturing jobs across the United States.
Completion of the REC Solar transaction with Aker Horizons is scheduled in May 2022, subject to a customary anti-trust filing in the US. The REC Silicon plant in Moses Lake is expected to become operational in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/23/puerto-rico-solar-tax-has-been-defeated/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PUERTO RICO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 23, 2022",Puerto Rico solar tax has been defeated,"A proposed surcharge on customers with rooftop solar power in Puerto Rico, to fund repayment of the utility PREPA’s debt, is now off the negotiating table, due to actions by the president and the territory’s oversight board.
Puerto Rico’s 100% renewable energy law prohibits solar taxes, and the solar tax proposal would have required a change in that law. Solar trade group SESA-PR has been “fighting like crazy to defend that aspect of the law” in the three years since the solar tax was proposed, said the group’s president PJ Wilson in a webinar with members this week.
After three years of fighting the proposal, victory was achieved.
First, Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi said the Government was terminating the PREPA Restructuring Support Agreement that included the tax proposal, exercising the right of each party to terminate the agreement. “Charges to private generation should not be imposed,” Governor Pierluisi said, adding that “there needs to be a considerable reduction” in the amount of PREPA’s debt that bondholders can recover.
SESA-PR had asked the executive branch of government last August “to pull out of the agreement,” said Wilson. “At the time, it seemed like an impossible ask, but we said ‘We’re asking you to do it anyway, since you’re against solar taxes, and it includes solar taxes.'”
The day after the governor’s statement, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico said in a federal district court filing that it “currently does not anticipate” developing or negotiating a PREPA debt restructuring plan “requiring legislation.” In other words, because solar taxes would require legislation, the debt plan would not include solar taxes. Because legislation would not be needed, the oversight board denied the request of the Puerto Rico legislature to take part in the ongoing mediation that will resolve PREPA’s debt, while inviting the legislature to submit positions or proposals for consideration.
Helping set the stage, SESA-PR had previously “suggested and supported” two different resolutions in the Puerto Rico legislature, Wilson said, ultimately leading to the Puerto Rico House and Senate passing a joint resolution last November, which expressed “the wholehearted rejection,” in the words of Puerto Rico legislator Héctor Ferrer, of a debt restructuring agreement that included a solar tax.
Governor Pierluisi’s statement outlined the Government goals in ongoing talks, including “respect” for the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau’s role in setting electric rates and overseeing compliance with PREPA’s integrated resource plan, protecting PREPA’s pensioners, and complying with “the requirements and public policy objectives’ of Act 17-2019, the Puerto Rico Energy Policy Act, which bans solar taxes.
The nine parties to the ongoing mediation to resolve PREPA’s debt consist of government entities, bondholders, and the union of PREPA workers, whose pension funds are at risk, Wilson said. “We will be as close to that process as we can,” he said, “to remind everyone involved that any deal including solar taxes” would be “strongly opposed by not only SESA but also the united legislature and the governor’s own commitment against solar taxes.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/23/comed-opens-enrollment-to-community-solar-project/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,ILLINOIS",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 23, 2022",ComEd opens enrollment to community solar project,"Customers of Illinois utility ComEd will have an option to get access to local solar energy, as the community Gar Creek solar project has been launched. The project, located across two solar arrays in a low-income community, will serve up to 600 customers.
ComEd said customers could see savings of about $1,000 annually on their electric bill for enrolling. Applications will be accepted to the program, called Give-A-Ray, through April 15th. Gar Creek is open to any customer located in ComEd’s northern Illinois region.
Gar Creek is a 3.5MW community solar project. Community solar differs from utility-scale in that it is characterized by smaller projects that are on the distribution-level. Utility-scale projects are larger, centralized sources of power that require robust (and costly) high-voltage transmission infrastructure. Community solar projects also typically entail a subscription process like Give-A-Ray, in which customers voluntarily sign on to purchase credits that represent the solar facility’s generation. This project was developed by local Illinois developers Fosler Solar and Trajectory Energy.
“At ComEd, we are committed to making the transition to clean energy as inclusive as possible, and the Gar Creek project will help us achieve that goal,” said Scott Vogt, vice president of energy acquisition at ComEd. “Our partners at Fosler Solar and Trajectory Energy share our vision, and we are excited to work with them to provide qualified customers anywhere in our region with access to solar energy regardless of their income level.”
Gar Creek’s subscription service was enabled by Illinois Solar for All, a state incentive program. Give-A-Ray is the first program of its kind in the state, launched last year in direct response to the funding made available.
ComEd said for the third year running, it has received over 10,000 applications from residential, commercial, and industrial customers to interconnect distributed resources like solar to its grid.
Five million community solar households
The US Department of Energy (DOE) recently set goals to extend the benefits of community solar to five million households by 2025. This would represent a 700% growth in the next four years. DOE also targets $1 billion in energy bill savings for those five million American households.

While the community solar industry experienced a record-breaking year of growth in 2020, to continue that trajectory the expansion barriers must be removed, and incentives offered. At the Community Solar Power Forum held Boston at the end of February, five key takeaways highlight the challenges for the industry:
Nearly three-quarters of the US market for community solar is concentrated in four states: Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York. Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C. have state policies that support community solar deployment.
“Community solar needs state-level polices in order to thrive,” said Rachel Goldstein, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie. New Mexico and Delaware both passed legislation in 2021 for new or improved community solar programs. Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin all have proposed bills working their way through state legislatures.
