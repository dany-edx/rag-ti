Instead, the county undertook a series of actions at the local level to expand the deployment of solar and storage while saving millions in energy costs. The county installed solar panels on four government buildings; partnered with a municipality to purchase energy produced from a solar installation at a local landfill; and launched a co-op that has helped more than 250 residents install solar on their homes.
This is just one example of how hundreds of local governments are taking action to help their communities benefit from solar energy—regardless of what’s happening at the state or federal level. Solar companies can take advantage of these opportunities through local engagement and partnership that will provide mutual benefit.
How local governments set the stage
While local jurisdictions often receive attention when they block or delay solar energy projects, it is also valuable to recognize their constructive (and crucial) role in setting the framework for solar market growth.
Local governments establish rules and procedures that influence the speed and cost of solar installations. This includes the process for obtaining building permits, which can determine if a rooftop solar project is approved quickly or faces costly delays. Planning and zoning procedures also help clarify whether solar projects can go up in most parts of the community without unnecessary restrictions.
Additionally, the development of comprehensive plans at the local level for land use, energy, and transportation sets goals and priorities for clean energy use, including rooftop, utility-scale, and community solar. Depending on the location, these activities can be handled by the municipality, county, and/or a coordinating body such as a regional planning organization.
Despite their central role in the process, local jurisdictions are often keen for more knowledge or experience to make their communities more solar friendly. They also may lack the resources or staff to focus their attention on solar energy amid competing priorities.
Federal initiatives that help
At my organization, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), we lead a program called SolSmart with the International City/County Management Association (ICMA). SolSmart provides technical assistance at no cost to help local governments and regional organizations meet national best practices to encourage solar energy use.
To date, more than 500 jurisdictions in 43 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have achieved designation under the SolSmart program. For the solar industry, a SolSmart designation is a sign that these communities are “open for solar business.” Local governments are invited to join us by filling out a short contact form on our website.
We also encourage jurisdictions to adopt SolarAPP+, a free online platform for automated permit processing launched by the National Renewable Energy (NREL) and a network of industry partners. SolarAPP+ allows communities to provide instant approval for most rooftop solar projects, greatly reducing the time and expense required to obtain permits. To date, over 110 jurisdictions have adopted or piloted SolarAPP+, and it has been used by over 600 contractors to approve about 27,000 permits.
The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has opened a host of new financial incentives and grant opportunities that will encourage local clean energy growth. Programs like SolSmart and SolarAPP+ will help jurisdictions streamline their processes to manage a growing number of requests for solar permits.
Partnering with communities
For solar companies, building a partnership with local governments begins with recognizing shared goals. Both a developer and a local jurisdiction have an interest in maintaining sound structures and engineering, and in ensuring that an installation meets codes and standards. Both parties hope to rely on a fast and easy approval process that avoids red tape and saves financial resources and staff time.
There’s no shortage of examples of how engaged leadership at the local level can help solar companies succeed. For instance, Orange County, Florida teams up with Solar United Neighbors of Florida every year to offer a group purchase program that has led to nearly 5 MW in installations. The county also reduced its solar permitting process to one day, provided specialized training to plan reviewers and inspectors, and installed solar on county buildings.
In Washington State, Thurston County joined the cities of Olympia, Tumwater, and Lacey to publish a Climate Mitigation Plan that set goals for reducing emissions. Michigan City, Indiana worked with the local NAACP to adopt the Soul Power program to train local residents for solar jobs, focusing on people of color and low-income communities. The town of Milton, Massachusetts is exploring a solar microgrid to power the town hall, police department, and an affordable housing complex, providing backup power in case of grid failure.
The solar industry has much to gain by developing constructive partnerships with local governments to help communities achieve sustainability, resilience, and equity goals. In turn, solar companies benefit from increased local knowledge, new installations, and an expanded customer base. Local government should be viewed not as a hurdle, but rather an indispensable partner in the clean energy transition.

Theresa Perry is the program director for the SolSmart program at IREC, which helps local governments encourage the use of solar and storage. Previously, she focused on corporate energy management and sustainability programming for companies including Cisco and Advance Auto Parts. Her energy supply side management experience includes purchasing renewable energy around the globe and developing solar projects as large as 20 MW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/10/sonnen-unveils-nem-proof-function-for-solar-batteries/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 10, 2023",Sonnen unveils “NEM proof” function for solar batteries,"Sonnen, a provider of smart energy storage and virtual power plant (VPP) technology, announced it has released an optimized time-of-use solution designed to maximize customer value under California’s net energy metering (NEM) 3.0 regime.
NEM 3.0 in California cut the value of exporting excess solar generation to the grid by about 75% on average, making new solar-only rooftop installations less valuable than previous iterations of NEM rate structures. By including a battery with smart time-of-use based controls, homeowners can ensure that their PV array is generating value under the new rate structure.
With the new sonnenConnect program, the grid-interactive VPP combines the company’s batteries with an algorithm-based bill management system. The company said this results in electric bill reductions similar to, or exceeding expectations for NEM 2.0 systems.
The company will connect its batteries in a statewide network, responding to price signals embedded in the NEM 3.0 time of use rates. The company said this coordination of resources represents an acceleration of the energy transition.
The VPP program allows customers to participate in the CAISO wholesale energy market, earning cash rewards for balancing the California grid. As part of the program, customers can also access proactive backup power services to mitigate the impact of planned and unplanned grid outages.
Sonnen said its system is designed to offset peak loads daily, regardless of weather-related impacts on solar production. The time-of-use algorithm analyzes the day ahead, preparing for potential weather effects and planned grid events. In the cast of predicted insufficient PV generation the next day, the algorithm will partially charge the battery during super off-peak periods.
Sonnen said this will lead customers to not pay peak-period pricing at any point throughout the year, and that solar will not be wasted by way of low-value grid injection.
“Our German heritage has taught us a great deal about the potential of grid optimized energy storage systems, functioning as a single grid asset, providing authentic grid services for society in a manner that accelerates true energy transition,” said Blake Richetta, chairman and CEO of sonnen Inc.
With the VPP offering, Sonnen will expand its partnership with Baker Home Energy, serving customers in southern California. The company targets enrolling 6,000 batteries in Baker’s ChargeOn program in by 2025.
“With ChargeOn, Baker and sonnen’s joint VPP program, we have already differentiated ourselves from the competition by offering an unparalleled grid services package that generates cash rewards for our customers enrolled in sonnenConnect,” said Mike Teresso, President of Baker Home Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/10/partially-developed-12-mwac-brownfield-solar-site-up-for-auction-in-new-york/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 10, 2023",Partially developed 12 MWac brownfield solar site up for auction in New York,"New York is on the hunt for a company to construct and take ownership of the partially developed Benson Mines Solar Project. This initiative marks the first auction of the state’s Build Ready program. The program aims to collaborate with local landowners to responsibly site potential solar power plants. The program’s goal is to shepherd these projects through the riskier stages of solar development, particularly zoning and interconnection, before handing them off to developers to deliver the facilities to the market.
An introductory webinar is scheduled for Tuesday, October 17, 2023 from 11:00 a.m. – 12:30 p.m..
The state’s latest press release identifies the project as a 12 MWac facility. Originally designed for up to 20 MWac with single-axis tracker solar modules, it was later scaled back to the current 12 MWac due to “non-local utility system upgrades.” These non-local upgrades often pertain to transmission modifications, specifically when the local substation needs to export surplus solar electricity elsewhere on the grid. Developers can, however, expand the project back to its original 20 MWac capacity if they deem the upgrades financially viable.

Spanning 111.5 acres, the project will house solar panels within a chain-link fence on the former Benson Mines tailings pile. Located across from a former federal Superfund site, this area once saw a massive spill: a million gallons of oil permeating the ground and the Little River. Its close proximity to the National Grid’s Star Lake substation minimizes connection costs using underground lines. The project has procured both a subdivision and a solar facility permit. Notably, it’s a mere one-eighth mile from the protected Five Ponds Wilderness Area.
The successful bidder will enter negotiations for a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, acquiring the project’s rights from the state. The New York State Energy Research and Development (NYSERDA) oversees the entire procedure. The new owner will also sign a 20-year agreement to sell the project’s renewable energy certificates (RECs) back to NYSERDA.
Recent ventures have locked in REC contracts with a guaranteed minimum “Index REC strike price” of $75.19/MWh.
A comprehensive list of timelines and milestones is available on the project’s Request for Proposal page, including the informational webinar on October 17 and the deadline for questions on October 27.

To participate in the auction, construction firms must present a $1.5 million letter of credit from a reputable commercial bank and have a $30 million bond on standby.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/10/grid-forming-inverters-will-enable-a-high-renewables-grid/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 10, 2023",Grid-forming inverters will enable a high-renewables grid,"Grid-forming inverters “are going to be needed once we get to very high levels of inverter-based resources,” said Ben Kroposki, organizational director of the UNIFI Consortium and director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Power Systems Engineering Center, at an RE+ conference panel discussion last month.
Solar, wind and storage resources are all inverter-based.
For 120 years, Kroposki explained, the electric grid has been based on synchronous generators, which can create the 60 hertz frequency used on the U.S. grid to “black start” the grid after a complete blackout. Synchronous generators also synchronize to the existing frequency and provide other key functionality.
Most inverter-based resources installed to date use grid-following inverters. In the event that a large amount of generation goes offline, causing the frequency to fall below 60 hertz, generators that use grid-following inverters “try to keep online and inject power and keep the frequency stable,” Kroposki said. He referred to the solid red line in the graph above showing the modeled performance of a grid in which 73% of the generation uses grid-following inverters, following a sudden loss of generation.
The problem under that scenario, Kroposki said, is that the frequency drops below 59.5 hertz, shown with the dashed red line, in which case “the way to save the system is to drop some load,” resulting in a partial blackout, “and keep the rest of the system online.”
Grid-forming inverters, in contrast, can respond much more quickly to a frequency disturbance to maintain the frequency within range, Kroposki said, as shown by the green line in the graph. This capability is known as fast frequency response.
These modeling results were obtained by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council’s modeling and validation subcommittee.
The Texas grid operator ERCOT already occasionally reaches 71% instantaneous inverter-based generation, Kroposki said, which is very close to the 73% modeled in the scenario he described.
Some island grids are already past 73% instantaneous inverter-based generation, Kroposki said, including the Hawaiian Islands of Kauai and Maui, and Ireland.
Joining Kroposki in the panel discussion, Becca Jones-Albertus, director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office, said that an annual renewable generation percentage of 60% to 80% on a grid implies instantaneous generation of nearly 100% for the inverter-based resources.
Hawaii already requires grid-forming inverters for their large-scale energy storage projects, Kroposki said. He described a project on the big island of Hawaii in which the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is evaluating the performance of two grid-forming inverters made by different manufacturers, each with a capacity of at least 10 MW, working together on the island power system.
NREL is also rotating grid-forming inverters from different manufacturers through a 1 MW testing facility to ensure that they can all work together.
That type of technology validation is one key function of the UNIFI Consortium, while another is providing industry standards for grid-forming inverters. Consortium members are working to ensure that grid-forming inverters can provide voltage stability and regulation, damp oscillations, black start the grid, and provide cybersecurity.
The consortium is focused on helping commercialize grid-forming inverters, which are already available for battery storage. Grid-forming inverters for PV-only and wind-only projects are “about to hit the commercial market probably this year or next year,” Kroposki said.
Kroposki said the consortium offers a seminar series and other educational materials through its website.
UNIFI is an approximate acronym for Universal Interoperability for Grid-Forming Inverters. The U.S. Department of Energy funds the consortium, which was formed last year.
