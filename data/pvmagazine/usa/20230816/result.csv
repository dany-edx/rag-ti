https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/16/domestic-content-guidance-on-solar-cells-and-structural-steel/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 16, 2023",Domestic content guidance on solar cells and structural steel,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of the Treasury recently introduced guidance on its Domestic Content Bonus Credit. Initial industry feedback suggests that securing the 10% tax bonus, tied to the 40% domestic content requirement, might be challenging.
Structural steel and iron – 100% made in the USA
All steel and iron used in projects must undergo their complete manufacturing processes in the U.S., with the exception of certain metallurgical processes related to steel additives. This primarily applies to construction materials used for racking and foundation components anchoring solar panels. However, this stipulation doesn’t extend to steel and iron components categorized as “manufactured products” in solar projects.
Keith Martin, in Norton Rose Fulbright’s analysis, simplifies the classification of steel and iron construction items by saying, “If they are removed, things fall down.”
Interestingly, tracker motors, which turn the torque tubes that re-orient solar panels, will be classified as a manufactured good, subject to only the 40% domestic content rule.
While the IRS guidance doesn’t explicitly address the issue of rooftop solar racking, often made of aluminum and steel with electrical grounding requirements, must also be 100% American made. However, most analysts assume that it will fall under the structural steel and iron regulations.

An important reminder: For projects exceeding 1 MWac, the full 10% dometic content bonus is attainable only if they meet prevailing wage requirements. Otherwise, the bonus tax credit drops to 2%.
Manufactured products – 40% American-Made
The major hurdle for the domestic content bonus lies in defining and reaching the 40% domestic content threshold for ‘manufactured goods’. The Treasury acknowledges this is just the initial guidance, and more comprehensive updates are on the horizon. They also express openness to revisions based on industry feedback.
Going forward, the 40% minimum domestic content requirement is set to increase annually, to 45% for projects starting construction in 2025, 50% in 2026 and 55% thereafter.
Manufacturers and developers must grapple with multiple considerations. Maria Bries of McCauley Lyman LLC recently illustrated some of these complexities in a recent graphic, highlighting challenges of determining actual domestic content percentages.

Manufacturers must determine the percentage of their products that are American-made. This not only involves tracing the origin of each component but also understanding the labor implications of its inclusion in the final solar product. Christian Roselund of Clean Energy Associates points out that if even one component in a manufactured product is imported, none of its associated labor counts toward the 40% quota.
Transparency in cost is another significant challenge. While larger players might have the leverage to demand cost breakdowns, smaller entities could be at a disadvantage. To fully trust and utilize the 10% bonus, concrete proof of product origins will be essential.
A call for U.S. based solar cell manufacturing
The IRS’s stance on solar panels is particularly significant. The guidance will assess both the origin of the final project purchased by developers, such as a U.S.-manufactured solar module, and its constituent components, like solar cells. This approach extends to other parts of the solar module, including the glass, frame, junction box, encapsulant, and more.
While the focus remains on the origin of the solar cell, the guidance doesn’t mandate a U.S. origin for the solar wafer, allowing panels with foreign-made solar wafers. This tacitly excludes polysilicon from sourcing requirements, even though it’s a significant cost driver for solar panels. The American thin-film solar module manufacturer First Solar has criticized this allowance.

Given the substantial investment solar panels represent, there’s mounting pressure within the industry to kickstart U.S. solar cell manufacturing. This is especially true for manufacturers who share financial risks with solar developers in the production of solar panels.
Following the IRS guidance, Meyer Burger announced a 2 GW solar cell factory in Colorado complementing its Arizona-based 2 GW solar module factory.
Additional components and the 40% threshold
In recent webinars hosted by Roth MKM’s Phillip Shen, featuring guest Keith Martin from Norton Rose Fullbright, discussions delved into other components that might contribute to the 40% target. Companies like Shoals, specializing in custom wiring for solar projects, could help meet this quota. Shen also theorized that incorporating a U.S.-manufactured Enphase inverter into a solar module might enhance compliance.
Items like copper wiring, conduit, disconnects, electrical panels, fuses, fencing, step-up transformers also count as manufactured goods and contribute toward the 40% goal.
Rooftop solar racking is another focal point. Discussions with a custom commercial rooftop solar racking company informed pv magazine USA that many developers are examining this product class more closely, eager to understand the key components and sources that make up these products.
Some have speculated that Goldman Sachs’ acquisition of inverter manufacturer EPC Power was a play to tap into the dometic content potential.

Batteries, integral to a vast number of upcoming projects, are classified as manufactured goods. It’s important to highlight that batteries have their own 30% tax credit, complemented by a 10% domestic content bonus. Developers therefore face a strategic decision: Should they integrate batteries with their solar projects or keep them as standalone units? Where batteries can operate independently, a detailed cost-benefit analysis might be required to determine the optimal approach.
Fluence’s new Oregon battery facility emphasizes its alignment with domestic content guidelines and its eligibility for the $10/kWh manufacturing tax credit.
The IRS specifically clarified that the 100% steel and iron requirement does not extend to items within manufactured parts. Components “such as nuts, bolts, screws, washers, cabinets, covers, shelves, clamps, fittings, sleeves, adapters, tie wire, spacers, door hinges, and similar items that are made primarily of steel or iron,” but not serving a structural function, are exempt.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/16/one-year-after-passage-of-the-ira-the-renaissance-has-begun/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 16, 2023","One year after passage of the IRA, the renaissance has begun","On the first anniversary of the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the historic bill has already begun to stimulate the economy and move the U.S. toward a carbon-neutral future.
The massive energy, climate and tax bill includes $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is focused on supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience. The spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes on the wealthiest Americans and corporations. The legislation contains numerous provisions to support the U.S. solar industry, including a long-term extension of the federal investment tax credit, significant domestic manufacturing incentives, labor standards, production tax credits and more. 
In the past twelve months, numerous industry experts have pontificated on just what the IRA will mean for the U.S. economy, the climate, supply chain security and more. The experts at the National Renewable Energy Lab, for example, expect that the IRA will increase clean energy in the range of 71% to 90% of total U.S. generation by 2030.
According to new analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), in the year since the IRA went into effect, U.S. solar and storage companies have announced over $100 billion in private sector investments, with as many as 51 solar manufacturing facilities announced or expanded in the last year.
The impetus behind the growth in solar manufacturing are the production tax credits (PTC) within the IRA. Previously afforded to wind farms, PTCs now include solar for the first time. That clean-energy PTC will be available until the end of 2024 when it will become technology-neutral. Solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydropower, and other eligible projects will bank a tax credit of $0.003 per kilowatt-hour generated, with $0.015 paid to projects built by workers in receipt of a prevailing wage and that met apprenticeship requirements. A higher PTC, of $0.026/kWh, is available for projects built before an “act beginning construction deadline” which will occur 60 days after the Internal Revenue Service specifies its wage and apprenticeship requirements.
In recent months, pv magazine USA has reported on a plethora of manufacturing announcements across the PV supply chain, with the most recent being German manufacturer Siemens, which plans to open a string inverter factory in the U.S. where it plans to supply 800 MW annually to the U.S. utility-scale market.
While U.S.-made inverters are expected to provide only 7 GW of capacity, the capacity expectations of domestically made modules, cells, ingots and wafers are impressive. SEIA projects that by 2026, the U.S. will have over 17 times its current manufacturing capacity across the supply chain, or enough to supply a majority of solar projects expected to be built in the U.S.
The announcements include:
Among these announcements is Swiss-Germany company Meyer Burger, which will construct a 2 GW per year solar cell manufacturing facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The facility will be used to produce solar cells for its own solar module manufacturing facility in Arizona.
QCells also announced plans to manufacture across the supply chain including ingots, wafers, cells, modules and encapsulants to be made a new facility in Bartow County, Georgia, complementing its existing facility in Dalton, Georgia.
“The unprecedented surge in demand for American-made clean energy is a clear sign that the clean energy incentives enacted last year by Congress are working,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.
Not only will domestic manufacturing ensure that U.S. clean energy investments stay in the U.S., but it will contribute to the economies of the manufacturing region. Many cities, states and counties a incentivizing solar firms to attract them to invest in their area because of the economic benefits. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, for every $1 spent on manufacturing, $2.60 is added to the economy.
Solar manufacturing facilities announced in the last year will employ more than 20,000 Americans. The nation’s solar manufacturing workforce is set to triple in size to over 100,000 jobs in the next decade, which is good news. The challenge, however, is in finding the workers. According to the recent National Solar Jobs Census from the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), the reality is that the tight labor market in the U.S. continues to create hiring challenges. The report notes that in 2022, 44% of solar industry employers said it was “very difficult” to find qualified applicants—the highest such percentage ever recorded in the Solar Jobs Census. The Inflation Reduction Act attempts to remedy the problem with new workforce-related requirements that address training, pay, diversity and job development in underserved areas.
Among the many benefits of the passage of the historic Inflation Reduction Act, in addition to securing a domestic supply chain, isthe decarbonization of the U.S. grid. IREC forecasts that total U.S. installations will multiply fivefold in the next 10 years, from 141 GW in 2022 to over 700 GW in 2033. The growth of emission-free solar energy will offset 459 million metric tons of CO2 annually by 2033, equivalent to roughly one-third of all power sector emissions in 2021.
While we look back at the opportunities presented by the IRA, we must also acknowledge the challenges that must be overcome as we build out a clean energy grid. Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), noted that challenges including supply chain constraints, trade restrictions, permitting and interconnection queue delays, insufficient transmission capacity, and workforce shortages can delay deals, increased project costs, and more. “Today’s anniversary is one to celebrate, but we have work to do to realize the full potential of the new law and achieve the Biden administration’s ambitious clean energy goals. We must address these pivotal challenges to achieve the clean energy future that the American people want, and our scientists say we desperately need.”

Much of the United States electric grid is still powered by natural gas and coal.
Electrify America, a provider of DC fast-charging solutions for EVs, has made a direct investment in solar to ensure that the demand created by vehicles charging on its network is met with low cost, reliable and emissions-free power generation.
The company entered a 15-year virtual power purchase agreement with developer Terra-Gen, signing on for generation provided by a 75 MW solar facility in San Bernardino County, California. Generation from a facility of this size is comparable to the power draw of 500 vehicles simultaneously at an average speed of 150 kW.
Spanning one square mile, the project, called Solar Glow 1, is comprised of over 200,000 solar panels and is expected to produce over 225 GWh of electricity per year.
“We expect the demand on our charging network to continue to rise with the increase in EV ownership,” said Jigar Shah, director of energy services at Electrify America. “Solar Glow 1 adds new additional 100% renewable energy generation with estimated annual production that exceeds our 2022 network usage.”
In 2022, Electrify America charged vehicles more than 5 million customer charging sessions, which was 3.5 times the sessions in 2021. These charging sessions delivered roughly 173 GWh of electricity, enabling an estimated 493 million miles of electric driving and an avoided consumption of roughly 21 million gallons of gasoline.
“This solar project is a significant accomplishment reinforcing our commitment in 2022 to back all energy delivered to customers on Electrify America’s coast-to-coast public, ultra-fast DC charging network with 100% renewable energy,” said Robert Barrosa, president and chief executive officer, Electrify America.

The facility, which will be operated by Siemens’ manufacturing partner Sanmina, will produce Blueplanet string inverters. Siemens acquired the inverter business of KACO in 2019, which has already actively been producing inverters at the Kenosha, Wisconsin site. 
Tax credits and demand-side incentives like the domestic content bonus in the Inflation Reduction Act are attracting record levels of clean energy manufacturing to the U.S., and the Siemens announcement adds to the growing domestic supply chain. Over the past four years, Siemens has invested $3 billion in U.S. manufacturing and acquisition activities. 
“Working with Sanmina to establish this new production line, Siemens is well positioned to address supply challenges our country is facing as we work to localize production for green and renewable infrastructure,” said Brian Dula, vice president of electrification and automation at Siemens Smart Infrastructure USA. 
KACO Blueplanet inverters range from 110 kW to 165 kW and offer a more modular, transportable option for utility scale projects than a large containerized central inverter. The inverters are made with a reliable silicon carbide design, are NEMA 4X enclosed, and are compatible with fused, cable-trunking systems up to 600 kcmil eliminating the need for string-combiner boxes. 
“Single-MPPT inverters are proving to be the preferred choice when it comes to ease of layout and flexibility in design. It is clear that in today’s inverter landscape there is no one multi-MPPT inverter which can provide a satisfactory design for all high-power modules,” said Siemens in a whitepaper on the inverter. “The KACO singleMPPT string inverter range offers a much easier and more flexible design through the use of DC combiners which is crucial when optimizing your PV module layout.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/16/mote-unveils-plans-to-build-its-second-biomass-to-hydrogen-plant-in-northern-california/,"HYDROGEN,CALIFORNIA",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 16, 2023",Mote unveils plans to build its second biomass-to-hydrogen plant in Northern California,"Mote Inc, a Los Angeles, California-based clean energy startup, is planning to build its second biomass-to-hydrogen and carbon sequestration plant in Northern California, in collaboration with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), the company announced last week. 
Mote received $1.2 million in funding from the U.S. Forest Service, the California Department of Conservation, and the California Department of Forestry for the facility, and will work with SMUD – its hydrogen offtake partner – to develop it. The facility should be able to produce roughly 21,000 metric tons of carbon-negative hydrogen annually, which can then be used to generate power or in the transportation sector, according to the company. 
The plant will be designed to use up to 300,000 metric tons per year of wood waste and other forest residue, which would otherwise be burned or sent to a landfill. It would be capable of sequestering more than 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to Mote; roughly equal to the emissions generated by 100,000 cars every year. 
Mote’s technology is based on taking in biomass waste, which is then reacted with pure oxygen to produce a gas mixture. That gas mixture, once separated and purified, results in bio-hydrogen and permanently storable carbon dioxide, as well as leftover ash that can be sold to fertilizer companies. The technology captures virtually all of the carbon from waste, Mote said. 
Mote’s first such facility is going to be sited near Bakersfield, in California’s Kern County. The company expects to begin constructing the project in 2025, and reach full operational capacity by 2027. 
The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office nvited Mote to submit the second part of an application for the project. The application is for the office’s Title 17 Clean Energy Financing program, through which the office finances projects focused on clean energy deployment and energy infrastructure reinvestment with the broader aim of reducing carbon emissions and air pollution. The program can offer up to 80% of eligible project costs in loan guarantees, according to Mote. 
According to Mote CEO, Joshuah Stolaroff, there is a pressing need for durable, large-scale carbon removal and scalable solutions that provide low-cost, clean hydrogen, and he said that Mote’s technology does both. 
“Our projects in Sacramento and Bakersfield will be the first commercial-scale projects to utilize sustainably sourced biomass for this purpose,” said Stolaroff. 
Bio-hydrogen – or hydrogen synthesized by converting biomass feedstock – can be a good source of carbon-negative hydrogen and a critical tool in achieving net-zero emissions targets, according to a January report from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. This is especially the case in sectors that are otherwise hard to decarbonize. In the iron and steel industry, for example, electricity only accounts for 13% of the industry’s total emissions, whereas a majority of its emissions come from blast furnaces. 
“As a result, renewable electricity plays a minor role in decarbonizing this sector,” the report said. 
However, the report noted that bio-hydrogen’s carbon-negative status depends on whether it uses biomass feedstocks that have a very low carbon footprint, and whether it is compatible with carbon capture and storage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/16/three-ways-that-community-solar-can-grow-wisconsins-economy/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WISCONSIN",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"AUGUST 16, 2023",Three ways that community solar can grow Wisconsin’s economy,"According to Renew Wisconsin, 50% of Wisconsin households can’t access solar energy because they live in apartments, are renters or lack the appropriate roof. The Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) wants to fill this resource gap. In 2022, they asked Forward Analytics to explore the economic benefits of investing in community solar infrastructure across the state. 
Community solar allows lots of people to invest in and then share the energy generated from a solar array. These photovoltaic (PV) systems are often started by organizations or individuals with enough capital to fund construction. In some states, a shareholder’s excess electricity is fed back into the region’s utility grid in return for credits on their monthly utility bills. Otherwise known as net metering, these incentives make clean energy accessible to more people. Subscription rates are usually cheaper than utility company programs. In most cases, the users can sell back excess electricity at the rate they purchased it.
Forward Analytics estimates that building 350 solar installations will grow Wisconsin’s economy in three ways: funding local businesses, stimulating the regional real estate market and increasing jobs. 
Researchers used CCSA data and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) intelligence to hypothesize the economic potential of such a project. The findings were run through the software platform IMPLAN’s program for a more accurate prediction of costs and revenue. The IMPLAN model measures the price of labor materials and land leases from a buyer’s and seller’s perspective. “The financial activity that occurs as these dollars move through the economy generates the multiplier effect,” the study reports.
The analysis estimates construction of 350 installations would take seven years. Assuming facilities would be built at a rate of 50 per year, Forward Analytics projects $1.57 billion will be generated during the building phase. The remaining $856.09 million and $67.03 million will be realized in the following 26 and six years respectively, due to operation and maintenance costs. 
 
Source: Forward Analytics
The bulk of economic growth during the construction period is due to high spending on materials and labor, “an average of 2,713 full-time equivalent jobs will be created or supported,” the study reports. However, the money local contractors or land renters make goes toward buying regional goods and services. “This cycle continues in smaller amounts, so the economic impact is much greater than the initial amount of spending.” 
Calculations for proposed economic activity generated
Forward Analytics found that the construction of solar installations would stimulate the local economy through spending on regional labor and materials. Research estimates that building a 5 MW facility will cost about $9.8 million, $3.8 million of which will be spent in the state. That’s because materials like modules solar panels and inverters may be purchased elsewhere. Furthermore, a portion of developer profits will be realized domestically.
With regard to land leasing, facilities may rent land from local owners to build community PV systems. Forward Analytics estimates lease payments would generate income for landowners over 26 years (it accounts for construction time). Research suggests landowners could lease one 31 acre solar farm space for $4,216 annually. This value accounts for varying rental rates depending on land type and location, as well as overall fluctuations in the real estate market over the past three years. 
Lastly, economic activity can be generated through the maintenance of community solar gardens. While these jobs will be less labor intensive than the construction ones, employees can still make an income that they spend to buy clothes electronics or cars across the state. 
The community solar market was down across the country last year, but is expected to exceed 6 GW in 2023, according to a report by according to a report by Wood Mackenzie in conjunction with the CCSA. The report also points to a strong future, stating that in 2024 community solar is expected to begin on an upward path that will see it grow at an annual clip of 8% with nearly 14 GW of cumulative capacity installed by 2028.
