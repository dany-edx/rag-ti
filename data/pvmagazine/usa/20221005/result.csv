The charging yard is a series of parking canopies topped with solar panels with a total capacity of 783 kW. The DC charging facility can charge 72 vehicles at once. Rivian said it is also working on installing a 2.8 MW wind turbine for charging. The project is expected to generate 1.04 million kWh annually, avoiding an estimated 800 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. The project came online in September 2022, charging R1 vehicles before they are delivered to customers.
ForeFront Power developed the project. The company has also developed solar for LaGuardia Airport, Sonoma County Transportation, and Michigan based cidery Virtue Cider.
“Rivian’s Solar Charging Yard project is a testament to the company’s climate and sustainability leadership, showing U.S. customers what a clean energy future looks like within the auto industry,” said Michael Smith, CEO of ForeFront Power.
Rivian signed the Climate Pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, 10 years before the Paris Agreement goal.
Rivian’s R1T truck has 260 to 400-plus miles of range on a full charge, can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3 seconds, and has a towing capacity of up to 11,000 lbs. The all-wheel drive vehicle comes in dual or quad motors and sits on a 21-inch wheel.
The R1S sports utility vehicle delivers between 260 to 320-plus miles range, tows up to 7,700 lbs., and accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in three seconds. It is equipped with dual motors and a 21-inch wheelbase.
Rivian’s standard warranty is five years or 60,000 miles. The battery pack and drivetrain are covered for eight years or 175,000 miles, and its limited corrosion warranty is eight years with unlimited miles.

One reason for the move into New York is the strong support the company has received from the state. Empire State Development (ESD) is assisting the project by providing up to $4 million of tax credits through the performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program, and $2.5 million of funding through the Regional Council Capital Fund Program. The gigafactory will be located in a former electronics manufacturing facility and is expected to create approximately 250 new jobs, with expected production of more than 1 GWh of battery and energy storage systems over the next five years.
“We are very pleased to have strong support from the State for this venture and expect to continue to find additional non-dilutive funding to support capital needs,” said Dr. Raj Das Gupta, CEO of Electrovaya.
New York Governor Hochul announced Monday that the company will set up its first U.S. plant in Chautauqua County.
“Thanks to state resources, Electrovaya is bringing up to 250 jobs to Chautauqua County and deepening New York’s involvement in the growing clean energy sector,” Governor Hochul said. “The race is one to capture the high-paying jobs that come with clean tech, and there is no place like New York for these manufacturers to grow, operate, and thrive.”
Electrovaya will also be eligible for other New York State funds, as well as U.S. federal funding from various agencies and programs. In July, the New York Power Authority Board of Trustees approved an allocation of more than 1.5 MW of hydropower under the Power Authority’s Industrial Economic Development program to meet the increased electric load resulting from the gigafactory. The final capital cost of the facility is estimated at approximately $75 million, and it is expected to open in phases starting late 2023.
Electrovaya recently announced a revenue update for the fourth quarter, indicating that preliminary unaudited revenue was $9.7 million or an increase of approximately 131% compared to the fiscal Q4 2021.

The project, to be located near a U.S. Steel plant, is expected to be large enough to power the equivalent of 40,000 homes. It is planned to reach commercial operations in late 2024.
The 2,100-acre project will be adjacent to U.S. Steel Corporation existing factory and a planned $3 billion expansion site.
“Driver Solar not only helps us meet our robust sustainability goals, but it will also help us deliver sustainable steel solutions for our customers,” said U. S. Steel senior vice president, chief strategy and sustainability officer Richard Fruehauf. 
“The renewable energy generated will power the production of verdeXTM, our advanced sustainable steel product, which is composed of up to 90% recycled steel content, as well as other products produced at our Big River Works facility,” said Fruehauf.
Lightsource bp has completed development and permitting of the solar facility and will build the project under a build-transfer agreement with Entergy Arkansas. It is expected to bring 350 to 400 jobs during the construction phase.
The project is conservatively estimated to bring $36 million in property taxes to Mississippi County over 30 years of operation.
In November 2021, Lightsource bp announced a procurement deal with First Solar for 5.4 gigawatts of First Solar modules. The Driver Solar project is planned to be constructed using all U.S.-made First Solar modules. The facility will also be built with solar trackers manufactured by Albuquerque-based Array Technologies.
“Arkansas’ largest solar project will help build American-made sustainable steel, as well as create hundreds of U.S. jobs for construction and across the supply chain,” said Kevin Smith, Lighthouse bp CEO of the Americas.
Earlier this year, utility Entergy Arkansas issued a request for proposals for 1 GW of wind and solar resources. In June 2022, Entergy Corporation said it discussed plans for up to 7 GW of renewable resources by the end of 2025, and as much as 14 to 17 GW of renewable resources by the end of 2031.
“We are listening to our customers as we develop and execute our generation strategy for the future,” said Laura Landreaux, president and CEO of Entergy Arkansas.

But the world wasn’t ready for a solar vehicle and funding didn’t exist like it does today. Fast forward thirteen years to 2019, the two returned to designing an EV focused solely on efficiency. Today’s Aptera is equipped with almost 700 watts of integrated solar cells, which enable it to drive up to 40 miles per day on the sun’s rays alone. The car’s battery is designed for a 1,000 mile range.
Aptera is working with Maxeon Solar Technologies as the cell supplier for its solar production program, and the carmaker’s solar engineers have used the cells to create ultra-lightweight and curved solar panels. Aptera selected Maxeon Gen 3 solar cells because they are durable, lightweight and have  minimal energy loss.
“We’re pleased to have been selected by Aptera to bring this next phase of solar innovation to market. At Maxeon, we provide the highest quality and most efficient solar technology, and Aptera’s mission to pioneer solar mobility is the natural progression of this innovation,” said Mark Babcock, interim CEO and chief revenue officer at Maxeon Solar Technologies. “The vehicle will feature the same extraordinary cells as those found in our high-efficiency solar panels powering homes and businesses – a true testament to our innovation as a solar leader.”
In June Aptera announced it chose EVE Energy as its supplier of lithium-ion battery cells, and the company said it planned to use Eve’s 21700 NMC 811 cylindrical cells in its vehicle’s structural battery packs.
Apterra said it currently has 25,000+ reservations from customers in more than 100 countries, and that future plans include mainstream autonomous capable 6-passenger cars, 2-seat commuters, and utility vehicles up to 18-wheelers. Prices range from $25,900 to $50,700.

Meyer Burger Technology AG has revealed plans to raise CHF 250 million ($255.2 million) via an ordinary capital increase, by issuing new subscription rights. It aims to use the funds to rapidly expand production to 3 GW, and is set to vote on the plan at its extraordinary general meeting on Oct. 28.
The Switzerland-based solar module manufacturer recently sealed a supply agreement with U.S. project developer DE Shaw Renewable Investments (DESRI). The agreement states that Meyer Burger will supply 3.75 GW to 5 GW of heterojunction solar modules to DESRI over a period of five years from 2024. The contract includes a fixed basic price, with a possible adjustment to wafer prices.
The company’s board mainly wants to finance the planned expansion of production capacity for its solar cells and modules. The CHF 250 million will support the expansion of heterojunction cell production in Thalheim, Germany, and the development of module production at the company’s U.S. site in Arizona.
More than 40,000 square meters of additional space will be available in Thalheim for the new cell production facilities. And the company expects the first module deliveries from its Arizona plant to start in mid-2024.
The company is also hoping to benefit from political momentum. Europe’s Fit for 55 package and REPowerEU Plan, as well as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, could help to drive the development of the solar industry. Meyer Burger believes it is positioned to benefit these trends, as it is one of the few established PV cell and module manufacturers with production outside of Asia.
Meyer Burger is targeting around 3 GW of new annual production capacity by the end of 2024, including 1.4 GW of module production capacity in Freiberg, Germany. In the USA, the expansion of around 1 GW of module production capacity is planned. While Meyer Burger focuses more on the sale of heterojunction modules for rooftop systems in Europe, in the United States, it is focusing on the large-scale segment.
In Freiberg, the company now has an annual production capacity of 400 MW and is ramping up its second production line. The ramp-up started as planned in September and after completion, 1 GW of production capacity will be available. Additional expansion to 1.4 GW has already started.

The nation’s largest energy conference was even more exciting than usual, since this was the first *large* U.S.-based solar show since 2019.
As always, solar modules from the world’s largest manufacturers were near the doors as pv magazine USA first walked in. But all around the floor (and outside) were other products of great interest.
Toledo Solar’s residential and commercial thin film solar panel was on display. The company’s product, the TS2-WS 115 Watt unit, is sized, constructed, and modeled after the FirstSolar Series 4 product. This makes a lot of sense, since the two companies are neighbors in Ohio.

The salesperson lauded the panel’s strong low light performance and low degradation values. And since they are manufactured in Ohio, the panels are seemingly eligible for the additional domestic content 10% tax credit due to the recently signed Inflation Reduction Act.
Philadelphia Solar is a new solar panel manufacturer from Jordan. The company had a sweet solar ping pong table that seemingly produced electricity as the company’s Chief Commercial Officer Mohammad Shehadeh announced via LinkedIn that they closed 330 MW worth of contracts at the show and are expanding to 1.5 GW/year of manufacturing capacity.

The company’s name comes from it being the name of Jordan’s ancient capital city (Amman). For a period of 1,000 years, from ~300 BC to 700 AD, the city was known as Philadelphia, named after Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who rebuilt the city and named it after himself.
It’s not a solar module, but a device that helps installers get modules up on the roof. The G2 Unit, from TransVolt, lifts 5 solar modules (up to 250 pounds) onto a typical roof in 30 seconds. This clever device reduces physical labor, speeds up installation, and looks considerably safer than carrying modules up a ladder!

Canadian manufacturer Mitrex recently launched their building integrated solar module series that looks a lot like…a roof! The company set up four unique modules outside of RE+ to give viewers a greater chance to see the module under natural sunlight.

The company’s standard solar module product comes in four designs. From left to right: Black Asphalt, Green Slate, Wood – Brown, and Black Shingles – all are designed to look like roofing materials. From a distance, one might not even notice that they are solar panels!
The Ningbo OSDA Solar booth attracted attention from displaying the many sizes of solar panels that the company manufactures. The group has been assembling modules in China since 2005.

Some of the modules’ uses include trackers, lighting, security, data, and off grid housing. The big one on the right, partially cropped out, is a grid connected residential panel.
Though many of the international manufacturers’ brand names are less recognizable, most have been around for many years – manufacturing solar panels, batteries, inverters, racking, and more.
Some of the alternative uses for solar panels were pretty novel:

While the Dust IQ does have a solar panel, its purpose is not to support the power grid, but instead to give data on the amount of dust that is on its custom solar panel, and give insight as to how much revenue is being lost to that dust on a solar farm.
pv magazine USA learned that VSUNSolar, a Japanese owned company,  is considering an expansion into the USA via a new facility, and is expected to split their volume between an unnamed U.S. investor and the general market. Below is the company’s flagship 670 watt module,  which stands at seven feet, nine inches tall, and weighs in at 84.8 pounds. 

VSUN plans to increase their overall manufacturing volume to approximately 3.8 GW/year of module assembly capacity by the end of year. They also have plans to move up the supply chain, adding cell and wafer manufacturing to their portfolio. We should expect an updated polysilicon agreement soon.

The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) has launched a request for proposals (RFP) to allocate 1 GW of renewable energy capacity and 500 MW of storage.
The procurement exercise is being held in accordance with the Integrated Resource Plan, which was approved by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau in August 2020. It is the second round of a tender scheme launched in February 2021. The deadline for the submission of proposals is Nov. 14. Selected developers will be awarded 25-year power purchase agreements.
The island’s grid has been changing since it was destroyed by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. Puerto Rican leaders and regulators have pushed to rebuild the island’s power infrastructure with a stronger focus on renewable energy.
Under Act 17, which was signed into law in 2019, PREPA must obtain 20% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050.
