https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/01/solar-modules-removed-from-target-facility-in-california-meet-sustainable-end-of-life/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 1, 2023",Solar modules removed from Target facility in California meet sustainable end of life,"Target, known for being ahead of the sustainability curve, has solar installed on nearly 550 locations or more than 25% of it stores. The company’s sustainability strategy, called Target Forward, commits the retailer to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions enterprise-wide by 2040. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) Solar Means Business 2022 Target is one of the top four companies for solar installed on site, which—at the time—amounted to 255 MW of capacity.
To stay ahead of the curve, Target decided to update the solar equipment on a Target facility in Los Angeles. While manufacturers often claim that solar modules last 20 to 30 years, they degrade over time. In research conducted at the National Renewable Energy Lab, for example, it was found that solar modules lose about 0.5% of output each year. At that rate, 20-year old solar modules would be producing about 90% of their original output. In addition, new technologies offer higher output, and corporations such as Target may find it cost effective to decommission older technology and replace it with new.
The Los Angeles Target installation consisted of legacy Shell Powerlight modules, Xantrax inverters, and an integrated PowerGuard flat racking solution. The entire project, including all system equipment, was removed in three weeks by Decom Solar LLC, a company that specializes in decommissioning. The 360 kW installation is being replaced by a new, state-of-the art system by PowerFlex, a national provider of onsite sustainable energy solutions.
Decom reports that it guarantees that all solar equipment they work with will be properly redeployed, reinstalled or recycled, and in this case they chose Solarcycle for recycling. Upon completion, a certificate of recycling will be provided as proof of proper handling.
“PowerFlex continues to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability, and this is one of many projects we have worked with a company to safely and responsibly decommission projects,” said Stephen Burns, co-founder of Decom Solar. “This is an important step in reducing our environmental impact and creating a more sustainable future for all.”
All modules from the project have been transported to Solarcycle’s recycling facility in Odessa, Texas, where the modules will be processed, recycled, and reintegrated into the supply chain. Solarcycle was founded in 2022 by industry experts from leading corporations and institutions such as Solaria, NEXTracker, Sierra Club, and the University of New South Wales.
The company said its recycling solution can recover more than 95% of vital materials that can be re-used. Its technology allows it to extract metals including silver, silicon, copper, and aluminum and to recycle or repurpose 95% of panels currently in use. In April the U.S. Department of Energy awarded Solarcycle a $1.5 million research grant to study the process for recovering higher-quality metals and materials extracted from retired solar panels. This came on the heels of a $30 million funding raise.
“Commercial stores not only hold huge potential to generate renewable energy, but they can also help our country build a solar circular economy through recycling commitments,” said Jesse Simons, chief commercial officer of Solarcycle.
Decom promises to plant one tree for each solar module removed, so after this decommissioning project, the company reports that it donated 4,795 trees to One Tree Planted, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to global reforestation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/01/u-s-solar-deployment-to-grow-40-this-year-remains-lowest-cost-option/,"COST AND PRICES,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 1, 2023","U.S. solar deployment to grow 40% this year, remains lowest-cost option","The U.S. solar industry is set to right the ship after a bumpy ride in 2022, a year in which supply chain constraints and trade law enforcement challenged the nation’s supply of solar components to serve a healthy project flow.
After receding 15% in 2022, solar deployment in the U.S. is expected to grow 40% this year, and by 2024, it is expected to reach 30 GW per year, or roughly 50% higher than 2022 totals. This vision of an industry recharged by supply improvements and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was shared by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its annual Renewable Energy Market Update.
Solar remains the number one source of global renewable capacity expansion in 2023, accounting for 65% of growth. Distributed applications, including residential and commercial systems, account for almost half of global PV expansion.
Electricity generation costs for solar are expected to decline by 2024 but will likely remain about 10% to 15% above pre-Covid levels in markets outside China, said IEA. Regardless of this increase, solar PV and onshore wind remain the lowest cost options for new generation in most countries.
Today, PV assets can provide electricity at prices 30% to 50% lower than those of future power contracts in most key markets, increasing renewables’ attractiveness for investors, said IEA.
IEA adds that market-driven procurement will contribute roughly one-fifth of PV expansion over the next two years, largely driven by corporate power purchase agreements. Globally, almost 60% of utility-scale projects will be developed under policies with administratively set remuneration policies such as fixed tariffs, premiums, and utility-owned projects, said the report.
“Despite challenges from volatile commodity prices, higher interest rates, supply chain constraints and trade measures, the renewable energy industry has shown financial resilience overall,” said IEA.
Global manufacturing is growing rapidly to meet this ramp up in projects, and IEA projects that production capacity may reach 1 TW annually by the end of 2024. This component supply is sufficient to meet annual demand in IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.
PV manufacturing project announcements in the U.S. have doubled since December, indicating that supply chains are diversifying in the medium term.
U.S. distributed solar additions are expected to hold strong, contributing about 8 GW to the 2024 total. Distributed generation offers numerous benefits in alleviating transmission requirements, offering resilient and flexible power, and potentially offering more financial benefits at the community level.
IEA notes there are two major policy changes that may counteract each other in the U.S. distributed generation space. One, the net metering ratemaking changes in California are expected to push installations downward for a time, while the incentives for community solar and economic adders in 2023 may make commercial PV more attractive to customers.
The report said IRA incentives and credits are a “game-changer,” but this change will become evident in 2025. Under the act, PV projects will once again be eligible for the Production Tax Credit if construction begins before 2025, offering an alternative for new capacity additions on top of those spurred by the Investment Tax Credit.
Globally, renewable energy installations are expected to reach 4.5 TW by the end of 2024, equal to the total power capacity of the U.S. and China combined. Annual installations could reach as high as 550 GW in IEA’s accelerated pace, pending improvements in timely permitting and grid interconnection processes. While solar is expected to rise sharply, IEA said global onshore wind additions may pull back 5% in 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/01/optimus-energy-eyes-commercial-solar-ev-charging-expansion-in-georgia/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,FLORIDA,GEORGIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 1, 2023","Optimus Energy eyes commercial solar, EV charging expansion in Georgia","Optimus Energy Solutions, a Mount Dora, Florida-based commercial, industrial and residential solar installer, sees market expansion opportunities in its neighboring state of Georgia as a new opportunity for securing new commercial PV projects and deploy EV charging stations.
Ben Pauluhn, chief executive officer and founder of Optimus Energy, told pv magazine USA that the developer sees Georgia as its strongest market for new commercial and industrial (C&I) solar projects and EV charging systems, where it is an installer of ChargePoint AC and DC fast charging systems. For now, though, the Floridian solar installer said he does not see a need to set up a second office in the Peach State.
At a current installation rate of about 2 MW per year of C&I projects (two-thirds of its revenue) and some residential projects (one-third of revenue), Pauluhn said Optimus aspires to deploy 3 MW to 5 MW of solar installations per year across both segments over the coming years. Additional projects in its home state and new projects within Georgia Power service territory could bring more business in for the developer as it expects to grow from its current 11 employee base into a larger organization.
Pauluhn founded the company in 2018 and in its first five years has doubled its installation rate each consecutive year as the company procures projects from Jacksonville, Fla., down to Tampa and the southern portion of the Sunshine State.
With favorable net metering framework across the state, Pauluhn said Optimus averages three residential installations per week and over the last year has deployed 2 MW per year of C&I market projects.
As a licensed American Solar Energy Society installer, Optimus’ residential contracts are performed by about half of its staff, which primarily services the central Florida region, while about half of its work in the region is sub-contracted out to local contractors, he said.
In the commercial market, Optimus installed projects for the hospitality, automotive dealership, consumer goods and various other markets across the Florida peninsula.

For energy storage, Pauluhn said Florida residents previously had a mismatched perception of how much battery storage is needed at homes to drive down electricity costs when Floridians typically require continuous use of air conditioning systems, creating a huge load drain on the electric grid.
“Air conditioner usage pushes for much larger solar systems, especially because gas service is not that prevalent in Florida, so almost all power consumed in the home is electric,” Pauluhn said.  The mismatch on air conditioner sizing to batteries is evident as battery sizes are needed to be upsized to start up multiple large loads like compressors and wells used in HVAC or home solutions, he said.
Nowadays, Optimus is deploying about 10% of rooftop residential projects with an attached storage system using Enphase, SolarEdge or DuraCell Power Center battery systems, while the company regularly uses REC Solar panels for residential PV installations and JinkoSolar panels for C&I projects, he said. The company also uses SolarEdge microinverters and Ironridge racking systems, he added.
In EV charging, the company has deployed a single-digit attachment rate worth of charging stations to primarily residential customers across Florida. Optimus is an exclusive ChargePoint installer of Level 2 AC charging and DC fast charging products for the growing Southeast EV market.
In its first five years, Optimus has secured sizable C&I contracts around its home state. Just last month, the installer secured a 1.51 MW commercial project for Legacy Vacation Resorts, a resort hotel operator, to deploy 200 kW to 760 kW rooftop PV systems across four hotel properties in central Florida.
After the Legacy projects, Pauluhn said Optimus has another two C&I projects in the works for Q3 2023, which would add another 1 MW of installations to the company’s development schedule for the year, rounding out the year at more than 2.5 MW.
Asked about the Inflation Reduction Act and domestic content sourcing, Pauluhn said the regional solar developer aspires to source as much components as possible in the coming years from local resources and U.S.-made systems. For Legacy, Optimus is procuring 3,700 domestically-assembled JinkoSolar 410 W modules, which are being distributed straight from the supplier’s Jacksonville, Fla., facility to instate project sites, providing an easy procurement for the developer, Pauluhn said.
Climate First Bank, a regional FDIC-insured community banking group, is a financial partner of the company and has securitized financing of the company’s Legacy resort portfolio. Pauluhn said the bank, which finances Southeastern clean energy developers and corporations with sustainability goals, is also a commercial bank lender to the small business.
Asked about Florida Governor and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, Pauluhn said since the governor took office in 2019, he has taken a pro-rooftop solar and small business-friendly stance. On April 27, 2022, DeSantis vetoed state legislation, HB-741, which would have ended net metering in Florida as proposed by its various utilities.
To date, Optimus Energy has been self-funded by management and sees itself as an employee-run company, Pauluhn said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/01/open-source-data-can-unlock-the-power-of-microgrids/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 1, 2023",Open source data can unlock the power of microgrids,"Microgrids connect distributed assets like solar, energy storage, and grid-connected electric vehicles to operate a flexible, resilient grid that is able to operate without support from the utility transmission grid.
The U.S. microgrid market is growing steadily, with about 10 GW of microgrid assets deployed through 2022.
According to Wood Mackenzie, the U.S. microgrid market saw a 47% increase in solar and storage capacity additions in 2022 compared to 2017 levels. Moreover, the data shows that more than 175 solar projects and solar-plus-storage microgrids have been in active development and were scheduled to come online by the end of 2022.
From military applications to critical resources, new home communities, remote communities, cities, airports, and universities, microgrids are already providing services to a wide variety of customers that rely on their power supply.
Tailwinds continue to move microgrids along in the U.S. Perhaps most notably the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 2222 allow aggregated distributed resources to stand on the same footing as utility-scale assets by participating in the wholesale energy markets.
The asset-based demand response is actively being evaluated across the U.S., including in Texas, which suffered widespread outages in the Winter Storm Uri due to natural gas underperformance and transmission grid restrains. Microgrids offer the ability to quickly respond when communities are hit hard by these constraints under extreme events.
A report from the Netherlands found that microgrid technologies could make a local “technoeconomy” 90% self-sufficient through decentralized energy sharing at the local level between multiple households.
“The climate crisis, however, presents us with an opportunity to rethink our energy systems. There is an urgent need to pivot towards greener, more resilient, and self-sustained energy systems. Not only would this mitigate the impacts of climate change, but it would also enable the infrastructure to effectively handle the power load fluctuations triggered by extreme weather conditions, said the Linux Foundation in a report on the benefits of open source data among the microgrid developer community.
Open source
Open source software is open code published and made available to the public, enabling users to copy, modify, and redistribute code without paying royalties or fees. In the face of a changing climate and increased extreme weather events, open source practices for microgrid operational data may offer an accelerated path towards adoption.
There are five main outcomes the Linux Foundation sees in the practice:
1. EXPANDS ACCESS TO MICROGRIDS, democratizing both energy access in emerging markets and microgrids resources and education for all.
2. ACCELERATES MICROGRID DESIGNS AND TIME-TO-MARKET, by enabling modularity, efficiencies, and open data sharing.
 3. IMPROVES INTEROPERABILITY and standards adoption, by fostering ecosystem collaboration, consensus, transparency, and compatibility across the stack.
4. ENABLES MICROGRID BUSINESS MODELS, via software, support and consulting services, training and certification, customization and integration, collaborative partnerships, and advancing modularity.
5. ENABLES MARKET INNOVATION TOWARD ENERGY RESILIENCE AT SCALE, via open source–enabled business models, security, and cost reductions.
The Linux Foundation report includes a series of links to actively available microgrid open source databases, which can be found on page 19. The resources span from standards, modeling and simulation tools, software and platforms, educational resources, associatied foundations, and component and hardware data.
“Some 100 years ago, governments helped scale national power grids with subsidies, but this is not the case with microgrids. They won’t radically scale until we combine forces to bring it all together,” said Manoj Sinha, founder and CEO of Husk. “Yes, it’s a risky bet to publish a roadmap that may divulge your own secret sauce, but we have to do that for the industry to grow. Years ago, when I worked in semiconductors, Intel published a semiconductor roadmap. These roadmaps don’t just help other companies; they help the entire industry pie grow more.”
The collaboration will require participation from microgrid operators, utilities, open source communities and foundations, and governments to fully unlock the potential of this technology.
Microgrid business models
The report examines several of different business models that microgrid providers provide. One popular method in the U.S. is energy-as-a-service (EaaS). Under this arrangement software, remote sensing, analytics, and other technologies enable providers to offer “pay-as-you-go” cloud-based service models for energy with remote monitoring and optimization. The model is particularly popular for U.S. institutional, commercial, and industrial applications, as customers take little to no risk and pay no upfront capital, while the EaaS provider designs, builds, owns, operates, and maintains the microgrid.
Another pathway to microgrids is through a utility partnership with local communities. Under this arrangement, infrastructure and energy management become two separate businesses. Communities benefit from greater efficiencies and reliability, while utilities are able to manage loads, ensuring flexibility and making way for more renewables on the grid.
A third microgrid business model is prosumer and peer-to-peer based microgrids, in which local energy nodes like rooftop solar or grid-connected electric vehicles can sell excess energy to other members of the community or utility, reducing costs for all participants.
“While nascent, these models are creating new tailwinds for microgrid adoption. Meanwhile, several adjacent trends, from standard pricing mechanisms to blockchain tokenization to regulations, could further influence economic incentives for microgrids,” said the Linux Foundation.

The Treasury and IRS released guidance that provides information about the application process and technical guidance for the program on energy communities as well as the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit program (48C) of the Internal Revenue Code from February 2023.
Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit
Under the IRA, $10 billion in total funding will be made available under the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit program. Congress required that at least $4 billion be reserved for projects in communities with closed coal mines or retired coal power plants. The initial funding round will include $4 billion, with about $1.6 billion reserved for energy projects sited in these designated coal communities.
To apply, taxpayers should submit concept papers describing the proposed project. Concept paper submissions will be accepted starting June 30, 2023, and the deadline for concept papers will be July 31, 2023. Beginning today, taxpayers can access information and materials for submissions.
More information, including a 48C mapping tool and an upcoming informational webinar, is available on the Department of Energy’s 48C webpage. 
Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury: President Biden’s Investing in America agenda ensures all communities benefit from the growth of the clean energy economy by driving investment in areas of the country that have often been overlooked and left behind. These investments will improve the nation’s energy security and create good-paying jobs in vital fields like clean-energy manufacturing and critical materials processing. They will also allow for existing energy infrastructure to be retooled for the clean energy economy. All this work will contribute to lower energy costs for families who have struggled to pay their utility bills.
Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit
Treasury and IRS also released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit program under Section 48E of the Internal Revenue Code, which was established on February 13, 2023.
The rulemaking includes an application process and technical guidance for low-income communities program, which provides an additional 20% Investment Tax Credit adder for up to 1.8 GW of annual new solar and wind energy projects (with maximum size of 5 MW) that are located in designated low-income communities or otherwise serving low-income populations.
“Every community can benefit from President Biden’s agenda to Invest in America through the revitalization of domestic manufacturing, the strengthening of domestic clean energy supply chains and the modernization of our nation’s industrial sector,” said David Turk, Deputy Secretary of Energy. “The guidance announced today will help usher in investments that will further spur the creation of quality jobs in every pocket of our country, while strengthening our energy resilience.”
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 defines “energy communities” with respect to certain types of U.S. government statistical data areas, such as “census tracts,” “metropolitan statistical areas,” and “non-metropolitan statistical areas.” However, the Act did not specify which vintages of these areas should be used by taxpayers. Initial guidance provided by the Treasury in April clarifies which data sets will apply, and the DOE’s mapping tool reflects those data sets in a user-friendly way.

Using its  48 kWh/288 kW energy storage systems contained in battery cabinets, ZincFive will provide its nickel-zinc-based uninterruptible power systems (UPS) into the hydrogen generator systems of KCE, which use a PowerCell fuel cell. The system will provide modular hydrogen fueling and EV charging in a single station, making it suitable for new markets for clean fuel.
The company’s commercial and industrial grade batteries rely on a nickel-zinc chemistry and potassium hydroxide aqueous electrolyte, an alkaline base suitable to operate in environments of 50 degrees to 104 degrees, and store electricity in environments as cold as -4 degrees.
“ZincFive and KCE have collaborated closely to develop a microgrid solution that delivers exceptional value to our customers,” said Robert Meaney, co-founder of KCE. “Leveraging ZincFive’s expertise in battery technology integrations, we have accelerated our learning cycles and streamlined our path to market. We are excited to commission our first system with our customer Zeem during the month of May.”
DC fast charging
ZincFive is also supplying its immediate power solution systems into a pilot DC fast charging station project of Advanced Power & Energy located in Greenville, Pennsylvania. The partner is developing commercial DC fast charging stations from 120 kW to 4 MW. For the project, three AP&E power cabinets using 240 kW worth of ZincFive batteries are being commissioned, Tim Hysell,  chief executive officer of ZincFive, told pv magazine USA.
“The DC fast charging site is located near two EV corridors as defined by the Pennsylvania State Department of Transportation, adjacent to the intersection of Highways 79 and 80,” George Bulick, president of Advanced Power & Energy, told pv magazine USA.
“We have worked closely with ZincFive to develop a unique set of products that offer turn-key immediate power battery solutions for commercial and industrial applications, including EV charging,” said Bulick.
AP&E has identified multiple additional U.S. fast charging sites and expects to launch its line of ZincFive battery-integrated EV charging stations in Q4 2023, with additional installations beginning in early 2024, said Bulick.
Both companies use U.S.-made batteries and energy storage cabinet components, and expect the products to qualify for funding under the Inflation Reduction Act as related to domestic content sourcing, Bulick and Hysell said.
Previously, ZincFive supplied its UPS battery cabinet and battery packs to data center facilities and mission-critical applications like medical systems and traffic centers that require continuous power. Lithium-ion batteries have shorter lifespans, can degrade or heat up, posing considerable risk for users of continuous power. ZincFive  reports that its battery cells provide no thermal runaway or travel restrictions for usage, theoretically making them safer across a wider group of applications than lithium batteries.
Founded in 2016, ZincFive is based in Tualatin, Oregon and has raised $139 million to date from VC investors Helios Climate Ventures, 40 North Ventures, Senator Investment Group, OGCI Climate Investment, Japan Energy Fund and Standard Investments.
