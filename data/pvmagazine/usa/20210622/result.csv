OYA and Omni expect to build the first 240 MW of projects under the arrangement in New York over the next 24 months and, independent of the deal, OYA expects to have 100 MW in construction this year from its existing New York pipeline. According to the company, these combined capacities make OYA’s community solar development pipeline represent roughly 12% of the state’s entire community solar development pipeline.
OYA has made rapid progress in becoming a key community solar developer in New York, as the company opened its New York office just over two years ago.
Outside of New York, the rest of the capacity executed under this deal will be developed in Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The two companies also hinted at more agreements to come soon, alluding to collaboration on portfolios in Massachusetts and New Mexico, as well as more development in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/22/renewables-are-seeing-declines-in-cost-and-market-value-what-gives/,"MARKETS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 22, 2021",Renewables are seeing declines in cost and market value: What gives?,"Regions that have high penetration of solar and wind resources can experience an excess of energy supply, which drives down hourly power prices, particularly for renewables. This is a benefit for consumers, but the decline in market value can hurt producers, according to a new study from the Energy Department’s Berkeley Lab. 
The study tracked market value of energy and capacity produced by 2,100 utility scale power plants across major power markets through 2019. The article appeared in Joule, “Solar and Wind Grid-System Value in the United States: The Impact of Transmission Congestion, Generation Profiles, and Curtailment.”
It found that output profiles (that is, how the output of generators matches local market prices, and the effect of transmission congestion had the largest impacts on market value. Curtailment, or the shutdown of solar and wind generators due to over-generation, had little effect. 
When compared to a “flat block” of generation–a theoretical “always on” power plant–solar and wind saw a decline in market value as their grid penetration increased. Solar had relatively high market values at penetration levels below 3% but declined as penetration increased. Wind was less than the flat-block value even at low penetration, but declined at a lower rate as penetration increased. 
While renewable energy market values have declined, costs have declined by even more. The report said this dynamic is reflected in the record number of proposed wind and solar projects, as evidenced by the volumes in interconnection queues.
Future trends in the market, technology, cost, and deployment have both positive and negative effects, said the study. It offered several ways to mitigate the decline in market value. 
For one thing, mitigating decline in market value must be matched with its cause in each region. Building more intra-regional transmission would relieve congestion penalties, the study said. And shifting output profiles through energy storage, new rate structures, demand response, and flexible loads is likely to be more helpful to regions with issues in their output profiles.  
Solar has been especially sensitive to market value decline due to its output profile. The study said the rise of hybrid solar-plus storage plants has helped in this regard. Wind turbines have resorted to using larger blades, allowing for improved generation during periods of low wind speeds. This boosts capacity factor, flattens the output profile, and reduces profile penalties. 
The Berkeley Lab paper said that both forces are expected to continue and that market values will fall, as will costs. Mitigation efforts will likely be necessary for the decline in cost to win the race against the decline in value.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/22/more-than-a-view-here-are-3-solar-energy-producing-windows/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 22, 2021",More than a view: Here are 3 solar energy-producing windows,"Buildings account for nearly 40% of global energy use and contribute about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions on our planet. What’s more, global building stock is expected to double in area by 2060. 
As solar arrays and wind farms continue to fill in open spaces, innovators have a vision of another way to produce energy:  photovoltaic windows. 
Here are some of the companies currently involved in turning windows into energy-producing devices:
Image: NEXT Energy Technologies
NEXT Energy Technologies produces a transparent photovoltaic coating that transforms commercial windows into energy-producing solar panels. The company said its first-generation windows could offset as much as 10-20% of the electricity needs of a typical commercial high-rise office building. 
NEXT Energy claims a one-year payback for the windows, and a functional life of 30 years. The windows transmit between 10%-50% of visible light and convert it to power at 7%-10% efficiency. 
The photovoltaic coatings are applied during the window fabrication process, integrating with established manufacturers without disrupting workflows and supply chains. NEXT Energy said its approach removes costs typically associated with packaging and installation of solar. 
A prototype of NEXT Energy’s Window Wall will soon be display in Paris, featuring an interactive display and charging ports that are powered by a set of 10 windows.
The prototype installation is designed to supply electricity to a battery that will power an interactive display as well as charging outlets for phones, tablets, and other electronics. In the coming years, NEXT windows are expected to be commercially available for window sizes up to 5 ft. x 10 ft (1.5 x 3 meters).
SolarWindow Technologies creates a product called Liquid Electricity, a transparent and lightweight material meant to be applied to glass, plastics, and films. The company said it has applications in architecture, agrivoltaics, aerospace and defense, and transportation.
A recent independent study between SolarWindow and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory determined a power conversion efficiency level as high as 14.72%.
The company said one advantage of its technology over rooftop solar is it can work under natural, shaded, low-light, and even indoor artificial light sources. 
The window uses what SolarWindow said are organic photovoltaics (OPV), and are produced as thin as 1/100th the thickness of a human hair. The process does not use toxic metals such as lead, cadmium, and selenium. The company said that in OPV two layers create a material boundary known as the acceptor layer and the donor layer. The material in each layer has its own specific level of electrical potential. The difference between each material’s electrical potential stimulates the movement of electrons, which generates electricity.
The product comes in a variety of transparency levels, from entirely non-transparent to transparency typical of a residential window. It can be applied with blue, green, gray, or tan tint, and electric output decreases as transparency increases.
U.S. and Ukraine-based SolarGaps views the concept from a different angle: rather than electrifying windows, it developed blinds integrated with photovoltaics. The blinds automatically track the sun, producing power and keeping the building cool.  
SolarGaps said its product can produce 100W per hour for every square meter during daytime. The product is installed external to the building and has both commercial and residential applications. SunPower C60 solar elements with a claimed 22.4% efficiency are used. 
Although it is an external installation, the blinds have built-in wind resistance with a  steel cable and are tested with air guns, said SolarGaps. The company claims a 10-year minimum lifespan and offers a two-year warranty. 
The blinds are IOS and Android app compatible, integrated with smart-home technology, can provide performance reports, and can be voice-controlled. The device has its own built-in tracker motor and inverter.

The Wheatsborough Solar project would be a 125 MW array, coupled with a 50 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) in Groton Township, Erie County, between Cleveland and Toledo. Sycamore Creek would be a 117 MW standalone project in Cranberry Township, Crawford County, also between Cleveland and Toledo.
The Wheatsborough Solar project is being developed by Apex Clean Energy, while the Sycamore Creek project is being developed by National Grid Renewables.
The hearings, which are set to take place at 6 p.m., EST on July 7 at Margaretta High School for Wheatsborough and 6 p.m., EST on July 22 at Bucyrus Public Library, are intended to give unaffiliated individuals an opportunity to provide testimony regarding the proposed facility, before OPSB decides whether to approve the project or not.
The installations would be among the largest in Ohio and Wheatsborough’s paired battery would be the largest BESS known to pv magazine in the state. The projects would provide a significant boost to the state’s overall installed solar capacity, which currently sits at roughly 530 MW, the majority of which came online in 2020.
Despite the relatively slow start, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) predicts that Ohio will see significant solar expansion over the next five years, adding a forecasted 2,955 MW, good for 11th in the nation over that period.
Alongside the potential capacity brought by these two projects, the state will receive a major boost once the Hillcrest Solar facility is completed. Developed by Innergex Renewable Energy, the 200 MW installation will be the largest in the state once it is completed, and construction started last year.
Also noteworthy is the 107 MW Arche Energy Project, with that installation being sponsored by 7X Energy. Final project design for Arche are expected to be completed in the third quarter. Construction could begin in the fourth quarter and be completed within 12 months.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/22/sunrise-brief-recurrent-energy-announces-energy-storage-contracts-for-california-projects/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 22, 2021",Sunrise brief: Recurrent Energy announces energy storage contracts for California projects,"Recurrent Energy, a unit of Canadian Solar, announced multiple contracts for battery energy storage systems (BESS) to be built in 2021 and 2022, including retrofits as-a-service, solar plus storage PPAs, and stand-alone storage tolling agreements.
Southern California Edison awarded Recurrent Energy a long-term contract beginning in the summer of 2022 for the 200 MW / 800 MWh Crimson BESS project. Both state regulators and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved construction of the project on public lands in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles.
Recurrent Energy also is partnering with Southern Power and AIP Management to provide development services to add 72 MW / 288 MWh of energy storage to the 200 MW Tranquillity solar project in Fresno County, California; and 88 MW / 352 MWh of energy storage to the 200 MW Garland solar project in Kern County, also in California. The Tranquillity and Garland solar PV projects were originally developed and built by Recurrent Energy in 2016 and are now owned by Southern Power and AIP. BESS retrofits on both projects are under construction.
Recurrent Energy said it also is building the Slate project (300 MW solar plus 140.25 MW / 561 MWh storage) and the 75 MW / 300 MWh BESS retrofit to the 100 MW Mustang solar project. Slate and Mustang are both located in Kings County, California and are owned by Goldman Sachs Renewable Power LLC.
NextEnergy Capital Group announced new investor commitments of $232 million into NextPower III ESG international solar fund, taking total funds raised to date to $530 million. The new commitments include German occupational pension fund, Derigo Gmbh & Co.KG, and an unnamed UK institutional investor.
NPIII focused on the international solar infrastructure sector, principally targeting projects in the U.S., Portugal, Spain, Chile and Italy. The fund to date has acquired 14 projects plus one portfolio with a total installed capacity of around 400 MW. This 10-year closed-ended fund is targeting a gross internal rate of return of 13-15%. The fund has a hard cap of $1 billion.
NPIII has five projects under exclusivity for an installed capacity of 453 MW and another 351 MW under advanced negotiation. During the third and fourth quarter, these acquisitions are expected to be completed bringing the fund’s total installed capacity to around 1,200 MW.
NEC said that NPIII is expected to achieve a portfolio of between 2.5 GW and 3.0 GW in operating solar projects across its target markets upon full capital deployment.
Nokomis Energy, a Minneapolis-based developer, and Rosemawr Sustainable Infrastructure Management said they will partner to deploy more than 50 MW of solar across Minnesota. The portfolio is expected to consist of 30 projects which could generate more than 70 million kWh per year upon completion.
Hydro-Québec brought two solar generating stations on line near Montreal, the first in the power company’s history. Gabrielle-Bodis generating station, in La Prairie, and Robert-A.-Boyd generating station in Varennes have a combined installed capacity of 9.5 MW and will be able to generate close to 16 GWh of solar power annually.
These facilities will help Hydro-Québec determine whether solar power is a good fit for its generating fleet, transmission grid, and the Québec climate. The projects use bifacial modules which will be tested to determine their effectiveness in capturing light reflected off of snow.
Although Hydro-Québec said it does not need additional capacity, it is considering solar energy to meet future demand.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/22/seia-has-a-strong-sense-that-u-s-solar-supply-chains-are-shifting-but-hard-numbers-are-scarce/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 22, 2021","SEIA has a ‘strong sense’ that U.S. solar supply chains are shifting, but hard numbers are scarce","Some 175 members of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) signed a pledge in early February against the use of forced labor in the supply chain.
The industry organization said at the time that it first became aware of the labor issue late in 2020 and began communicating with its members companies that they needed to move their supply chains out of the Xinjiang region of China where the forced labor allegations were focused.
In an interview at the time with pv magazine, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said that the trade group’s expectations were that companies would set up new factories and repurpose facilities in other parts of China, or rely on production from other nations.
“The reality is that companies will start to lose business if they do not make these changes,” she said in the interview, adding that  “we think that the shift will happen by the end of June.”

Ross Hopper told pv magazine, “There is an urgency to this that companies understand” and that by the end of June, companies “will have had seven-plus months to make these changes.”
Now, as June draws to a close, pv magazine followed up with SEIA to learn how well the domestic solar industry has met the goal Ross Hopper laid out in February.
In response to an email, John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy said, “We don’t know and we may not know” the percentage of the industry that has shifted its supply chain. Based on what SEIA has heard from the U.S. government and from customers, “most of the major suppliers have found sources of polysilicon outside of Xinjiang,” he said.
In addition, SEIA has been in “close contact” with companies and has a “strong sense” that the largest suppliers are using SEIA’s newly issued supply chain protocol or adapting it to their own needs and are moving supply chains, he said.
In May, in response to a question during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, the Biden administration’s climate envoy John Kerry confirmed that the administration is considering introducing additional sanctions on China that could affect the solar industry. In a story published June 21, the Politico news web site reported that the administration is considering an outright ban on polysilicon from the region.
Mark D. Herlach, a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm Eversheds Sutherland said in an interview that any sanctions could be calibrated and may well depend on the amount of political pressure directed toward the administration.
In a note to clients, the firm said that possible sanctions could have implications on purchasers of panels. Implications could include direct legal jeopardy, financing challenges, supply chain disruptions, and reputational risk. The note said that reputational concerns, for example, have led major brands such as Calvin Klein, Gap, H&M, IKEA, Patagonia, and Tommy Hilfiger to stop buying cotton sourced from Xinjiang.
Adding to pressure on the Biden administration, members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter urging customs officials to “immediately take aggressive enforcement actions” regarding polysilicon products entering the United States from Xinjiang, China. The letter to acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner Troy Miller was dated June 10 and was signed by two dozen members of the congressional tax writing committee.

The letter complained that the agency has been slow in following up on forced labor allegations and “has yet to take a single enforcement action.” It said that customs officials had received allegations in late 2020 and suggested “imminent enforcement action” three months ago. “We believe it is time to act,” the letter said.
In late April, SEIA released the supply chain tracking tool that it said would increase transparency and help ensure that solar components are made ethically throughout the solar value chain.
The Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol is a set of guidelines intended to help solar companies meet compliance obligations and “provide customers with assurances that their solar products are free of unethical labor practices.”
“Solar customers expect their products to be ethically produced, and this protocol helps ensure that solar products coming into the United States are not made using forced labor,” said Smirnow on releasing the tool.

The protocol is a set of recommended best practices that SEIA said is designed to prevent forced labor in the solar supply chain; help companies meet their U.S. import compliance obligations; and provide customers value chain transparency. SEIA said the tool was structured as an industry specification or de facto standard, with the expectation that it will be further developed into a formal industry standard.
The protocol includes an audit mechanism intended to measure a company’s implementation and compliance. SEIA said that auditors would assess conformance.
Companies with global supply chains typically have compliance officers whose job it is to ensure that a myriad of U.S. and international trade agreements, import restrictions, and related requirements are adhered to. A similar ramp-up in compliance monitoring could be in store for the solar industry.
In the email to pv magazine, Smirnow said that after the third-party audits are completed, “we’ll have a better sense of the level at which companies are successfully implementing the protocol.”
He expressed confidence that companies will be able to demonstrate to customs officials and customers that they are not using forced labor, “but those companies may not make all of their information public.”
Also in her February interview, Ross Hopper told pv magazine that supply contracts may need to be renegotiated, but offered “I don’t think it’s going to have a huge impact on cost.”
Four months later, Smornow said that, as with other sectors of the economy, “there are cost increases” associated with logistical challenges around the globe. With regard to logistical costs of moving poly production, “there is nothing unique about the shift of polysilicon capacity” from conflict regions within China.
“We don’t see a connection between the recent price increases and our call to move supply out of the region.”

He said that extra production capacity is being added in other parts of China, India, Malaysia, Europe, and the United States. One source contacted by pv magazine said that supply chains can take years to establish, especially considering the capital needed to set up and establish alternative sources of basic supplies.
In early June, First Solar said it would invest $680 million to expand its domestic U.S. photovoltaic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3 GW annually. The facility would increase the company’s northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GWdc, which it said represents one of the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complexes outside of China.

Higher commodity prices and delivery delays are beginning to affect portions of the U.S. solar industry, according to SEIA and Wood Mackenzie in their Solar Market Insight Report for the first quarter, published in mid-June.
The report said the most significant impact of the current supply environment is on utility-scale projects that are under development. Developers are approaching off-takers to renegotiate their power purchase agreements (PPA) in an effort to increase prices or relax in-service dates.
The report said that, so far, efforts to increase PPA prices on existing contracts “have not been very successful in a hyper-competitive market.”
The report said the price of steel has more than doubled since the pandemic began. This has led to increased prices and lowered availability of solar racking equipment and trackers. Here, too, this has mostly affected utility-scale solar projects but has also impacted carport installations, which require more steel support structures than other solar projects.
Equity research firm Roth Capital Advisors warned clients in a May 16 research note that current price pressures could delay as much as 15% of planned 2021 utility scale solar development.
