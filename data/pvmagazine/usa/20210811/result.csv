The document was voted on, and released, by the Senate’s controlling Democratic Party.
The document will help guide the coming Budget Reconciliation process, which needs only a simple majority to pass the House and Senate.
The bill aims to fight climate change with investments in clean electricity and home electrification, to be funded by higher taxes on corporations. Several items directly influence the solar, electric vehicle, and energy industries:
While official language has yet to be written, the blueprint offers indications for where discussions are likely to go.
Many clean energy industry groups, as well as House and Senate members, have proposed that the tax credits for residential and business owned solar be raised from their current 26% to 30%, and extended through the end of 2029.
Additionally, the Biden Administration, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and others have advocated for shifting the tax credits to a “direct day” format. Under that arrangement, a direct pay credit first would be applied against a tax filer’s tax liability. Unlike the current tax credit, however, any leftover credit would be refunded to the filer via a cash payment.
The current pure tax credit can be rolled over into the following year’s tax liability, but eventually is discarded entirely if the taxpayer’s tax liability is insufficient.
While the CEPP won’t incentivize solar power directly, it would provide financial motivation for utilities that choose to make use of it. An explanation of this program was put together by the Clean Air Task Force. An in-depth description can be found on co-author Jesse Jenkins’ twitter account.
A key sentence from the Clean Air Task Force write up describes the CEPP as follows:
“Electricity suppliers that increase their share of clean electricity beyond a designated annual threshold receive federal performance payments for each additional MWh of clean electricity delivered….It is not a regulatory mechanism and does not create a binding mandate.”
The manufacturing tax credits might include those submitted by Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA). These tax credit include:

The projects were financed by Summit Ridge Energy, facilitated by Black Bear Energy, and will be owned and operated by Summit Ridge. They mark the first foray into community solar for BentallGreenOak. Once the capacity becomes operational in the second quarter of 2022, the arrays are expected to supply enough electricity to meet the annual demand of around 300 homes.
BentallGreenOak recently bought two industrial properties in Maryland, and those may may play host to the rooftop capacity.
Earlier this summer, Summit Ridge entered into a joint venture with Osaka Gas USA Corp. to build, own, and operate more than 120 MW of community solar projects throughout the state of Maine.

The offering follows a decision by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to establish a new solar energy incentive program. Madison Energy Investments has not yet made clear how many projects, or how much capacity could result from its offering.
Of interest will be the inclusion of energy storage. Earlier this summer, the state launched an incentive program for residential and business customers to buy and install energy storage systems as part of an Equitable Modern Grid initiative. The initiative calls on the state to install 1,000 MW of energy storage by the end of 2030, and includes proposed incentives ranging from $225 to $280 per kWh for up to 50 MW of energy storage for commercial and industrial installations through 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/11/recovering-waste-heat-from-solar-cells-using-a-thermoelectric-generator/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 11, 2021",Recovering waste heat from solar cells using a thermoelectric generator,"From pv magazine Global
A U.S.-Italian research group has fabricated a hybrid thermoelectric photovoltaic (HTEPV) system that is able to recover waste heat from its solar cell and use it to generate additional power output.
The device consists of an optimized thermoelectric generator (TEG) placed in thermal contact with the back of a perovskite solar cell with a surface area of 1 cm² by means of a layer of thermal grease. While in thermal contact, the two units are electrically separated.
“The HTEPV should be used once two main requirements regarding the PV part are met,” research co-author, Bruno Lorenzi, told pv magazine. The first is that they use cells with a wide bandgap. The researchers estimate that cells with an energy gap greater than about 1.6 eV are needed, as large gap cells are less sensitive to temperature in terms of their performance. The second requirement is that the system has sufficient input power to raise the temperature enough.
Heat flows naturally through the TEG because its cold side is kept at room temperature, while its hot side, which is in thermal contact with the cell, is at a high temperature. The Seebeck effect, which is the direct conversion of temperature differences between two semiconductor materials into electric voltage, generates this difference which then translates into additional electrical power.

The scientists decided not to use a spectrum splitting technology, which is generally utilized in these applications, to direct different parts of the solar spectrum towards either the PV or the TEG unit.
“It is more convenient, in terms of final efficiency gains, to keep the solar cell at the same temperature of the TEG hot side, instead of keeping the cell cold but losing much of the recoverable heat,” the academics explained. They said that a wide-gap solar cell based on perovskite was chosen for the device, due to its lower sensitivity to high temperatures.
“Temperature-sensitive materials, such as silicon, lose too much efficiency to make the hybridization convenient,” they said.
The TEG is placed into an evacuated tube to minimize the heat exchange with the environment. It is able to extract waste heat from the solar cell and convey it to its cold plate, where it is dissipated by a fluid. Its cold side is attached with thermal grease to the vacuum chamber bottom and its temperature is controlled with a K-type thermocouple.
 “As the TEG part is placed under a difference of temperature a delta of electrical potential is developed between its hot and cold electrodes due to the Seebeck effect,” Lorenzi said. “Thus once the TEG is connected to a load it generates a flowing electrical current.”
The extraction of heat from the solar cell, according to the scientists, can provide efficiency gains ranging from 0.2 to 3.05%. Although the group tested different kinds of wide-gap solar cells for the HTEPV system, it found the perovskite-based devices offer the best performance in terms of power conversion efficiency.
“Evaluating the cost of this technology is not easy, because it depends a lot on the type of system you are considering,” the Italian researchers said. “The thermoelectric material itself has a negligible cost, as very little is needed in volumetric terms per unit of area. What may increase the device’s cost, according to him are the heat sink, the vacuum tube, and the concentrator used for its assembly. “If you develop a hybrid starting from a PV technology that works in concentration and with a cooling system, the cost is very low and there are no problems,” he said. “The other cases must be carefully evaluated.”
The full description of the thermoelectric-photovoltaic device can be found in the paper Practical development of efficient thermoelectric – Photovoltaic hybrid systems based on wide-gap solar cells, published in Applied Energy. The research group includes scientists from the University of Milano-Bicocca and the University of Rome Tor Vergata in Italy, as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States.

The RFP aims to obtain renewable energy to meet the state’s increasing Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and capacity required to meet projected New Mexico energy demand. The RPS requires the utility to meet 40% of its jurisdictional sales with renewable energy resources beginning in 2025.
The utility is experiencing around a 2% customer base growth rate year-over-year, leading to an increase in energy usage and customer demand.
The utility’s resource planning studies project a New Mexico capacity need of roughly 40 MW in 2022, growing to 90 MW in 2024, with 90 to 110 MW of capacity needed in 2025. The utility said the new generation is also necessary to offset its planned retirements of older, less-efficient generating units.
The utility said it will also need a long-term resource that will generate roughly 175,000 MWh per year of additional renewable energy by December 2024.
