PREPA will issue the first of the six procurements “as early in 2021 as possible,” the utility said in a regulatory filing. Regulators had set a target release date of last December for that first procurement, to secure 1,000 MW of solar and 500 MW of storage.
A study released by PREPA in mid-January, however, concludes that Puerto Rico’s grid can handle only 650 MW of utility-scale renewable generation, including existing renewables. That value does not reflect “expected system upgrades or energy storage systems that will be incorporated in the near future,” said the study, prepared by engineering consultants Sargent & Lundy.
In an apparent reference to the study, PREPA Board Chairman Ralph Kreil told local newspaper El Nuevo Dia, “We understand that the system supports between 500 and 600 megawatts” of renewables, “and the Bureau understands that it must be 1,000,” according to a Google translation of the Spanish-language quote. Kreil added that PREPA’s request for proposals will call for 1,000 MW of solar, “as the Bureau says, and we will see what happens.”
The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau’s dockets for this matter are NEPR-MI-2020-0012 and CEPR-AP-2018-0001.
“We have 3% renewable energy” in Puerto Rico, said PJ Wilson, president of the Solar + Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. “We can build 2,000 MW of renewables before we get the integration challenges that they saw in Hawaii and elsewhere. Let’s get construction going on those 2,000 MW now, and solve the integration challenges for higher levels as we go.”
Wilson said that PREPA indicated last week that each solar and storage procurement would be issued via the utility’s software, PowerAdvocate. He charged that the procurements would be “posted publicly nowhere” so that “not even the Energy Bureau” would be able to see it. The association he leads plans to ask the Energy Bureau to order PREPA to post each request for proposals in a public docket.
Puerto Rico’s Act 17, enacted in 2019, requires PREPA to reach 20% renewable generation by 2022 and 40% renewables by 2025.
The Energy Bureau’s Final Resolution and Order on PREPA’s integrated resource plan provided a target schedule of six solar and storage procurements by June 2023, which is intended to enable the projects to go online by 2025:

Project construction is expected to begin immediately and finish later this year. It will include the installation of more than 300,000 First Solar Series 6 modules.
To tackle this undertaking, Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives will be hiring approximately 300 craft workers, the majority of whom will be local laborers.
The Lumpkin Solar Farm is part of a 435 MW portfolio of projects being constructed to supply 100% renewable energy to Facebook’s data center in Newton County, Georgia. All six of the supply contracts within that portfolio have been executed by Walton Electric Membership Corp. and Silicon Ranch.
Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives has already contributed to this portfolio, constructing the 25 MW Appling Solar Farm in southeast Georgia under another EPC contract with Silicon Ranch. The Lumpkin Solar Farm represents Silicon Ranch’s fourth contribution to the 435 MW project portfolio.
The other announced projects that make up the portfolio are a 107 MW solar project in Jeff Davis County and a 102.5 MW project in Early County. Combined, the projects will create more than 800 construction jobs. The two remaining projects have yet to be announced.
Any Georgia residents interested in working on the Lumpkin Solar Farm should apply online at IEA.net or send an email to recruit@iea.net.

The California-based energy and smart grid solutions provider will deploy behind-the-meter solar-powered home batteries to roughly 6,000 residential customers to create a VPP on Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii islands.
Swell’s VPPs are based on an aggregated network of distributed energy resources that provide a variety of benefits. The Hawaii program will deliver more than 25 MW of solar power, paired with more than 80 MW of batteries and 100 MWh of stored energy, delivering capacity and frequency response to the three island grids.
The contract was awarded in response to Hawaiian Electric’s request for dispatchable energy storage and renewable generation through distributed energy resources, along with capacity and ancillary services.
Swell Energy will augment Hawaiian Electric’s energy supply by relieving the grids of excess renewable energy as production spikes and absorbing excess wind energy when needed. The result is intended to reduce peak demand and provide fast frequency response to balance the grids. The renewable energy storage systems will collectively respond to grid needs dynamically, moment-to-moment.
The program is available to Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii Island customers who are seeking solar energy with a home battery for backup capability, as well as those who already have solar systems with storage installed. Swell Energy said this is one of several VPPs that it is launching with other investor-owned utilities and community-choice aggregation programs in the U.S. The Hawaii program will form Swell Energy’s largest VPP to date.
Swell said it is launching the first phase of its VPP program in partnership with RevoluSun, the leading residential solar company in Hawaii.

When state and local governments put their money behind renewables, that public-sector investment is critical support as well.
The Colorado Department of Local Affairs (DOLA) recently awarded $7.14 million in Energy and Mineral Impact Assistance Funds (EIAF), with the majority of the grants going to regional solar projects.
According to DOLA, the department awarded the City of Steamboat Springs and its partners $2.1 million for solar installations at 13 local government facilities for several towns, cities, and counties. Eight of the projects will be ground-mounted arrays totaling 1.8 MW, while the remaining five will be rooftop systems.
The department also awarded the City of Craig $2 million in planning and implementation funds for a project adjacent to the Yampa Valley Electric Association. The community solar garden will allow regional partners to buy a power subscription from a third-party developer.
Furthermore, DOLA awarded the Aurora Campus Community a $780,000 grant for bus canopies fitted with solar panels.
The remaining round of EIAF grants went to broadband projects and other initiatives. According to DOLA, funding from the EIAF program is ongoing to help areas socially or economically affected by the development, processing, or energy conversion of minerals and mineral fuels.
As DOLA Executive Director Rick Garcia explained, “An important aspect of this program is to support communities feeling the impacts of the transition from coal.”
In 2020, DOLA awarded a total of $47.2 million through EIAF for 137 projects in communities across Colorado. That included $13 million for 22 Renewable and Clean Energy Initiative projects.

According to a Reuters report, the deal is valued at $57 million.
In an announcement, Naturgy said Hamel Renewables’ project portfolio includes 8 GW of solar and 4.6 GW of energy storage across nine states. Of these projects, 25 sites totaling 3.2 GW of solar and 2 GW storage could be operational before 2026.
The integrated gas and electricity company said it plans to invest up to $1.8 billion in the U.S. over the next five years to reach 1.85 GW of operational solar capacity in 2025. The company retains the option to develop the remaining pipeline, adding up to 8 GW of solar projects until 2030.
As part of the transaction, Naturgy also signed an exclusive five-year development agreement with Candela Renewables, a utility-scale developer founded by former First Solar workers in 2018.
Naturgy said its initial U.S. market investment demonstrates the company’s commitment to developing renewable energy internationally, focusing on stable geographies and early-stage projects.
The company’s renewables portfolio includes wind, hydroelectric, and solar projects in its domestic market and abroad. The company reported 403 MW of total installed solar capacity in Spain and Brazil at the end of 2019.
Naturgy and gas company Enagás also recently announced plans to build one of the largest hydrogen plants in Spain. The aim is to produce up to 9,000 tons per year of renewable hydrogen from a 400 MW PV plant and an electrolyzer of up to 60 MW.
Naturgy joins other European companies making moves into the U.S. renewables market. Earlier in January, French energy giant Total entered a joint venture to build 1.6 GW of U.S. solar and storage.

His think tank, RethinkX, recently published a report titled “Rethinking Energy 2020-2030 – 100% Solar, Wind and Batteries is Just the Beginning.”
In early December, pv magazine publisher, Eckhart Gouras, interviewed Seba and Adam Dorr, the two authors of this report. As Seba and Dorr make clear in the interview, a 100% solar-wind-battery system is not only possible, but the cheapest way to build an electricity system in the U.S. by 2030. (Read Part 1.)
In the initial interview, they introduce the concept of the “Clean Energy U-curve,” which shows that the cheapest system is actually one that involves a lot more solar PV and wind power capacity than the peak power demand profile.
And they go one step further by introducing the concept of “SuperPower”: by investing in even more solar PV and wind power than the lowest-cost system defined by the “Clean Energy U-curve,” the gain in additional energy, or “superpower,” is exponential to the money invested.
The conversation continues below.
pv magazine: The CEO of Vistra Energy, America’s largest integrated generator and retailer of electricity in competitive markets, recently said that President Joe Biden’s plan to decarbonize electricity by 2035 would be “prohibitively expensive for consumers.” Curt Morgan went on to say that: “I think reality will set in when he has serious people sit around the table talking about what is achievable and what is not.” IPPs like Vistra produced 2 out of every 5 megawatt-hours generated in the U.S., so getting these players to participate will be critical to decarbonizing this sector. How can this uphill battle be won?
Tony Seba (TS): Classic incumbent: fear, uncertainty and doubt, right? Happens with every disruption. When faced with the reality of disruption–and it’s now a reality–it’s not out there, it’s here, it’s now. Basically, incumbents go through the five stages of grief, including denial, anger and attacking the messenger.
Image: tonyseba.com
We saw that not long ago in transportation with the CEO of Daimler, for instance, poo-pooing Tesla and saying that electrification was decades out and Tesla was building toys, right? And now they’re running for their lives.
So this is classic incumbent fear, uncertainty, doubts. Microsoft said there was no chance in hell that the iPhone was going to be successful, right? No chance, and so on. It’s classic.
pv magazine: But with the iPhone you have that big pull from the consumer, which once they realized what the smartphone could do, a much bigger market was created and classic disruption. But how do you get that pull from the consumer with electricity? It might be the cheapest, but you won’t have people rushing online or in stores to get this gadget. So it seems to be a very different dynamic?
TS: I would disagree with that. Essentially, the move to solar, wind and batteries is being constrained by the monopolies. They have no incentives for the world to go 100% solar, wind and batteries. None. They’ve had this cushy rent extraction system for 100 years. They don’t want to let it go, right?
If you give consumers and businesses their right to generate, store and trade electricity, just like we have the right to information, for instance; I mean, we didn’t ask anyone else for permission to have this conversation … we can sell and buy anything on eBay.
But for some reason, electrons are all monopolies. If you give consumers that right, and businesses, then you’re going to get competition. And if you make the electricity market competitive, then you’re going to see a different dynamics. What you’re going to see is the Walmarts of the world giving away electrons. Electrons are going to be so cheap that a Walmart would give away electrons for somebody to come in and shop right at their store.
Adam Dorr (AD): Another source of competition is entire regions are going to be able to compete once superpower is recognized for the opportunity it is. Today, in places like Germany and California that are early adopters of solar and wind, there already is some superpower being generated for some small part of the time: when it’s very sunny out and you have a surplus of output from solar.

But today, the incumbent system, the old system has an irrational response to this essentially free electricity, almost zero marginal cost, clean energy. What could be better? The irrational response to the existing system is: this is a problem, it’s a threat, and we need to curtail this output of electricity – let’s flush it down the drain. It’s completely crazy, but this is the current system. A clear sign the disruption is imminent, if you have irrational system behavior like this.
Historically, disruptions are led from the outside, not by the incumbents. We will see examples emerge, where a region says “we’re going to lead this disruption, take advantage of this incredible opportunity that superpower presents. It’s not a problem. It’s an opportunity. And watch: we can give electricity at an extremely low cost, maybe even free for some time, part of the day, if manufacturers move to our regions to take advantage of that.”
Regions will end up competing with one another with entirely new business models and ways of creating value because the new system produces electricity in such a different way than the current system does. With zero or near zero marginal costs, this changes the game completely. We are going to see competition, whether the incumbents like it or want it or not. It may not be from individual consumers who are pulling the market with demand, but we’re likely to see competition at different scales. And that will push the entire system towards disruption.
pv magazine: According to Vistra it would take an investment of $7 trillion to decarbonize the electricity sector in the U.S. and then only by 90% by 2050. What accounts for this massive disconnect between Vistra’s figure and your analysis?
AD: There is a prevailing myth that 90% is somehow better than 100%. It’s better economically. It’s more affordable. It’s more feasible. This is a mistake, it is an error.
What we’ve discovered with the clean energy U curve, and especially with superpower and disproportionate returns, is that a 100% system has much better benefits and a lower cost of electricity than a 90% system does. This is very un-intuitive and really flips the existing narrative. The idea that we need to only go to 90% and it will be a struggle and a mistake or a problem to go to 100 is backwards. It isn’t just wrong. It would be a mistake to only go to 90%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/18/tesla-introduces-solar-inverter/,"EV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JANUARY 18, 2021",Tesla introduces solar inverter,"From pv magazine Global
Tesla has come a step closer to a more comprehensive ecosystem by launching a proprietary solar inverter.
In the last years, multiple inverter companies have ventured into electric vehicle (EV) charging and expanded the power electronic ecosystem, repeatedly emphasizing the inverter’s importance at the center of the system. Tesla has gone the other way. Starting with EVs, the carmaker penetrated the residential solar market with panels and batteries but only now has brought an inverter to market.
The product – the Tesla Solar Inverter – comes in 3.8 kW and 7.6 kW versions featuring two and four maximum power point trackers (MPPTs), respectively.
That is slightly above average as most sub-10 kW inverters have just two MPPTs, but the product’s efficiency is somewhat below the figures achieved by market leaders. Tesla says its solar inverter has 97.5% efficiency, though it does not specify whether that is California Energy Commission-weighted or maximum efficiency.
As is mandatory in the U.S., the inverter comes with integrated rapid shutdown capability and provides arc-fault and ground fault protection. The EV maker says the product has been designed to integrate with the Tesla Powerwall battery as well as the Tesla app, which enables the monitoring of power generation and consumption patterns.
Tesla has published select data about the inverter on its website, rather than a full spec sheet. It is also not entirely clear what the app will be capable of in terms of system integration and optimization.
As a rule of thumb, the more devices that emerge from a single vendor, the easier it is for software to align them to work in symphony and improve system efficiency and that was a trend seen last year.
The company may also choose to leverage its EV production capacity and power electronics expertise. EV drive trains require DC/DC and DC/AC stages as batteries produce DC power and engines can run only on alternating current. Whether such expertise is transferable to residential solar appliances, and would improve functionality, efficiency or robustness remains to be seen. The 12.5-year warranty offered by the Tesla inverter announcement would hint at the latter.

JA Solar is supplying PV modules for an 88 MW project in the U.S. territory of Guam. Korea Electric Power is building the project, which is expected to be the largest single PV plant in Guam.
Because of the project’s island location and in an environment with strong winds, the project has stricter-than-usual requirements for backside mechanical load and module degradation rate. In 2020, the two companies signed a framework cooperation agreement, and recently launched cooperation on new projects.
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Tokyo Institute of Technology developed a blockchain technology that they say can optimize peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading.
The technology is expected to contribute to more effective use of surplus electricity from renewable energy by creating trading environments that flexibly respond to shared trading needs, particularly to maximize the amount of surplus electricity available in the market at any given time.

Beginning in April, the P2P energy trading system’s performance will be evaluated to further optimize the algorithm, aiming at commercialization.
In the collaboration, Mitsubishi Electric took charge of designing the P2P energy trading system and its clearing (transaction-completion) functions. Tokyo Tech handled blockchain technology R&D and the design of an optimal clearing algorithm Their newly devised distributed-optimization algorithm enables customer computers to share trading goals and data, and then optimally match buy and sell orders using minimal computations.
Using the new technology involves four steps. First, information on buy and sell orders with a common trading goal (market surplus, profit, and so on) are shared by computing servers during a predetermined timeframe. Next, each server searches for buy and sell orders matched to the common goal. Each server then shares its search results. In the fourth and final step, each server receives the search results and generates a new block by selecting trades that best meet the shared goal, which it adds it to each blockchain.
The technology partners said that P2P energy trading benefits consumers by enabling them to engage in direct trading as buyers and sellers, and sometimes make trades above offer prices or below bid prices if the right match is found.
Oil major Total said that following a review of the climate positions of the American Petroleum Institute, it has decided not to renew its membership for 2021.
The review was based on six points:
Following the 2019 and 2020 reviews, API’s positions were found to be “partially aligned” with Total’s. For example, API supported candidates in last fall’s election who argued against the United States’ participation in the Paris Agreement.
With release of its Climate Ambition plan in May 2020, Total committed itself to “ensuring that the industry associations of which we are a member adopt positions and messages that are aligned with those of the Group in the fight against climate change,” said Patrick Pouyanné, chairman and CEO.
In mid-January, Total and 174 Power Global formed a 50/50 joint venture to develop 12 utility-scale solar and energy storage projects of 1.6 GW cumulative capacity in the United States.
