Trina Solar has partnered with an affordable-housing nonprofit, Foundation Communities, along with Spear Commercial & Industrial, to help power the Waterloo Terrace apartment complex and provide free solar energy to the complex’s residents.
Foundation Communities not only provides affordable housing, but it has strong sustainability goals and achievements. Since 2014, the non-profit has more than doubled its solar capacity and now has 1.1 MW installed across 14 properties.
“We are a Department of Energy Better Buildings Challenge partner and have goals to reduce our energy and water consumption by 20% over ten years,” said Katelynn Essig, director of sustainability at Foundation Communities. “We also have a solar capacity goal to install 1.5-megawatt (MW) and the solar at Waterloo Terrace helped us meet that goal one year early.

High operating costs often put a strain on the budgets of non-profits like Foundation Communities, but energy is one of the highest controllable operating costs in affordable housing. With a large rooftop space, Foundation Communities made a commitment to controlling those costs by installing the 250 KW solar system on the Austin apartment complex.
“We pay the utilities for the 132 single adults that live with us and so the solar savings significantly reduce our operating costs, which allows us to invest that money back into the residents” said Essig.
Spear Commercial & Industrial is an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) company focusing on commercial and industrial (C&I) solar projects. Spear chose Trina Solar US to help streamline and enable the most efficient and cost-effective project possible. The C&I Solutions team at Trina Solar US has helped with design, and installations, from financing to development to supply chain management to interconnection.
“By providing a complete solution, we’re making it easier for customers to finance and install large solar projects,” said Adam Jordan, Head of US commercial solutions at Trina Solar. “When all the equipment is compatible and optimized, including modules, inverters, and racking, projects become less challenging and more profitable.”
Spear took advantage of Trina’s smart commercial solar solution to make Foundation Communities’ sustainability goals a reality. Trina’s smart solutions optimizes the performance of each module, while allowing for shady areas in the design as well as different roof orientations.
“The Trina group I work with sells solar panels, the racking system, and the inverters all together so we don’t have compatibility issues,” said Mark Rangel, executive vice president of Spear. “And Trina negotiates all pricing with other manufacturers to deliver a solution that is extremely competitive. I see a lot of value in that because we’re a small company. I don’t have a large purchasing department and so it really helps.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/17/solaredge-ships-battery-cells-to-stationary-energy-storage-market/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CALIFORNIA,ISRAEL,SOUTH KOREA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 17, 2023",SolarEdge ships battery cells to stationary energy storage market,"SolarEdge Technologies, a solar equipment manufacturer, today announced its energy storage division has begun shipping new battery cells designed for stationary energy storage applications. Manufactured at its Sella 2 gigafactory in South Korea, the company has begun shipments of Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) pouch cells optimized for energy storage applications in the residential, commercial and utility scale segments.
The NMC cells provide up to 8,000 cycles with high energy density and power throughput without compromising operational life, enabling SolarEdge to provide battery solutions that support a broad range of use cases, notably grid-stability applications.
“The global stationary storage market is estimated to grow from approximately 45 GWh in 2022 to 164 GWh by 2030 and SolarEdge is focused on supporting this critical segment,” said Ronen Faier, chief financial officer and general manager of SolarEdge’s energy storage division. “Owning key processes and cell chemistries will allow us to further secure the resilience of our supply chain and provides us with the flexibility to produce cells optimized for various energy storage solutions.”
On May 25, 2022, SolarEdge subsidiary Kokam Limited opened the 2 GWh battery cell manufacturing facility Sella 2, located in the Eumseong Innovation City of Chungcheongbuk-Do, South Korea.
The Korean facility is equipped to manufacture battery cells for SolarEdge’s residential solar-attached batteries as well as battery cells for a variety of industries, including mobility, energy storage solutions (ESS) and UPS applications. The facility can scale its battery cell capacity in the future to support the growing needs for storage solutions offered by the company.
In October 2018, SolarEdge closed the acquisition of a 75% majority stake in Kokam, a provider of lithium-ion cells and battery components, for $88 million, establishing the solar inverter producer’s expansion into the global battery supply market.
Additional growth avenues for SolarEdge include its recent partnership with Sunnova Energy to provide a residential energy-as-a-service system to Sunnova users using the SolarEdge home battery system.
SolarEdge’s 9.7 kWh battery is characterized by its DC-coupled design, which requires just one power conversion when consuming solar-generated electricity. Up to nine batteries (three per inverter) can be stacked to achieve an 87.3 kWh backup system with 30 kW of continuous power.
The battery has a round-trip efficiency of 94.5%, capable of being charged while simultaneously exporting power to the grid for utility bill credits.
The company said this efficiency adds up over time, and over the course of a year, it can lead to 10 full days of saved energy, compared to a typical 10 kW solar array in self-consumption mode (no battery). The battery is reportedly robust enough to provide continuous power, allowing users to consume stored power for large devices like washing machines and HVAC systems for longer periods of time.
SolarEdge’s common stock traded up 4% today to $325 per share on the news of production from the Sella 2 battery line, with a $17.8 billion market capitalization.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/17/inside-the-455-billion-u-s-investment-in-electric-vehicles/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 17, 2023",Inside the $455 billion U.S. investment in electric vehicles,"Electric vehicles (EV) are set to take over as the leading transportation technology, as automakers around the world have announced investments approaching $1 trillion through 2030.
A report by Atlas EV Hub is tracking the announcements worldwide and has found that roughly $860 billion has been raised to build out EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure. Nearly one fourth of this is represented by the United States, which has $210 billion in major automaker and infrastructure projects planned.
At the end of 2020, the U.S. was falling behind other major markets, having announced $51 billion in domestic EV and battery manufacturing, less than half of the $115 billion China announced at the time. However, following the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the United States has supercharged its EV push.
As of the end of Q3 2022, Europe leads with $238 billion announced, followed by the United States and Asia Ex-China each with $210 billion, $199 billion in China, and $10 billion outside of these regions (including Mexico, Canada, and Australia), reports Atlas EV Hub.
Since the beginning of 2021, investments have totaled over $150 billion, said Atlas EV Hub. This investment is supported by $83 billion of loans, grants, and tax credits set forth in new legislation. It was also boosted by a 40% increase in U.S. EV sales in 2022.
This includes $8.1 billion in grants and $25 billion of loans specifically to produce low or zero-emission vehicles or batteries. The IRA includes $10 billion in tax credits for a variety of manufacturing facilities, including EV and battery manufacturing facilities. In total, between both laws there is at least $145 billion of funding for which EV charging projects could be eligible, said Atlas EV Hub.
Major automaker announcements have included:
Automakers and battery makers also plan to spend $54 billion across 37 dedicated EV battery manufacturing facilities. At full capacity, the facilities could produce 654 GWh in capacity, enough to support 10 million light-duty vehicles annually by 2030.
“With more than $245 billion eligible for EVs from IIJA and IRA and $210 billion in private investments already announced for EV and battery manufacturing, the United States is poised to become a global leader in the EV transition,” said Nicole Lepre, Atlas EV Hub.

U.S. battery manufacturer Yoshino Technology has developed solid-state lithium-ion batteries with outputs ranging from 330 W to 4,000 W. They are designed for home backup, off-grid applications, and powering small industrial machinery.
The system can be used in combination with solar panels. The 4,000 W power station has a peak power of 6000 W and 2,611 Wh of capacity. It can be fully recharged by a 600 W solar panel in 5.5 hours, according to the company. Other charging options include AC, DC, and USB-C inputs.
“These portable power stations are built around a state-of-the-art solid electrolyte in place of the bulky and flammable liquid electrolyte found in traditional lithium-ion batteries, which improves performance and represents a giant leap forward for battery technology,” Yoshino said in a statement. “Higher energy density means the same amount of power fits into a smaller, lighter package – up to half the weight per watt compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries.”
The smallest battery measures 25.4 cm x 15.5 cm x 24.1 cm and weighs in at 4.58 kg. The largest one measures 54.3 cm x 25.9 cm x 23.8 cm and weighs 24.99 kg. They can reportedly run for 2,500 cycles to 80% capacity.
The 2,000 W and 4,000 W models feature uninterruptible power supply (UPS) when plugged into wall sockets. Yoshino is selling the products starting at $349 retail. They feature a 36-month warranty.
The solution includes a mobile app to monitor charge level, battery health, and connected devices. The entire product range will be available starting in May.
