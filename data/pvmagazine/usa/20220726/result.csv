https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/26/gm-and-lg-joint-venture-receives-2-5-doe-loan-to-build-three-battery-manufacturing-plants/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MICHIGAN,OHIO,TENNESSEE,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 26, 2022",GM and LG receive $2.5 billion DOE loan to build three battery manufacturing plants,"The US Energy Department intends to loan Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture of General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution, $2.5 billion to help finance construction of new lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facilities in Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan.
The loan comes from the government’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program, which has $17.7 billion in loan authority to support the manufacture of eligible light-duty vehicles and qualifying components, authorized by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.
In January of this year, LG Energy Solution announced a commitment to construct a $2.1 billion battery manufacturing plant in Lansing, Michigan with General Motors to mass produce 50 GWh of EV batteries under the Ultium Cell brand.
Ultium devices are unique due to their large-format, pouch-style cells that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside a battery pack, enabling engineers to optimize energy storage and layout for each vehicle design.
“With a shared vision, GM and LG Energy Solution pioneered the EV sector by seizing new opportunities in the market well before anyone else did,” LG Energy Solution chief executive Young-Soo Kwon said. “Our third battery manufacturing plant, fittingly located in America’s automotive heartland, will serve as a gateway to charge thousands, and later, millions of EVs in the future.”
GM and LG are investing more than $7 billion via the venture to build three battery plants, according to a Reuters article. The Warren, Ohio plant is currently employing 700 workers and is planned to begin production next month. The Tennessee plant will start production in late 2023 and the Michigan plant in 2024, according to the Reuters report.
The DOE also recently announced a separate $60 million in funding to support second-life applications for batteries once used to power EVs, as well as new processes for recycling materials back into the battery supply chain. These funding opportunities are part of the government’s strategy to bolster America’s supply chain and reduce the reliance on competing nations.
Currently China is the leader in the global lithium-ion battery production market, according to a Wood Mackenzie report. And while the United States is supporting its battery industry, China is investing heavily to build out more manufacturing facilities to extend its dominance. Secondarily, these initiatives support the President’s goal of electric vehicles making up half the vehicle sales in North America by 2030.
“Positioning the United States front and center in meeting the growing demand for advanced batteries is how we boost our competitiveness and electrify our transportation system,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic investment in battery production and recycling will give our domestic supply chain the jolt it needs to become more secure and less reliant on other nations—strengthening our clean energy economy, creating good paying jobs, and decarbonizing the transportation sector.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/26/electriq-power-residential-batteries-beat-the-heat-with-backup-power-smart-time-of-use/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,PUERTO RICO,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 26, 2022","Electriq Power residential batteries beat the heat with backup power, smart time of use","Nationwide, and particularly in Texas, where grid infrastructure is becoming increasingly unreliable, Americans are struggling to beat the heat as peak temperatures lead to peak energy demand and scheduled rolling blackouts on the energy grid. Simultaneously, energy prices are increasing, especially during peak demand hours, making this summer a costly and uncomfortable situation for many.
Electriq Power, provider of the home battery PowerPod 2, said its battery can both provide backup power during blackouts, but also provide smart time-of-use charging and discharging cycles that insulate homeowners from expensive peak demand charges. Home storage also alleviates pressure on the grid, making it more reliable and prices more stable for the surrounding community.
The lithium ferro-phosphate PowerPod 2 battery comes in a few different formats, each with a continuous 7.6 kW AC power output and an instant 9.12kW output. The battery has 10, 15, and 20 kWh usable capacity configurations. It can shift between backup power, time of use, and self-supply operating modes, and it has a max DC efficiency of 97.6%.
Batteries are often placed in the garage or in a cool, dark place on the exterior of the home. The PowerPod 2 is rated for outdoor use with a NEMA 3R certification. It is also UL9540 and UL9540A certified. It can operate between –4 F to 131 F and at a maximum altitude of nearly 10,000 feet. The battery unit measures 27.5″ x 50″ x 9″ while the accompanying inverter is sized at 18″ x 33.7” x 7″. Both components are warrantied for 10 years by Electriq Power.
 
Powering Puerto Rico
Last month, Electriq Power announced it was chosen as the exclusive hardware and software supplier for Barrio Eléctrico, an organization that works with community partners to install solar and storage systems in Puerto Rico. The island suffers frequent power outages and heavy storms that affect the centralized grid, so the distributed solar and storage offer an alternative to keep the lights on.
Rooftop solar and a home battery can also reduce electricity costs, which is a major concern in Puerto Rico. Over 750,000 households on the island are considered low- or moderate income, but electricity rates on the island are among the highest for US residents. By reducing the need for energy generated from the grid, home batteries installed as part of this program can substantially lower a family’s utility bill, said Electriq power.
“Puerto Rico’s ongoing struggle with stable electricity makes the island an ideal location for home storage and solar,” said Frank Magnotti, CEO of Electriq Power. “Thanks to Barrio Eléctrico, there are greater opportunities for homes on the island to embrace independent electricity generation.”
“The talent and natural resources in Puerto Rico are the ingredients for a robust economy, but the unreliable electricity is a primary factor holding back economic development. The first step to solving the electricity crisis is grass-roots action in each community. Our program supports individuals in taking control of their electricity needs, while it simultaneously builds the community’s capacity to design and have a voice in the electric service of tomorrow. Because of allies like Electriq Power, which provides the fundamental components of our high quality, affordable systems, we have been able to initiate community and municipal actions towards a brighter, more equitable future.” Lauren Rosenblatt, founder and acting CEO of Barrio Eléctrico
The need for distributed energy resources and backup power resonates on the continental US, too. Grid reliability reports warned of summertime outages in the Midwest, California and Texas, especially as a widespread drought in the west limits hydropower production and a mismatch between supply and peak demand persists.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/26/vehicle-integrated-photovoltaics-for-low-speed-electric-vehicles/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 26, 2022",Vehicle-integrated photovoltaics for low-speed electric vehicles,"Quebec-based startup Capsolar has developed a solar panel for vehicle-integrated applications.
“The CAPSolar’s SM–550 solar module is capable of maximizing the capture of solar energy in a dynamic setting by reducing the impact of shading on its performance while being as robust and lightweight as possible when fitted on our structure which can fit any type of low-speed electric vehicle,” the company’s CEO, Samy Benhamza, told pv magazine.
The module has a size of 2,100 mm x 1,320 mm x 25 mm and weighs in at 30 kg. It has a power conversion efficiency of 21.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 108.0 V, a short-circuit current of 6.4 A, and a fill factor of 76%. It can be operated with a maximum temperature of 45 C while driving and 55 C when the vehicle is parked.
The panel relies on 24%-efficient solar cells provided by US manufacturer SunPower. It also features an IP67 enclosure and an MPPT buck controller. “The solar panel itself is fully flexible but when mounted on our structure, it conforms to the desired shape and becomes rigid. In its layout, strategically oriented solar cell series help in better managing different incidence angles and combined with multiple bypass diodes, we have an optimal shading management,” Benhamza said.
According to the manufacturer, the panel offers a 70% higher daily energy output at the same power rating as competitor products. The company tested the module in Montreal, Quebec, on a client’s vehicle and claims it achieved a 17% average range extension per day, with a peak of 26% on sunnier days.

“In collaboration with our European strategic partners in Belgium, we have developed a patent-pending, fully modular system that allows us to adapt our panels, just like LEGO, for each type of low-speed electric vehicle with no extra modification and custom work,” Benhamza explained.
Capsolar is currently collecting data to better determine the parameters that have the most impact on the performance of a vehicle-integrated solar module. “We will then be able to feed this data to the charge controller we are designing and use artificial intelligence to optimize the operating parameters of the MPP–tracking algorithm,” Benhamza concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/26/perovskite-solar-cell-defect-characterization-during-manufacture-for-improved-stability/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ARIZONA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 26, 2022",Perovskite solar cell defect characterization during manufacture for improved stability,"The Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office announced it selected the University of Arizona to develop a new method for identifying defects in perovskite solar cell development during the manufacturing process.
Perovskites are actively being researched worldwide for their ability to be manufactured at scale as readily printable materials that can be deposited as paper-thin solar cells. The flexible, lightweight cells are hailed for their numerous uses, like on low-load roofs, in aviation, wearables, and rapid delivery and rollout in disaster situations. Perovskites are naturally occurring minerals, but they also represent lab-made crystalline structured materials that imitate the natural minerals’ shape.
Perovskites have made leaps and bounds in their efficiency, growing from 3% in 2009 to over 25% today. However, the material currently struggles with stability, in part because temperature sensitivity causes them to degrade relatively rapidly. The earliest perovskites worked for only a few minutes or hours, but today they have a lifespan of several months. Improving this lifecycle is the focus of the grant-funded research at the University of Arizona, which is led by associate professor of chemical and environmental engineering Erin Ratcliff.
“Perovskites are the highest-performing printable solar cell technology,” said Ratcliff. “But the operating hypothesis in the field is that defects are contributing to instability.”
Ratcliff is developing a method to detect the creation of defects not after the perovskites are made, which is the traditional operation, but rather during the manufacturing process.
“What our project is about is trying to develop an in-line characterization tool to get you a quality control assessment to tell you how good the layers are in the exact moments you’re making them,” said Ratcliff. “This quality control method is also an indication for the long-term stability of the materials you’re making.”
Ratcliff is developing an electrochemical method to achieve this goal. The method can offer a more nuanced look at the potential presence of defects. It will involve using a robotic arm to apply a thin material about the thickness of plastic kitchen wrap to the solar panel being manufactured.
“You stick it on there and you apply an electric field on [the manufacturing] line, and you can figure out how it works under operation, without having to make the whole device first,” she said.
The research is supported by the Department of Energy, the Office of Naval Research, and Tech Launch Arizona, the University of Arizona’s office that commercializes research projects.
“Large-scale manufacturing of these robust, high-quality perovskite-based photovoltaics will require low-cost and practical quality control methods that can be integrated into an operating line,” said Laura Silva, senior licensing manager for the College of Science at Tech Launch Arizona. “Ratcliff’s approach is overcoming these challenges and making the technology much more attractive in a marketplace that’s demanding higher and higher performance.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/26/connecticut-to-allow-distributed-resources-to-compete-with-distribution-grid-upgrades/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CONNECTICUT",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 26, 2022",Connecticut to allow distributed resources to compete with distribution grid upgrades,"Connecticut utilities proposing a distribution grid upgrade project that would cost more than $1 million would soon be expected to issue a competitive non-wires alternatives (NWA) solicitation, under a proposed program developed by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA). An NWA bid that met the “grid needs” that the grid upgrade project was intended to meet, at lower cost, would win a contract. Some smaller upgrade projects might also trigger a solicitation.
Other states besides Connecticut that already allow distributed resources to compete with planned distribution grid upgrades include California, Hawaii, Minnesota, New York and Rhode Island, said Lauren Shwisberg, a manager at the nonprofit RMI, who co-authored a 2018 report on non-wires solutions.
Under Connecticut’s proposed program, an NWA bidder could propose to meet the grid needs identified by the utility with distributed solar, storage, demand response, or energy efficiency, including aggregated resources.
The Northeast Clean Energy Council (NECEC) and RENEW Northeast said in joint comments that they backed the $1 million presumptive threshold for a solicitation, saying that level is “appropriate to provide enough value to spur market engagement.”
The groups said that for the program to be successful, competition would be key, with distribution utilities “incented to choose the most competitive and reliable solution regardless of who owns the NWA resources.” Transparency is also key, they said, to provide clarity to bidders on the solution being sought, the criteria by which a project will be evaluated, and the deadline for project completion.
NECEC keeps “hammering on the importance of the grid,” the group said on Twitter, because “as we electrify vehicles and heating, we have to build out a grid that can deliver all the power.” The grid consists of long-distance transmission, and local distribution circuits that deliver power to customers.
Distribution grid upgrades
A traditional distribution grid upgrade may involve a substation or a distribution “feeder,” the electric circuit that extends from a distribution substation to deliver electricity to end users. A feeder upgrade may involve new conductors (commonly known as wires) that have higher capacity, transformers, voltage regulators and monitoring equipment, according to a working paper from the Energy Institute at Haas.
California utility PG&E will need to upgrade about half of its distribution circuits by 2030, and about 80% by 2050, as the state pursues electrification of vehicles and heating, the working paper projected, while only a small percentage of substations would need upgrades.
A “roadmap for the lowest cost grid” prepared by Vibrant Clean Energy, and cited in the white paper, projected that greatly expanding local solar and storage nationwide would save $473 billion by 2050.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/26/solar-jobs-increased-9-nationwide-in-2021/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 26, 2022",Solar jobs increased 9% nationwide in 2021,"Solar energy jobs were up in 47 states and increased 9% nationwide from 2020 to 2021 to a total of 255,037 solar workers, according to the annual National Solar Jobs Census released today by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), an independent national nonprofit organization.
This job growth follows 2020, which was a tough year for many industries. The US solar industry employed 231,474 workers in 2020, a 6.7% drop from 2019 due to pandemic restrictions and increased labor productivity, according to the National Solar Jobs Census 2020. The job growth in 2021 reflects a rebound taking place in what was a record year for solar installations. Overall, the solar industry added 21,563 jobs in 2021, with more than two-thirds of these new jobs (14,350) at installation and project development firms.
“America’s solar industry came back strong from the pandemic to expand the clean energy workforce across all regions of the country,” said Larry Sherwood, president and CEO at IREC. “The future remains uncertain in light of the supply chain disruptions, trade issues, and stalled federal policy in the first part of 2022. There is potential for unprecedented job growth in the coming years if federal, state, and local leaders take action to expand clean energy use and address climate change.”
The National Solar Jobs Census was first published in 2010 by The Solar Foundation, which merged with IREC in 2021. It’s interesting to look over the past decade with US solar employment more than doubling from 105,145 jobs in 2011 to 255,037 jobs in 2021. The most significant growth has taken place in the installation and project development sector, where employment more than tripled since 2011 to reach 168,960 jobs in 2021.
State by state
Not surprisingly, California—the number one solar market in the country—was way ahead of other states in solar employment with 75,712 jobs as of 2021. Florida, the Sunshine State and number three solar market in the country, came in second with 11,761 jobs, Massachusetts, ninth for solar installations had 10,548 solar jobs. New York followed closely with 10,524 jobs and Texas at 10,346 jobs. Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Ohio, each had between 7,000 to 9,000 jobs.
California also led for the number of jobs added (+7,035) in 2021, followed by Massachusetts (+1,053 jobs), Nevada (+1,019 jobs), and Arizona (+932 jobs). Other strong growth states were Ohio, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Georgia, each with 800 to 900 new jobs. A complete table of solar jobs by state and job growth from 2020 is available here.
“Solar energy is an economic growth engine, creating new jobs while it helps us confront the climate crisis,” said Dan Reicher, Senior Scholar, Stanford Woods Institute and former US Assistant Secretary of Energy. “There is vast and untapped potential to expand solar installations and related jobs across the United States, in an environmentally sustainable manner, as we help businesses and families access this renewable energy source.”
Diversity
The solar industry has more work to do to meet its goals for diversity, equity, and inclusion. The report found that women made up just under 30 % of the solar workforce in 2021, which held steady from 2020. This is a surprisingly low figure when compared to the fact that women make up 47% of of the overall workforce in the United States. Unfortunately, only 31% of solar firms reported that they have strategies, policies or programs to increase the number of women hired.
To help women join the solar workforce, Solar Energy International (SEI) and SOLV Energy recently announced a partnership aimed at creating a global network of women who are considering careers in clean energy and supporting female solar professionals actively working in the industry. The SEI Women in Solar program consists of training, networking, mentorship, and clean energy employer and job connections, all with the goal of empowering women to join the clean energy sector and advance the careers and influence of women already working in the sector.
Black employees made up 8% of the solar workforce, compared to their 12% representation in the national workforce. Latino or Hispanic workers made up 20%, and Asian workers made up 9%. Fewer than one-third (26%) of solar firms reported strategies to increase female, ethnic or racial minority hires. Only 8% had a strategy to increase LGBTQ+ hires.
Puerto Rico job potential
The report looked at Puerto Rico, where solar has made strong inroads five years after hurricanes ravaged the island. While the island had just under 2,000 solar jobs in 2021, largely unchanged from 2019, that may change because a new law requires that Puerto Rico to obtain 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2025 and 100% by 2050. According to IREC’s research, meeting these goals would lead to 20,000 solar jobs in Puerto Rico by 2030.
Educational requirements and training
The solar industry can offer a path to advancement and job training. Less than one-third of entry-level solar jobs in the solar industry (31%) require a bachelor’s degree, while 65% of firms provide on-the-job training. In a year with a tight labor market, 89% of firms reported difficulty finding qualified applicants, with 35% saying it was “very difficult.”
Looking at solar jobs by employment sector shows that 66% of jobs were in installation and project development. 13% were in manufacturing, 11% in wholesale trade and distribution, with 5% in O&M (and another 5% in “other”). Looking at jobs by industry sector, 51% were in residential, 20% in commercial, 20% in utility scale, and 9% in community solar.

“These 2021 findings highlight that we can create family-sustaining jobs at the same time that we reduce carbon emissions,” said Tom Starrs, Vice President, Government and Public Affairs at EDP Renewables. “They also highlight the critical importance of supportive policies to unlock the full potential of the solar industry to drive employment, foster local energy resilience, and confront climate change.”
Better than fossils
Employment in the solar industry looks favorable compared to the fossil fuel industry. Solar employs over twice as many as the coal industry. And while the petroleum and natural gas industries employ more workers than solar, solar workers are needed to develop the infrastructure and not to generate the fuel itself. As a result, the solar industry employs more workers per unit of generation compared to fossil fuel sources.
