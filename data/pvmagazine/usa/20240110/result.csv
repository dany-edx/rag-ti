https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/10/more-than-50-gw-of-new-solar-projected-in-2024/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 10, 2024",More than 50 GW of new solar projected in 2024,"The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts the deployment of 45 GWdc in utility-scale solar projects larger than one megawatt in 2024. This is projected increase to about 53 GWdc in 2025, according to the agency’s Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).
Adding Wood Mackenzie Power and Renewables conservative projections of 6 GW in residential solar and 2 GW in commercial projects, the total solar capacity expected for 2024 is 53.5 GW.
Projected figures for 2025 suggest a potential total deployment of 65 GW of solar power.
According to EIA, utility-scale solar is expected to constitute 6% of the total electricity generation in 2024 and 7% in 2025. This is set against a backdrop where overall electricity generation is predicted to grow by 3% in 2024 and remain constant in 2025.
Small scale solar generation is anticipated to contribute 2% to the total electricity generation in 2024, increasing to 2.3% in 2025. This suggests that solar power could represent 8% of the total electricity used in 2024 and 9.3% in 2025. If the deployment reaches about 65GW in 2025, solar power could account for nearly 11% of all electricity generation in 2026.
These forecasts are based on end-of-year utility scale capacity figures of 93.2 GWac at the end of 2023, increasing to 129.6 GW in 2024, and 172.2 GW by the end of 2025. The values are derived from data from EIA-860M.
The EIA also predicts that coal’s contribution to electricity generation will fall by 9% in 2024, and another 10% in 2025 due to increasing renewable generation. The EIA believes that natural gas electricity generation will stay that same.
With electricity generation set to increase in 2024 by 3%, along with coal falling 9% and gas staying flat, it means that solar is both replacing the decline in coal, as well, covering the growth of 3%.
This will lead to electricity emissions falling by less than a percent on lower gas and coal usage in 2024, before falling by 2.5% in 2025. Petroleum usage will stay flat during the period though, meaning total emissions are estimated to stay flat in 2024, and to fall by 1.7% in 2025.

Adding to previous investment commitments from CIT, SMBC, and NY Green Bank, a division of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), among others, NineDot has now secured a capital base of approximately $400 million.
“From our first meeting it was clear that Manulife IM understood the importance of battery storage in modernizing the urban electric grid, making it cleaner, more resilient, more equitable, and less costly,” said David Arfin, chief executive officer and co-founder, NineDot Energy.
New York Governor Hochul has placed a nation-leading roadmap for energy storage, calling for 6 GW of storage capacity by 2030, on the path to 100% zero-emission electricity for the state by 2040.
Battery storage is an important aspect of electricity decarbonization. Not only does it enable more intermittent renewable capacity to operate on the grid, it is also an alternative to natural gas peaker plants. Peaker plants are reserve capacities of natural gas that are only fired up during times of peak electricity demand, a highly carbon-inefficient process.
“We have been believers in community-scale battery storage for a long time and are pleased to form a long-term equity partnership with NineDot Energy. We view NineDot as the leading BESS developer in a complex but attractive market,” said Recep Kendircioglu, global head of infrastructure, Manulife Investment Management.
NineDot is making progress towards its internal goal of deploying 400 MW of battery storage capacity by the end of 2026. The company’s initial battery storage site, located in the Pelham Gardens neighborhood in the Northeast Bronx, became operational last summer.
The company has about 30 projects under construction across the New York metro area, with many more in development. NineDot said a typical 5 MW battery project is designed to power 5,000 New York City households for four hours on a peak summer day. Using the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) emissions methodology, each 5 MW peaker battery site would offset 420 tons of carbon emissions equivalent in 2022 grid conditions.
As part of the transaction, Christopher McKenzie, a managing director from Manulife’s infrastructure business, will join NineDot’s board of directors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/10/washington-legislation-intends-to-bring-fair-access-to-solar-for-all/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,WASHINGTON",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 10, 2024",Washington legislation intends to bring fair access to solar for all,"State-level community solar programs are one way to level the playing field by bringing clean energy to all. Community solar enables rate payers to subscribe to a solar project and receive credits on their electric bills. The rate payers don’t need to pay in advance, as they would if they put solar on their own home. They don’t even have to own a home—as community solar serves all.
Washington state was home to the country’s first community solar project; however, it has some catching up to do as it now ranks 31st in deployment. To that end, Washington Representative David Hackney (D-King County) and State Senator John Lovick (D-Mill Creek) pre-filed both HB 2253 and SB 6113, respectively. These bills intend to expand equitable access to the benefits of locally sited solar power to all Washington rate payers.
The legislation, called the Fair Access to Community Solar Act, intends to advance community solar in the state as well as to help the state meet its energy goals. In addition, the bills, which were just introduced in Washington’s House and Senate, are expected to create jobs and help the economy.
“As soon as constituents and my colleagues learn how community solar works, they realize the immense benefits it can bring,” said Representative Hackney. “Our state is long overdue for this type of legislation to implement a competitive community solar program in order to bring energy justice and economic growth for all Washingtonians.”
The Fair Access to Community Solar Act establishes a community solar bill crediting program to ensure subscribers earn a proportionate credit on their monthly utility bill.
“I am proud to work with Representative Hackney, fellow legislators, and our Washingtonian business community to introduce this community solar legislation,” said State Senator Lovick. “By prioritizing a program structure that benefits as many Washingtonians as possible, The Fair Access to Community Solar bill will help ensure our state can lead on community solar adoption.”
In addition, the policy supports solar developers, as it allows them to access state and federal incentives.
This is not the first community solar legislation in the state. In April 2022, Washington passed a solar incentive program aimed at expanding the opportunities for low-income residents to access renewable energy through an increased focus on installing community solar projects in the state. HB 1814 was, in part, the result of a three-year effort by Olympia Community Solar, a small non-profit, to pass policy that recognizes the growing need for equity in the energy economy. Passage of the bill created a new $100 million incentive program, which began last year, that will provide funding for low-income households and low-income service providers’ installing solar.
“A new legislative session brings hope for community solar in Washington,” said Mason Rolph, president of Olympia Community Solar. “This legislation will help reduce many Washingtonians’ stubbornly high energy costs and ensure that the grid of the future is affordable, equitable, and reliable.”
CCSA members have worked to ensure the bill reflects the needs and realities of all rate payers in Washington state including those in disadvantaged communities.
“The national momentum for community solar continues to build. Getting a comprehensive program bill across the finish line here in Washington will allow for the state to reap all the benefits numerous states across the country already see from community solar,” said Derek Chernow, CCSA.

BlackRock now holds a 15.8% stake in Israel-based inverter manufacturer SolarEdge, up from 9% in April 2023. The US investment firm began investing in the company in 2017 and is now its biggest shareholder, according to a statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The new investment follows a difficult financial year for SolarEdge. Since announcing record revenues for 2022 at the start of last year, the inverter manufacturer reported a net loss of $61.2 million in its latest financial results, which relate to the third quarter of 2023.
For the third quarter of 2023, the company posted revenues of $725 million, $676 million of which is from its solar segment. However, looking ahead to the fourth quarter, SolarEdge provided guidance of $325 million in revenues.
Its share price has slumped, falling by 67% in 2023 and by almost 80% from its peak in 2021. The company also left the S&P 500 Index in December.
SolarEdge’s share price reached its lowest 2023 point on Nov. 1 at $56.53 per share, and stands at $77.86 per share on Jan. 10, 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/10/the-effect-of-pv-plants-on-albedo-vegetation-land-temperature/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"JANUARY 10, 2024","The effect of PV plants on albedo, vegetation, land temperature","Using remote sensing, researchers from China and the United States have quantified the effects of solar farms (SFs) on albedo, vegetation, and land surface temperature (LST). Namely, they have used data from the MODIS instrument onboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites to analyze data regarding 116 solar farms worldwide.
“Satellite data with high spatial resolution and global coverage enables the detection of changes in surface properties at fine scales,” they explained. “We use long-term remote sensing observations from MODIS, which have good temporal coverage and moderate spatial resolutions.”
While some SFs analyzed in the study were photovoltaic (PV) and some were concentrating solar power (CSP) sites, all had a minimum occupying area of 400 ha. The scientific group also analyzed non-SF buffer areas. They were generated as ring-shaped areas with a width of 1 km surrounding the SF and 1 km away from the boundary.
The research has examined three MODIS measurements – LST, albedo, vegetation, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). These values were quantified during a 5-year window, as the first measurements were from two years before the year of construction and the last from after two years as well. To rule out any natural climate variability, the change in the buffer area was deducted from the change measured in the SF site.
“Globally, there was a significant decrease in albedo of -0.016 for most SF samples,” the research found. “Regionally, SF in North America (NA) experienced a larger albedo decline (-0.014 to -0.021) than those in East and South Asia (ESA) (-0.010 to -0.017).”

As for the vegetation, the overall EVI index decreased by -0.015, an 8.2% drop. That also exhibited regional variations – as all sites in North America showed a decrease of 0.023 in the EVI, while in East and South Asia, approximately a third of the SF showed an increase.
As for the LST, the researchers found an average cooling effect of -0.49 K during the daytime and -0.21 K during the nighttime. Additionally, 94 of the 116 states experienced land cooling in the daytime, while only 82 experienced it in the nighttime.
“Since there are different types of solar energy technologies, PV and CSP, we searched for pairs of PV and CSP SFs with the same land cover and in the same latitudinal band to compare their impacts,” the researchers added. “On barren land, PV had overall stronger impacts than CSP, except for a larger daytime cooling with CSP. In contrast, on cropland, PV had weaker impacts on albedo and daytime LST than CSP but greater impacts on EVI and night LST.”
The results of their analysis were presented in “A global assessment of the effects of solar farms on albedo, vegetation, and land surface temperature using remote sensing,” published on Solar Energy. It was written by academics from China’s Beijing Normal University, the Southern University of Science and Technology, and the US’s California Institute of Technology.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/10/ohios-largest-solar-complex-activates-its-first-phase/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,OHIO",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 10, 2024",Ohio’s largest solar complex activates its first phase,"Solar developers EDF Renewables North America and Enbridge announced that the first phase of its Fox Squirrel Solar complex in Ohio is fully operational and delivering electricity to the PJM grid. The three-phase project is located in Madison County, Ohio. 
Represented in DC capacity ratings, Fox Squirrel’s first phase is a 194 MW project that reached operations in December 2023. Phase two will add another 325 MW, expected to be active by mid-2024, and phase three will add 230 MW, bringing the total capacity added to 749 MW.
Once complete, Fox Squirrel would be the largest solar facility in Ohio, although an 800 MW project was proposed by Savion in early 2023.
The project, among the largest in the United States, secured 20-year power purchase agreements with a “strong investment grade counterparty.” It is large enough to power the equivalent of 118,000 average Ohio homes. 
Fox Squirrel is comprised of 1.4 million solar panels and 159 inverters. During peak construction of the first phase, 650 workers were onsite, installing 10,000 panels per day. 
Enbridge invested in the project’s first phase and announced plans to reach final investment decisions on the following phases through 2024, provided certain conditions are met. 
“The project underscores our energy transition leadership and highlights our rigorous capital allocation process which targets projects that are immediately accretive to [discounted cash flow] per share and complementary to our growth outlook,” said Matthew Akman, executive vice president corporate strategy and president, power, Enbridge. 
Project developer EDF Renewables has 35 years of experience and 16 GW of solar, wind, and storage projects developed. The company is a provider of a wide range of integrated energy solutions from grid-scale power to electric vehicle charging. 
Development challenges 
Public opposition has led to several large solar projects in Ohio to be rejected. In August 2023, the Ohio Power Siting Board (OPSB) revised its guidelines for solar facilities that exceed 50 MWac. These updates include sound regulations that extend to a mile away, modified setbacks – allowing for a 350 foot setback for non-participating neighbors – and a contingency plan in the event of a horizontal directional drilling inadvertent release of drilling fluid. 
Ohio continues to navigate development challenges due to “general opposition by local citizens and governmental bodies.” Various counties in the state have taken steps to prohibit wind and solar projects outright. To date, ten counties have implemented solar bans. Clermont County Commissioners unanimously barred large solar and wind projects in seven townships. 
The state also introduced legislation to create a community solar market. Ohio state representatives James M. Hoops (R-Napoleon) and Sharon Ray (R-Wadsworth) introduced the legislation, which would carve out a 1.75 GW community solar pilot program. 
Ohio University conducted an economic analysis on the program, finding that it would generate an estimated $5.6 billion in gross output and $409.5 million in local tax revenues.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/10/agrivoltaics-can-help-meet-growing-needs-of-the-lone-star-state/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RACKING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 10, 2024",Agrivoltaics can help meet growing needs of the Lone Star State,"Scientists with Texas A&M AgriLife are taking a look at agrivoltaics as a potential solution to the growing demand for both electricity and food.
Agrivoltaics is the practice of pairing solar energy and agricultural production on the same land. As the economy and population in Texas grows, so does its demand on the electrical power grid as well as its demand for sustainable food production. The researchers find that agrivoltaics offers the potential to enhance the efficiency of both.
A large number of coal plants were retired in 2018 and solar has been on the upswing ever since. The state had enough solar installed by Q3 2023 to power 2.5 million homes. Over 11,000 Texans are employed by the solar industry, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that over $24.4 billion has been invested in the technology there through Q3 2023. Just over 5% of Texas electricity is generated by PV. SEIA estimates 40 GW to be installed over the next 5 years, putting Texas first in the nation in solar power generation.
Texas is now one of only two U.S. states with a population of 30 million or more: the nation’s second-most-populous state reached a population milestone by passing the 30-million threshold.
According to the U.S. Census, the population in Texas grew 43% from 2000 to 2022, making it the fourth fastest growing state in the country. It is now one of only two states with a population over 30 million; Texas’s population in 2022 was 30,029,572 with only California topping it at 39,029,342.
Not surprisingly, with that growth comes increased demand. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) reported an unofficial record demand of 85 GW during the summer heatwave of 2023.
“As the population of Texas continues to grow, we will see limitations in the amount of land available for the production of food and other agricultural commodities,” said Dr. Nuria Gomez-Casanovas, assistant professor in regenerative system ecology in the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Department of Rangeland, Wildlife and Fisheries Management.
The Texas A&M team is taking a look at the potential for agrivoltaics as a result of the growing loss of agricultural lands, coupled with expanding energy requirements, according to Gomez-Casanovas.
The team collaborated with researchers from across the country on a recent paper Knowns, Uncertainties and Challenges in Agrivoltaics to Sustainably Intensify Energy and Food Production, published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
With an understanding that agrivoltaics has the potential to enhance the sustainability of agricultural land while helping to meet energy and food demands, the research focused on the challenges including the ecological, environmental, and socio-economic consequences of agrivoltaics.
Enhanced land productivity
“We reviewed existing scientific literature to assess how agrivoltaics can provide synergistic benefits across the food-energy-water nexus compared to solar power arrays or agricultural systems alone,” Gomez-Casanovas said. “One of the take-home messages from our analysis is enhanced land productivity through the implementation of agrivoltaics.”
Agrivoltaics can reduce the competition for land resources and can minimize or “avoid the unintended negative consequences of conventional solar energy deployment” with smart decision making.
“The idea is to make each acre more profitable for landowners and agricultural operations,” said Gomez-Casanovas.
Using the land equivalency ratio, the researchers found that planting agricultural crops under solar panel arrays can enhance land productivity by up to 60% compared to crop monocultures or solar panel arrays on the same land area.
While land is usually heavily graded before solar is installed, with agrivoltaics vegetation is planted under the solar arrays.
“In a photovoltaic system, vegetation is often removed or kept low under the solar panels, which can result in biodiversity loss associated with land conversion and clearing, as well as an increase in local temperatures due to what is known as the photovoltaic heat island effect,” said Gomez-Casanovas.
Reduction in water loss
Most of the large-scale solar development in Texas is happening in the wide open, arid regions amenable more to cattle grazing than agriculture. Gomez-Casanovas said agrivoltaic systems could boost solar energy production and agricultural resiliency in semi-arid regions of the state.
“Because the solar panels provide shade to the plants, less solar radiation reaches them, resulting in a reduction in soil water evaporation and plant transpiration,” Gomez-Casanovas said. “This is very beneficial for plant health during intense summers and periods of drought.”
Other agrivoltaic studies, such as one conducted by Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences, have noted a reduction in water loss. According to Chad Higgins, an associate professor in Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences and the senior author of the paper published in the journal Sustainability, “Agrivoltaics provide a rare chance for true synergy: more food, more energy, lower water demand, lower carbon emissions, and more prosperous rural communities.”
Reduction in water loss is important in Texas, as water becomes an increasing challenge, and the Texas study notes that the reduction in plant water loss ultimately translates to water savings in irrigation, an important factor for agricultural production.
“Although shading might be expected to lower plant productivity, and it does in certain agricultural settings, there is increasing evidence that agrivoltaics has the potential to enhance crop and forage yields compared to traditional agricultural systems alone,” said Gomez-Casanovas.
In a 2019 study conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and co-authors from the University of Arizona and University of Maryland studied the potential benefits of agrivoltaics on food production, irrigation water requirements, and energy production. The study, published in Nature Sustainability, found a two-fold increase in yields from tomato and chiltepin peppers grown under solar panels in a semi-arid environment compared to a traditional agricultural system.
The Texas A&M researcher, Gomez-Casanovs noted, however, that more research is needed to understand how to enhance crop yields under solar panels because different plant species have varying light requirements. She added that animals can also benefit from the shade provided by solar panels, potentially reducing heat stress in the livestock.
Carbon sequestration
The team also studied the potential for increased carbon sequestration, seeking to increase to increase the body of knowledge around this important benefit. In 2021 a study was conducted by researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Lab, NREL and University of Minnesota, which analyzed solar power facilities that integrate natural grasses. The study modeled and averaged solar facilities in seven states in the Upper Midwest. Their modeling suggested that native grasses planted as part of 10 GW of solar generation capacity would sequester 129.3 tons of carbon per hectare; that is 65% and 35% greater than either an agriculture or a solar-turfgrass scenario, respectively.
The Texas A&M study expands on this knowledge, finding that prior land use is a key factor in predicting the impact of agrivoltaics on carbon accrual.
“For example, if you transition a native rangeland to an agrivoltaic system, there is a detrimental impact on carbon sequestration,” said Gomez-Casanovas. “However, if you transition from an agricultural system with low soil organic carbon to an agrivoltaic system promoting carbon buildup, there would be a positive impact.”
Types of plants, soil and agricultural practices can also influence the level of carbon sequestration at agrivoltaic sites, the study suggests. Strategic management, which might include restoring native vegetation or planning pollinator-friendly crops, can affect biodiversity, according to Gomez-Casanovas.
Strategic management of vegetation under the arrays, such as the restoration of native vegetation or planting pollinator-friendly species can also have a positive impact on biodiversity, Gomez-Casanovas said.
One of the challenges to implementing an agrivoltaic system is the significant upfront cost with a long-term investment window, the study finds. These costs are attributed to the infrastructure needed—not only the solar panels and racking, but energy storage and transmission, as well as crop selection. Other areas requiring more insight, the researchers say, include the optimal solar array configuration and policy support that will make agrivoltaics as competitive as possible.
“The profitability of agrivoltaics is expected to play an important role in farmers’ decisions to adopt the system,” Gomez-Casanovas said. “At this point, we have more questions than answers, which is exciting because these questions will guide our future cross-discipline research.”

A group of researchers in Europe conducted a study on the impact of solar parks on birds in a Central European agricultural landscape. They surveyed 32 solar park plots and 32 adjacent control plots in Slovakia during a single breeding season.
“We selected ground-mounted photovoltaic power plants with an area of at least 2 hectares,” the researchers explained. “All of the studied solar parks had fixed-tilt solar racks, one of which also had panels mounted on biaxial trackers, and were developed at least eight years earlier. Seventeen solar parks were developed on arable land, and 15 parks were developed on grassland.”
The scientists visited each plot twice, each time surveying it with binoculars for 20 minutes, and recorded all the birds that could be seen or heard. They were then classified according to species, population trends, nesting places, diet, and foraging strata. The plots were also classified for elevation, previous land use, land type, and vegetation management.
Overall, the academic group spotted 353 individuals of 41 species in the solar parks and 271 individuals of 40 species in the control plots. Black redstart, European stonechat, white wagtail, and Eurasian tree sparrow were identified as species most strongly associated with solar parks.
According to the research group, bird species richness, diversity, and invertebrate-eater species richness and abundance were higher in the solar parks than in the control plots. Among the reasons provided by the research group is the food availability for insectivorous birds, as the PV panels attract various species of water-seeking aquatic insects.
“As food availability and accessibility is low in winter, it can be assumed that solar parks can have a positive impact on farmland birds outside the breeding season, as they can serve as stopover, foraging and roosting sites during migration and wintering as the ground under the solar panels can remain snow-free in winter,” the academics explained.
Another possible reason suggested was the higher structural diversity of solar parks.
“We observed that the support structures of the solar panels were used as nesting sites by the black redstart and the white wagtail, the Eurasian tree sparrow nested in the support structures of the panels made of pipes, while the stonechat nested in the uncultivated or extensive vegetation under the solar panels or next to the fence,” the researchers added.
They also stressed that the solar parks considered for the study were designed and managed for renewable electricity production only. “Therefore, it can be assumed that the biodiversity benefits would be even greater if they were managed synergistically with a stronger focus on wildlife,” they concluded.
They presented their analysis in the study “Solar parks can enhance bird diversity in the agricultural landscape,” published in the Journal of Environmental Management. The research was a collaborative work of scientists from Slovakia’s Slovak Academy of Sciences, Gemer-Malohont Museum, Comenius University in Bratislava, Catholic University in Ružomberok, Slovak Ornithological Society/BirdLife Slovakia, and Belgium’s University of Antwerp.
