“There is wide spectral tunability with the organic semiconductors to tune the light that is absorbed by the solar cells and the light that gets transmitted to the plants,” NCSU researcher, Brendan O’Connor, told pv magazine. “Our work shows that this transmission spectrum can not only support healthy plant growth but may be used to promote gene expression in crops for desired characteristics.”
According to him, this spectral tunability, along with relatively high power conversion efficiency, is the key opportunity with organic solar cells. “Traditional opaque solar cell technologies block too much light,” he further explained.
In the paper “Beyond energy balance in agrivoltaic food production: Emergent crop traits from color selective solar cells,” published in bioRXiv, the research group explained that each filter was made with 12 organic PV units which each measured 20cm by 10cm, and which were arranged in a single layer on a substrate made of PEDOT:PSS coated onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate.
The filters were placed on top of boxes designed to house the lettuce within a climate-controlled growth chamber. The boxes were positioned at the same height from the floor of the growth chamber so that similar amounts of light reached the plants in each treatment. “As expected, there were fewer differences between treatments when light intensity was controlled,” the scientists explained. “The spectral differences between the three OSC filters alone were not great enough to have a significant effect on biomass.”
(Read: “Photoluminescent solar PV for greenhouses“)
The crop growth of the filter-covered boxes was compared to that of two reference boxes covered with a clear-glass or shaded control. “Our experiments were designed to account for both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of OSC-filtered light on lettuce as a representative crop,” the academics specified.
The researchers used transcriptomic analysis to assess the key modifications of the plants grown under the solar filters. Transcriptomics is the analysis that is able to provide the sum of all of the RNA transcripts of an organism. Comparing transcriptomes allows the identification of genes that are differentially expressed in distinct cell populations or in response to different treatments. “The advantage of a transcriptome analysis in the study of OSC-grown plants is that these key modifications can be identified without the need to directly measure each aspect of plant growth and development,” they emphasized.
Through this analysis tool, the academics found the physiology of the plants was altered by the differences in light quality under the OSC filters, on a molecular and transcriptomic level. According to them, the boxes are not only able to produce different crop species at an affordable cost but also to enable growers to fine-tune plant characteristics by selecting from the wide range of OSC transmission spectra.
In a previous study, the same research group analyzed the growth of red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in a greenhouse equipped with organic solar cells coated with filters that can manage both near-IR (NIR) and long-wavelength (LW) IR. Their analysis showed that the organic solar cells contribute to reducing overheating in the greenhouse and that lettuce growth proceeded unabated under the solar cells as the different transmission spectra had no impact on the fresh weight of the plants.

Pike Solar is set to be a 175MW solar project coupled with a 25 MW/100MWh four-hour lithium-ion battery energy storage system, both among the largest ever proposed in Colorado, especially so far as energy storage is concerned.
Also worth note, Colorado Springs Utilities, the project’s energy offtaker, shared that there will be a reservoir on site for water-based energy storage, but that said storage is distinctly not hydropower. pv magazine reached out to the project’s developer, juwi, for clarification on this additional storage system, and will update this story pending juwi’s response.
Project construction is expected to commence in 2023, lasting roughly a year before Pike enters commercial operation in 2024. The project has a 17-year power purchase agreement (PPA) in place with Colorado Springs Utilities.
The project marks the second solar collaboration between juwi and Colorado Springs Utilities, the first being the 60MW Palmer Solar project, which is currently the largest solar project on Colorado Springs Utilities’ system, though it will be overtaken once Pike is complete.
The largest solar project in Colorado, however, is Lightsource bp’s 300MW Bighorn Solar project, located in Pueblo, Colorado. It is one of the largest on-site solar facilities in the US dedicated to a single customer, with more than 750,000 solar panels, and will provide power to Evraz’s Rocky Mountain Steel plant via a 20-year PPA with Xcel Energy, the utility that serves the plant.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/21/invasion-of-ukraine-an-inadvertent-boost-for-green-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,GERMANY,RUSSIA,SPAIN,UKRAINE",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 21, 2022",Invasion of Ukraine an inadvertent boost for green hydrogen,"From pv magazine global
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having widespread geopolitical and economic impacts, not the least of which can be seen in the price spike of gas-powered grey hydrogen and ammonia compared to green versions of the fuels. 
Earlier this month, BloombergNEF published a report suggesting “a delivered hydrogen price of $6.59/kg is now sufficient to make green ammonia cheaper than ‘gray’ ammonia, made from unabated natural gas on a short-run, marginal cost basis. This is just enough for a green ammonia facility in Germany to be competitive.” Of course, Bloomberg pointed out that prices in countries like Spain, India and China would be even more competitive. 
This week, Rystad Energy similarly predicted that a surging cost of blue and gray hydrogen in line with fossil fuel hikes increased the growing feasibility “of green hydrogen as an affordable and secure source of renewable energy in Europe”. 

According to Rystad, the war in Ukraine has “turbocharged” the green hydrogen production sector, which was already set to experience a boom year as it passed the 1GW milestone. Thanks to a 70% increase, Rystad predicts the cost of fossil fuel-linked blue and gray hydrogen could reach from $8/kg to $14/kg “in a matter of days”. For green hydrogen, however, since the invasion of Ukraine Rystad is predicting lower production costs of $4/kg, particularly in Spain, which looking to produce more than 4GW of green hydrogen by 2030. 
The market is well and truly swinging, and to add weight to that swing the EU has already announced plans for a €300 million funding package for hydrogen, as well as REPowerEU’s Hydrogen Accelerator initiative to unhook the region from its dependence on Russian gas. 
Rystad Energy’s head of hydrogen research Minh Khoi Le said “While industry and governments are heading in the right direction, their challenge is to lower the risks for green hydrogen investors and create incentives necessary to scale up quickly both the demand and supply. Fundamentally, a world where green hydrogen fulfills the role currently played by oil, gas and coal will look very different,” Le continued.
To realize that world green hydrogen production needs to increase to more than 10 million tons worldwide by 2030 and see its costs cut to at least $1.5/kg. 10 million tons might sound like a lot, but according to Rystad if green hydrogen and its derivatives were to replace gas and coal in Europe’s power mix base case by 2030 it would need 54 million tons. 
Currently, Europe is working to produce 3 million tons of green hydrogen annually by 2030, while RePower Europe has set a target of 15 million tons per annum. Clearly, there remains an enormous gap, but the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may just have swung the economics in green hydrogen’s favor.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/21/solaredge-590-million-capital-raise-expands-the-war-chest-said-roth/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 21, 2022","SolarEdge $590 million capital raise “expands the war chest,” said ROTH","SolarEdge Technologies, a major player in the PV inverter space, recently priced an offering of 2 million shares at $295, raising nearly $600 million total gross proceeds. In an industry note, Philip Shen, managing director, ROTH Capital Partners, described the offering as a well-timed move to expand the company’s “war chest.”
The offering comes as SolarEdge is trading about 15% below its all-time high. ROTH estimates total liquidity for the company may reach as high as $2 billion. With this war chest, SolarEdge said it can fund general corporate purposes and support new acquisitions. The company said it does not have any active commitments to acquisitions at this time. The raise creates about 3.4% equity dilution, estimates ROTH, but the firm said SolarEdge is well positioned for flexibility going forward. ROTH reiterated its buy rating and raised its price target for SEDG from $300 to $380.
SolarEdge has a market cap of about $17 billion, posting nearly $2 billion in revenues in 2021, and $1.45 billion in 2020. ROTH estimates growth may bring the company to $2.66 billion in revenues this year. The firm said SolarEdge is set to benefit from global solar demand acceleration, particularly in the European Union.
ROTH said some investors believed the capital raise was designed for additional battery capacity expansion, but the firm said it believes the company could have used bridge financing to do so.
SolarEdge’s major competitor in US markets, Enphase, recently made an acquisition of its own. The microinverter and battery provider purchased SolarLeadFactory, a residential solar lead generation business. The lead generation feature is set to add to Enphase’s digital platform for installers that includes design, permitting, installation, monitoring, and maintenance interfaces for solar PV and batteries. Soft costs like customer acquisition are a big hurdle for solar installers, so bringing lead generation in-house may be an attempt by Enphase to create competitive cost advantages.
New products and services
SolarEdge has also made significant additions to its business in recent months. Last October, the company released a residential battery system: the Energy Bank battery and Energy Hub inverter. SolarEdge said the DC-coupled residential energy storage battery provides 9.7 kWh of backup power. It can be connected in parallel with eight additional batteries, delivering up to 87 kWh of backup capacity. It has a round-trip efficiency of 94.5%, said the company. It said its DC-coupled technology requires one power conversion, rather than the three conversions that are needed with  AC-coupled technology.

The Energy Hub inverter ranges from 7.6kW to 11.4kW PV power and 10.3 kW backup power, with 200% DC oversizing to deliver higher energy yield for the home. The company said the backup power inverters simplify installations by reducing the need for main panel upgrades. The devices can be connected wirelessly, and can link up with the SolarEdge Home EV charger.
The equipment can be monitored and managed from the company’s mobile app. The software helps prioritize loads based on homeowner preferences, and applies algorithms that aid economical decisions, while accounting for external factors like weather events.
This January, the company partnered with Texas-based energy provider PearlX to create a virtual power plant (VPP) service. PearlX will purchase hardware and cloud-based grid services technology from SolarEdge, and the inverter provider will offer design and engineering support. While not a significant part of SolarEdge’s operations yet, VPPs offer an example of one of the many ways the company can expand its services and offer value in an increasingly distributed energy environment.
Described by PearlX as a “win-win-win,” each VPP provides load-serving and resiliency benefits to consumers, royalty and income streams for its multi-family real estate partners, and flexibility and capacity services to the Texas energy market, enabling utilities to leverage and control a previously untapped pool of available distributed energy resources to support grid stabilization.
With an expanded “war chest,” more partnerships, product offerings, or acquisitions may follow for SolarEdge.

Three non-profits in Brooklyn have partnered to form Barrio Solar, an organization that aims to take some of the sting away from high bills faced by Brooklyn residents by helping them to go solar.
The campaign is open to all Brooklyn residents who own a 1- to 4-family house, and participants will receive free solar consultation from non-profits and discounted pricing through a solar purchasing group. For those who live in apartments or whose roof is not oriented for solar, Barrio Solar can connect them with local community solar projects that provide guaranteed utility bill savings.
The first 25 low- to moderate-income (LMI) homeowners that sign up will receive a campaign-specific incentive of $3,500 to apply toward the upfront cost of solar panels or roof repairs, Barrio reports. This subsidy is available to homeowner households earning up to 100% of the Area Median Income.

The non-profits that formed Barrio Solar are the Fifth Avenue Committee (FAC), Neighbors Helping Neighbors, and Solar One. FAC is a community development corporation that’s been around for 44 years. Its mission is to advance economic, social, and racial justice in New York City through integrated, community- centered affordable housing, grassroots organizing, policy advocacy, and transformative education, training, and services. FAC works to benefit over 5,500 LMI New Yorkers annually with its services.
Neighbors Helping Neighbors is a housing counseling agency founded in 1990. The organization promotes racial justice and housing stability for low to moderate income residents. And, Solar One runs educational programs to educate New Yorkers on the the benefits of clean energy. The organization is focused on education, workforce training, and technical assistance to fosters sustainability and resiliency in diverse urban environments. Solar One has facilitated more than 700 solar projects in the NYC metro region since 2014, primarily in low-income communities.
Barrio Solar will be hosting an online workshop on weatherization and solar on March 23 and another on solar and batteries on March 30.

Decarbonizing food production, which accounts for as much as 30% of global emissions, makes agrivoltaics an environmental win-win.
A new solution for controlled-environment agriculture is set to be developed in a partnership between Heliene, a solar module manufacturer, and UbiQD, a photoluminescent materials integrator. The two seek to build a solution for greenhouses that transmits useful light for the plants inside and produces solar energy.
UbiQD builds translucent panels for greenhouses that are integrated with photoluminescent particles that are efficient at converting light into a preferable wavelength. The UbiQD “UbiGro” panels glow a spectrum of color that is optimized for plant growth, absorbing UV and blue light and emitting fruitful orange or red light.
In recent trials, UbiGro led to a 21% boost in flowering in geranium flowers, a 14-28% boost in winter strawberry growth, and an 8% yield increase in cannabis production. Increased crop yields are a welcome sign to any grower, and the two companies are set to take that benefit one step further, integrating productive solar PV in the greenhouse-topping modules.
The practice of co-locating solar energy production with food growth has been dubbed by many as “agrivoltaics.” The emerging sector taps into the benefits of localizing energy and preserving land use. In greenhouse agrivoltaics, there is a tradeoff between the transparency of the roofing and the electrical production. Herein lies the motivation to add yield boosting photoluminescence to the product.
“As energy costs continue to rise, the controlled environment agriculture industry will have to utilize energy sources more efficiently,” said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene. “Greenhouses and photovoltaics generate hundreds of billions of dollars of value from sunlight, and our plan is that with our agrivoltaic modules, the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts.”
UbiQD has been developing electricity-generating windows alongside the photoluminescent light-optimizing UbiGro product. Now, with the participation of a major North American solar PV manufacturer in Heliene, the two can continue to develop and scale the photovoltaic element of the product.
Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location, including both indoor and outdoor uses, could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.
The Oregon State paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of US electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/21/us-doe-invests-5-million-in-advancing-lithium-battery-manufacturing-and-workforce/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 21, 2022",US DOE invests $5 million in advancing lithium battery manufacturing and workforce,"The US Department of Energy (DOE), in coordination with the US Department of Labor and the AFL-CIO, today announced that it is investing $5 million to launch a strategy for lithium-battery manufacturing.
This initiative is part of suite of announcements from President Biden’s Interagency Working Group (IWG) on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization committed to taking action to support coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities as the nation transitions to a clean energy economy.
Lithium batteries power everything from electric vehicles to consumer electronics and are a critical component of President Biden’s whole-of-government decarbonization strategy. The DOE and the Biden administration are investing in this critical area in order to establish a secure end-to-end battery materials and technology supply chain.  Currently China is the leader in the global lithium-ion battery production market, according to a Wood Mackenzie report. And while the US is supporting its battery industry, China is investing heavily to build out more manufacturing facilities to extend its dominance.
In June the DOE announced a separate funding initiative in which $200 million was earmarked to support the battery supply chain in the US along with new vehicle development, both in EVs and connected vehicles. This month, American Battery Factory (ABF), announced plans to set up a network of lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery fabrications across the United States. Incubated by Lion Energy, a mobile battery and solar generator provider that reported $100 million in sales in 2021,
“I am glad to see the Department of Energy collaborating with our industry partners to invest in the next generation of our clean energy workforce,” said US Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “While I remain concerned about our dependence on China and other foreign countries for key parts of the lithium-ion battery supply chain, engaging our strong and capable workforce to manufacture batteries domestically is a critical step toward reducing our reliance on other countries and ensuring we are able to maintain our energy security.”
The pilot training programs will support industry-labor cooperation and will provide sites for job task analyses and documenting worker competencies. Insights gained will support the development of national industry-recognized credentials and inform the development of broader training programs to support the overall battery supply chain.
This announcement follows DOE’s recent release of two Notices of Intent authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to provide $3 billion to support projects that bolster domestic battery manufacturing and recycling. The funding, which will be made available in the coming months, will support battery-materials refining, which will bolster domestic refining capacity of minerals such as lithium, as well as production plants, battery cell and pack manufacturing facilities, and recycling facilities.
According to a recent PV Intel report, California is an example of a burgeoning US battery market with an 8x increase in solar-plus-battery installations just in the past year.

The 400MW Obsidian Solar Center is set to be developed on 4,000 acres of low-value grazing land in Lake County, which is in the south-central portion of the state, near the Oregon-California border. The project was initially expected to begin construction in 2019 and be finished in 2022 or 2023, however opposition from local landowners bogged down the process, and the project is now slated to begin construction in 2023 and reach completion by the end of 2024.
While the land set aside for construction poses little value for grazing, local farmers argued against the use of agricultural land for a project of this size, as agricultural land in the greater Christmas Valley region is especially valuable for growing high-quality hay. Opponents of the project also cited concerns over displacement of local fauna into other landowners’ growing fields, the potential for the project to create dust plumes, and the precedent set by developing non-agriculture on agriculturally-zoned land.
Ultimately, these concerns were overridden by the Energy Facility Siting Council and deemed speculative, allowing the project to move forward. The project does not currently have an energy offtaker, though the generation is expected to be purchased through a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a large utility company or data center operator in the region.
As it stands right now, the proposed capacity of the Obsidian Solar Center represents nearly 33% of all solar that has been installed in Oregon to date, which currently sits at just over 1,200MW. The project also far exceeds the size of Oregon’s previous claimant to largest project: the Montague Solar Facility.
With a final expected capacity of 162MW, the Montague Solar Facility is under construction on 1,200 acres of Exclusive Farm Use zoned land in Gilliam County, in the North-Central part of the state, near the Oregon-Washington border. that project was developed by Avangrid Renewables and holds a 15-year PPA with PGE.
Obsidian represents Obsidian Solar’s 13th project in the Pacific Northwest, and is the company’s largest-ever solar installation, 353MW greater in capacity than the runner-up.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/21/three-grid-regions-processed-25gw-of-solar-interconnection-requests-last-year/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 21, 2022",Three grid regions processed 25GW of solar interconnection requests last year,"Texas grid operator ERCOT processed 14GW of utility-scale solar interconnection requests last year, while grid operator MISO in the central US reported processing 6GW and California’s CAISO processed 5GW. Battery storage interconnection requests processed in the three regions were 6GW, 0.1GW and 7GW, respectively. The grid operators provided the data in response to a pv magazine inquiry sent to the seven regional grid operators.
Project developers have identified interconnection delays and costs as the biggest barrier for utility-scale renewables. The interconnection queue of grid operator PJM, for example, has stretched to nearly 300GW of renewables and storage projects, according to the trade group Advanced Energy Economy. Interconnection requests are handled by grid operators in seven regions across the US, and by utilities in other parts of the US.
ERCOT’s processing of 14GW of solar interconnection requests last year compares to its 8.3GW of solar capacity at year-end 2021.
MISO’s reported processing of 6GW of solar requests last year compares to its 1.3GW of solar capacity at year-end 2021, and the 6.8GW of solar that MISO expects to come online this year. MISO aims to shorten its timeline to reach an interconnection agreement from 505 days to as few as 373 days.
CAISO’s processing of 5GW of solar requests compares to its current 15GW of solar capacity. CAISO is now processing a larger cluster of interconnection requests and will release full interconnection studies for that cluster in late 2023, under a plan approved by federal energy regulators.
Across the three grid operators, which serve about 30% of the US population, the 25GW of solar interconnection requests processed compares to the 17GW-dc of utility-scale solar installed across the entire US in 2021, as reported by the solar association SEIA.
In response to pv magazine‘s request, ERCOT and CAISO provided data on solar and battery projects for which they completed a full interconnection study last year. MISO provided data on projects for which a generator interconnection agreement was filed last year.
After completing a full interconnection study, a grid operator hands off the interconnection request to the utility owning transmission near the project site. The utility and the project developer first enter a contract known as a generator interconnection agreement that spells out their respective obligations. The transmission owner then builds the infrastructure to connect the solar or battery project to the grid, at the project developer’s expense. Project developers are not required to proceed beyond the full interconnection study, and in many cases they do not proceed.
Data on the pace of processing interconnection requests may also be obtained by analyzing the interconnection queue dataset of each grid operator, a task requiring both talent and time to extract the relevant data. In the Southeast and much of the West, individual utilities have their own interconnection queues.
