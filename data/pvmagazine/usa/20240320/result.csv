The portfolio of projects support the utility’s Clean Energy Blueprint – a plan to bring 1.1 GW of solar generation to the state by the end of 2024.
The projects span over 5,000 acres and are expected to generate enough electricity to serve the equivalent power demand of 170,000 homes. The projects include:
Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) was performed by Burns & McDonnell. The projects started construction in 2021 and were delivered on-time amid COVID-19, labor, and supply chain restrictions that beleaguered the utility-scale segment at the time.
“Having our EPC team, self-perform crews, environmental and permitting specialists, and substation and interconnection support teams integrated with Alliant Energy and the local union halls early in the project was critical to achieving certainty in outcome and delivering on time,” said Chad Cotter, vice president of solar construction, Burns & McDonnell. “But I think most important was Alliant Energy’s bold vision to move forward with these projects despite the volatile period that paused many other projects across the country.”
Alliant Energy said the strategic investments in solar will help the utility save on long-term costs.
Over 1,300 craft workers were employed during the installation of the nine utility-scale solar projects. An apprenticeship program was run through AZCO, the union construction subsidiary of B&M. It provided hands-on experience for 230 apprentices working as carpenters, electricians, laborers, operators and millwrights. B&M said over 75% of program participants were Wisconsin residents.
“The local union halls and contractor partners, we were able to help Alliant Energy deliver exceptional value to customers across Wisconsin while keeping project dollars in the community,” said Josh Ronk, construction project manager, AZCO.
Nine greenfield substations were built during this project, with six generation-tie lines adding about 8 miles of 69-kV and 138-kV transmission lines. To address ongoing supply chain issues, the team made use of temporary high-voltage gas circuit breakers that were decommissioned from an Alliant Energy coal plant to maintain the project schedule while waiting for high-voltage circuit breakers to arrive.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/20/booming-u-s-energy-storage-installation-grows-90-year-over-year/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-20,Booming U.S. energy storage installation grows 90% year-over-year,"In its latest Energy Storage Monitor report, Wood Mackenzie outlined the continued trend of rapidly increasing battery energy storage deployments across the U.S., with data through Q1 2024.
Across all segments, the U.S. energy storage industry deployed 8.7 GW, a record-breaking growth of 90% year-over-year. The nation deployed 4.2 GW in Q4, 2023, and California and Texas installations accounted for 77% of Q4 additions, said Wood Mackenzie.
The U.S. grid-scale storage market shattered previous quarterly installation records in Q4 2023, deploying 3,983 MW / 11,769 MWh, leading to an average duration of 2.95 hours. A combination of short-duration energy storage serving acute peak electricity demand times, and four-hour grid-scale batteries are common configurations in today’s market.
The residential energy storage market reached a marginal record quarter in Q4, 2023, deploying 218.5 MW, beating the record set by Q3 of 210.9 MW. The community, commercial, and industrial (CCI) segment deployed 33.9 MW, with the most deployment occurring in California, Massachusetts, and New York, said Wood Mackenzie.
“Q4 2023 was extremely strong for the U.S. energy storage market, helped by easing supply chain challenges and system price declines,” said Vanessa Witte, senior analyst, Wood Mackenzie.
The storage boom has been supported in part by drastically lowering costs. In Q4, battery prices declined rapidly, in large part due to lower-than-expected EV demand in the U.S. and EU, and due to an oversupply of battery grade lithium raw material.
“Chinese OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) are selling DC blocks at aggressively low prices, undercutting competitors in order to gain market share,” said the Wood Mackenzie report. “However, this price pressure isn’t enough for all developers to turn away from the full AC-block solution of a more traditional integrator.”
Since last summer, lithium battery cell pricing has plummeted by approximately 50%, according to Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world’s largest battery manufacturer. In early summer 2023, publicly available prices ranged from $0.11 to $0.13 /Wh, or about $110 to $130 per kWh. Goldman Sachs predicts that these price reductions will make electric vehicles as affordable as gasoline-powered vehicles, leading to increased demand.
While the grid-scale segment grew 98% year-over-year in terms of capacity deployment, Wood Mackenzie warns this growth curve is not likely to continue.
“Growth flattens in 2025 and 2026 as project capacity is pushed into later years of the forecast largely due to early-stage development challenges such as permitting and siting difficulties, and interconnection queue timelines,” said the report.
Meanwhile, Wood Mackenzie expects the residential segment to grow to 2.1 GW per year in 2024, while CCI is expected to install 1.2 GW annually. It said that the emergence of storage incentive programs and the transition to NEM 3.0 in California will support distributed storage growth in the coming years. It also highlighted strong distributed energy storage growth in Puerto Rico.
“Energy storage has unique capabilities to address grid resilience, with the ability to serve as generation, load, and transmission. These benefits to the grid have been evident, especially in recent years, as storage has provided reliability and stability during critical moments like historic heatwaves. With a robust pipeline, the future for energy storage deployment is strong,” said John Hensley, vice president of markets and policy analysis, American Clean Power.

Longi has revealed it might reduce its global workforce due to an “increasingly competitive environment” in the solar industry.
“In order to adapt to market changes and improve organizational efficiency, Longi is optimizing its workforce,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The expected job reduction rate is about 5% of total employees, and the information circulating online about our company’s ‘30% layoff’ plan is false.”
The statement refers to an article published by Bloomberg on Monday, citing “people familiar with the matter” as a source. The outlet reported that Longi was planning to cut around one-third of its staff to reduce costs and regain competitiveness in an industry plagued by overcapacity.
This is not the first time layoff rumors have emerged in relation to Longi. In December 2023, reports surfaced suggesting a significant reduction in expatriate laborers and management trainees, alongside a halt in social recruitment activities.
According to the company’s latest annual report, it employed 60,601 people at the end of 2022. It was expected to have grown to around 80,000 employees by mid-2023.
Longi is the world’s leading vertically integrated solar enterprise. It recorded CNY 94.1 billion ($12.6 billion) of operating revenue in the first three quarters of 2023, up 8.55% year on year. Net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies also saw an uptick, reaching CNY 11.694 billion, up 6.54% year on year.
However, Longi has also encountered significant challenges, due to escalating overcapacity in the PV sector and the continuous decline of module shipping prices.

China’s JinkoSolar was the world’s largest PV module supplier in 2023, with 78.5 GW of global shipments.
In its financial results for 2023, the company said that its panel shipments increased by 76.4% year on year.
“At the end of the fourth quarter, we became the first module manufacturer in the world to have delivered a total of 210 GW solar modules, covering over 190 countries and regions,” it said, in reference to its cumulative shipments.
JinkoSolar recorded a turnover of CNY 118.68 billion ($16.72 billion), up 42.8% from 2022. It also posted a net profit of CNY 3.45 billion.
“Benefiting from our efforts in cost optimization, our profitability for the full year significantly improved year-over-year, with gross margin at 16.0%, compared to 14.8% in 2022,” said Jinko CEO Xiande Li. “Module shipment in the fourth quarter was 26.3 GW, exceeding our guidance.”
Li said that around half of the modules shipped in the fourth quarter went to the Chinese market, where they were sold at lower prices.
In its outlook for 2024, JinkoSolar said it hopes to ship between 100 GW and 110 GW.
“We expect our annual production capacity for mono wafers, solar cells and solar modules to reach 120 GW, 110 GW and 130 GW, respectively, by the end of 2024, with N-type capacity accounting for over 90% of total capacity,” it stated. “By then, we believe mass-produced N-type cell efficiency will have reached 26.5%.”

Sinovoltaics, a Hong Kong-based technical compliance and quality assurance service firm, has begun to publish supply chain reports about PV manufacturing in North American and European markets. In the pipeline is coverage of India and Southeast Asia.
Published in the form of infographics and data tables, the supply chain reports are free.
“We have been observing supply chain trends and movements for years and years, for example also witnessing the gradual growth of manufacturing in Southeast Asia, which is why we have nowadays quality engineering teams on-site at the factories in that region,” Sinovoltaics CTO Niclas Weimar told pv magazine. “This new type of report is basically putting our observations into report form, starting from this year onwards, helping to visualize the distribution of manufacturing capacities across different jurisdictions.”
The analysts expects the information to be used by solar developers and other buyers to locate manufacturers in relevant regions, assess the scalability of the supply chain for larger projects, or to source modules for projects more efficiently with an eye on reducing transportation costs and carbon emissions.
“The solar industry needs the most up-to-date module purchasing information,” said Dricus de Rooij, co-founder and CEO of Sinovoltaics in a statement. “Every four months, solar developers will have critical and dynamic data that will enable them to stay informed about emerging PV suppliers and the latest developments in global solar manufacturing.”
The supply chain reports cover current and planned manufacturing activity from 2023 to 2027 for producers of modules, cells, wafers, ingots, polysilicon, and multigrain silicon. It notes capacity at each of a manufacturers’ factory locations. There are also symbols indicating if a company is now bankrupt, or a manufacturing site is closed or on hold.
The first edition of North American report covers 81 sites in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, while the European version lists 91 sites across the region, including companies located in Kazakhstan and Turkey.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/20/electrolyzer-prices-what-to-expect/,"COST AND PRICES,WORLD",CORNELIA LICHNER,2024-03-20,Electrolyzer prices – what to expect,"From pv magazine print edition 3/24
All electrolyzers have a technology-specific stack at their center, in which water is split into hydrogen and oxygen. This consists of carefully layered, gas-tight, welded bipolar plates and plastic membranes – among the main cost factors in every electrolysis plant. Xiaoting Wang, an analyst at BloombergNEF, spoke to 20 companies worldwide as part of the company’s “Electrolysis System Capex [capital expenditure] could drop 30% by 2025” study. This gave her an insight into the cost structure for 30 projects and made it possible to determine the price components for a 10 MW alkaline electrolysis plant in China in 2021, as an example.
The stack accounted for around 33% of the total costs, said Wang, with 40% of the costs coming from the other technical equipment, including power electronics, gas and liquid separation, and gas purification (see chart below). A further 27% of the costs were attributable to other project expense, such as civil engineering, equipment installation, and housing.

Chinese alkaline
The BNEF report stated a 10 MW alkaline system often consists of two stacks of 5 MW that deliver hydrogen at 16 bar. The manufacturer usually offers a complete solution with all accessories and installation. Chinese developers received such an offer in 2021 for as little as $303/kW – that is, a total of around €3 million ($3.2 million). This did not include the grid-connection fee, high-voltage transformers, or other “soft” costs such as expenses for development, approvals and financing agreements.
Wang said that the project costs in Western markets with domestically produced electrolyzers are around four times as high. Investment costs averaged €1,200/kW for alkaline electrolyzers and €1,400/kW for proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers.
Cheaper offers, such as €180/kW, from Peric for an 80 MW plant in China; or €521/kW, from Thyssenkrupp for a 2 GW plant in Saudi Arabia, do not include all project costs and are, therefore, not comparable. They do include electrolysis stacks, gas liquid separation and purification, and the water supply. However, power electronics and control cabinets are excluded.
Wang attributed this large price difference to low labor costs and the established supply chains in China, where manufacturers of electrolyzers can source materials and components at much lower prices than in the West. Thus far, the production of most electrolyzers is not automated. Chinese manufacturers were producing megawatt-scale electrolyzers for other industries before there was demand from green hydrogen producers, meaning they benefited from scaled production. Existing customers included manufacturers of polysilicon for photovoltaic cells.
The Bloomberg analysis, from September 2022, claimed that Western manufacturers could achieve similarly low costs. To do so, they would have to utilize highly automated production. Wang said she anticipates significant price reductions by as early as 2025 (see main chart above). Prices for 2021 also still included adequate margins for engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies. Long-term development shows that prices for electrolysis projects will converge worldwide from 2035.
Western investors tend to entrust an EPC company with the handling of an entire project for a lump sum, and to rely on large, well-known companies. Such companies usually have little experience in the construction of electrolysis plants, however, so the safety premiums in the price of the overall offer are high. With increasing experience and the entry of specialized project planners, which leads to more competition, these surcharges should decrease.
Prefabricated containers
Equipment suppliers are also endeavoring to offer products that reduce the workload on the construction site, and thus cut costs. One trend that supports this is the development of containerized systems. This means that the various system components do not have to be assembled on site but are instead prefabricated in a factory, tested, and delivered to the intended location. This minimizes sources of error and reduces the deployment time of specialist personnel on site.
In an update to its market analysis, Bloomberg reported on offers for such container solutions for $1,000/kW. Industry insiders have even reported offers as low as $700/kW, said Wang. One such container solution was presented in a pv magazine Germany webinar in February 2023. The PEM electrolyzer from German supplier H-Tec has an output of 1 MW and produces 450 kg of hydrogen per day. Recordings of pv magazine webinars are available at pv-magazine.com/webinars.
Those who want to reduce costs by purchasing an electrolyzer from China need to consider that exported products are usually sold at a premium of around 20% to 30%, compared to prices on the domestic market, said BloombergNEF, meaning that development and project planning costs would still be higher. It is important to consider that choosing a Chinese brand to supply the core equipment could reduce a project’s chance of receiving local subsidies and could affect financing.
The first green hydrogen projects were, and still are, mainly designed to draw electricity from the grid, with the electrolyzers’ electricity consumption balanced monthly or annually against the suppliers’ renewable electricity generation. In this case, the technical disadvantage of alkaline electrolysis in terms of flexibility would not bother operators.
However, after 2030, most new green hydrogen projects will need to ensure an hourly match between power generation and power consumption for grid-connected electrolysis systems, which will lead to more off-grid projects being developed, said Wang. This trend is not only due to the need for a clearer definition of green hydrogen. A direct connection to renewables generation plants should also improve economic feasibility in the future. After all, using the grid to shift huge amounts of electricity will cost more in the future. Electrolysis with stable grid electricity will, therefore, not be able to produce cheaper hydrogen in the future than with solar and wind energy, with their low electricity generation costs.

Cost reduction
This is where PEM electrolyzers come into play. These can better follow the fluctuating electricity supply and also work efficiently in partial load operation or off-grid. However, this technology still needs to significantly reduce its dependence on expensive platinum group metals, especially iridium, in order to gain a dominant market share, said Wang. Plug Power, from the United States, and ITM Power, from the United Kingdom, use 200 grams to 300 grams of iridium per megawatt of capacity.
Current worldwide production of iridium is around seven metric tons per year. Even if the entire volume were used to produce catalysts for PEM electrolysis, this supply chain could only support a maximum of 35 GW per year. PEM can only dominate the green hydrogen market if manufacturers manage to significantly reduce the consumption of iridium per unit this decade or achieve an equivalent effect in parallel with improved metal recycling. Wang said Electric Hydrogen, a new United States-based manufacturer of PEM electrolyzers, has already reported using significantly less iridium than competitors.
There is also a chance that anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis could replace PEM after 2030 because it does not use expensive metals. This means manufacturers must succeed in developing stacks that are suitable for large scale projects. Enapter is an AEM pioneer, building small stacks and assembling them into larger 1 MW units which are still small compared to other electrolyzers. California-based company Verdagy is just starting to sell 20 MW modules, each consisting of two 10 MW stacks.

Larger stacks
Producing more hydrogen from a single stack is another route to cost reduction. One way to achieve this is by increasing the size of the stack itself. The largest commercial stack, with 15 MW, which came onto the market in September 2023, comes from Longi, according to Wang. Although increasing the size of the stack sounds straightforward, it has several disadvantages. First, it becomes more difficult to move large units, especially for international sales. Second, with larger units, mechanical forces and stresses become more uneven, which affects safety and is associated with lower efficiency.
More yield can be achieved by increasing the current density. Put simply, the more electrons that pass through the stack, the more hydrogen can be produced. Simply applying a higher voltage can increase the current density but has a detrimental effect on efficiency. The strategy to maintain or even increase efficiency is to revise the internal structures and introduce advanced catalysts and membranes.
Over the long term, it is preferable to increase the current density, said Wang. Plug Power and ITM Power are in the lead here with a current density of more than 3A/cm2 (amperes per square centimeter) followed by AEM manufacturer Verdagy, with 2A/cm2. Most Chinese alkaline electrolyzers have only 0.3A/cm2. Wang, in turn, has learned from Electric Hydrogen that their product would have an even higher current density than Plug Power and ITM Power. She estimated that, by 2030, current densities close to 10A/cm2 will be typical for the remaining manufacturers of PEM electrolyzers.
More competition
The costs of Western products could initially fall by around 30% by 2025. In addition to technological progress, competition is also likely to increase. Manufacturers worldwide have announced a production capacity of 52.6 GW for this year while deliveries are optimistically only 5 GW, according to BloombergNEF’s forecast. In China, where there is already fierce competition for orders from project developers, manufacturers’ margins are small. In addition, developers hedge their risk against the manufacturer by paying only up to 85% of the agreed price on delivery and the rest once commissioning has been completed and performance is still good after 18 months.
The pressure is not yet as high on Western markets, as investors and project developers in Europe and the United States can reckon with relatively high subsidies. However, production capacities are also increasing here and factories need to be fully utilized. If Chinese manufacturers also seek their salvation in exports, it is foreseeable that the price war will increase in all markets.

Vanadium flow batteries are one of the most promising large-scale energy storage technologies due to their long cycle life, high recyclability, and safety credentials. However, they have lower energy density compared to ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries, and their uptake is held back by high upfront cost.
Now, researchers led by the University of Padua in Italy developed a techno-economic model, using experimental and market data, which can better inform investment decisions for this type of technology.
Their model considers the present and future competitivity of industrial flow batteries in operating specific services, which have not yet been developed to an accurate grade, and yields economic performance indicators such as capital costs, operative costs, levelized cost of storage (LCOS), and net present value.
To perform their calculations, the researchers used technical parameters taken from large-area multi-cell stacks, rather than from small single-cell experiments, to better characterize the behavior of real industrial-scale systems. They also used data from real financial markets and economic patterns of some major manufacturers.
The assessment was performed considering a lifespan of 20 years with a charge/discharge cycle per day. Each component affecting the capital and operative costs was analyzed, and the impact of side phenomena on capacity losses was considered.
As a result, their model showed where the economic indicators are heading and which parameters have a greater affect on investment profitability, thus tracking a possible roadmap for system optimization.
Their estimations indicate that technological and market evolutions are heading to much more competitive systems, with capital costs down to $284.2  per kWh at an energy/power duration of 10 hours. Namely, this is the breakeven point where the present values of total costs equate the present values of total revenues and no economic result is obtained.
“This is to be compared with a break-even point in the net present value of $434 per kWh, which suggests that flow batteries may play a major role in some expanding markets, notably the long duration energy storage,” the researchers stated.
Their results are published in the study “Techno-economic assessment of future vanadium-flow batteries based on real device/market parameters,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.

The result is a fuel-flexible solution for commercial and industrial customers looking to decarbonize.
A microgrid is a self-contained electrical network that generates electricity on site by a fuel source such as solar and stored for when it is needed most. The microgrid can be connected to the power grid or can decentralize and “island” when needed. The ability to decentralize power ensures that critical facilities, such as data centers or healthcare facilities, have electricity to power critical operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They can also be used in remote areas where energy access is limited or nonexistent to provide much-needed resources.
As part of Schneider Electric’s cybersecure solution architecture, EcoStruxure Microgrid Operations is a dedicated, packaged microgrid controller solution. The hardware and software solution offers streamlined operator experience, advanced distributed energy resource management, advanced grid management, and more, according to Schneider Electric.
The Mainspring Linear Generator was launched commercially in 2020 and the company reports it is installed today in multiple regions of the U.S., running operations for Fortune 500 companies.
These generators use a low-temperature reaction of fuel and air to create electricity, continuously. When used in conjunction with solar modules, the generators can ensure optimal use of the sun’s energy at all times. The Mainspring generator also lets customers switch among multiple fuel options, including renewable options such as biofuels, green ammonia and green hydrogen.
 “We designed the fuel-flexible Linear Generator so that as clean fuels become increasingly available and cost-effective, organizations of all kinds can capitalize on them without having to replace or retrofit equipment,” said Shannon Miller, Mainspring CEO and founder.
