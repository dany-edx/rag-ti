When used in a conventional lithium-ion battery, aluminum fractures and fails within a few charge-discharge cycles, due to expansion and contraction as lithium travels in and out of the material. The material’s potential application in batteries was investigated in the past, but to no avail.
Now, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States have developed lab-scale lithium-ion battery cells with non-pre-lithiated aluminum-foil-based negative electrodes with improved energy density and stability.
“This is a story about a material that was known about for a long time, but was largely abandoned early on in battery development,” said Associate Professor Matthew McDowell. “But with new knowledge, combined with a new technology — the solid-state battery — we’ve figured out how we can rejuvenate the idea and achieve really promising performance.”
Instead of using pure aluminum in the foils, which would fail rapidly when tested in batteries, the research team added small amounts of other materials to the aluminum to create foils with particular “microstructures,” or arrangements of different materials. They tested over 100 different materials to understand how they would behave in batteries.
The new aluminum foil anode demonstrated markedly improved performance and stability when implemented in solid-state batteries, as opposed to conventional lithium-ion batteries. The lab-scale cells deliver hundreds of stable cycles with practically relevant areal capacities at high current densities (6.5 mA cm−2)
“One of the benefits of our aluminum anode that we’re excited about is that it enables performance improvements, but it also can be very cost-effective,” McDowell said. “On top of that, when using a foil directly as a battery component, we actually remove a lot of the manufacturing steps that would normally be required to produce a battery material.”
The project began as a collaboration between the Georgia Tech team and Atlanta-based aluminum manufacturer and recycler Novelis. The researchers are now working to scale up the size of the batteries to understand how size influences the behavior of aluminum.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/24/solar-contractor-tool-helps-quote-roofing-and-solar-in-one/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOFTWARE,CANADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 24, 2023",Solar contractor tool helps quote roofing and solar in one,"Canadian company SumoQuote launched its solar quoting system featuring EagleView TrueDesign as the premium design partner. SumoQuote Solar is a software tool that allows contractors to quote roofing and solar in one place.
SumoQuote Solar, an add-on to the company’s roofing tool that is available through a subscription, enables roofing contractors to offer solar to any roofing quote. Often homeowner’s looking to install solar need to first replace their roof, so this all-in-one tool can be used for both quotes.
EagleView, a specialist in geospatial technology, has a geospatial data and imagery library that the company reports encompasses 94% of the U.S. population. EagleView TrueDesign makes use of the imagery data to help installers create a sales-ready design with accurate PVWatts-backed production forecasts. The platform creates a report for customers, empowering sales representatives to move projects forward. Once the sale is closed, the installer can use the one-button planning process and to generate a CAD design after a few hours of processing. “This is only possible through EagleView’s level of granularity,” Peter Cleveland, Eagleview’s VP of solar sales told pv magazine USA. 
TrueDesign is intended to save installers a lot of time and resources, as a truck roll is no longer necessary to bring a site surveyor to the home. It also minimizes risks for installers who have employees climbing ladders for manual pen-and-paper site surveys on rooftops, as well. Interior structures must still be manually observed, but the shortened site survey time is significant, according to EagleView.
SumoQuote Solar can be added to any paid subscription for an additional $150/month which includes 10 free quotes. Roofing installers who already use SumoQuote will get access to preferred report pricing when they use the EagleView add on.
SumoQuote will host a live web class on why and how to add solar to a roofing business. Register here for “Double Your Revenue: The Roofers Guide to Solar” taking place on Thursday, August 3 at 11 a.m. MST.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/24/how-will-the-latest-change-to-net-metering-impact-solar-adoption-in-california/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",,"JULY 24, 2023",How will the latest change to net metering impact solar adoption in California?,"California is appropriately named the Golden State, not only due to the gold rush in the 1800s, but because of the limitless possibilities it provides. In recent years, the Golden State shined brightly, with solar at the forefront of its transformational shift to sustainable living. Leading the solar industry in the US, the market grew exponentially, driven by the lucrative incentives available under the previous net energy metering (NEM) regulations – NEM 2.0.
However, in April of this year, NEM 3.0 was put into place bringing with it a drastic change to net metering rates that is projected to make it around 70% less profitable for homeowners to sell excess energy to the grid. Naturally, this has led to some market uncertainty, with concerns about a possible dip in demand.
Leaning on the past to better understand the future
Fortunately for California, this situation is not new. Similar changes have occurred in many other countries across Europe. If energy becomes more expensive to buy than it is profitable to sell, it is more cost-effective to store your energy for personal use when the sun goes down. What you get is a net metering market shifting to a self-consumption market, with solar + storage becoming the norm.
In both Belgium and Germany for example, we saw the same pattern emerge: demand for solar increased significantly in the run-up to the tariff change and then dipped slightly afterwards. However, in both countries this proved to be a blip rather than a trend. In Germany for example, we have seen incredible market growth since net metering ended in January 2021, with 70% of new SolarEdge PV installations now including a home battery (Q1/22 figures), up from 38% prior to net metering ending. This substantial increase in demand for solar + storage installations has made the market very profitable for German installers.
Helping homeowners to prosper in a self-consumption market
With storage presenting a larger, long-term investment, homeowners will look to ensure good value and a system that will last. For installers, the key to maintaining sales is to add as much value for homeowners as possible. This starts by advising homeowners on the help available to reduce the cost of purchasing a solar + storage system. The introduction of the Reduction Act in 2022 brought with it rebates for energy efficiency retrofits of up to $4,000 for single-family homes and up to $400,000 for multifamily buildings, which can help to make a significant dent in the initial purchase price.
Even with this financial help, purchasing a battery may seem out of reach for some homeowners, and so it is essential to offer a range of solutions to meet every budget. Currently, most batteries in the US are purchased in combination with a back-up unit. However, this is not essential for homeowners who are looking to store energy simply to increase their self-consumption. In order to meet this need, we recently introduced ‘Rate Saver’, a storage-only solution which reduces battery system costs for homeowners by up to 38% through reduced equipment and installation costs.
Investing in a solar + storage solution will also be more appealing to homeowners educated on time of use (ToU) savings. Under NEM 3.0, export rates for solar energy will differ from hour to hour, which can make it difficult to determine the revenue homeowners can generate by selling energy back to the grid. On average, homeowners will receive about 5 cents/kWh. The exception is that during September between 6:00pm and 8:00pm the rate will increase to $3/kWh. This means that homeowners could receive a potential paycheck of $750-$850 for September with careful management of the process. Here, product selection is key, as some systems use algorithms which will ensure the battery is automatically fully charged prior to these times, maximizing profitability for homeowners.
Another way to add value for customers is to talk to them about the role that load shifting can play in increasing solar energy self-consumption. For example, scheduling heavier electrical loads such as EV chargers, heat pumps, pool pumps and air conditioners, to run at times when solar production is at its highest, will help customers use much more of the energy produced by their home. This functionality will become even more important because of how EV charging increases the amount of energy required in homes. Therefore, offering a complete end-to-end smart energy management system within the home that automates this process will become a major selling point under NEM 3.0.
Oversizing PV arrays also becomes a more important consideration in a self-consumption market. Oversizing the array (in comparison to the inverter’s AC power) ensures that PV systems produce more power more of the time, even during low light conditions. The result is higher energy yield for the home, and a faster return on investment for the homeowner through greater ToU savings and load shifting.
How installers can thrive in NEM 3.0
For installers to thrive in the new reality of a self-consumption market, they need to consider the battery options available, and the factors which make installing batteries easier for themselves, as well as beneficial to the customer.
A DC-coupled battery provides the highest efficiency energy storage by eliminating what is known as the “triple conversion penalty”, with two less power conversions required than AC-coupled batteries. In some cases, this can result in an additional ten days of saved energy per year. Right now, homeowners are hyper-aware of how much their energy use is costing them, and so it’s easy for them to very quickly calculate how much extra savings this will generate.
However, the benefits of DC-coupled batteries also extend to installers. Unlike AC-coupled batteries, DC batteries do not require additional breakers to be installed in the home’s load center, which in the vast majority of cases removes the need for a main panel upgrade (MPU). MPUs can be expensive for the homeowner and are extremely time consuming for installers. Reducing the time it takes to complete each project means installers can move on to the next one much quicker, which is great news for their bottom line.
Long commissioning times for batteries is another source of frustration for installers. We often hear stories about batteries that can take up to a day to commission because of the time needed to upload firmware to the battery bank. By choosing a battery with wireless communication and an intuitive installer app, commissioning times can be cut to less than one hour. What’s more, commissioning can also be carried out in parallel with installation, rather than as a separate task once the install is completed.
So, will California stay golden?
While there’s no doubt the Californian solar market has undergone a major change, it presents a huge opportunity for installers. As we’ve seen in other self-consumption markets that have experienced a similar shift, sales may dip in the short-term, but this will be followed by a resurgence in demand driven by solar + storage installations. The market that emerges will be more mature, stronger and resilient, and for installers who understand how to best implement batteries into their sales mix, they will be well positioned to become more profitable than ever.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/24/interfaith-group-uses-moral-suasion-to-advance-solar-power-for-philadelphia/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PENNSYLVANIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 24, 2023",Interfaith group uses moral suasion to advance solar power for Philadelphia,"The group Power Interfaith has called on southeastern Pennsylvania utility PECO to enter long-term contracts for solar and wind power, challenging the utility’s “insistence” on short-term contracts that “artificially favor fossil fuels.”
With long-term contracts, solar and wind power “are cheaper than burning fossil fuels,” the group says in its People’s Energy Plan for PECO.
PECO should include “the maximum amount of affordable, renewable energy” in its four-year energy procurement plan due to state regulators next year, said Julie Greenberg, who serves as director of Power’s climate justice and jobs initiative and as rabbi for a Philadelphia congregation. PECO should not propose “the absolute minimum that is required” under Pennsylvania law, “which is what PECO served us in its last plan” four years ago, she said.
At a rally in front of Philadelphia’s City Hall last month to launch the PECO initiative, Power Interfaith Executive Director Dwayne Royster said that Pennsylvania law “only requires PECO to obtain one-half of 1% of our electricity from solar,” and that the state ranks 45th out of 50 states for the amount of electricity produced from wind, solar and hydro. Royster, who also serves as senior pastor for Faith United Church of Christ in Washington, DC, said that other utilities in Pennsylvania have begun using 25-year power purchasing contracts “to support the construction of new solar energy.”
The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PUC) approved in 2020 a PECO proposal to solicit new ten-year contracts for Solar Alternative Energy Credits.
“PECO nearly has all of our eggs in one fossil fuel basket,” Royster said, adding that natural gas price volatility “puts people at risk” because “so many households in our region are already struggling to afford energy bills.”
“All of humanity is facing the huge challenge of climate change,” Royster added, saying that Philadelphia is already “seeing and feeling climate change,” as “summers are getting hotter earlier,” and recent hurricanes flooded large areas in southwest Philadelphia and caused the Schuylkill River to overflow, flooding the I-676 highway.
Philadelphia City Council member Kendall Brooks said that the People’s Energy Plan “is about using people power to ensure clean energy and clean water for our children. We want PECO to be proactive and shift our energy away from fossil fuels toward wind and solar.”
Anthony Ross, a solar installer with Solar States, said that clean renewable energy “gives opportunities.” He said that in the past, he was a “troubled person” dealing with homelessness and incarceration. “But I was introduced to the solar industry, and it allowed me to be financially stable.”
Ross added that fracking in Pennsylvania, “mostly in low-income rural areas,” has “caused many peoples’ health to deteriorate, due to toxic chemicals in the water.” He said he empathized with those who have been “affected by this environmental crisis.”
The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission in its 2020 proceeding on PECO’s last procurement plan approved a partial settlement to which all intervening parties except a group of environmental stakeholders had agreed, and denied the environmental stakeholders’ objections to that partial settlement. Power Interfaith did not intervene in that proceeding.
Power Interfaith is a multi-issue community organizing group operating in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.
Greenberg credited the Earth Quaker Action Team for its work for six years leading a campaign to pressure PECO to “power local green jobs” through solar expansion—a campaign that “Power enthusiastically joined,” she said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/24/2-gw-meyer-burger-solar-cell-factory-in-colorado-hints-of-more-coming/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 24, 2023","2 GW Meyer Burger solar cell factory in Colorado, hints of more coming","Meyer Burger will construct a 2 GW per year solar cell manufacturing facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The facility will be used to exclusively produce solar cells to feed the company’s Goodyear, Arizona solar module manufacturing facility.
The company also stated further expansion in the U.S. was probable. CEO Gunter Erfurt said, ”Meyer Burger is currently working on additional multi-gigawatt offtake agreements in the U.S. with new customers. We are already exploring opportunities to add further solar cell and module production capacity in the country”.
The two cities, separated by a mountain range, are a bit over 800 miles and twelve hours away. Colorado Springs is just over an hour away from the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado.
The manufacturer noted multiple sources of financing for the facility.
First of course, is that solar cells made in the factory are expected to qualify for the advanced manufacturing tax credit 45X, which is part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Meyer Burger says that from the end of 2024 through 2032, the company’s current manufacturing capacity at its solar cell and module factories would manufacture a cumulative sum of hardware that would be eligible for up to $1.4 billion in tax credits.
As part of the IRA, solar cells manufactured in the U.S. earn 4¢/Wdc in tax credits, while solar modules earn 7¢/Wdc in tax credits, totalling 11¢/Wdc for Meyer Burger’s hardware. At 2 GW/year for eight years (including all of 2025 through the end of 2032), a minimum of 16 GW of modules would be manufactured at the facilities.
The company noted additional funding of $90 million was provided from the city of Colorado Springs and the state of Colorado, mainly in the form of tax credits, direct support and discounted electricity and water rates. Meyer Burger said $300 million in prepayments from module offtake partners, as well as funding from the Department of Energy loan program total $300 million.
The prepayments from module offtake partners include funding to cover the operating costs of the facility, purchase price of the components that go into the modules (wafers, glass, aluminum, etc), as well as a floating price on the wafers, which protects both parties in the transaction against the volatile polysilicon market.
The company said the machines used to make the solar cells will be redirected from current plans of deploying this hardware in Germany. This was done to get the U.S. manufacturing facility up and running as fast as possible. The company was recently awarded $224 million by the European Union to develop 3.5 GW of solar cell and panel manufacturing.
Meyer Burger had previously said it was considering solar cell manufacturing in the U.S. after the Internal Revenue Service released their “domestic content” guidance on May 12 – about two and a half months ago. The guidance made clear that in order for a solar module to meet domestic content guidelines and partially qualify a project for the 10% tax credit adder, that the solar cells in the solar modules must be made in the U.S.
The company’s Arizona facility recently announced new solar module offtake agreements that have brought its annual manufacturing capacity goals to 2.0 GW/year as well. Meyer Burger’s module offtake partners include D. E. Shaw Renewable Investments, Ikea, and BayWa r.e..
Meyer Burger has also hinted that there are light talks with residential installation companies Sunrun and Sunnova, however, no other deals are announced at this time. Sunrun & Sunnova, which are primarily residential solar companies, are able to make use of the 10% tax credit adder for domestic content in the residential space – unlike actual homeowners. This is because the commercial and residential tax credits are separate laws within the Inflation Reduction Act, and the residential tax credit doesn’t offer a domestic tax credit bonus.
Thus, these two companies – and any other third party residential asset owner – have a strong business interest to sign an offtake deal for the residential module manufacturing lines in the Arizona Goodyear facility. Currently, these manufacturing lines have no signed offtake agreements in place.
