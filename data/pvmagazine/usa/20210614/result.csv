The acquisition actually became effective in January 2020, but the pandemic and and desire to finalize the development of solar projects in Maryland, California, and Virginia caused the official announcement to be pushed back.
CI Renewables will continue KDC Solar’s operations, including pursuing the development of commercial and industrial solar and renewable projects in select U.S. markets. This includes the company’s pursuit of new solar development opportunities in Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey.
According to the announcement, KDC Solar’s business practices will remain unchanged under CI Renewables, continuing to focus on providing clean energy solutions for companies and institutions with large and complex electric loads greater than 2 MWs, without requiring any capital investment from the customer.
The pulicizing of CI’s acquisition of KDC Solar comes just a week after CI announced financing has been secured for its 29 MW solar portfolio for Howard County, Maryland with CleanCapital. In the near future, the company will also announce the closing of financing for a 10 MW project in Madera, California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/14/how-utilities-can-catch-up-to-a-digitized-decarbonized-future/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,WORLD",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 14, 2021","How utilities can catch up to a digitized, decarbonized future","The utility industry is unprepared for the imminent digitized, decarbonized future, with the sector falling behind as demand for clean energy and electrification requires a workforce and enterprise beyond their current capabilities, according to the EY Power & Utilities Digital Transformation and the Workforce Survey.
159 power and utilities executives, with responsibilities across multiple sub-sectors, including electric, gas, water, and renewables, were asked about how their companies will be adapting to changing consumer expectations for a cleaner energy economy, and how they are planning to invest at least a moderate amount in technology. For both topics, the respondents were also asked if they felt that their workforce was capable of adapting to these changes.
While more than 90% of respondents shared that they will be changing their mix of energy sources over the next several years and see investing in technology and their workforce as a pressing need, these goals both come with unique and difficult-to-address challenges. Most paramount, 52% of respondents shared that the speed at which their organization can move is a major challenge to digital technology adoption, with 40% also citing funding as a major challenge.
A potentially more troublesome 89% of respondents report having too few workers with the right skills to make digital technology adoption viable.
Without funding support and a w0rkforce capable of meeting the challenge, these utilities will have major issues meeting the climate and technology goals being established for the near future. The report highlights the specific hardships that will make it difficult to achieve the European Commission’s goal of at least 30 million zero-emission cars and 80,000 zero-emission trucks to be in operation by 2030.
In recognition of the challenges facing these utilities, EY has developed three strategies to best deliver differentiation, excellence in customer and employee experience, and cost optimization in an evolving energy landscape:
The report likens the difference between “doing” digital operations and becoming a digital-thriving entity to buying a race car: it’s nice to have a fast car, but knowing how to drive it is equally important.  Likewise, utilities must make sure the capabilities and functions of the digital technology they are investing in align with their strategic vision in order to sustain or improve that company’s competitive position in the market.
As for the skills gap, the most universal concern among respondents, the report outlines that closing the gap begins with identifying and prioritizing what skills each business needs to achieve expressed goals and further investments. Planning and implementation must be done at pace across the organization, focusing on cost optimization strengthening workplace culture. The digital revolution will make utilities tech companies as much as they are service providers.
Finally, in order for the two above strategies to work, utilities need to understand that any change made is not singular, and that the effects can influence the entire company. This is why keeping the workforce up-to-date on unified goals and strategies is so important. Being dynamic in challenge identification and the strategies used to overcome obstacles will be critical as technology speeds innovation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/14/hacker-group-revil-claims-responsibility-for-invenergy-data-breach/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,ILLINOIS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 14, 2021",Hacker group REvil claims responsibility for Invenergy data breach,"Chicago-based solar and wind developer Invenergy said that it has been hacked, following a recent trend in energy-data security breaches. Russia-linked hackers “REvil” claimed involvement in the breach.
The attack was reported June 11 and is the latest in a series of hacks claimed on REvil’s dark web site, including recent attacks on Quanta, a Taiwanese supplier of Apple, and JBS, an industrial meatpacker.
In a blog post, REvil claimed to have downloaded 4 terabytes of “sensitive data” from Invenergy, including projects, contracts, and non-disclosure agreements.
It also claimed to have taken “very personal and spicy” details about billionaire chief executive Michael Polsky from his personal computer.  The attack follows a new hacking trend of “extortionware” focusing on reputational damage rather than operationally sensitive information.
Invenergy said that its operations remain unimpacted by the attack, and no data was encrypted. The company said that it did not intend to pay a ransom.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/14/new-tool-aims-to-streamline-fast-charging-ev-station-design/,"EV,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 14, 2021",New tool aims to streamline fast-charging EV station design,"XENDEE Corp. and Idaho National Laboratory launched a Microgrid Fast Charging Station Designer and tested and validated it with two case studies for grid connected and islanded operation.
The project offers a design and validation framework for renewable energy-based microgrid configurations that deliver electric vehicle fast charging, energy security, and value-added grid services. Features are supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Microgrid Program and were built on an existing XENDEE platform.
The designer uses software to create project simulations, financial optimizations, and operational dispatches that aim to maximize system efficiency and capture early returns on investment. The platform also maps cables, transformers, and distributed technology interactions to anticipate and mitigate problems during peak usage or adverse conditions.
The optimizations were tested by INL. During these tests, INL’s simulations — which were based on real-world data from the University of California San Diego campus — concluded that electrical results matched within 5% of the predicted values.
The platform also optimizes dispatch and generation at each time step of the day enabling the microgrid to take advantage of energy sales to a utility and best manage fleet charging under changing hourly conditions. The tool is intended to help operators build microgrid systems, both grid connected and islanded, and to operate them efficiently under supply and demand conditions for fast charging at scale.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/14/sunrise-brief-congress-urges-border-patrol-action-on-forced-labor-allegations/,"FINANCE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 14, 2021",Sunrise brief: Congress urges Border Patrol action on forced labor allegations,"Members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter urging customs officials to “immediately take aggressive enforcement actions” regarding polysilicon products entering the United States from Xinjiang, China.
The letter to acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner Troy Miller was dated June 10 and was signed by two dozen members of the congressional tax writing committee.
The letter complained that the agency has been slow in following up on forced labor allegations and “has yet to take a single enforcement action.” The letter said that customs officials had received allegations in late 2020 and suggested “imminent enforcement action” three months ago. “We believe it is time to act,” the letter said.
The letter said that enough evidence exists to trigger action under Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1307). It called on the customs agency to take “strong action.” Section 307 bars the importation of goods made by convict labor or forced labor.
The site of a former coal plant in New York State could host a 140-200 MW solar array under plans being floated by Applied Energy Services (AES).
The project was first proposed by sPower, which AES acquired in late 2020. Land for the project would be leased from Beowulf Energy.
The project would be reviewed by the Office of Renewable Energy Siting (ORES) committee under the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act, or 94-c, which was passed as a part of the 2020-21 state budget.
Local reports said that approval could come in late 2022 with construction taking place during most of 2023. The project could have an in-service date in 2024.
AES has invested about $2 million into the project, including legal work and engineering, and is investigating the possibility of a Payment in Lieu of Taxes agreement. During its operation, the coal plant where AES intends to build operated under a similar an agreement.
A unit of Greenbacker Renewable Energy bought the 20-MW West River portfolio of pre-operational solar projects from Energy of Utah.
The projects include West River Solar and West River Solar II and have a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with Basin Electric Power.
Both projects are located in Pennington County, South Dakota, home to Mount Rushmore. The projects are near Fall River Solar, an 80 MW solar project Greenbacker bought in late 2020 from the same developer. The West River portfolio is expected to reach commercial operations in December 2022.
With the acquisition, Greenbacker will own around 1.12 GW of generating capacity, including 853.6 MW of utility-scale and distributed solar facilities, 242.6 MW of wind facilities, 16 MW of battery storage, and 12 MW of biomass facilities.
Sunnova Energy International priced its latest securitization of leases and power purchases agreements. The single-tranche securitization consists of $319.0 million in A- (sf) rated 2.58% notes at a 76.4% advance rate, representing a spread to the benchmark swap rate of 140 bps. The A- rated notes carry a weighted average life of approximately 7.46 years through the Anticipated Repayment Date of April 30, 2031 and have a final maturity of April 28, 2056.
The notes are backed by a portfolio of more than 20,900 solar rooftop systems distributed across 18 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Northern Mariana Islands. The weighted average customer FICO score of the customers is around 740. Sunnova said it intends to use the proceeds from the sale to repay financing arrangements of its business units. The transaction is expected to close by June 17, subject to closing conditions.
Quoting state planners, Reuters said that China will no longer grant subsidies for new solar power stations, distributed solar projects by commercial users, or onshore wind projects from the central government budget in 2021.
Electricity generated from the new projects will be sold at local benchmark coal-fired power prices or at market prices, the government statement said. The new rule will take effective August 1.
