Primergy served as engineering, procurement, and construction firm, and will operate the active facility, as well.
Located near Aspen, Colorado on land leased from the Aspen Consolidated Sanitation District, the project was developed with the local landscape in mind. The facility was originally planned to have 18,000 cubic yards of civil work and a 20-foot berm constructed, but Primergy said it was able to eliminate these elements by using efficient and responsible construction practices. A low-touch land management approach allowed Primergy to install the project without having to grade the site, minimizing environmental impacts, the company said.
The site is under a flight path near the Aspen Airport, and abuts a popular pedestrian trail and residential neighborhood, which posed challenges in viewshed requirements and glare concerns. Primergy implemented solar panels with a specialized anti-glare product to address this issue.
The installation featured bifacial panels and single-axis tracking systems.
Primergy also closed on tax-equity financing from Regions Bank.  The company said the bank helped navigate the increasingly dynamic tax equity landscape and deliver expertise in an evolving clean energy market, providing efficient capital solutions.
Oakland, California’s Primergy Solar is a portfolio company of Australian specialist investment manager Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, which has a portfolio of over 19.5 GW of energy assets. Primergy is the developer of the Gemini project in Nevada, a 690 MW solar and storage project that is among the largest solar projects nationwide.

State regulators have chosen to eliminate the fee.
The fee amounted to roughly $100 per year per solar customer It was instituted under the premise that it costs the utility more to provide solar customers with electricity service. The decision to remove the charge is, in large part, due to the efforts of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The organization testified against the charges in October 2020 and December 2020 and showed that solar customers paid their fair share of grid costs compared to non-solar customers.
In addition, SEIA showed the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) that the utility’s claims about increased service costs for solar customers were unsubstantiated.
The decision was a long time coming, especially as regulators had previously shot down attempts by two other state utilities to institute their own grid access charges. In 2018, ACC shot down a similar proposed charge in rate cases for Tucson Electric Power and UNS Electric. In that decision, regulators ruled that the tariff would over-recover costs from solar customers.
At the time of that decision, Vote Solar said that the ruling rejecting the grid access fee could be meaningful as a basis for other decisions. Now, three years later, that prediction has come true.
“The commission showed a lot of leadership on how those studies should be implemented going forward,” said Vote Solar’s Briana Kobor.
SEIA referred to Arizona Public Service’s overturned charge as “outdated” and a “drag on the Arizona solar economy.”

Amp Energy is developing a renewable energy portfolio made up of five separate solar power generation systems at four project sites in central New York State.
The portfolio represents about 40 MW of solar generation capacity and includes three sites with battery storage capabilities.
Founded in 2009, AMP is based in Toronto, Canada with global operations. It has acquired or developed more than 6 GW of renewable power generation since its inception. In January, U.S.-based investment firm The Carlyle Group committed $374 million in financing to the firm.
Renewable power generated by the AMP NY2 portfolio will be fully contracted on completion by a mix of residential and commercial customers. New York Green Bank, a state-sponsored financial entity working to increase investments into New York’s clean energy markets, is sharing in the debt financing for the project.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/29/should-i-include-a-battery-with-my-home-solar-project-part-2-costs-and-savings/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 29, 2021",Should I include a battery with my home solar project? Part 2: Costs and savings,"Attaching a solar array to a home is a long-term commitment, with many considerations, and one that offers great potential for energy bill savings. A recent addition to the list of options is whether or not to attach a battery energy storage system.
A battery can often add $10,000 or more to the total cost of a residential solar system, said EnergySage. But it comes with a range of benefits that vary depending on the home’s electricity needs and experience with the utility company. So, what are the benefits?
In part two of this two-part series, pv magazine reviews the capabilities of batteries beyond backup power, which was covered in part one, and evaluates costs, benefits, and timing.
Without a battery, a grid-tied home solar array will export any unused power directly to the grid in real-time. With a battery, electricity can be charged and discharged in ways that optimize energy bill savings.

Take demand charges, for instance. Some utilities, including providers in Massachusetts, Arizona, and Illinois, charge an additional fee based on the maximum amount of power required over a single hour, or 15-minute period, in a given month. A battery can be scheduled to discharge power during peak use times so that peak energy demand is smoothed, and demand charges are lower.
Utilities also use a billing design called time-of-use, which, similarly to demand charges, are intended to discourage power use during peak demand periods. For example, a utility may charge a lower rate of $0.15/kWh during off-peak hours, and then increase the rate to $0.32/kWh.
With a battery, the home is able to store energy during off-peak hours, which typically occur during the day when the solar array is producing the most. The battery can then export power to the home during on-peak hours, which are often in the evening as people return from work and run appliances and the array produces less power. Without a battery, homeowners are subject to whatever rate is being charged if the array is not actively producing.
A third benefit is the ability of the battery to provide value in utilities without net metering. Net metering is the process of exporting energy to the power grid in exchange for credits that can be used to offset utility bill costs.

Some utilities offer a one-to-one value, meaning each kWh of power sent out will cover one kWh of utility bill costs. Others have a decreased value for net metering. 
For example, power may be billed by the utility at $0.16/kWh, but the value of exported energy only offers a credit value of $0.08/kWh. Other utilities offer no net metering credit whatsoever, like in Hawaii, where battery attachment rates are much higher than the rest of the United States at 80%. Again, in the net metering scenario, batteries are able to store and provide power, limiting exposure to the value loss in poor net metering climates.
A lithium-ion home battery comes with a sizeable price tag, usually around $10,000. Currently, energy storage that is paired with a residential solar system is eligible for the 26% federal investment tax credit.
Certain states and utilities offer additional incentives for including batteries, and in some cases the value adder can make a dramatic difference. The SMART program in Massachusetts, the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) of California, and incentive programs in Maryland and Long Island provide up-front cost relief for batteries.
Programs like ConnectedSolutions of New England offer further savings to homeowners who opt-in to a “bring-your-own-battery” program, wherein an incentive is paid to homeowner who agree to allow their batteries to export power to the grid during times of extreme peak demand.
In addition to the ticket-price of the battery, there may be hardware costs associated, as well. Tesla estimates supporting hardware for the battery costs $1,100, and installation will range from $800 to $2,000. Electrical work like a main panel upgrade may drive costs higher, and some installers will require the customer to cover costs like permit fees or retailer/connection charges, said EnergySage.
Bloomberg’s New Energy Finance reports lithium-ion battery pack prices have fallen 87% from 2010 to 2019. With global supply chains ramping up lithium production due to increased demand (also driven by electric vehicle adoption) it is possible that further price reductions may occur. But is it worth waiting for a cheaper battery?

The answer depends, but in the past, the cost of installing a battery after-the-fact, or “retrofitting”, is dependent on the inverters on the array, said EnergySage. Most home solar arrays are installed with AC-coupled inverters, which would then need to be re-converted by an additional inverter back to DC for use by the battery. This means a retrofitted battery would come with an additional cost of another inverter, plus installation costs.
A solar system with a battery included at initial install can include just one DC-coupled inverter, which reduces costs, and converts and stores energy more efficiently than AC-coupled solutions.
It should be taken under consideration that some installers do not perform battery retrofits altogether.
Inverter companies are actively working to make retrofits easier. For example, Enphase recently released a microinverter that the company said can be retrofit to any type of home energy storage battery without the need for recoupling

The batteries reportedly will be used for the automaker’s Model 3 and the Model Y.
The reports calculated that the 45 GWh would be enough to support production of 800,000 vehicles, which is more than Tesla’s sales through the first three quarters of 2021 (625,000 units). The news outlet pegged the battery capacity of the two models at 55 kWh and 60 kWh.
On October 28, CATL broke ground on a new lithium-ion battery production base in Yichun, east China’s Jiangxi Province. The first phase of the project involves an investment of around $2.1 billion to build a 50 GWh lithium-ion battery production base.
News outlets said that Tesla’s Nevada battery plant is expected to expand production to more than 40 GWh. Additional supplies from Panasonic and LG Chem led the outlet to speculate that global sales for Tesla in 2022 could be around 1.5 million vehicles.
The first LFP-powered Tesla model was the standard-range Model 3 made in its Shanghai factory. Earlier this year, the Shanghai-made standard range Model Y also switched to an LFP battery.
At the end of August, Tesla said that its U.S. customers would have the option of buying an LFP-powered Model 3. And, in reporting its third-quarter financial results in October, Tesla said that it would shift to LFP battery chemistry globally for its standard-range vehicles.
