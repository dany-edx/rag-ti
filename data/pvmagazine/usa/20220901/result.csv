This year’s report found that in 2021, shipments of PV modules rose to a record electricity-generating capacity of 28.8 million peak kW in 2021, from 21.8 million peak kW in 2020.
The shipments represented an increase of 32%, despite module supply issues due to ongoing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent ripple effects through the global economy, including factory shutdowns, component shortages, and steeply increased shipping and materials costs. This growth occurred in the face of international trade issues, including the Hoshine Withhold Release Order (WRO), and antidumping and anti-circumvention tariff threats.
The United States added 13.2 GW of utility-scale solar capacity in 2021, an annual record and 25% more than the 10.6 GW added in 2020. Research from Princeton University and affiliates projects that these figures could reach 50 GW a year by 2024 and by 2031, that number may reach as high as 100 GW of deployment annually.
Small-scale solar installations, those under 1 MW, increased by 5.4 GW in 2021, a 23% jump over 2020’s deployment rate, said EIA. Residential installations had a particularly strong year totaling more than 3.9 GW in 2021, compared with 2.9 GW in 2020.
Representing 46% of the nation’s capacity, the top five states for U.S. solar panel shipments were:
In 2021, the United States had nearly 29 million module shipments. This number was only 320,000 when EIA began reporting it in 2006, and about 3.7 million ten years prior to this report in 2011.
EIA reports 4.2 million modules were manufactured domestically, while nearly 23 million were imported. Export shipments totaled about 1.1 million modules. About 119,000 were purchased from U.S. original equipment manufacturers.
China, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam accounted for 11.3 million modules shipped to the United States. Malaysia accounted for 3.2 million; South Korea, Thailand, and United Arab Emirates nearly 5 million; and “other” nations shipped nearly 3.5 million modules.
Notably, EIA said fewer companies now report on the module shipments “EIA-63B” form due to “company consolidation and changes to strategic planning of companies in the U.S. solar photovoltaic industry.” As a result, EIA’s 2021 report is less detailed to protect confidentiality of company-level data. Data can no longer be published for the specific types of PV cells and modules, or by region.
Domestic supply
In 2021, about 80% of U.S. solar panel module shipments were imports, primarily from Asia. This makeup may be set to change significantly over the next eight years, as the U.S. solar industry eyes a target of 50 GW of manufacturing capacity by 2030.
The Department of Energy (DOE) said, “Greatly expanding U.S. PV manufacturing could mitigate global supply chain challenges and lead to tremendous benefits for the climate as well as for U.S. workers, employers and the economy.” DOE concluded in a study that U.S. production could reach 10 GW in two years, 15 GW in three years and 25 GW in five years on its path to 50 GW annual production.
Currently, the U.S. has capacity to produce materials like metallurgical grade silicon, polysilicon, steel, aluminum, resins, racking and mountings. However, there are significant gaps in the supply chain. United States currently has no domestic solar ingot, wafer or cell manufacturing capacity and only modest capacity to produce solar modules, inverters and trackers, said SEIA. As a result, these segments must be targeted on the path to 50 GW.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has over $60 billion in funds planned to achieve these domestic manufacturing goals, including:
The IRA also includes tax credits across the solar supply chain:
“With long-term incentives for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, the solar and storage industry is ready to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and get to work building out the next era of American energy leadership,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/01/its-no-longer-if-but-how-to-get-to-100-emissions-free-electricity/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022","It’s no longer ‘if’, but ‘how’ to get to 100% emissions free electricity","There are many paths to reach 100% emissions free electricity. We will probably be taking all of them as we build out our nation’s energy future.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has released Examining Supply-Side Options to Achieve 100% Clean Electricity by 2035. The analysis takes a deep dive into multiple scenarios which all include getting to 100% emission free electricity in under 15 years.
NREL concludes that a 90% clean grid will have a low incremental cost, and that it can be built primarily with new wind, solar, storage, transmission, and other existing technologies. However, the last 10% will present financial challenges, requiring research and new technologies.
The lab points to four ‘critical hurdles’ to reach 100%:
Across all of their main scenarios, the lowest cost electricity mix is dominated by wind and solar, which provide most of the generation (60% to 80%). By the end of this decade, solar will require additions of 40 GWac to 90 GWac per year, and wind will require additions of 70 GW to150 GW per year. By 2035, we will need to have added 2 TW of wind and solar combined.

Other accomplishments that must also happen by 2035 include the deployment of 5 to 8 GWs of new hydropower, 3 to 5 GWs of geothermal, and 120 to 350 GW of Diurnal storage (2 to 12 hours of capacity). Hitting these targets will require $330 to $740 billion in overall capital.
Another complex issue is that the models require between 1,400 and 10,100 miles of new high-capacity lines each year, which NREL says will triple the deployment volume rate being installed today.
Solar in the United States will need to massively increase deployment, with installation rates 2 to 8 times that of the 15 GWac capacity that was added in 2020. These future annual installation volumes will be 25% to 110% of the entire capacity installed worldwide in 2020.

NREL sees that 190 GWac of rooftop installations will need to be installed by 2035, with the overall capacity ranging from 540 GWac to 1 TWac. The research group expects pricing to decline between 14-44% by 2030. In 2035, somewhere between 20 to 36% of all electricity will come from solar.
The report suggests that up to 3 million of the nation’s 9.8 million km2 are viable for solar development. If we assume that each MWac of solar power needs 7 acres, then 1 TW of solar would require roughly 6 million acres, or 28,372 km2. That is approximately 3/10th of a percent of the USA’s total land area.
One interesting nuance in the modeling is that a significant amount of existing fossil capacity could be left in place to guard against peaking events. Even though the old infrastructure would rarely be used, generating only 4% of the grid’s electricity each year, the peaking protection would represent a substantial 21% of total capacity. NREL estimates that only 4% of the grid’s generated electricity would come from the old plants. The hope is that by then, we should have a viable carbon capture and storage industry.

The above chart, Figure 19, shows an example scenario and the amounts of capacity (left) versus generation (right).

Naked Energy’s solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) technology decarbonizes the heating of homes and buildings. The company said its technology delivers up to 3.5 times the carbon savings per square meter than other solar technologies. The Naked Energy VirtuPVT collector combines solar PV and solar thermal technology to generate both electricity and heat from a single collector.  The VirtuHOT collector, which generates solar heat only, recently received the gold standard TÜV international certification.
The partnership with ELM will accelerate its move into the U.S. market at a time when clean energy adoption is accelerating due to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.
“The United States is a key market for us and we’re incredibly proud to be working with such an exceptionally professional business as ELM. With their help we’re looking forward to decarbonizing the United States’ heating systems one building at a time,” said Christophe Williams, CEO and co-founder of Naked Energy.
ELM Companies is a specialist in energy storage and microgrids, and it will distribute Naked Energy’s solar thermal and PVT Virtu product range through its new division, ELM Solar, as well as through its large dealer network and partnerships across the United States. It also plans to build a factory to manufacture Virtu products in Texas.
“We’ve seen a significant uptick in interest for renewable energy solutions across the United States. In the face of rising energy prices, we’re pleased to be working with Naked Energy to provide the country with renewable alternatives,” said Lee C Graves, chairman and founder of ELM. “When we were introduced to Naked Energy and the Virtu product range it was a no-brainer for us to work with them. We’re excited to start distributing their innovative solar thermal technology across the United States.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/01/50-states-of-solar-incentives-virginia/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,VIRGINIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Virginia,"Over the last three years, Virginia pivoted its energy policy, centering it squarely on solar and wind energy buildout. The Department of Environmental Quality set a target of 5.5 GW of renewable energy, at least 3 GW of which should be under development by 2022. In the last two years, the state has deployed gigawatt-scale capacity in solar, dwarfing years past.  
Virginia targets 30% renewable energy by 2030, and 100% by 2050. While much of the buildout thus far has been at the utility-scale, the state also has significant incentives for solar and energy storage at the residential and commercial levels. 
Incentives 
Virginia employs a traditional net metering program, meaning a solar customer will receive credit on their bill for any excess electricity sent back to the grid. A full retail rate is paid to all residential customers with systems under 20 kW. Non-residential projects can receive retail net metering up to 1 MW, and agricultural customers up to 500 kW. 
Virginia, like many states, also has a property tax exemption for solar taxes. Although the price of a home will likely rise after going solar, Zillow estimates an average of 4%, property taxes will not be assessed on that value increase. Earlier this year, the residential property tax exemption lifted its system size to 25 kw. 
In 2020, the Virginia Clean Economy Act was passed, which mandates the state via a renewable portfolio standard to have at least 1% of its energy from solar resources. To encourage this, the state set up a solar renewable energy credit (SREC) program. For each megawatt-hour produced by a system, a credit is assigned to a solar customer. Virginia SRECs are currently valued at about $50 a month, and the price ceiling is $75. 
The Virginia Clean Economy Act was a big step for the state’s energy transition. It is expected to create up to 13,000 jobs per year, produce nearly $70 billion in net benefits for residents, and generate up to $3,500 in savings for each household over the next 30 years. It also placed a cap on electric bills, closed loopholes on energy monopolies, and added energy efficiency programs for marginalized communities. 
Federal incentives will further boost the value of solar for Virginians. The Investment Tax Credit was recently extended for the next decade at 30%. The credit also applies to battery energy storage. 
A full list of solar and clean energy incentives can be found here. 
Shared solar? 
Another policy development this year that solar advocates found issue with was the establishment of a “shared solar” minimum bill of $55 a month. Shared solar, similar to community solar, allows customers to sign on for a portion of off-site solar generation when rooftop solar is not a suitable option. The $55 minimum bill is the highest in the nation by a good measure. 
The approved legislation also set the rate for bill credits under the program. Customers are paid $0.11765/kWh; however, customers of Dominion Energy pay upwards of $0.124/kWh for traditional electricity, and rates are steadily on the rise. Generally, community or shared solar programs offer bill savings or at least price parity with the market, but under this program, the economics aren’t particularly attractive to residential customers. 
“We did not pass legislation to create a program that exists in name only,” wrote a group of solar-supportive state senators in a letter to the commission. “(The shared solar program) should be implemented with an underlying assumption that the program needs to work. A competitive shared solar program is a new and exciting frontier for Virginia, and we recommend taking serious consideration of the input provided by industry and advocates with regards to what has proven successful in other markets.” 
Dominion argued the high charge is designed to offset the “cost shift” that non-participants would receive as a result of the program. The company has not yet provided evidence of how much of a cost shift would be borne by non-participants. 
The “cost shift” argument is standard in the monopoly utility playbook for quashing distributed solar projects and third-party participation in their territories. Read about California’s struggle with the cost shift argument and a debunking of its false assumptions here. 
“It is correct that the record does not include evidence that specifies exactly what cost shift would occur under Dominion’s proposed minimum bill, or any of the other proposed minimum bills,” wrote SCC Hearing Examiner Mathias Roussy.
Notable project
Though not yet installed, the most notable project in the state stands to rank among the largest solar facilities in the world. The Randolph Solar project is an 800 MW renewable energy producing titan with an estimated value upwards of $800 million. This July, Officials in Charlotte County, Virginia have voted to grant a conditional use permit to SolUnesco’s planned project, which is set to be developed on a 21,000-acre footprint across the southern portion of the county.
Construction is planned for the second quarter of 2025 and may take a crew of 700 workers up to 2 years to complete. The project is expected to generate $311 million in revenues for the county over its 35 year planned lifespan. While the permit has been granted, SolUnesco still needs approval by the State Corporations Commission, which the company is expecting in 2024, after it has performed environmental impact studies, as well as other pre-construction site and viability assessments.
Deployment 
Solar is increasingly an important part of Virginia’s grid. As of Q1 2022, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports the state has deployed about 3.8 GW of solar capacity. This would rank it 10th in the nation in terms of deployment. It ranked 4th in the nation in 2021, buoyed by utility-scale projects.
The state is home to 179 solar companies, nearly 5,000 jobs, and has invested over $4 billion in solar technology to date, said SEIA. There are 28,095 solar projects installed in the state, and SEIA projects another 4.1 GW will be installed over the next five years. 
There is currently enough solar energy to power over 427,000 homes in Virginia, making its way to the goal of all 3.6 million homes being powered by renewables by 2050.

This investment follows the company’s announcement that it is increasing electric vehicle production. The expanded manufacturing facility will not only provide the needed batteries, but will add 350 jobs, bringing the total employment to approximately 2,100. Scheduled to begin production in 2025, the facility will produce batteries for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and BEVs.
Toyota has a target of 40% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electrified vehicles by 2025, and the target increases to 70% by 2030. This is one step along to path to achieving the company’s goal of zero CO2 emissions from new vehicles by 2050. With the new investment in its North Carolina battery manufacturing facility, the total commitment to advancing its battery production is now $5.6 billion.
“This marks another significant milestone for our company,” said Norm Bafunno, senior vice president, Unit Manufacturing and Engineering at Toyota Motor North America. “This plant will serve a central role in Toyota’s leadership toward a fully electrified future and will help us meet our goal of carbon neutrality in our vehicles and global operations by 2035.”
With an eye toward future technologies, Toyota is exploring fuel cells in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to construct, install, and test a 1 MW proton exchange membrane fuel cell power generation system at the NREL Flatirons campus in Arvada, Colorado. The program is a 3-year, $6.5 million project funded by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office, part of DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/01/the-ira-wont-solve-all-of-our-energy-issues/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,TEXAS",,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022",The IRA won’t solve all of our energy issues,"Houston resident Mohammed Nasrullah bought solar panels for his home in 2020. It was a big investment, but he knew that with the free energy he was getting during the day and the excess that he would send back to the grid, he would be able to pay off his system in a relatively short amount of time. That was until his options vanished for earning bill credit at the same rate that he bought electricity from the grid.
This is a problem plaguing solar homeowners and those interested in installing rooftop solar in Texas.
The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will make solar panels more affordable nationwide through tax credits. That’s great. However, it won’t fix the fact that most Texans, like Mohammed, live in the retail choice electricity market, where they can no longer switch to plans that offer them credit on their electricity bill for the extra energy they produce at the same rate that they buy from the grid (aka a “buyback” plan that mimics net metering). The deregulated electricity market is unique to Texas, and it means that anyone who lives in it (more than 85% of the state), must wade through the quagmire of more than 100 Retail Electricity Providers (REPs) offering different rates to select a plan that fits their needs.
Unlike 37 other states, Texas does not have a net metering policy, meaning it’s up to individual utilities to set how much excess rooftop solar generation is worth. Until late last year, solar homeowners had options when switching to a retail plan that mimicked net metering. Then, rising energy generation and transmission costs drove those plans out of the market, forcing many solar owners to give away their excess generation at a discounted rate.
Many Texans go solar to save money on their electricity bills. Without fair and consistent buyback plan options, it’s hard to predict what a payback period will look like – especially for homeowners that want to offset most of their electricity consumption with solar. There are many homeowners, like Mohammed, who already own solar and thought they would have access to one-to-one buyback plans that no longer exist. Many families made hard economic decisions and now have a payback period that has been pushed further out or is completely uncertain.
Record-breaking summer temperatures and skyrocketing electricity prices have made it clear that Texas needs to rethink its electricity grid. This means addressing electricity demand – like energy efficiency, rooftop solar, batteries, and smart thermostats – with the same fervor that’s being given to energy supply (building new power plants and keeping old, inefficient thermal plants online). While rooftop solar can reduce demand, improve congestion by generating energy close to where it’s needed, and decrease the amount of homes drawing energy from the grid when it’s under strain, the pricing signals are out of sync. The IRA will make going solar more affordable for Texans through tax credits, but homeowners will still need to gamble on what their excess generation will be worth in the future.
Unfortunately, Texas politicians have shown little interest in solving this problem. And until plans that fairly credit rooftop solar are offered, whether through policy or in the market, homeowners’ investments will continue to erode. While many people decide to go solar because of a positive experience from a friend or neighbor, the opposite can also be said; homeowners who feel like they have been baited and switched are motivated to dissuade others from falling into the same trap.
So, if Texas politicians won’t fix the problem, who can?
Texas solar homeowners are taking the matter into their own hands and seeking a market solution. Almost 600 Texans in the competitive electricity market have signed a petition organized by my nonprofit, Solar United Neighbors, to say they would switch to a one-to-one plan if properly credited. The group has put out an RFP to providers and aims to review bids and select a plan this fall. By joining together and leveraging their power in numbers, Texas solar homeowners are proving there is large and growing demand for fair plans, and that they can bend the market to work for them.
Despite the coming influx of clean energy investments through the IRA, and widespread bipartisan support of solar, distributed solar in Texas is hampered by buyback plan options that leave homeowners wondering why they switched to solar in the first place. We all deserve the right to produce our energy and be fairly credited for our generation. Until corrective policies or regulations can solidify the value of solar in Texas, we hope to show that there is consumer demand for fair credit and to continue Texas innovation in advanced energy solutions.
