The clawFR racking system is built in 10-degree and dual-tilt configurations. PanelClaw said the system comes with a single-bolt hardware kit, enables tool-less module attachment, and integrates preinstalled roof protection pads. The equipment, which has been installed in more than 10,000 projects, comes with a 25-year warranty. PanelClaw has deployed over 2 GW of flat roof PV racking to date. 
“We strive to have best-in-class products like clawFR in our warehouses, and it checks all the boxes for our clientele in terms of performance, product support and project growth efficiency,” said Jodi White, co-CEO at BayWa r.e. 
A public training for PanelClaw installers will take place Thursday, Feb. 10 via webinar.
BayWa r.e. is a global developer, service supplier, and distributor that has 4 GW of energy online and 10 GW under asset management. The company also operates as an independent power producer. It is held by BayWa AG, a $19.6 billion global business, and Energy Infrastructure Partners, an energy infrastructure investor.
In November 2021, BayWa r.e. purchased the solar distribution division of Beacon, a publicly traded roofing distributor. Beacon’s business consisted of four dedicated and six shared branch locations where it distributed solar products, including photovoltaic panels, to both residential and commercial contractors. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2021, Beacon Solar Products generated $111 million in net sales, net income of $2.6 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 million.
Adding Beacon Solar increased the number of BayWa r.e. warehouses from six to 16, and the company said the acquisition may reduce delivery times in many parts of the country including many key U.S. solar markets. The combined company will explore offering solar and roofing products nationwide.
Last July, the company inked a 90 MW solar, 70 MW storage power purchase agreement with community choice aggregator (CCA) San Diego Community Power. The not-for-profit CCA will purchase power for 20 years from the BaWa r.e.-built project, sited near SDG&E transmission infrastructure.
As part of the development plan, the project has committed to funding improvements of a local community park, as well as preserving 435 acres of native habitat. The developers said they expect the facility to offset more than 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by the end of its life. Construction is planned to begin in the first quarter of 2023.

Eco Energy World (U.S.), which will be headquartered in New York City.
According to the company, the purpose of the expansion is to capitalise on the Biden Administration’s ambitious decarbonisation targets via project development and acquisition. the company also added that it is specifically targeting greenfield developments.
To date, EEW has developed roughly 1.3 GW of solar capacity across 23 projects located in Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. EEW also boasts a 7.3 GW project pipeline, a figure that the company hopes will rapidly expand following its entry into the U.S.
In November, EEW announced that the company had hit the benchmark of having 290 MW of solar projects in advanced development in Sweden, making it the country’s largest solar power developer. In addition to the the 290 MW, seven-site portfolio of projects in advanced development, EEW also has a 14-project pipeline within the country, totaling 485 MW, as well as 55 MW at the mid-stage of development and 145 MW at the early-stage.
Leading the company’s U.S. branch will be finance and solar industry veteran, Kaveh Ertefai, who will serve as as President of the U.S. business to lead the move into the North American market.
Kaveh’s previous track record in the PV space comes from his roles as CEO of a private equity partnership focused on renewable energy and founder of a solar manufacturing and development start-up, Activ Solar. On the business development side, Kaveh has also held several senior positions at UBS Investment Bank.
In recognition of his announcement, Kaveh doubled down that entry into the U.S. market provides EEW with a significant opportunity to expand its owned under-development project portfolio.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/17/lithium-ferro-phosphate-battery-for-off-grid-solar-and-tiny-homes-unveiled/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CANADA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 17, 2022",Lithium ferro-phosphate battery for off-grid solar and tiny homes unveiled,"pv magazine met with Discover Battery at Intersolar North America in Long Beach, California to view the unveiling of Helios ESS, a lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery with use cases in off-grid solar, tiny homes, and RVs.
The Vancouver-designed battery comes in a 24 V or 48 V design, with 60 Ah and 30 Ah rated capacity, respectively. The 30 lb unit is sized at 10.2 x 7.1 x 10.8 in and has a nominal energy rating of 1.54 kWh.
Up to 20 Helios batteries can be linked in series, which are controlled by Discover’s Lynk II Gateway, a battery management system (BMS) that can dynamically manage charges and perform remote troubleshooting when connected with the internet. The Lynk II can be integrated with major inverters from Schneider, Victron, Sol-Ark, SMA, Studer, and more. The BMS is located in a cabin at the top of the battery unit for ease-of-access. When charged in a closed-loop managed by proprietary BMS, the batteries can be charged 25% faster, said Discover.
Discover said the battery case is designed in-house and fit directly for Discover’s battery cells, making the device stable, especially when used in mobile applications. In remote, cold climates, the Helios battery employs its integrated self-heating layer for optimal performance. The battery also has an on/off switch for flexibility and energy conservation. The device is available now globally, with shipments starting in February.
LFP batteries have a significantly lessened risk of thermal runway compared to conventional lithium counterparts, as they remove the key culprit, cobalt, from the battery chemistry. Helios is UL 1971 certified.
Discover has been making batteries since 1949, and primarily works in the lead-acid space. The team brings 100+ years of combined solar industry experience, using that expertise to create a product that is sensitive to the needs of solar installers and service teams. Remote management via BMS means less truck rolls, and a removable BMS that does not require moving cells prevents the need for shipping lithium when repairs are needed.
Coming down the line for Discover this summer is its Element battery, a 5 kW LFP battery that can also be placed in a series of 20 and managed by Lynk II. This device joins Discover’s workhorse, the AES battery, a 3.0 kWh and 7.4 kWh 48 V unit.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/17/department-of-justice-appeals-itcs-section-201-ruling/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PRODUCTS,CHINA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 17, 2022",Department of Justice appeals ITC’s Section 201 ruling,"On Friday January 14,  the U.S. Department of Justice appealed the U.S. Court of International Trade’s Section 201 ruling that struck down the Trump administration’s effort to raise solar tariffs.
To say that this is a disappointment to the solar industry is an understatement. Back in November of 2021, The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) has determined that tariffs continue to be necessary for U.S. industry producing crystalline silicon PV cells.
In a guest column for pv magazine in November, Brian Lynch, director of solar sales for LG Electronics USA wrote, that opposition to the tariffs in 2018 highlighted the possibility for project cancellations and lost jobs if the tariffs were to be imposed. He wrote that at a macro level, “the solar industry has exceeded every forecast during the period of the tariffs in every category— from megawatts deployed to jobs created.”
(Read “ITC says Section 201 tariffs should be extended”.)
In response to the recent appeal by the DOJ, John Smirnow, General Counsel and VP of Market Strategy for SEIA said, “We are disappointed that the Department of Justice has appealed the Court of International Trade’s ruling. Continuing this legal fight in light of the history of the case is another government misstep in this long and tortured saga and provides no benefit to the American workers, public, or clean energy goals.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/17/puerto-rico-nears-awards-for-800-mw-solar-and-220-mw-storage-toward-multi-gw-goals/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,PUERTO RICO,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 17, 2022","Puerto Rico nears awards for 800 MW solar and 220 MW storage, toward multi-GW goals","Puerto Rico’s utility PREPA has forwarded project bids for 800 MW of utility-scale solar and 220 MW of storage to the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau for approval.
Both the Energy Bureau and the Financial Oversight and Management Board (FOMB) must approve the proposals before contracts are finalized, said PJ Wilson, president of the Solar + Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico (SESA). PREPA said that the offers would also need final approval from PREPA’s executive director and its governing board, Wilson noted.
The Energy Bureau asked PREPA to obtain FOMB approval of the bids, and to forward six more bids for storage projects totaling 445MW, by January 10. PREPA then filed, and requested confidentiality for, a request of the Energy Bureau to provide clarification, among other items, according to an Energy Bureau spokesperson.
SESA’s Chief Policy Officer Javier Rúa-Jovet expressed hope that the competitive bidding process, which yielded 72 bids for about 3 GW of renewables, achieved winning bid prices that will satisfy the FOMB. FOMB was created by the U.S. law known as PROMESA.
The solar and storage bids were in response to the first of six requests for proposals (RFPs) that the Energy Bureau requested in 2020 guidance, which combined would add 3.75 GW of solar or equivalent energy and 1.5 GW of 4-hour battery storage to the island’s grid. The Energy Bureau’s guidance came in an order responding to PREPA’s integrated resource plan. The guidance called for RFPs to be issued every six months from December 2020 through June 2023, so that projects could go online by 2025.
PREPA also has bids totaling 200 MW of virtual power plants (VPPs), Wilson said, and plans to submit those bids to the Energy Bureau by January 30. The VPPs are made up of distributed generation, storage, and demand response resources.
A second RFP is being planned that would target 500 MW solar and 250 MW storage, provided it follows the Energy Bureau’s guidance. Interested parties may register for updates from the RFP’s independent coordinator Accion Group.
Puerto Rico’s new transmission and distribution operator Luma “appears to be making lots of progress” in working through a backlog of thousands of interconnection requests for distributed solar, Wilson said. Luma approved 11,000 rooftop systems totaling 64 MW of solar, said the company’s website, thus cutting the backlog of requests to 4,000 systems totaling 25 MW.
Puerto Rico’s Act 17, enacted in 2019, requires PREPA to reach 20% renewable generation by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050. The Energy Bureau is developing a regulation to implement the law, Wilson said. He noted that each 10% toward the 100% goal could be met by about one gigawatt of solar power.
