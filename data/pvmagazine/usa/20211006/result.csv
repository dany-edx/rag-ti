There are advantages and disadvantages to each, and no single solution is the catch-all for every home and homeowner. 
Under a solar lease, or Power Purchase Agreement, the solar company owns the equipment, and the homeowner owns the power it produces. Customers agree to offset a determined percentage of their overall energy use, and the solar lease payment replaces the money that would have been paid to the utility company.
As you might imagine, when purchasing a system, the homeowner owns the equipment and all the power it produces.

A solar lease often offers upfront savings, reducing the cost per kWh relative to the utility bill. Typically, if upfront savings are the main goal, a solar lease will be offered. However, financing is often available for a solar purchase, so a no-upfront-cost loan structure can be achieved. 
While a solar lease helps avoid any kind of upfront cost, it generally winds up costing more over the 20–25-year life of the contract, said SolarReviews. These contracts are long-term, so it is important the system is properly sized to maximize savings.
An upfront cash purchase will, in most cases, be the cheapest option for going solar. EnergySage said systems can cost between $15,000-$30,000 or more before rebates and incentives. Most cash purchases pay for themselves in savings in five to seven years, and a typical loan breakeven point is hit in a little over eight years. Interest rates usually running about 3-8%, reports EnergySage.
EnergySage said purchases often will save a homeowner about 40-70% on energy bills in the long run; solar leases save between 10-30%.

Rebates, tax credits, and other incentives can reduce total cost by up to 50%, said EnergySage. While it is generally the case that a homeowner owns the rebates and credits in a purchase, and the solar installer owns them in a lease, the benefits of these cost reductions can be available in both arrangements.
Often, solar installers will manage rebates and incentives for the customer, and the price reduction is built into the contract. This is true for both leases and loans. If it is important for the homeowner to take in a tax credit directly, then purchasing is the best option.
Solar maintenance agreements vary widely company-to-company, and contracts should be read closely to understand what is covered. Often, when purchasing a solar system, the maintenance and monitoring of the system is the homeowner’s responsibility. Sometimes solar companies will offer an additional maintenance protection program with a cash purchase or loan.

A solar lease is more often coupled with a complete maintenance package for the length of the term. Many solar companies offer performance guarantees, meaning they either have to keep the equipment producing at the level promised, or the homeowner will be paid for any shortcomings in production.
Thankfully, solar is relatively low-maintenance, said SolarReviews. The life of a solar panel can be well over 25 years, and typically inverters are the first major component to cause downtime or failures.
When a solar system is owned, it is considered an improvement to the home, and increases home value. Zillow reports homes with solar sell for an average of 4.1% more, and that they leave the market 20% faster.
By contrast, a solar lease does not increase a home’s value directly. The entire agreement can typically be transferred over to the next homeowner. If the buyer is not willing to take on the lease contract, the seller usually has the option to buy-out the solar system, and then recoup that cost in the sale of the home. This can make selling a home with a solar lease more difficult in some cases, said Forbes.
If long-term savings and the flexibility to sell the home unabated are of chief priority, then a purchase may be the best option. If a low-maintenance, turnkey solution that provides savings day one is an appealing arrangement, then a solar lease may make the most sense.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/06/sandia-offers-public-access-to-csp-archives/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 6, 2021",Sandia offers public access to CSP archives,"The Energy Department’s Sandia National Laboratories has created a global archive of concentrated solar power (CSP) documents, which it is making fully accessible to the public.
Sandia has been studying utility-scale solar power since the 1960’s. Its National Solar Thermal Test facility was commissioned in 1978, spurred by the oil crisis of 1973. Documents detailing the design, construction, and research conducted at the multi-megawatt CSP facility had been shelved in backrooms and basements.
CSP uses large mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver tower to generate electricity. Sandia’s team has spent the last few years cataloging the history of the technology, organizing reports, blueprints, photos, among other items.
“A lot of ‘what if’ questions can be answered if you look at what was documented back in the day,” said Ken Armijo, project lead and CSP researcher at Sandia. 
In addition to tens of thousands of Sandia documents, the lab sourced information from collaborators in Australia, South Africa, Germany, and the U.S. Department of Energy.
Armijo said that successful research projects are often shared widely in the research community through peer-reviewed papers, presentations, and reports, but unsuccessful projects are often be shared more quietly and reluctantly. The knowledge of failures can be lost when a researcher retires, which may lead to the repeat of mistakes by new researchers. The archive aims to serve to address these knowledge gaps.
Some of the projects in the archive include the Solar One, a Sandia-led 10 MW CSP project that delivered power to Barstow, California from 1982 to 1986. It was upgraded in 1995 to the Solar Two, which used a high-temperature molten-salt receiver to store heat and convert it to electricity after the sun set.
Now, the lab has received a $25 million award from the DOE to build a third-generation, particle-based CSP plant with expanded storage capacity. Documents from the archive could inform the construction of the plant.
The archive project is funded by the Department of Energy Solar Technologies Office and was kicked off by Chuck Andraka, a retired Sandia engineer. Sandia said it is interested in creating archives for other renewable energy technologies, as well.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/06/this-yacht-sets-sail-with-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 6, 2021",This yacht sets sail with solar,"Baltic Yachts began delivery in July of its Baltic 146 Path, which includes an 8,714 watt solar rooftop and energy storage system designed by Solbian Solar using the company’s walkable solar modules.
Recently, some of the yacht’s technical work has been shared online. Built from 1,742 monocrystalline solar cells, many of the 86 solar panels were custom cut to fit the deck’s shape by the Solibian team in Italy. The units were based on the company’s Super Rugged (SR) Series.
The SR series has solar cell busbar technology developed by Merlin Solar. In one video, the Merlin team drives over the solar panel, throws bags of cement on it, and even shoots it with a bow and arrow in an effort to prove the product’s resilience. The company said its busbar technology makes this kind of abuse possible.
The 60 square meters of solar panels produces 30-50 kWh of energy per day. The company said that’s enough to power all of the onboard electronic equipment–including navigation, autopilot, lighting, and entertainment–for around seven hours.
Once the sun goes down, a Mastervolt MLI 44kWh LiFePO4 battery pack allows the diesel generator mostly to stay off, providing generally silent operation for 14-18 hours.
Baltic Yacht’s solar system is roughly half the size of the Silent 60’s 16.8 kWdc solar plus storage system. The Silent 60 is a solar-propelled yacht less than half the lengthBaltic yacht and price, which reaches 6-8 knots on solar power alone. The Path does not feature electric propulsion and therefore relies on diesel engines when the wind dies down.
Since the Path uses a sail for propulsion, the team installed 154 bypass diodes and 12 solar panel strings and trackers – Mastervolt SCM-60 MPPTS – in an effort to maximize power output and minimize the effect of the sail’s shadows on the panels. The entire solar system, including wiring, controllers and small parts, weighs less than 300kg, the company said
The 146 Path has an overall length of 146 feet. The yacht can accommodate eight in addition to the ship’s owner, as well as eight crew members. Path carries two tenders, an 8hp Torqeedo electric outboard-powered RIB, and a 6.5m twin-engined RibEye. There are also two ultra-lightweight Reverso Match sailing dinghies.
When the front tender is deployed, its storage container can be turned into a pool.
The ship’s main diesel engine is a 405kW (550hp), six-cylinder Scania. The specific model isn’t listed, however the “DI13 092M IMO Tier III, EU Stage IIIA” lines up with all of the stats and looks like the unit in a video of the engine being installed.
The owner’s suite includes a sleeping cabin, and an en suite lounge with a glass divider doubling as a movie, tv, and sailing information screen. An upper lounge features a 2.7m-long video wall.

The solar-plus-storage facility is intended to support Eaton’s Las Piedras circuit breaker manufacturing plant, lessening the company’s reliance on the island’s energy infrastructure.
Enel said it will finance the project under an energy-as-a-service model, shifting Eaton’s investment in the microgrid system from capital to an operational expense. Eaton said it will provide expertise in installation, as well as supplying some system components, including the microgrid controller and plant electrical distribution equipment.
The Las Piedras microgrid will integrate nearly 5 MW of solar PV and about 1.1 MW/2.2 MWh of battery storage into the facility’s onsite power generation systems. Together with the Arecibo microgrid, the two facilities are planned to contribute 10 MW of solar PV, and 2.23 MW battery storage by 2022.

The Enel X distributed energy resources optimization software will manage the system to maximize project value across applications that include bill savings, incentive programs, and grid services.
The project will be constructed to withstand Category 5 hurricane-force winds. Large-scale power outages on the island have increased 67% since 2000, said Climate Central. Microgrids offer backup power when the grid is down, and can balance when, where, and how electricity is stored. When grid power is restored, microgrids can provide added value by delivering renewable energy and reducing stress on the grid.
“As extreme weather caused by the climate crisis becomes the new normal, commercial and industrial businesses need to adopt an integrated energy strategy and solutions that are both resilient and sustainable,” said Surya Panditi, head of Enel X North America.
Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau has set targets of 3,500 MW of solar and 1,500 MW storage by 2025.

The company warned the event will also affect output from its downstream cell and module production facilities in Southeast Asia.
The memo was dated October 4 and was sent by one of the manufacturers’ senior U.S.-based executives. pv magazine USA has asked the executive to confirm the memo’s authenticity and will withhold the company’s name until confirmation is received.
The memo said that in order to recover from the effects of the “potential Force Majeure event,” it may delay or stop equipment delivery or seek to renegotiate contracts to pass  through higher prices.
Rapid growth of domestic power demand in China has been blamed for a national electric power supply shortage. The National Development and Reform Commission of China mandated a “dual control of energy consumption” policy, forcing industries with high energy consumption to reduce or stop production.
The solar manufacturer’s memo said that key solar materials, including aluminum, glass, metallurgical-grade silicon and other commodities “are now in short supply.”
As the winter heating season gets underway, shortages of electricity and raw materials are expected to further intensify, the memo said.
The manufacturer said that it was negotiating with local governments in an effort to reduct the impact of power rationing and maintain normal operations. The company said it expected coal power supply constraints and energy demand to ease in the first half of 2022 allowing industrial production in the affected provinces to resume.

Terms were not disclosed.
Once in service, the Vikings Energy farm will be among the first solar peaker plants in the United States.
The facility’s configuration – 150 MW of solar, coupled with 150 MW/600 MWh of battery energy storage – enables it to shift daytime solar production to late afternoon and evening hours, providing on-peak energy.
In late September, Arevon said that it bought a 2 GW/6 GWh supply of Tesla Megapacks through a master supply agreement. Arevon said it anticipates to install 250 MW/1,000 MWh of Tesla Megapack energy storage systems in California and Nevada by the end of the year.
