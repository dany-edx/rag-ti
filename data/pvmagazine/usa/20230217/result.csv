Power Authority office,"A first-of-its-kind energy storage system using that provides cellular isolation in lithium-ion batteries has been opened at a New York municipal power authority’s office.  This week the New York Power Authority unveiled a 50 kW / 250 kWh demonstration system at its White Plains, N.Y. offices, that uses a cell-isolating technology from Cadenza Innovation, a Danbury, Conn.-based startup company.
The New York project is demonstrating a peak energy demand shaving function that reduces the peak electricity load in commercial buildings. The pilot project will also help advance New York State’s nation-leading climate and clean energy goals, including Governor Kathy Hochul’s recently announced plans for a framework to achieve 6 GW of energy storage resources by 2030.

Following an April 2019 battery fire at Arizona Public Service’s McMicken site in Surprise, Ariz., states including New York have adopted stringent requirements for lithium-ion battery installations.
Cadenza’s SuperCell is produced with funding assistance from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and is designed with fire safety in mind. The battery technology prevents a ‘thermal runaway,’ meaning a malfunction in the cell is isolated to that one cell and is not expected to propagate into surrounding cells that make up the battery in the event of overheating or fire. The SuperCell’s safety feature enables energy storage systems to be installed into more densely populated urban areas.
Deployed adjacent to NYPA’s White Plains offices and funded in part with a $1 million award through NYSERDA’s Innovation program, the Cadenza battery system was developed in collaboration with Hitachi Energy to highlight the role of energy storage in enhancing demand management and grid flexibility.  The battery project is projected to serve as a model for integrating low-cost, high-performance and thermally safe renewable energy resources into the grid.
“This initial testing phase shows the potential for this type of battery energy storage system to serve as a model for managing energy demands and lowering costs for owners of commercial and industrial buildings,” said NYPA president and chief executive officer Justin Driscoll. “The unit is reducing peak loads at the Power Authority’s main offices, smoothing electricity network operations and showing a safety advantage by demonstrating a reduction in the potential of thermal runaway.
Cadenza’s battery is U.S. Department of Defense tested UL compliant. The superCell’s design bolsters grid resilience and powers a range of uses in the commercial and industrial market. By packaging components to lower costs and increase safety, the battery is designed to reduce the need for additional fire safety protection and mitigation systems, resulting in improved energy density and advanced lithium-ion systems.
Under New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), the state has pledged to generate 70% of its power resources from renewable energy by 2030 and become net zero by 2040. Governor Hochul recently proposed expanding New York State’s energy storage programs to double the goal to 6 GW by 2030, which represents at least 20% of the state’s peak electricity load.
BloombergNEF (BNEF) has forecast the global energy storage market to increase 15-fold by 2030 and “expects batteries to dominate the market at least until the 2030s, in large part due to their price competitiveness, established supply chain and significant track record.”  Bloomberg NEF’s Helen Kou recently told pv magazine USA that 54 GW of Inflation Reduction Act-driven storage will lift the U.S. to 112 GW/396 GWh this decade.  BNEF’s post-IRA forecast includes 2.5 GW of added storage capacity in New York through 2030 that would have not been added without IRA incentives such as the standalone storage ITC credit.
Founded in 2012, Cadenza Innovation has raised $15.5 million in growth funding to date from investors that include Turtle & Hughes, an electrical contractor, the U.S. Department of Energy, Kestrel Holdings, Golden Seeds, Toba Group and private investors.

The event, held Feb. 14 to 16 at the Long Beach Convention & Entertainment Center, is dedicated to advancing the clean energy transition. It featured four keynote addresses, the third annual Solar Games installer competition, and valuable distributed energy panel sessions and networking opportunities. Diversified Communications, the event organizer, reported after the conference that they welcomed over 8,000 solar + storage professionals and hosted 400+ exhibitors.
FranklinWH Energy Storage Inc., a specialist in whole-home energy management, saw throngs of visitors at its booth on the exhibit floor. The San Jose, Calif.-based company was demonstrating its residential battery system, which has shown a five to 15 minute commissioning time.
The company’s energy storage system debuted over a year ago and is made in Shenzhen, China. The system integrates a 13.6 kWh lithium iron phosphate “aPower” battery with adaptive learning, part of the aGate smart control system. FranklinWH reports the battery is compatible with any PV inverter technology, and it can connect with existing solar systems while scaling up to 15 units for a total of 204 kWh of capacity. In the event of a power failure, its “black start” feature creates a micro-grid for the home.

Nearby, electric panel startup SPAN.io Inc., also headquartered in San Francisco, was showing off an EV charging plug interconnected with its digital and off-grid electric panel system, housed in a mobile tiny house trailer. The company reports that it enables residential electrification without replacing infrastructure like wires and transformers.
Unlike a traditional electrical panel, SPAN provides circuit-level control and digital real-time usage to energy consumption at the appliance level of the house. When paired with solar and storage, makes the home self-reliant and sustainable during a power outage by enabling  flexible backup. At Intersolar the SPAN panel was paired with Enphase home battery systems and can also be paired with Tesla Powerwall, among others.  The SPAN panel retails for $4,500 before professional installation and tax.
Among new EV solutions debuted at Intersolar was Enteligent’s EV Fast Charger, a 25 kW home and commercial-scale DC to DC charging port which allows daily charging directly from solar generation. Without the conversion of solar photovoltaic energy from DC to AC at the grid level first, Enteligent’s wall-mount and ballast configurable charger adds back 13 to 20% of lost energy from traditional AC home charging systems.  The small charger is about the size of traditional home EV chargers and doesn’t require additional batteries or electrical infrastructure upgrades.
The company’s chief executive officer Sean Burke told pv magazine USA that the first Enteligent fast chargers will be delivered in Q3 2023. The company recently closed on a $7 million Series A round from NOVA, the venture arm of Saint-Gobain, and Taronga Ventures, a real estate technology investor.

Utility-scale innovation
Across the exhibit hall at Intersolar North America, a number of utility solar operations and maintenance solutions vendors were showing off their solutions. After Zeitview (formerly Dronebase) showed its new North American Solar Scan, an asset rating system for utility solar projects, it was easy to see the value in O&M solutions at Intersolar.
Two such firms, Bird Control Group and RST CleanTech, are literally removing the crap from dirty panels in coastal regions or areas with regular migratory birds.
Using the Avix Autonomic laser system, Bird Control Group provides a 5,000-hour, 360-degree green laser gun that is mounted on a tripod or racking system adjacent to a solar project. The laser senses incoming birds in its periphery and deters birds from flying above or around solar systems, providing a 90% reduction in birds and bird poop from reducing the efficiency of solar panels within a range of 1,640 yards, just shy of one mile.
Ihor Mulyck, sales manager at Bird Control Group, told pv magazine USA that the laser systems were developed by its Danish parent company, and typically sell for $15,000, including installation and O&M services.
Matt Casey, owner of RST North America, the U.S. business of Israel-based RST Cleantech Solutions, said RST sells and maintains a sprinkler system network that cleans 2 million solar PV panels each day across systems that average 20 MW per project.
RST’s sprinkler mounted on PV modules improves efficiency by up to 35%, and Casey told pv magazine USA that many of its commercial and industrial customers have assets more than a decade in service that are performing at peak performance. Using a mobile phone application, RST’s sprinkler systems are deployed on panels to discharge water to clean panels during the night time, with projects routinely cleaned about every 10 to 14 days to maintain efficiency.
“Without cleaning, it’s like buying a movie ticket and not going to the movie performance,” Casey said about the U.S. solar market that has not yet fully embracing solar cleaning solutions. “There’s a real gap in solutions. EPCs [engineering, procurement & construction] just want to install projects and not worry about anything else.”
The Israeli company reports that it cleans approximately 40% of the Middle Eastern country’s PV systems, and Casey said the company expects to achieve a similar metric in the U.S. in the coming years. In addition to its sprinkler nozzle and tubing system being evaluated for inclusion in solar investment tax credit status, Casey said RST’s systems are beneficial to agrivoltaic system usage, as its water-based cleaning systems use no chemicals, are deployed overnight using water conservation, and excess water flows to the ground level to water plants or nearby bushes or shrubs.
Outside the Long Beach Convention Center, Nevados Engineering’s All Terrain Tracker was on display, equipped with First Solar Series 6 modules. The Nevados tracker provides for ground-mounted installations at slopes of up to 37% in any direction, allowing for 96 modules to be installed in a single row. The trackers are designed to fully eliminate site grading constraints in projects with uneven terrain. This avoids time and cost-intensive permitting, construction, and revegetation steps, and accelerates project schedules, according to a product circular.
The All Terrain Tracker system’s torque tube and damper designs improve wind performance and has been tested at hurrican force winds of 80 miles per hour.
Mark your calendars: Intersolar North America and Energy Storage North America 2024 returns to San Diego, Calif. next year, taking place January 17 to 19, 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/17/over-25-gw-of-solar-is-actively-being-constructed-in-the-u-s/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CALIFORNIA,FLORIDA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 17, 2023",Over 25 GW of solar is actively being constructed in the U.S.,"Viewing the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) monthly update of capacity additions, it is clear that the energy transition is well underway. Nationwide, projects listed as actively under construction total over 25.4 GW in capacity. This adds to the 107.5 GW of existing solar on the U.S. grid that exists today, as reported by the EIA. 
Small-scale solar projects of 1 MW or less total an estimated 39.5 GW nationwide, while utility-scale projects above that threshold total nearly 68 GW, reports EIA. 
There are currently 366 utility-scale projects actively being built across the U.S. as of the most recent EIA data release. The average size of these projects is 69 MW. Of this total, 166 projects are listed as 50% complete or more, adding 10.2 GW of capacity. 
The largest project under construction is Gemini Solar, developed by Primergy, a Quinbrook Infrastructure company. This project will add 690 MW to the Nevada grid once complete. The next seven largest projects are all located in Texas, averaging 405 MW in capacity.  
Texas is a dominant state for utility-scale solar project construction, with 28 projects totaling 6.7 GW in capacity, with about 240 MW as an average project size. The state’s largest active project is 500 MW. 
Florida is making significant headway in the utility-scale project construction space. Just under 5 GW of capacity is currently being installed across 68 projects, averaging 73.4 MW in size. Notably, project designs are very uniform in Florida, with 65 of these projects ranging from 74 MW to 75 MW in capacity. 
California follows with 3.2 GW of projects actively under construction, with a greater emphasis on distributed projects. EIA reports 45 projects underway with an average nameplate capacity of 75 MW. The state’s largest active project is 300 MW. 
Another 1.96 GW of projects nationwide have been fully constructed and are awaiting final approvals to reach commercial operation. There are 48 projects that fall into this bucket, averaging 41 MW in capacity. Eight of these projects are 1 MW solar facilities in Minnesota, a market known for its standout performance in community solar projects of this size. 
Solar energy is now in the center stage of the U.S. plans for a decarbonized economy, representing 70% of high-probability utility-scale power capacity planned through 2025.   
Solar’s rise to the top as a key energy resource now seems inevitable, but its fate was not always sealed. The technology contributed a negligible amount of power less than ten years ago, and the EIA did not begin reporting annual net generation of PV until 2014. In that year, solar contributed 27 TWh of electricity to the U.S. grid. Seven short years later, it generated 164 TWh in 2021, multiplying generation six times over. 
This progress has been made possible by supportive industrial policy, economies of scale, improved technological efficiencies, and business innovations. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) has fallen over the years, and the benefits of solar and energy storage become more crystalized as the threats of climate change increase with the passing years. 
Looking ahead, project construction is expected to continue to accelerate. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures and calls for a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. Princeton University released a Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT) in collaboration with Dartmouth College, Evolved Energy Research, and Carbon Impact Consulting, outlining the potential impact of the law. 
The impact on the U.S. solar industry could be huge, to say the least. The Princeton report said solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said Princeton. 
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The IRA would lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said the report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/17/energy-storage-as-a-transmission-system-asset/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,CALIFORNIA,CHILE,GERMANY,LITHUANIA,UNITED STATES,WESTERN EUROPE",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 17, 2023",Energy storage as a transmission system asset,"With the pace of energy storage already ramping up in standalone and solar-plus-storage projects, few outside of the development community have focused on deploying storage systems on the generation and distribution side of the grid to unlock transmission and distribution capacity. 
Speaking on a panel entitled, “Energy Storage as Grid Assets: Expanding Transmission Capacity to accelerate renewable growth” at Intersolar North America in Long Beach, Calif., industry panelists pointed to international storage projects that could be replicated in high penetration distributed generation regions such as California.
Under this innovative process, one battery system is installed next to a solar project and another is installed at the end of the transmission corridor, close to an urban center, for instance. This provides a large boost of grid storage capacity in the range of hundreds of megawatt hours.
Andrew Gilligan, director of commercial storage at Fluence Energy, said his company has been developing a large 250 MW Netzbooster (Grid Booster) project in Germany with partner TransnetBW that provides this exact “storage-as-transmission” system.
With high wind resources in northern Germany and a large industrial concentration in the middle and southern regions of the country, government energy authorities sought a storage-as-transmission solution “to better utilize the existing transmission and distribution system,” Gilligan said.
The 250 MW battery-based energy storage system supplied by Fluence, will be located at Kupferzell, a major grid hub in Baden-Württemberg, part of Germany’s industrial region, and is scheduled for completion in 2025. The project is designed to reduce operating costs of Germany’s transmission system. The Grid Booster project will lower the number of required preventive measures in system operation, while also increasing the use of the electricity grid, thus reducing the need for traditional alternating current (AC) network reinforcement and expansion, said Gilligan.
Jackson Salovaara, vice president of strategy at SB Energy, a solar developer backed by SoftBank, said the Grid Booster example reflects multiple application uses in the grid transmission and distribution capacity for energy storage. Historically people have associated storage with coupling just with solar at the generation point.
Gilligan, Salovaara and Gabe Murtagh, storage sector manager of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), all agreed that energy storage placed at two interconnection points provides a great way to avoid transmission costs in markets that resemble Germany. They used California as an example, with its high remote renewable energy resources and densely populated regions within a few hundred miles.
In addition to the standalone investment tax credit from the federal Inflation Reduction Act that can be applied to energy storage projects starting this year, Murtagh said storage provides additional revenue streams than just standard power purchase agreement mechanisms, such as “rate-basing over time.”  Justin Boose, a partner at Holland & Knight, said his firm has routinely seen the terms “storage as a transmission asset” and “storage as a merchant power asset,” showing the new use cases and ability to monetize distributed generation resources such as storage assets.
Nevertheless, Gilligan was first to acknowledge that outside of California, the U.S. utility market continues to lag in the global energy storage development market compared to countries like Germany, Chile and Lithuania, among other parts of Europe affected by natural gas and spiking energy prices from the Russia-Ukraine War.
“You can’t make multiple use case examples for a power transmission line,” said Boose, highlighting use cases of storage such as merchant power, energy arbitrage, and contingency events such as during California’s wildfire season.
New markets for energy storage in the U.S. include the Southeast, where the “vertically integrated utility” market and new developments of utility solar projects create good opportunities to add storage in additional places near pockets of high populations and industrial activity, said Fluence Energy’s Gilligan.
The passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022 has spurred a boost in forecasted capacity for energy storage to 55 GW, which BloombergNEF has forecast through 2026, while Wood Mackenzie analysts have forecast about 65 GW of new installed capacity in the same timeframe.
CAISO’s Gabe Murtagh said this week that California is forecast to deploy 2 GW of energy storage assets per year for the coming years, a clip on par with the historic rate of solar installed in the state, or about 1.5 GW per year. This past summer CAISO saw 6 GW of installed storage capacity feeding into its grid, of which 5.2 GW was four-hour duration lithium-ion systems, Murtagh said.
With daily peak prices increasing across the board, SB Energy’s Salovaara said, “the hour we’re worrying about is 8 p.m.,” in response to a question about the energy storage market using new resources from long-duration systems such as flow batteries, which provide 6 to 12-hours of power dispatch, after solar resources are inactive during the day.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/17/50-states-of-solar-incentives-north-dakota/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NORTH DAKOTA",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 17, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: North Dakota,"Solar is about as rare as a sasquatch siting in North Dakota, with only 1.1 MW of total solar capacity installed to-date, according to the Energy Information Administration. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates this to be a bit higher at 2 MW, which is equivalent to the electricity demand of under 150 homes. 
About $3 million has been invested in solar in the state, said SEIA. Over the next five years, SEIA expects North Dakota to take its first real steps in solar adoption, adding 508 MW over that span. Most of the state’s renewable energy capacity comes from wind power, which provides 4.3 GW of capacity to the grid. 
Incentives 
State law requires investor-owned utilities to offer net metering to solar customers. Net metering involves crediting a customer bill for sending excess solar production to the grid.  
In North Dakota, the rate is based on the “avoided cost” to the utility, a location and time-based calculation that generally results in a rate far lower than the retail rate paid by customers. Due to this, to avoid value losses, solar customers should size their systems to cover daytime energy usage or attach a battery to store solar production for nighttime usage. 
Like many states, North Dakota offers a property tax exemption for solar, meaning it will not increase property taxes despite increasing the assessed value of a home. Like all states, North Dakotans can access the federal investment tax credit, which covers 30% of installed system costs. The tax credit has been extended through the next ten years, and now offers a direct pay option, making the benefit available to solar adopters that do not have a large tax appetite. 
Residents of rural areas in North Dakota may be interested in the USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grants. Available to agricultural producers with at least 50 percent of their gross income coming from agricultural operations, and small businesses in eligible rural areas with populations less than 50,000, the program funds various renewable energy technologies, including solar. 
The REAP program offers loan guarantees on loans up to 75 % of total eligible project costs, grants for up to 40% of total eligible project costs, and combined grant and loan guarantee funding up to 75% of total eligible project costs. REAP loans approved in Fiscal Year 2023 will receive an 80% loan guarantee. Grants are capped at $1 million for renewable energy and $500,000 for energy efficiency. 
Notable project 
A Tribal community in North Dakota accessed a $200,000 grant from the Tribal Solar Accelerated Fund to install a 50 kW rooftop solar array on a 65,000 square foot main campus building at Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College. 
The project was built in partnership with Lightspring Solar and Native Brothers, and participation from Mountrail-Williams Electric Cooperative. The project was motivated by a sustainability and environmental science program at the college. 
“Not only is it just good sense business-wise and energy-wise for the college, it’s also got the education piece to it,” said Jennifer Jenecek-Hartman, vice president of campus services. 
Wes Davis, Lightspring Solar project manager said this installation is just the beginning for North Dakota. 
“The economic stimulus package from the Biden administration has given us the opportunity to build better infrastructure,” said Davis. “It opens up the door for homeowners, contractors and business owners to apply for these grants — and tribal governments.” 
“I believe this year, 2023, is going to be a huge leap year for renewable energy on tribal nations. And I just want to be a part of that and I want to give back to my people,” he said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/17/the-outstanding-success-of-solar-on-new-homes-in-california/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",BRIAN SAVAGE,"FEBRUARY 17, 2023",The outstanding success of solar on new homes in California,"Between 2011 and 2021, approximately 1.1 million new homes started construction across the United States each year, and those rates are only expected to continue to grow. These buildings are one of the largest sources of emissions.
The IEA found that in 2021 the operation of buildings accounted for 30% of global final energy consumption. This means that achieving carbon neutrality in the future will require steps that must be actively taken today. A February 2023 report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory looks at how new homes built with solar provide a ready-made option to achieve these goals.
By assembling a dataset across all new homes and most existing homes through 2020 with solar, where address data was available, the Berkeley Lab found that California had achieved groundbreaking levels of solar adoption.
This success is thanks in large part to state policy. From 2007 to 2018, the California New Solar Home Partnership (NSHP) provided incentives to encourage the adoption of solar on new homes. NSHP offered cash rebate incentives for building new solar homes in the three investor-owned utility (IOU) service areas including Pacific Gas & Electric Company, San Diego Gas & Electric Company, and Southern California Edison.  These incentives ranged from $0.50 to $1.25 per watt over the period and were not additional to other incentives available at the time in California.
This policy helped push new home solar penetration to an average of about 40% across California. Of particular note are counties like El Dorado, Placer, Tulare, and Yolo, which exceed 60% solar penetration rates. The report found penetration rates across counties were strongly correlated to areas where NSHP incentives were available and within IOU areas. For example, IOU areas of the state had 50% new solar home penetration rates while non-IOU areas were less than 5%.
 
Building upon NSHP incentives, the California Solar Mandate required all new homes to have solar energy systems, with few exceptions, starting in Jan. 1, 2020. Outside of California, the peak adoption rates were just 4% in Arizona, 3% in Nevada, and on average about 0.5% across the rest of the United States. Before 2020, there were 18,511 new solar homes in California compared to only 794 new solar homes in other states. Few policies exist across the US that specifically target new home solar, which explains some of California’s success.
Outside of policy, the strongest correlate driving deployment was the size of market share of the builders involved. As seen above, the top-10 or top-25 largest California builders in the new home market share, for both solar and non-solar, had much higher levels of new solar home deployment. The report found that larger builders were more likely to have the capacity to adapt their practices and to hire new people with experience with solar to utilize the incentives.
When analyzing other variables such as average retail electricity rate, home value, median income levels, and population density the report found relatively weak correlations in comparison to the effects of California’s NSHP program and builder market share. Outside of California, larger builders were not associated with increases in new solar home construction.
Beyond policy, and builder market share, there were important differences in the characteristics among solar and non-solar new homes. The report found that the system size for new home solar was typically smaller, around 4 kW on average compared to 6 kW for installations on existing homes. New homes also had lower battery attachment rates and were more likely to be owned by a third party, like a solar lender.  When it comes to the cost of solar systems on new homes, it is comparable to existing homes, but smaller systems benefit less from economies of scale.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/17/us-scientists-improve-photoresponsivity-in-solar-perovskite-by-250/,"RESEARCH,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 17, 2023",U.S. scientists improve photoresponsivity in solar perovskite by 250%,"Scientists led by the University of Rochester in New York state have considerably reduced electron recombination processes in lead-halide perovskites (LHPs) used for solar cell applications. Recombination can have a significant impact on electrical performance in perovskite cells, with implications for open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, and ultimately, power conversion efficiency.
The researchers used what they call a “physics-based method” to create a film based on a type of LHP known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). They deposited that directly on a plasmonic substrate made of hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) with a high local density of state, via spin coating. They fabricated the multi-layered HMM with four pairs of alternative 10 nm thick layers made of silver, aluminum sulfate, and ozone (Ag-Al2 O3) by electron beam evaporation.
“The metal layer serves as a mirror, which creates reversed images of electron-hole pairs, weakening the ability of the electrons to recombine with the holes,” the scientists said, noting that they used a momentum-resolved imaging technique to characterize the film’s transition dipole orientation, which is the key factor enabling control over exciton recombination processes.
They claim that the interaction between the in–plane dipole of the LHP and its image formed on plasmonic substrate results in a tenfold decrease in the recombination rate, without any chemical treatment, optical cavity, and photonic band–gap engineering.
“Furthermore, image dipole interaction enables us to substantially improve the device performance of photodetectors by achieving more than 250% increase in the photoresponsivity,” they added.
The academics presented their findings in “Gigantic suppression of recombination rate in 3D lead-halide perovskites for enhanced photodetector performance,” which was recently published in Nature Photonics.

Located in Central O’ahu, Waiawa was developed by Clearway Energy Group, and it sits on 180 acres of land leased from Kamehameha Schools.
In partnership with Blue Planet Foundation and the school system, Waiawa Solar provides local and mainland internships and programs for students in renewable energy education.  The partnership with the school system was formed in 2018, and it has since supported 15 summer internships, where college students explore a range of renewable energy careers by joining the Clearway Energy team. It also supports classroom programs and events to teach Hawaii students about climate change and renewable energy. Blue Planet Foundation joined the partnership last year, helping to support programming and events reaching over 1,900 students and teachers in Hawaii.
“We are especially proud of working with Kamehameha Schools and Blue Planet Foundation to create access to clean energy education and exposure to career pathways,” said Craig Cornelius, chief executive officer of Clearway.
Based in Princeton, N.J., Clearway Energy is a national independent power producer and a leading solar energy developer in Hawaii. This is the company’s second utility-scale solar and battery project on the school’s land in O’ahu and the fifth utility-scale solar project that it has developed on the island.
“Our collaboration with Clearway has provided us with paths to steward our ‘āina [land] in ways to reduce Hawaii’s dependence on fossil fuels while bringing ‘āina-based learning to haumāna [apprentice] through partnerships and innovations,” Kamehameha Schools’ vice president of community and ‘Ᾱina Resiliency Kā’eo Duarte said. “We congratulate Clearway and Hawaiian Electric in reaching this milestone which we believe will help to contribute to the resiliency of our communities.”
The solar farm generates enough clean electricity to power about 7,600 homes at about half the cost of fossil fuels. Project construction was led by Moss and the batteries were supplied by Wärtsilä.

“As we work to stabilize energy costs for our customers, projects like Waiawa Solar play a critical role by feeding electricity to the grid at about half the cost of oil,” said Shelee Kimura, president and CEO of Hawaiian Electric. “Mahalo to Clearway and Kamehameha Schools for their contributions as we all work together to decarbonize our energy system. We look forward to bringing even more benefits to our communities as six additional projects come online over the next two years on O’ahu.”
Clearway Energy has developed renewable projects in Hawaii since 2019, including a 45.9 MW site in Waipi’o, a 14.7 MW site in Mililani, and a 49 MW site in Kawailoa on O’ahu’s North Shore. In August 2022, Clearway completed O’ahu’s first utility-scale solar and battery project in the Mililani Agricultural Park. Altogether, the five solar projects total 185 MW for Hawaiian Electric’s grid and generate enough clean electricity to power more than 45,500 O’ahu homes each year.
Blue Planet Foundation is a Hawaiian nonprofit dedicated to bringing a renewable energy economy to Hawaii. It was launched by Henk Rogers, who was part of the original Tetris design team. Following the game’s success, Henk refocused his energy on energy and environmental endeavors including Blue Planet Energy, an energy storage company that makes batteries for home and commercial use, and Blue Planet Foundation.
