Originally, four local power companies, Athens Utilities Board, Gibson Electric Membership Corp., Joe Wheeler Electric Membership Corp., and Volunteer Energy Cooperative, all petitioned to break their supply deals with TVA over TVA’s slow adoption of renewable energy resources and its unwillingness to provide them transmission service if they did not source all of their power from TVA.
The companies alleged that the federal entity violated Section 211 A(b) of the Federal Power Act, which allows any electric utility, federal power marketing agency, or any other person generating electric energy for sale for resale to apply to FERC for an order requiring a utility to provide transmission services, and FERC to redress discriminatory practices being made by transmitting utilities.
The companies also alleged that their supply deal with TVA is discriminatory so long as TVA has a generation portfolio skewed toward fossil fuels and relatively lacking in renewables, and that, once freed from their supply deals, they would pursue renewable energy projects.
In discussing why the petition was denied, FERC Chairman Richard Glick said it was not due to disagreement with the petitioners, but rather that the power to approve the petition is not held by FERC. Glick cited TVA’s “fence” provision, which limits TVA’s sales activities to a specified service area, but also prevents competitors from “cherrypicking” TVA’s customers by barring them from operating in the service area.
The petition’s denial was described Gaby Sarri-Tobar, a campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, as “a deeply disappointing decision and a slap in the face” to TVA customers.
“FERC just blew an opportunity to set an important precedent and give TVA power companies options for cheaper, renewable power and lower rates for customers, and begin breaking our fossil-fuel addiction,” continued Sarri-Tobar.
Two of the LPCs, Athens Utilities Board and Gibson Electric Membership Corporation, have appealed FERC’s decision to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, bringing in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to rule on FERC’s decision.
When reached for comment, a representative with TVA told pv magazine that:
“TVA respects the right of petitioners to seek review of FERC’s decision as part of the legal process. We look forward to participating in the proceedings and resolving this issue. TVA will continue to focus on working with customers and stakeholders across TVA’s service territory to provide the many benefits of the public power model to our 10 million customers. FERC’s October 2021 decision is consistent with TVA’s view that the public power model created by Congress through the TVA Act best serves the public interest, which fundamentally shares the benefits and related costs of the power system. The petitioners’ request would have unfairly shifted costs to TVA’s remaining customers and threaten the successful TVA public power model to serve the Tennessee Valley.”
The appeal process could proved to be a lengthy one, as any decision made in this case by the court could then be appealed to the Supreme Court.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/21/roth-100mw-of-modules-detained-under-hoshine-wro-released/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 21, 2022",ROTH: 100MW of modules detained under Hoshine WRO released,"Hundreds of detained shipping containers housing roughly 100MW of LONGi solar modules have been released, reports ROTH Capital Partners in an industry note.
On top of the 100MW of LONGi modules released, ROTH also believes that Trina has had the vast majority of its detained product released, if not all of it entirely.
The modules were originally detained under the Withhold Release Order (WRO) applied to silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. (Hoshine) and its subsidiaries, which was instituted after Customs and Border Patrol identified two indicators of forced labor during its investigation of Hoshine.
The action was taken under Section 1307 of the Tariff Act. Section 1307 prohibits the importation of merchandise mined, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by forced or indentured labor, including forced child labor. Such merchandise is subject to exclusion and seizure, and may lead to criminal investigation of the imported goods.
ROTH believes that LONGi may still have more detained product, and the outlook following the release has been mixed, with the industry note describing the release as “a step forward toward more product for utility scale projects that are desperately needing modules.”
Just how big of a step it will be still has yet to be determined. ROTH believes this month’s round of anti-circumvention cases being filed against Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and now Cambodia casts a shadow over the ability for LONGi and Trina to actually restart their facilities in SE Asia and to ship to the U.S.
One of the signers of the most recent petition, Auxin Solar, claims that Chinese manufacturers are shipping cells to the aforementioned countries to avoid paying tariffs that have been in place since 2012.
ROTH said under this case, all crystalline-silicon modules from each of the four countries could be subject to a tariff. Unlike the first case, this one is designed to be focused on entire countries, rather than specific companies. This new petition adds Cambodia, as Auxin claimed Chinese companies were moving operations to the country in anticipation of tariffs. Historically, Cambodia contributes less than 3% of all US C-Si module imports.
ROTH also outlines that remaining uncertainty over how the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act will be implemented only compounds the difficulty for  LONGi and Trina to re-establish their manufacturing and shipping processes for the US market. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act would ban all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang unless the products are determined to not be connected to forced labor, a time-consuming and costly process.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/21/build-back-later/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 21, 2022",Build back later,"The Build Back Better (BBB) Act, which would stand as one of the Biden administration’s most important pieces of legislation, has promised to bring the United States into a new era. It would rebuild crumbling infrastructure, boost clean energy initiatives, revitalize the country’s workforce, and provide tax relief to working families. Democrats assumed a confident, results-driven posture on the announcement of the bill, vowing that they would do all it takes to get the $3.5 trillion in spending passed.
In October, the initial $3.5 trillion package included a proposed $555 billion for climate and clean energy initiatives – an unprecedented investment in the nation’s infrastructure. Included in the framework were 10-year expanded tax credits for utility-scale and residential clean energy, storage and transmission, clean transportation, and decarbonized energy manufacturing. It set aside $105 billion for climate resilience – working to mitigate damages from wildfires, droughts and hurricanes – and established a Franklin D. Roosevelt-inspired Civilian Climate Corps of over 300,000 working Americans.
Also included in the bill was $110 billion in incentives and investments in clean energy technology, manufacturing, and supply chains. Targeted incentives were designed to support full domestic value chains, like solar module manufacturing and lithium battery recycling. Specifically, domestic production of PV modules would be incentivized at $0.07/W, cells at $0.04/W, PV wafers at $12/m², and polysilicon at $3.00/kg. Additional incentives were added for solar trackers, purlins, inverters from residential to utility-scale.
The White House said its proposal would deliver “well over 1 gigaton” of greenhouse gas emissions reduction in 2030. The legislation was pitched as the roadmap to the United States meeting its climate goals – which are centered around a 50% to 52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels in 2030.
As proposed, the October framework for BBB would cut the cost of installing residential rooftop solar by 30%, the White House claimed, reducing the payback period by around five years. Electric vehicles built in the United States would be met with an average tax credit of $12,500 for American families.
“The Build Back Better framework contains the most ambitious and transformational clean energy policies we’ve ever seen from Congress,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said when the October framework was released. She called on Congress to “come together and pass this momentous legislation as soon as possible.”
Jason Burwen, the interim CEO of the US Energy Storage Association, said that with new manufacturing incentives available for batteries and federal procurement of next-generation long-duration storage, the framework would “supercharge efforts to rapidly transition to clean energy while building a robust energy storage supply chain here at home.”
In a November interview with pv magazine USA, Maxeon Chief Revenue Officer Mark Babcock said the company was exploring US-based manufacturing. Babcock said a 3GW cell facility could be online by 2023, but the policy landscape needed improvements for the plan to go through.
It appeared that the Biden administration was on track to secure a victory, and all that was needed was party unity among Democrats to pass BBB. Negotiations with Republicans and moderate Democrats resulted in the $3.5 trillion plan being reduced $2 trillion by late December. The original top-line number was expected to come down, but this new price level marked a significant conciliation to Arizona Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, who feared the spending would drive outsized inflation and further increase national debt.
Sentiment was strong that the moderate Democrat holdouts were pleased with the changes and that the simple majority would be achieved to pass BBB. Then, on Dec. 19, Manchin shocked the nation as he stated he “cannot vote” for the legislation in its current form. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the senator’s comments are “at odds with his discussion this week with the president, with White House staff, and with his own public utterances.” The day after Manchin’s announcement of withdrawing his must-have vote, solar stocks fell steeply, with First Solar down 8%, Sunrun nearly 7%, and SunPower about 7%.
Senator Manchin is famously moderate for a Democrat, and has ties to the coal industry, which serves as a backbone of West Virginia’s economy. He argued for a further-reduced $1.75 trillion proposal, effectively cutting the original plan in half. The White House said it was not interested in making further cuts, and that it would stand by its $2 trillion proposal. This, right before the holiday recess, put BBB back on the shelf.

Pain is already being felt by the solar industry. Analysts are predicting relief, but perhaps not until later in the year. The Invesco Solar ETF has tumbled 40% since BBB was shelved. Inflation concerns, supply chain constraints, and the possibility of multiple interest rate hikes throughout the year are further limiting growth opportunities.
Making matters more difficult, the proposed decision for California’s Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 has been described by grid experts and energy leaders as a “proposed dystopia” and a “tax on the sun.” California, which represents about 50% of the nation’s rooftop solar market, was instrumental in the US solar industry’s maturation to the 230,000+ workforce it has today, per the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC).
EQ analysts conservatively predict a 57% to 71% overall reduction in solar value if NEM 3.0 passes as planned. A recent SolarReviews-run survey of 4,000 Californians found that 95% of active solar shoppers were no longer interested in buying solar after viewing the new cost assumptions.
The US solar industry’s outcry at the development has been echoed by environmental groups and caused a postponement of the date on NEM 3.0 from late January to late February, at the earliest. The industry will watch NEM 3.0 closely as BBB negotiations restart. Brandon Conard, managing partner at SolRiver Capital, said that one potential hiccup caused by Manchin’s sudden withdrawal of support for BBB is pricing difficulties. Conard said a lot of the project bids he was seeing in late 2021 were likely pricing in the assumptions of BBB and were too low if the legislation fails. He said that many large-scale solar development contracts are now at risk of not being honored and will likely be re-traded or stalled. Conard said SolRiver did not factor BBB into its its bids, but that those that had done so may face sentiments of bad will or mistrust after the Manchin-imposed speedbump.
Adding insult to injury, the cost hikes the solar industry incurred in 2021 continue to bite. Both shipping costs and module prices have increased throughout the year and little relief is in sight. Conard said that in 2020 SolRiver could purchase bifacial panels shipped-to-site at $0.28/W, but this year the same panels cost around $0.42/W. He said he doesn’t see price relief until late 2022 and expressed a sentiment that BBB may take that long to come around, too. “Major US solar policy items seem to generally pass in December,” he said.
There are some signs that in 2022 the supply chain squeeze may improve and result in stronger installation figures in 2023. However, the United States needs urgent action to achieve its climate goals. The US Department of Energy has reported that solar deployment will need to accelerate at a rate at least three-to-four times faster through 2035 to reach a goal of 40% electricity generation share, up from today’s 3%.
Democrats will now try once more to find a legislative package that will suit the needs of Manchin and other moderates. In November, a major piece of legislation and spending was passed in the “bipartisan infrastructure bill,” allocating $1 trillion to updating transportation, roads, and bridges.
Suzzane Leta, head of policy and strategy for SunPower, wrote that the BBB needs a new sales pitch. She said it is currently pitched as a “social bill,” with provisions for childcare, housing, and education. Leta wrote that the bill should be pitched instead as a climate-focused roadmap for resilience across the political, geographic, and income-level spectrum.
Manchin said that he is once again open to talks but wants the conversation to start over “from scratch.” SolarReviews projects the passing of the package would lead to the creation or continuance of more than 1 million solar jobs. For now, the nation awaits resolution in what would be the most significant climate and energy legislation in US history.

Solarjuice Technology signed agreements to upgrade its Sacramento, California manufacturing facility with cutting-edge technology due in mid-May. The expansion will boost capacity from the current manufacturing capacity of 200MW to 1.GW, expected to be achieved in Q3.
SPI acquired the existing lease for the 140,000 square foot manufacturing facility from Sunergy, after Sunergy filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2021.
“The state-of-the-art solar module manufacturing facility, which combines California’s highly skilled workers with machine-to-machine connectivity, will feature a high degree of precision automation and continuous improvement for manufacturing PV modules,” said Mr. Xiaofeng Denton Peng, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of SPI Energy.
SPI Energy Co., founded in 2006, has three core divisions: SolarJuice residential solar, the commercial & utility solar division comprised of SPI Solar and Orange Power, and the EdisonFuture/Phoenix Motor EV division. SolarJuice is the leader in renewable energy system solutions for residential and small commercial markets and has extensive operations in the Asia Pacific and North America markets.

So that interconnection studies for large-scale renewables projects may be completed in “months instead of years,” three clean energy trade groups have asked FERC to launch an “accelerated, stand-alone” interconnection rulemaking to implement their recommended approach.
The groups are the solar association SEIA, clean energy trade group Advanced Energy Economy, and renewables and transmission trade group American Clean Power Association.
The plan would provide interconnection customers the option of using third-party consultants to produce required studies.To enable both transmission providers and third parties to produce such studies efficiently, the plan calls for creation of standardized unit pricing and criteria for planning and construction, especially for facilities studies. Those studies can now take over two years to complete, the groups say.
The plan would also require transmission providers to meet minimum standards for interconnection study timeliness and accuracy, with “enforceable, non-recoverable financial penalties for underperformance.”
The groups say that timelines and penalties, together with third-party competition, “will incentivize transmission providers and owners to devote sufficient resources and staffing to completing accurate studies on time.”
Among 21 near-term and long-term solutions, the groups also recommend:
The groups asked FERC to require all transmission providers to use practices comparable to those of transmission providers that have “already implemented” the reforms identified in their comments.
Of FERC’s five commissioners, currently three are Democrats and two are Republicans.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/21/novel-ibc-solar-cell-architecture-based-on-crystal-photonics-shows-efficiency-potential-of-29-1/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 21, 2022",Novel IBC solar cell architecture based on crystal photonics shows efficiency potential of 29.1%,"From pv magazine global
Researchers in Germany have conducted a series of numerical simulations to assess how photonic crystals may increase the efficiency of interdigitated back-contact solar cells based on a passivating electron-selective n+-type polysilicon on oxide (POLO) junction at the minus contact of the cell and a hole-selective p+-type POLO junction at the plus contact.
Photonic crystals are periodic dielectric structures that are ideal for light-harvesting applications in photovoltaics, as they have a bandgap that forbids propagation of a certain frequency range of light, which increases the photon path length, especially for high wavelengths.
“The ‘practical efficiency limit’ of silicon single-junction cells with poly-Si on oxide contacts for both polarities – best placed on the rear side to minimize shading and parasitic absorption – is over 27%,” Robby Peibst, the research project’s corresponding author, told pv magazine. “The improved light trapping promised by photonic crystals could enable even higher efficiencies.”
The simulated cell was assumed to rely on a standard wafer thickness of 150 μm and the scientists found it may achieve an efficiency of over 28% under normal incident light. “Since Maxwell equations predict the formation of optical modes parallel to the surface, the optics are rather independent of the wafer thickness,” Peibst explained. “The latter could therefore be reduced strongly, which also reduces extrinsic and intrinsic recombination losses in the wafer.”
The German group also investigated how improving the hydrogenation process of the POLO junctions by a rear-side dielectric layer stack made of aluminum oxide and silicon nitride (Al2O3/SiNx/Al2O3) may further raise the device’s efficiency for the same standard thickness. This configuration was found to have the potential to reach an efficiency of up to 29.1%. “Even without photon crystals, an efficiency potential of 27.8% is predicted for the improved surface passivation quality on 150 μm-thick wafers,” the scientists stated.
“The transfer of the concept of photonic crystals into PV is at a very early stage,” Peibst explained. Although there is no doubt of the Maxwell equations and photonic crystals have already been commercialized for other applications, their benefit has not been demonstrated so far at the solar cell level, he added. “We are now planning to investigate concerns like angular dependency and the effect of spectral variations experimentally.”
According to him, another important step would be the development of an industrially feasible and cheap method for the fabrication of photonic crystals even on saw-damaged etched surfaces. “So far, photonic crystals are fabricated by various lithography techniques,” he stated. “However, their targeted size for application on the front side of solar cells of around 1-3µm is also realizable with other techniques that can be considered cheap enough for PV.”
As for the cost of solar cells based on photonic crystals, it would be the same as for high-efficiency premium cells. “The costs are so far higher than for standard PERC modules, but they can probably come down further by scaling effects, and in particular by emerging inexpensive metallization schemes such as non-alloying Al pastes for contacting of the poly-Si,” Peibst added, noting that these cells may find ideal applications in rooftop solar and vehicle-integrated photovoltaics.
The solar cell was introduced in the study Towards 28 %-efficient Si single-junction solar cells with better passivating POLO junctions and photonic crystals, published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The research group includes scientists from the Leibniz Universität Hannover and the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH).
