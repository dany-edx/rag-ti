But how long do panels last, and how resilient are they?
Panel life depends on several factors, including climate, module type, and the racking system used, among others. While there isn’t a specific “end date” for a panel per se, loss of production over time often forces equipment retirements.
When deciding whether to keep your panel running 20-30 years in the future, or to look for an upgrade at that time, monitoring output levels is the best way to make an informed decision.
The loss of output over time, called degradation, typically lands at about 0.5% each year, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Manufacturers typically consider 25 to 30 years a point at which enough degradation has occurred where it may be time to consider replacing a panel. The industry standard for manufacturing warranties is 25 years on a solar module, said NREL.
Given the 0.5% benchmark annual degradation rate, a 20-year-old panel is capable of producing about 90% of its original capability.

Panel quality can make some impact on degradation rates. NREL reports premium manufacturers like Panasonic and LG have rates of about 0.3% per year, while some brands degrade at rates as high as 0.80%. After 25 years, these premium panels could still produce 93% of their original output, and the higher-degradation example could produce 82.5%.

A sizeable portion of degradation is attributed to a phenomenon called potential induced degradation (PID), an issue experienced by some, but not all, panels. PID occurs when the panel’s voltage potential and leakage current drive ion mobility within the module between the semiconductor material and other elements of the module, like the glass, mount, or frame. This causes the module’s power output capacity to decline, in some cases significantly.
Some manufacturers build their panels with PID-resistant materials in their glass, encapsulation, and diffusion barriers.
All panels also suffer something called light induced degradation (LID), in which panels lose efficiency within the first hours of being exposed to the sun. LID varies from panel to panel based on the quality of the crystalline silicon wafers, but usually results in a one-time, 1-3% loss in efficiency, said testing laboratory PVEL, PV Evolution Labs.
The exposure to weather conditions is the main driver in panel degradation. Heat is a key factor in both real-time panel performance and degradation over time. Ambient heat negatively affects the performance and efficiency of electrical components, according to NREL.
By checking the manufacturer’s data sheet, a panel’s temperature coefficient can be found, which will demonstrate the panel’s ability to perform in higher temperatures, said SolarCalculator.com.

The coefficient explains how much real-time efficiency is lost by each degree of Celsius increased above the standard temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. For example, a temperature coefficient of -0.353% means that for every degree Celsius above 25, 0.353% of total production capability is lost.
Heat exchange drives panel degradation through a process called thermal cycling. When it is warm, materials expand, and when the temperature lowers, they contract. This movement slowly causes microcracks to form in the panel over time, lowering output.
In its annual Module Score Card study, PVEL analyzed 36 operational solar projects in India, and found significant impacts from heat degradation. The average annual degradation of the projects landed at 1.47%, but arrays located in colder, mountainous regions degraded at nearly half that rate, at 0.7%.

Proper installation can help deal with heat related issues. Panels should be installed a few inches above the roof, so that convective air can flow beneath and cool the equipment. Light-colored materials can be used in panel construction to limit heat absorption. And components like inverters and combiners, whose performance is particularly sensitive to heat, should be located in shaded areas, suggested CED Greentech. 
Wind is another weather condition that can cause some harm to solar panels. Strong wind can cause flexing of the panels, called dynamic mechanical load. This also causes microcracks in the panels, lowering output. Some racking solutions are optimized for high-wind areas, protecting the panels from strong uplift forces and limiting microcracking. Typically, the manufacturer’s datasheet will provide information on the max winds the panel is able to withstand.
The same goes for snow, which can cover panels during heavier storms, limiting output. Snow can also cause a dynamic mechanical load, degrading the panels. Typically, snow will slide off of panels, as they are slick and run warm, but in some cases a homeowner may decide to clear the snow off the panels. This must be done carefully, as scratching the glass surface of the panel would make a negative impact on output.

Degradation is a normal, unavoidable part of a panel’s life. Proper installation, careful snow clearing, and careful panel cleaning can help with output, but ultimately, a solar panel is a technology with no moving parts, requiring very little maintenance.
To ensure a given panel is likely to live a long life and operate as planned, it must undergo standards testing for certification. Panels are subject to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) testing, which apply to both mono- and polycrystalline panels.
EnergySage said panels that achieve IEC 61215 standard are tested for electrical characteristics like wet leakage currents, and insulation resistance. They under go a mechanical load test for both wind and snow, and climate tests that check for weaknesses to hot spots, UV exposure, humidity-freeze, damp heat, hail impact, and other outdoor exposure.

IEC 61215 also determines a panel’s performance metrics at standard test conditions, including temperature coefficient, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power output.
Also commonly seen on a panel spec sheet is the seal of Underwriters Laboratories (UL), which also provides standards and testing. UL runs climactic and aging tests, as well as the full gamut of safety tests.
Solar panel failure happens at a low rate. NREL conducted a study of over 50,000 systems installed in the United States and 4,500 globally between the years of 2000 and 2015. The study found a median failure rate of 5 panels out of 10,000 annually.
Image: PVEL
Panel failure has improved markedly over time, as it was found that system installed between 1980 and 2000 demonstrated a failure rate double the post-2000 group.
System downtime is rarely attributed to panel failure. In fact, a study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of all solar plant downtime is a result of failing inverters, the device that converts the panel’s DC current to usable AC. pv magazine will analyze inverter performance in the next installment of this series.

A solar PV plant is an individual generating station, designed by a single developer (or consortium) and usually with a single export connection to the grid. It may in some cases be configured on several nearby plots of land and/or constructed across multiple phases.
This article looks at the largest of these individual solar power stations, highlighting those over 500 MW, and showing in brackets where it stood in the list published in 2019.
In some places, solar plants are grouped together in solar parks or clusters, leading to even higher capacities. As described in the introduction, these will be covered in later articles.
China recaptures the number one position this year with the 2,200 MWAC solar power plant commissioned last September by Huanghe Hydro­power Developments. It covers over 5,000 hectares of semi-desert in Gonghe County of the Hainan Prefecture in Qinghai, China.
Just visible to the east in this picture is the Longyangxia Solar-Hydro Project (3). This plant has been expanded over seven years and now covers such a huge area (220 km2) that I will list it with the solar parks in the next article, although it arguably meets my definition of a solar plant.
This 938 MWAC plant in Abu Dhabi in the UAE became the world’s largest single solar power station when commis­sioned in June 2019 – a position it held for 15 months.
The development, led by Marubeni and JinkoSolar, was built by Sterling & Wilson using a pitched structure with arrays totaling 1,177 MWP at a shallow angle oriented towards east and west. As this aerial view of the plant shows, this configuration achieves a very high packing density on the 800 Ha site.
The UAE will also feature prominently in the solar parks list with Dubai’s multi-gigawatt development.

The largest plant of 2019 is third in today’s list – the so-called Yanchi Solar Park just south of Gaoshawo in Ninxia’s Yanchi district. Despite the name, it is not a “solar park” as we would define it. The project was developed by China Minsheng New Energy and has been operational since 2016. Its 1 GWP solar arrays give it an output of about 820 MWAC.
The U.S.’s highest entry this time is at #4 (its highest at #6 in the previous list, Solar Star, is now down to #10). One of the U.S.’s earliest utility-scale solar plants, phase one of the Copper Mountain project was first connected by Sempra Energy back in 2010. When the southernmost phase five was commissioned this March, it took the total capacity of the plant to 816 MW.
Located in Nevada’s Eldorado Valley between Boulder City and Searchlight, not far south-east from Las Vegas, it surrounds Acciona’s Nevada Solar One CSP project (outlined in red).
In China’s Shanxi Province, another 1 GWP project has been installed in Datong district, as part of China’s demonstration program for projects at this scale. The solar array is distributed on hilltops over a wide area, making them hard to pick out on satellite images.
Another project of similar size is located around Ili in Xinjiang, but is spread over such a wide area, I have not included it as a single plant in this list. Nor do I include a further gigawatt-scale project portfolio being developed around Alashan in Inner Mongolia.
Spain leaps into this list at #6 with ACS Group’s 850 MWP project covering a total of almost 1,900 hectares divided between three municipalities in Zaragoza. It was commis­sioned in stages during 2020.
The plant, which delivers 730 MWAC is owned by Galp, a Portuguese energy company.
Enel Green Power’s Villanueva project in Mexico has been expanded from 640 MW since our 2019 list, to leapfrog over the Kamuthi project.
The plant is located in Coahuila state and is one of several projects in this list to use horizontal single-axis trackers. It is therefore relatively less dense, covering an area of just over 2,600 hectares.
India’s top stand-alone plant has now slipped down to #8, although the country will feature more prominently in the forthcoming solar parks list.
The plant was built in 2016 by Adani covering nearly 1,200 hectares in the State of Tamil Nadu, and has an AC capacity of 648 MW.

Another Indian plant – located further north in Jaisalmer district, Rajasthan – is a new entry to the list with a capacity of 600 MW. It is one of a series of projects contracted by tender to supply power directly into India’s Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS).
The PV project, which spans the communities of Lawan and Purohitsar in Pokhran, was connected recently by SB Energy, the company acquired earlier this year from Japan’s Softbank by Adani.
Now the U.S.’s second-largest solar plant, Solar Star covers multiple sites in California’s Antelope Valley.
The plant was constructed in two phases in 2013-2014 using Sunpower Corp. modules. It has a total capacity of 585 MW and is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group.
Back to China for plant #11, this multi-phase project is clustered in an area of semi-desert around Hongshagangzhen in Gansu province.
It is being built by China Singyes, with at least 574 MW now operational, and an eventual capacity of 820 MW.
The U.S.’s third plant in this list at 550 MW, Topaz was briefly the country’s largest plant when commissioned in November 2014.
Developed by First Solar, it is built on multiple sites totaling nearly 1,400 hectares in Carrisa Plains in central California. Coincidentally this incorporates the site where the world’s first multi-megawatt solar project was built in the 1980s (outlined in white on this image).
We go to Brazil for the first South American project to reach this list of the world’s largest solar plants. But it is the second entry in Latin America for Italy’s Enel Green Energy.
The plant near São Gonçalo do Gurguéia in the State of Piauí is being constructed in three phases with an eventual capacity of 765 MW. When phase II was completed in February this year, the capacity reached 549 MW.
The plant uses bifacial modules mounted on single-axis trackers, and currently covers about 1,300 hectares.

The last of the ½ GW+ solar plants is a conglomeration of hillside arrays In the valleys to the east of Ninxia’s capital Yinchuan. The Yinchuan Xinqing project has a total capacity of about 500 MW and was installed in mid-2018.
Just below our cutoff, with a present capacity of 480 MWAC, is Vietnam’s largest plant at Ea Súp in Đắk Lắk Province. This is due to be expanded, so may join this list in the future.
Other large projects in development may lead to Australia, Saudi Arabia, Chile, France, and Texas, amongst others, joining soon.
Philip Wolfe has been active in the renewables arena since the 1970s and is the founder of Wiki-Solar. His book on utility-scale solar was published in 2012 and one on the early years of the terrestrial PV sector was published in 2018.

Over the next two to three years, Dominion Energy will conduct field studies, develop the project plans, and complete local and state permitting processes. The company will jointly develop the project with Antares Group, which will serve as the owner’s engineer. The company plans to begin construction at the site in far southwest Virginia in 2024 or 2025, subject to review and approval by the Virginia State Corporation Commission.
The collaboration builds on The Nature Conservancy’s ongoing effort to develop the first utility-scale solar projects on former surface mines in the coalfields of southwest Virginia and surrounding states. In May, the group announced partnerships with Sol Systems and Sun Tribe to develop utility-scale solar projects within the Cumberland Forest Project in Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky.
According to a Nature Conservancy release, The Cumberland Forest Project was put in action to show that investments in nature can yield financial returns and critical conservation results while returning value to local communities.
It has not yet been shared to whom the electricity generated by the Cumberland Forest Project will be sold. However, with a targeted construction and operation dates tentatively set in 2023 and 2024, plenty of time remains for those buyers to be announced. Similarly, no offtake buyer has been announced for the Highlands Solar project.

The two now have partnered on 51 projects.
Comprised of both rooftop solar and ground mounts, the 39 projects’ combined capacity is 38.3 MW. Walmart commissioned EDP to build projects in Arizona, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Louisiana, Maryland, and South Carolina.
Recently, Walmart, in partnership with developer Nexamp, served as anchor tenant to support 129 MW of solar projects in New York. The retailer signed up for a share of each of 23 Nexamp projects across the state, equivalent to about 50 MW of the portfolio. 
Walmart set a goal in 2020 to target zero emissions by 2040 across its global operations, and aims to use renewable energy to power all its facilities by 2035. 
The company said 36% of its operations worldwide are powered by renewable energy. As of the end of 2020, Walmart had more than 550 onsite and offsite projects in operation or under development in eight countries.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/13/house-panel-offers-details-on-solar-benefits-in-3-5t-budget-bill/,"POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2021",House panel offers details on solar benefits in $3.5t budget bill,"The House Ways and Means Committee released details of a proposed $3.5 trillion federal budget package that includes extending the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for 10 years at 30%.
A domestic content clause could boost tax credits for solar projects to 40%. A revived production tax credit (PTC) for solar as well as an ITC for energy storage projects also were included in the package’s draft language.
If passed later this year, the bill as currently drafted would extend the full ITC for 10 years before phasing it down between 2032 and 2033. (Read the bill’s clean energy provisions.)
The proposal set a 6% base credit rate which all qualifying projects may receive. For a project to receive the full 30% credit,  conditions pertaining to prevailing wages and apprenticeships must be met.
In addition, all projects that start construction before a qualifying date or that have a maximum net output of less than 1 MW could claim the bonus rate and also would be exempt from the other requirements. That provision could boost both residential and commercial and industrial solar.
An additional 10% bonus credit rate also could flow to projects that use at least 55% domestically manufactured content. All totaled, the ITC then could be valued at 40%.

Lawmakers who drafted the proposal included an additional bonus credit of 10% for projects located in low-income communities. They included an annual capacity limit of 1.8 GW for each year from 2022 through 2031 for projects sited in those communities.
The proposed language would revive and extend a full solar production tax credit (PTC) through 2031, before phasing down to 80% in 2032 and 60% in 2033. The PTC would pay a base credit rate of $0.005 for each kilowatt-hour of energy produced. A bonus rate of $0.025/kWh would be paid to projects that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship conditions.
The proposed bill also includes a tax credit for energy storage projects. Batteries or other storage technologies with a minimum capacity of 5 kWh could claim a base credit rate of 6%. As with the other provisions, the rate could increase to 30% if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met.
The proposals are part of a spending package that the Democrat-controlled Congress is aiming to pass before the end of the year. The bill is being advanced under what is known as “budget reconciliation,” a tool that would allow the bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote.
That is no sure thing, however. More than a few defections among House Democrats could scuttle the bill in that chamber. The margin for victory appears narrower in the Senate where all 50 Democrats need to be on board. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ) have expressed reservations about the size of the budget bill and how it would be paid for in the coming years.
