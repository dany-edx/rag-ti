As part of the deal, TVA is working with developer Silicon Ranch to build a 20 MW solar farm in Moore County, Tennessee. Through a long-term power purchase agreement with TVA that was signed on Jack Daniels’ behalf, Silicon Ranch will own and operate the plant.
The electricity bought by Jack Daniels will fulfill nearly three-quarters of the company’s electrical needs, according to Vice President and Assistant General Manager Melvin Keebler. Prior to the solar commitment, the company transitioned to running its distillery with a zero-waste-to-landfill policy and instituted programs to protect the water and wood used to make the whiskey.
While TVA has not been the most solar-friendly entity historically, it has found success with its Green Invest program. TVA has increased its contracted solar capacity by 60% since October 2020, with the Green Invest program. The energy provider’s 2020 Request for Proposals for solar capacity resulting in the addition of 964 MW of contracted solar and 130 MW of battery storage to the TVA system.
In addition to Jack Daniels, the Knoxville Utilities Board, Metropolitan Government of Nashville, and Vanderbilt University (through a partnership with Nashville Electric Service) have all made solar commitments under Green Invest.
TVA plans to have more than 2 GW of solar operating by the end of 2023, expanding that figure to 7 to 10 GW of solar energy by 2040. To help meet those goals, TVA said it plans to issue a new request for proposals for additional renewable energy this spring.

The project, located in Gibson County, will begin construction in summer 2022 and begin commercial operation in summer 2023. Capital Dynamics will construct the project and NIPSCO will enter into a joint venture once construction is complete.
The scope of the project is significant, especially considering its location, as the state of Indiana has installed just under 475 MW of solar to date. While this figure is by no means near the bottom of the national installed-solar leaderboard, Indiana may well move up that leaderboard soon, as the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects the state to install nearly 4 GW over the next five years. That would be good enough for the 8th most expected capacity additions of any state in the country.
One for the surge of interest in utility-scale solar is NIPSCO’s to close the majority of its coal facilities by 2023, with the remaining facilities on the way out by 2028. Because of the need for new generation capacity, the utility has turned to solar, pledging to bring more than 1 GW of new projects on-line by 2023.
The company initially announced 900 MW over three projects: the 200 MW Cavalry Solar project, paired with 60 MW of energy storage; the 265 MW Dunns Bridge Solar I project; and the 435 MW of solar and 75 MW of battery storage Dunns Bridge Solar II project.
Since that announcement, NIPSCO has signed a long-term Power Purchase Agreement for 280 MW of the power generated by Capital Dynamics’ upcoming Gibson Solar project and a Build & Transfer Agreement for the 200 MW Indiana Crossroads Solar Park .

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/13/silicon-for-lithium-ion-batteries-moves-to-commercial-production/,"BATTERY,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"APRIL 13, 2021",Silicon for lithium-ion batteries moves to commercial production,"From pv magazine Global
Battery materials startup Group 14 Technologies brought its first commercial-scale factory online in the northwest United States. The factory can produce up to 120 tons per year of the company’s lithium silicon-carbon material SCC55, designed as a replacement for graphite in lithium-ion batteries.
Since it has around 10 times the energy density of graphite, silicon has attracted plenty of attention from researchers as a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Challenges with the material’s tendency to expand when used in battery, however, have largely held back commercial applications until now.
Group 14 said that by focusing on large-scale solutions from the start it has been able to design a material that can both be produced at large-scale and serve as a “drop in” solution for battery manufacturers already working with graphite.
“We leveraged our team’s deep commercial manufacturing experience to prioritize process development and designing for cost from the beginning,” said CTO Rick Costantino. “The process to manufacture SCC55 was designed from the start to be scaled quickly and efficiently, an approach that has kept us on track to bring our technology online to help power consumer electronics, electric vehicles and more.”
The material consists of a carbon “scaffold,” inside which is a 3-5 nanometer particle of amorphous silicon. Void space inside the scaffold gives the silicon some room to expand, while the carbon surface creates a stable interface with the electrolyte.
Batteries using only SCC55 as the anode have shown stability over more than 500 cycles. It can also be combined with graphite in various ratios for stability over 1,000-2,000 cycles, with customers able to find the optimal balance.
“We have a lot of customers looking at the blending approach, and others also working only with our material to get a 50% plus boost to their battery capacity,” Group 14 CEO Rick Luebbe told pv magazine.
Group 14 did not share information on the cost of its material, although it said it will be competitive with graphite when the improved performance is taken into account.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/13/sunrise-brief-partners-announce-2b-investment-in-utility-scale-solar-and-wind/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 13, 2021",Sunrise brief: Partners announce $2b investment in utility-scale solar and wind,"Talen Energy said it entered into a joint venture with Pattern Energy Group to invest $2 billion over the next five years to develop, finance, build, and operate roughly 1.4 GW of utility-scale renewable energy projects.
The initial project portfolio for the venture, known as PT Energy Transitions, includes six solar facilities in Pennsylvania and a hybrid solar and wind facility in the western U.S.
The joint venture expands on Talen and Pattern Energy’s first joint development project, Montour Solar One, a 100 MW solar power plant to be built adjacent to Talen’s fossil generating station in Washingtonville, Pennsylvania. That solar capacity is expected to enter service in 2022.
EVLO Energy Storage said it will deploy a 4 MW / 20 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) on the Hydro-Québec grid based on the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology.
The system will be deployed as part of the work being carried out on a transmission line and will supply a remote community’s residential and commercial customers for the duration of the work.
The BESS will be the largest such deployment in Quebec. Once work on the transmission line is completed, the system will remain in place to manage peaks on the grid and serve as an auxiliary source in the event of an outage.
System components will be delivered this fall and the system is expected to be in service by spring 2022. As part of the project, EVLO will provide software for remote operation and management activities.
EVLO will also soon deliver two other storage systems: one 2 MW system in La Prairie, Québec, as part of a solar generating station project, and a 9 MW system in Joux-la-Ville, France, as part of the Tonnerre project in collaboration with Innergex.
The Connecticut Green Bank announced its 2021 Green Liberty Bond issuance, which is anticipated to be available to retail and institutional investors this month. Green Liberty Bonds are lower-dollar denomination bonds (offered in $1,000 increments), making it easier for individual investors to consider an investment. Bond proceeds are independently certified as having financed infrastructure projects with climate and environmental benefits that will help strengthen our state’s green energy economy and create much needed jobs.
The Connecticut Green Bank was established by the Connecticut General Assembly in 2011 as the nation’s first green bank. This is the Green Bank’s second Green Liberty Bond release, and builds upon the success of the July 2020 issuance, which raised $16.8 million from retail and institutional investors.
The bonds are modeled after the World War II Series-E bonds. More information is available here.
Energy Transition Ventures (ETV) said it launched a venture fund to invest in energy transition technologies. The Texas firm was started by cleantech startup execs and venture capitalists Craig Lawrence and Neal Dikeman, and has anchor investment from two operating companies of the GS Group of South Korea.
Investments will focus on North American companies driving or benefitting from the energy transition off fossil fuels, across categories including distributed energy, electrification, mobility, and resource efficiency. ETV said it closed its first capital in February this year, completed its first investment in March, and is expected to close new investors for a total fund size of $75 million. The firm will co-locate a Silicon Valley office with GS Futures.
The firm also said that Jon Wellinghoff, former chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Deb Merril, president of EDF Retail and co-founder and former co-CEO of Just Energy, joined as advisors. GS Energy executive Q Song moves from Seoul, South Korea, to join the Houston ETV team.
