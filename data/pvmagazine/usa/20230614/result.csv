https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/14/solar-plus-storage-microgrids-to-replace-diesel-generators-in-mojave-water-conservation-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 14, 2023",Solar-plus-storage microgrids to replace diesel generators in Mojave water conservation project,"Scale Microgrid Solutions, a developer using distributed solar, battery storage and combined heat and power (CHP) generation, will bring a solar-powered microgrid system to the Mojave Desert with water conservation partner Cadiz, Inc.
At the Cadiz Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage project, a 50,000 acre-feet per year project that captures groundwater before it evaporates, Scale Microgrid will deploy systems across a network of 25 to 30 production wells.
Scale Microgrid, a Ridgewood, N.J.-based project developer, will outfit each Cadiz well with a 1.12 MW ground-mounted solar array paired with a 634 kW / 2.66 MWh battery system, and 380 kW low-emissions CHP generation system.
The distributed generation systems will be tied together with smart controls and a switchboard. The microgrid and control system will enable remote monitoring, providing 100% uptime reliability and lower maintenance costs over the life of the systems.
Cadiz currently manages a groundwater basin in the Mojave Desert of San Bernardino County, Calif., using diesel generators that power an off-grid wellfield that spans across more than 1,300 acres. The solar-hybrid microgrids are expected to lower energy costs by more than 30%, provide 100% uptime reliability and cut carbon emissions from fossil fuels by more than 75%.
“Microgrid technology has improved to the point where shifting to clean energy is now the most cost-effective way to operate off-grid,” said Susan Kennedy, executive chairwoman of Cadiz. “Our mission is to deliver clean, reliable and affordable water to people. Scale’s solar-hybrid microgrid systems can give us the reliability we need at significantly lower cost while reducing emissions as much as 75%, demonstrating that clean energy and clean water go hand-in-hand.”
The water conservation company produces more than 1.8 billion gallons of recycled water to the Santa Margarita Water District (SMWD). This represents 5,000 acre-feet of water, covering about 20% of the southern California water authority’s annual water usage. Recycled water is used for irrigation, including parks, golf courses, municipal and homeowner association landscaping.
Cadiz’s project water is conveyed to SMWD and other water providers through a 43-mile pipeline connecting to the Colorado River Aqueduct, which delivers water to the providers’ supplier, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
The water conservation company expects to have up to 30 production wells in operation when the conservation project is fully constructed. The company’s 220-mile Northern Pipeline, an unused natural gas pipeline that will be converted to carry water, will transport 11 million tons of water each year to remote and underserved communities across Southern California.
“It takes a lot of energy to produce and move that much water,” Kennedy said. “With Scale’s clean energy microgrid design, we will be able to deliver that water reliably, sustainably and cost-effectively.”
Scale Microgrid designs, constructs, finances, owns and operates distributed energy assets that utilize solar photovoltaics, battery storage and low-emissions CHP systems, providing off-grid power for power intensive applications such as water pumping, agriculture and other commercial and industrial use. The company is backed by the energy transition and sustainability fund group of Warburg Pincus, a global private equity investor.
In March, Scale closed a $225 million project debt financing from KeyBank Capital Markets and City National Bank to fund the construction and operations of a microgrids, combined heat and power (CHP) systems, solar and storage projects such as the Mojave portfolio in California, plus other projects in Oregon, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Colorado, North Carolina, New Jersey and New York.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/14/direct-pay-transferability-guidance-released-for-clean-energy-tax-credits/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 14, 2023","Direct pay, transferability guidance released for clean energy tax credits","The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released much-awaited guidance on the rules and regulations of two important transactional provisions of the tax credits contained in the Inflation Reduction Act. Direct pay and transferability guidance is now posted, with additional granular details expected next week.
Direct pay is made available to tax-exempt entities investing in clean energy projects. Credits including the 30% Investment Tax Credit, plus any applicable adders, can be used by these entities as a payment against tax liability, and any remaining balance can be refunded as a direct payment to these entities. Tax years beginning January 1, 2023 are eligible for this transaction.
Organizations that are exempt from tax by § 501(a) are eligible for the direct pay option, as well as those described by § 501(c), including public charities, private foundations, social welfare organizations, labor organizations, business leagues, and others. The option is available to Tribal Governments, rural electric cooperative utilities, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, as well. A frequently asked questions page offers more information.
A substantial update in the guidance is that the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Component Credit is eligible for the direct pay option.
As for transferability, this process enables project owners to monetize tax credits by transferring them to other taxpayers. Under this transaction, renewable energy developers and owners are essentially able to sell tax credits for cash, making financing easier for new clean energy projects. The transferability option is generally open to the entities that are not covered by the direct pay option. More information in the frequently asked questions section can be found here.
(Read: “Inside transferability, or selling renewable energy tax credits“) 
Gregory Wetstone, president and chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), said the guidance will “unleash a massive infusion of new renewable energy investment.” 
“We are thrilled to see constructive treatment of numerous key issues reflected in this guidance and look forward to continuing to work with the Treasury Department as it moves to finalize these proposed rules,” Wetstone said. 
The transferability provision addresses current constraints in the nation’s tax equity market, while the direct pay regime makes it easier for tribes, state and local governments, co-ops and other nonprofits to participate in the clean energy transition, Wetstone said.
Mit Buchanan, managing director, energy investments at J.P. Morgan, said that the $20 billion to $30 billion of tax equity issuances in the industry broadly needed to be increased to bring new capital parties to the table, speaking at the ACORE Finance Forum on June 7 in New York. ACORE said that the transferability option alone will fuel $50 billion or more in annual of monetization of tax credits. 
Colin Witherspoon, business development officer for U.S. Bank, said his firm is seeing prices on tax equity transfers be in the low $0.90 per dollar range, making the statement during a tax equity panel session at the ACORE Finance Forum. 
Transferability and direct pay apply to the following credits:
Additionally, the 45W credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles is eligible for direct pay, but not for transferability.

Israel-based inverter manufacturer SolarEdge has partnered with Germany’s Vaillant and South Korea’s Samsung to integrate heat pumps with residential PV systems.
“This development will provide end-users with the ability to power the heat pump with excess PV, all controlled from a single point via the mySolarEdge app,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
Users will also be able to control home temperatures via the app. It will reportedly allow homeowners to optimize their energy consumption using excess PV or shifting consumption in accordance with optimal energy rates.
SolarEdge estimates yearly savings of around $108 by optimizing the consumption of the heat pump at alternative times, it said in a statement.
“Smart homes have mainly been about convenience and interconnectivity, but the next step is building a comprehensive and integrated ecosystem,” said Alfred Karlstetter, general manager of SolarEdge Europe. “By merging home devices with the value of smart solar energy through this integration with Vaillant, we are leading the way in making the power of smart solar energy more accessible, intuitive, and convenient for more people.”
The integration is expected to become available in the second half of this year.

Ohio-based thin-film PV manufacturer First Solar is showcasing fully functional, pre-commercial, bifacial thin-film PV modules at Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany. It announced a limited production run of what it calls “the world’s first bifacial solar panel utilizing an advanced thin film semiconductor.” The cells feature thin-film CdTe for the semiconductor.
The bifacial product line is now undergoing field and laboratory testing. It builds on the company’s Series 6 Plus monofacial modules, which were first launched in 2019.
First Solar’s R&D teams have reportedly developed a transparent back contact for the module. This innovative feature allows infrared wavelengths of light to pass through the back of the module instead of being absorbed as heat. It also enables bifacial energy generation. The manufacturer said that this technology will reduce the operational temperature of the module and increase its specific energy yield.
“This module combines the quality, sustainability, reliability, and long-term performance of our Series 6 Plus platform with our first increment of bifaciality,” said Pat Buehler, chief product officer at First Solar. “Once commercialized, we expect Series 6 Plus Bifacial to represent the first real alternative to crystalline silicon-based bifacial technology, effectively combining bifaciality with the industry’s best warranted degradation rate, CdTe thin film’s ability to deliver more energy per nameplate watt, best-in-class reliability and durability, and innovative module design.”
The monofacial series 6 Plus modules have power ratings from 455 W to 480 W and up to 19.0% efficiency. They offer a 0.3% warranted degradation rate, spectral response, shading behavior, and an anti-reflective coating to enhance energy production.
“Moreover, unlike crystalline silicon (c-Si) panels, First Solar’s Series 6 Plus module does not experience losses from Light Induced Degradation (LID) and Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID),” said First Solar.
In October 2022, First Solar said that it would build a new R&D innovation center in Perrysburg, Ohio. The facility will be completed in 2024 with a pilot manufacturing line to produce full-sized prototypes of thin-film and tandem PV modules.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/14/roll-out-solar-awning-with-1000-w-for-rvs/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 14, 2023",Roll-out solar awning with 1000 W for RVs,"There are a lot of solar options for recreational vehicles, from parking canopies to mountable solar panels and portable solar kits. The latest innovation comes from Eco-dynamic Tech, an Illinois-based company that is introducing a roll-out solar awning for RVs.
The awning, called Artpiece for RV, is a 1000 W array that extends from the side of the vehicle, providing a shaded patio space below while generating electricity from the sun above.
Eco-dynamic offers a few different customizable colorways for the awning, with unique designs that the company said are highly resistant to fading.
“Solar product should not just be a practical equipment, it can also be a shining piece of art,” said Michael Soon, vice president of business development, Eco-dynamic Tech.
Flexible heterojunction (HJT) cells are used as the powerhouse of the awning. HJT cells are being increasingly evaluated for their flexibility and high levels of bifaciality, meaning that both sides of the panel collect light and produce electricity, taking advantage of reflected light from below.
The HJT solar array offers 1040 W peak power, a 108.3 V operating voltage, and a 9.6 A operating current. The array can be completely retracted and rolled 360 degrees for storage. Colorways include “Apple Green,” “Peacock Blue,” and “Narcissus Purple.”
The company reports that with under eight hours of sunlight, the awning can power major RV appliances. For example, Eco-Dynamic Tech says it can power a 300 W air conditioner for 26.6 hours, a 100 W refrigerator for 53 hours, a typical laptop for 36.3 hours, and even a 2800 W oven for nearly three hours.
The company recommends having a battery bank on board to store the awning’s clean energy production. It should be compatible with output specifications of the awning, which the company can help troubleshoot.
The structure is made from 6061 aluminum profile brackets, which are known for stability and resistance to corrosion. An electric motor that extends and retracts it in about 60 seconds, and LED lights are integrated on the awning. It also comes with a radio-controlled remote control that can operate the electric motor from over 100 feet away, the company reports.
Eco-dynamic recommends measuring your RV side surface area where the awning is planned to be installed to right-size it to your RV. A typical Artpiece for RV awning measures 144.2 inches by 96.5 inches, though other sizes are available. Currently, the company recommends that a professional partner installs the structure, and it will ship the product to an approved installer for the service. Shipments of product are expected in late 2023, said Eco-dynamic.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/14/nyc-grocer-krasdale-foods-becomes-first-community-solar-provider-in-the-bronx/,"COMMUNITY,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,NEW YORK",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 14, 2023",NYC grocer Krasdale Foods becomes first community solar provider in the Bronx,"A 115-year-old New York City grocery distributor that hands out free turkeys in low-income neighborhoods on Thanksgiving, has taken its community partnership role seriously.
Now Krasdale Foods, which distributes food under the CTown and Bravo supermarket brands in the city’s five boroughs, has made 1.62 MW of clean power of a 2.68 MW warehouse rooftop solar facility available to 300 low- and moderate-income Bronx residents under a community solar program.
Managed by MaxSolar and installed by PowerFlex, an EDF Renewables company, the companies and site host held a site visit to the rooftop generating facility at its Hunt’s Point, Bronx distribution facility on June 14, attended by pv magazine USA.

Under an export-only framework in utility Consolidated Edison’s grid, Krasdale’s solar facility provides 3.4 million kWh of clean energy per year to local residents. As of this week, Lucie Dupas, chief delivery officer at PowerFlex, said the project was fully subscribed to New York City residents.
Construction of the facility’s 6,700 JinkoSolar 400 watt panels took about nine months, beginning in September 2021, with PowerFlex hiring about 25 local construction workers during peak construction, Dupas said.
Dupas and other PowerFlex team members said the rooftop system used Solectria PVI 60TL three-phase inverters and PanelClaw mounting hardware. The site host and system operator are able to monitor the system’s output using AlsoEnergy monitoring software.
MaxSolar is providing operations and maintenance support for the project and also handled subscription management.
Howie Jacobs, chief legal officer of Krasdale Foods, said prior to construction, the site owner had to install a new roof using contractor CentiMark to deploy a new commercial rooftop to support the layout of 6,700 panels.
Gus Lebiak, president and chief operating officer of Krasdale Foods, told pv magazine USA that in addition to having rooftop solar on its White Plains, N.Y., office building, the Bronx, N.Y. grocery distribution company also uses 35 electric forklifts and 145 battery-powered pallet jacks. Lebiak said this electric fleet was the reason the company needed to procure more than 1 MW of the new rooftop solar system’s power for its own facility management.
Lebiak said the seven-acre warehouse facility is a dry goods distribution facility, that ordinarily would not have required a large power load, but its goal of becoming more electrified warranted the higher power source from on-site solar. Over the coming years, Lebiak said the grocer would also look to add more electric trucks and deploy battery energy storage systems at the Hunt’s Point site.
David Sandbank, vice president, distributed energy resources at the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), said under Con Edison’s export-only framework, at least 60% of the community solar’s power output must be made available to the local community, while 40% of the power capacity would be used by the anchor tenant.
NYSERDA awarded $1.3 million from the state’s NY-Sun program’s MW Block Program, which incentivizes new commercial and residential solar installations, to the Krasdale Foods community solar project. According to its website, Con Edison non-residential users have now deployed over 25 MW of systems for projects generating in excess of 1 MW per system.
Krasdale Foods first started looking at clean energy systems about seven years ago, Lebiak said, while 2021 is when the citywide food distributor turned to PowerFlex to begin working on its rooftop facility that would power its entire distribution facility and provide power to local residents.
Vanessa Gibson, the Bronx Borough President, commended Krasdale on going the next step forward in sustainability after being a dependable community partner for over one century, providing food to residents in underserved communities across New York City.
“Our residents have been denied clean air and lack of energy efficiency. Now we have access to the largest clean energy project in New York City,” Gibson said. “These public-private partnerships will last for generations.”
Shakira Wilson, vice president of planning at Con Edison, called the event a “joyous occasion to celebrate the largest solar project in the Bronx.” To date, the local utility has more than 517 MW of distributed generation projects located across the city’s grid, she said.
Based in White Plains, N.Y., Krasdale Foods was formed in 1908 as A. Krasne Inc., by Abraham Krasne. In 1972, the company rebranded as Krasdale Foods and moved into the Hunt’s Point distribution center as the first anchor tenant of the massive 60-acre South Bronx distribution hub which houses the Fulton Street Seafood Market, Anheuser-Busch, and other food and beverage institutions.
Krasdale distributes food and consumer goods to more than 280 supermarkets in New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Florida under the CTown, Bravo, Aim, Market Fresh, Shop Smart Food Markets and Stop 1 Food Mart brand names. The Hunt’s Point distribution facility sees up to 45 inbound trailers and up to 80 outbound tractor trailer trucks enter and leave its facility each day, Lebiak said.

The Canadian solar market grew by over 75% in 2022 compared to 2021 and is set to accelerate further with the Canadian government’s goal of making its electric grid net zero by 2035, spurring $20.9 billion in tax incentives for clean energy projects over the next six years.
The Hi-MO 7 module was launched globally in May at the SNEC tradeshow in Shanghai. Longi reports that the new product, a 580-Watt module, is based on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells, M10 wafers and high-performance hybrid passivity (HPDC) dual junction technology.
It measures 89.68 inches by 44.4 inches by 1.18 inches and weighs 70 pounds. It features 2.0 mm of dual glass, an anodized aluminum frame, and an IP68 rating, which can withstand dust and up to 4.9 feet of water. The temperature coefficient is -0.28% per C.
The new series comes in seven versions, with power outputs between 560 W and 590 W. The power conversion efficiency ranges between 21.7% and 22.8%. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 50.89 V to 51.63 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.89 A and 14.1 38.
The panels can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V. The company offers a 12-year product guarantee and 30-year power output guarantee for 88.18% of the initial yield.
“We are thrilled to introduce the Hi-MO 7 PV module to the Canadian market,” said Steven Chan, head of Longi Solar North America. “Canada has emerged as a key player in the global transition to renewable energy, and LONGi is committed to supporting this transition by providing the industry’s highest-quality solar solutions. The Hi-MO 7 module showcases our dedication to solar technology innovation and reinforces our position as a leading provider of PV modules worldwide.”
Longi reports that its Hi-MO 7 module is made using advanced manufacturing processes that include stringent raw materials selection. Hi-MO 7 uses high-quality monocrystalline silicon wafers, optimized module encapsulation and cell paste, SMBB high-precision interconnection, and intelligent automatic junction box welding technology. Longi’s digitalized manufacturing and quality control platforms incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) detection technology, which the company says ensures quality.
The Hi-MO 7 module comes in a high-strength aluminum alloy frame for enhanced durability and load capacity, which Longi reports enables the module to withstand heavy snow loads and high wind pressures, ensuring exceptional performance and durability in the cold weather climates of Canada. Hi-MO 7’s superior HPDC bifaciality is at approximately 80%, which improves power production.
“After Longi’s rigorous 18-month evaluation, development and testing program, this module not only significantly improves module efficiency, but it also brings world-leading product quality and long-term reliability,” said CJ Fu, director of product solutions at Longi Solar North America. “The new design brings down the LCOE by 3%-4% compared to system design utilizing mainstream PERC modules, reducing costs associated with balance of system and AC terminal equipment as well as overall operation and maintenance costs throughout the project lifecycle.”
Despite seeing 2022 pricing pressure as the cost of polysilicon rose, Longi shipped 46.8 GW of silicon modules, representing three years of sequential growth from 24.5 GW shipped in 2020. For Q1 2023, Longi recorded $4.09 billion of revenue, up 52.35% from the comparable quarter a year ago.
Longi is exhibiting at the Global Energy Show 2023 from June 13 to 15 at the BMO Centre at Stampede Park in Calgary at Booth 1227, where Longi experts will be on hand to discuss the company’s complete portfolio, including the Hi-MO 5 and Hi-MO 7 products for various application scenarios. Hi-MO 7 capacity is available for immediate delivery in Canada.

The $13.5 million program, including $10 million from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal achieving a 100% clean electricity grid by 2035.
“President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is accelerating the clean energy transition, resulting in the creation of hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and boosting our growing clean energy economy,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “That’s why DOE is working to jump-start solar energy careers, especially in underserved communities, developing the long-term structures needed to deliver these jobs over the next decade.”
In order to reach SEIA’s Solar+ Decade target of solar making up 30% of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030, SEIA estimates that the solar and storage industries will need an estimated 800,000 new workers for a total workforce of more than 1 million. DOE estimates that as many as 1.5 million workers will be need by 2035 to achieve the Biden-Harris Administration’s decarbonization goals.
The U.S. Energy and Employment Report found that while the solar industry is more diverse than some other energy industries, the overall energy workforce lags in Hispanic (17%), Black (8%), and Indigenous worker (1%) representation. With solar power potentially contributing up to one third of the U.S. electricity supply, there is a need for more equity and inclusivity in the industry. The Advancing Equity through Workforce Partnerships Funding Program selections address the need for diversity and inclusion. The selectees include partners from industry, tribal organizations, unions, community colleges, and state and local governments.
Before funding is issued, DOE and the applicants will undergo a negotiation process, and DOE may cancel negotiations and rescind the selection for any reason during that time. Selection for award negotiations is not a commitment by DOE to issue an award or provide funding.

The firm intends to develop rooftop community solar assets 5 MW in capacity, while developing ground mount facilities with up to 25 MW capacity.
According to the company’s press release, the industrial rooftops should be 500,000 square feet or larger, and located on relatively new structures. For ground mount community solar, they’ll see parcels near population centers of approximately 30 acres. The Crow Holdings Renewables team already has projects, and is seeking more, in California, New Jersey, Maryland, and Illinois, with additional markets to follow.
By next year, the company aims to have 50 MW of solar projects in their portfolio. Laurance Pelosi, a senior managing director at Crow Holdings and the nephew of Nancy Pelosi, predicts that the firm’s solar assets under development will double annually for the ‘foreseeable future’. He pointed out that less than 5% of all commercial real estate currently incorporates solar, representing the most significant solar opportunity in the United States.
Moreover, the group announced they would extend their development services to other rooftop asset owners.
The press release mentioned that the Crow Industrial team has already developed more than 68 million square feet of industrial facilities. While the private firm does not disclose specific data, a report from 2020 disclosed that the company had developed 60 properties and 23 million square feet of industrial space since 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2019, it had 8 million square feet under construction.
Another entity under Crow Holdings, Trammell Crow Residential, has constructed over 280,000 multifamily residential units. 
Crow Holdings was originally established by Trammal Crow. His son, Harlen Crow, expanded the business considerably after taking over. Harlan currently serves as the chairman of the board, and previously served as chief executive officer.
Harlan Crow recently drew attention as a fervent supporter of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and a collector of various controversial military society artifacts.
