What’s unique about this energy storage system is that it uses the common alkaline battery.
Previously the home was using lead-acid batteries to back up the solar energy system, but recently Urban Electric Power replaced those as part of the demonstration project of its rechargeable alkalines. The new installation stores enough electricity from the solar array to power the home for several days between recharges. With summer temperatures spiking over 100 degrees in recent weeks, the alkaline batteries are holding up well, as they have been tested to operate at more than 122 F.
The advantage of alkaline batteries over lead acid is that alkalines don’t require regularly refilling the batteries with electrolyte as flooded lead-acid batteries do. The alkalines have been demonstrated to last up to eight years with minimal capacity fade.
“We can provide long life with no maintenance, as shown by the IEC Solar Protocol testing,” said Gabriel Cowles, VP of commercial strategy and finance Urban Electric Power. “It’s the best of both worlds.” In addition, the standard zinc-manganese dioxide chemistry of these alkaline batteries is certified to pose no risk of “thermal runaway,” or hot, hard-to-extinguish fires, a problem that can face lithium batteries.
More than 15,000 residents live without grid-supplied electricity on the Navajo Nation, which spans 17.5 million acres across parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. To address their needs, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has installed 500 solar PV and energy storage systems to date. The Authority takes a three-pronged approach to deploying the solar systems, which is “safety, reliability, and efficiency,” according to Derrick Terry, renewable energy specialist for the Authority and a member of the Navajo Nation. The Authority has had a 30-year partnership with Sandia, which Terry said helps “with the latest knowledge and technical advisement, so that we can deliver these systems to our remote families.”

Urban Electric Power, based in Pearl River, New York, was spun out of federal and state research fund sfrom the City University of New York Energy Institute. The company’s focus is to transform the traditional alkaline battery, such as the AA, into a rechargeable that meets the needs of changing energy infrastructure. The battery technology uses zinc and manganese dioxide, which are both earth abundant and safe, and the batteries are aqueous, making them resistant to fire. Certified to UL standards, the batteries can be readily stacked to scale capacity and voltage for various market needs from residential power backup, to commercial, to industrial and utility-scale energy storage.
“Tribal projects are not only an obligation for DOE, but they provide valuable experience for off-grid applications in the US and abroad,” said Dr. Imre Gyuk, who directs the DOE Energy Storage Program Two more demonstration projects at Navajo homes are moving ahead with Urban Electric Power batteries.

The 15 MW Raptor Ridge solar array was commissioned this month at a 100-acre site in Tucson, Arizona and will supply power for the TEP GoSolar Home program, which provides a renewable energy option for renters and homeowners, including those whose rooftops are shaded by trees or nearby buildings.
The Solar FlexRack trackers are supporting  35,500 bifacial modules, which were installed by Sturgeon Electric Company and MYR Energy Services, Inc. Construction on the project began in Aug. 2021, and the project was completed just after its initial target date of May 2022.
“We selected Solar FlexRack from many solar racking options because of their engineering expertise and solar tracker architecture with minimal backside shading design, well suited for bifacial modules,” said Jeff Krauss, TEP’s manager of Community Scale Renewable Resources. “In a challenging market environment where supply chain issues have delayed other large solar projects, Solar FlexRack demonstrated their commitment to customer service by honoring agreements and delivering product on time. We are excited to bring this community-scale solar project online and Solar FlexRack is a big part of TEP’s success at Raptor Ridge.”
TEP’s GoSolar Home community-based solar program allows customers to pay a fee to buy power from a dedicated solar facilities and receive a fixed bill for up to 10 years. In Aug. 2021, regulators approved extending the program to renters and and also expanding the facility supporting the program by 10 MW, a move that is expected to clear the 500+ customer waiting list that existed prior to the expansion. As of that point, the program was fully subscribed at 841 participants, according to local news reports.
Also in Aug. 2021, Solar FlexRack announced  it supplied solar trackers and mounting technology to Swinerton Renewable Energy for 80 MW of distributed generation solar projects.
Located in Connecticut, California and Illinois, 30 MW of projects will use Solar FlexRack’s TDP 1.0 and TDP 2.0 Solar Trackers in 11 community solar projects.  That adds to an earlier 50 MW of completed solar projects between the two companies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/30/three-million-u-s-jobs-are-dedicated-to-decarbonizing-energy/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 30, 2022",Three million U.S. jobs are dedicated to decarbonizing energy,"The energy sector employs 7.8 million people in the United States, and about 41% of those jobs, about 3.1 million people, are dedicated to net-zero technologies. This, and other insights were shared in the U.S. Energy and Employment Report run by the Department of Energy.
Energy jobs grew at a faster rate than the overall job market in 2021, increasing 4% versus the 2.8% increase experienced nationwide. Solar jobs led the way for generation technologies, adding 17,212 jobs, an increase of 5.4%.
Solar was followed by wind, which added 3,347 jobs, a 2.9% boost, and hydropower, which added 1,383 jobs, an increase of 2.2%.
Transmission, distribution, and storage sectors employed 1.3 million people in 2021. Traditional transmission and distribution jobs increased by 13,008, a 1.4% increase. Battery jobs grew by 4.4%, increasing in both grid storage and electric vehicle sectors, adding 2,949 jobs. Smart grid jobs increased 4.9%, adding 1,136 jobs.
Fossil fuels have continued to decrease in employment as the global economy works to transition to emissions-free energy. U.S. petroleum jobs fell sharply by 6.4%, shedding 31,593 jobs. Both onshore and offshore industries were impacted by the losses. The coal fuel industry declined by the greatest percentage, losing 7,125 jobs, 11.8% of the sector.
The nuclear industry also declined in employment, shedding 4.2% of jobs, representing 2,440 jobs.
Energy efficiency is another key element in the energy transition, and it employs over 2.1 million U.S. workers. The sector added 57,741 jobs in 2021. Traditional HVAC jobs added the most workers (17,740), followed by Energy Star appliance and service jobs (12,941), and renewable heating and cooling jobs (4,027).
The electric vehicle boom is well underway, with the full electric battery vehicle sector increasing by an impressive 26.2%. That sector added 21,961 jobs, while the hybrid vehicle sector grew by 19.7%, adding 23,577 jobs.
Unions hold a more significant position in the energy sector than the broader job market, representing 10% of all 2021 energy jobs versus 6% of the private sector overall.
This March, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said the world will need 5.2 TW of solar power generation capacity by 2030, and 14TW by mid-century, to have any chance of limiting global average temperature rises this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a critical threshold in limiting the worst effects of climate change.
IRENA estimated the 12 million global job losses it anticipates in the fossil fuel and nuclear industries will be comfortably outweighed by “close to” 85 million new energy-transition roles this decade, including 26.5 million in clean energy.

“In the de-occupied territories most affected by the Russians, there are problems with electricity, and Tesla Powerwall stations provide backup power during power outages,” said Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov.
Solar power systems are being deployed mostly to prevent blackouts and to protect critical infrastructure such as hospitals, said Olga Sukhopara, development director of the Ukrainian Association of Renewable Energy.
“After the liberation of the north of Ukraine, a lot of power grid lines were damaged or destroyed due to hostilities,” Sukhopara said, adding that all damaged grid lines in the region have been restored.
Commercial rooftops and façade solar PV have become popular in recent years as a way to save on energy bills, said Sukhopara.
“Cross-subsidizing in the electricity sector still exists in Ukraine: tariffs for households are state-regulated, while business pays market price for electricity which is on average three times higher than for households,” she said. “That’s why businesses started installing solar systems for their own consumption more often – to lower energy bills and to provide themselves with electricity at fixed price years ahead.”
Ukraine’s solar industry is mostly focused on survival now, and not on further development. The aim is to avoid going bankrupt under constant curtailment and lower feed-in-tariff payments, said Sukhopara.
“Work is underway to amend the legislation on free access to the electricity market for RES producers,” she said. “We also hope to start exporting green electricity to the EU in the near future.”

Faster, lower-cost interconnection by combining ERCOT, MISO, PJM approaches ERCOT’s approach enables interconnection in 2 to 3 years, whereas recent regional transmission planning by MISO and PJM found cost-saving ways to interconnect 53 GW and 75 GW of renewables respectively, said a Brattle transmission expert.
CleanCapital acquires BQ Energy Looking to expand from its role as long-term owner to a more comprehensive development and origination model, CleanCapital has acquired the landfill and brownfield developer, as well as its 1 GW project pipeline.
How a FERC decision could unleash solar and storage deployment FERC’s proposal could open up the interconnection backlog and pave the way for solar and storage projects to be completed more quickly, resulting in much more solar and storage being deployed, and moving us closer to meeting our climate and energy goals.
