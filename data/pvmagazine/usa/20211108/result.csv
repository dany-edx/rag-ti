CCAs help communities exercise control over their electricity sources, demand more green power, and negotiate lower electricity prices. Demand aggregation gives communities greater leverage when conducting these negotiations.
Roughly 9% of all nationwide voluntary green power sales in 2016 were attributed to CCA’s, said NREL.
The first CCA legislation was passed in Massachusetts in 1997, and in 2016, over 8.7 billion kWh of clean power was delivered to about 3.3 million customers across the seven U.S. states that have approved its use, said the EPA
To create CCA legislation, local governments must hold public hearings and then pass law that authorizes the CCA. Homes, businesses, and municipal sites in an approved jurisdiction may qualify, depending on the design of the CCA law.
CCA participation is always voluntary. Most programs have opt-out provisions, so that when a community begins a program, customers are given advanced notice and have the choice to opt-out of the CCA and continue to receive electricity from their conventional supplier. Generally, customers who do not opt-out are automatically enrolled.
Many CCAs have a tiered structure. There is often a standard option that automatically enrolls customers, and an optional tier that has a higher (sometimes 100%) renewable energy supply, usually at a premium rate. The power is typically sourced from locally-sited renewable energy sources.
Electricity prices of CCA members are often 15-20% lower than residential retail prices for electricity, said EPA.
One advantage for customers is the ability to reduce their utility bill rates and opt-in for a higher proportion of renewable energy. Control of electricity generation is localized, which means municipalities can be more sensitive and responsive to local economic and environmental goals, said the EPA.
CCAs represent an expansion of consumer choices, and can spur local jobs, particularly in renewable energy development.
CCAs do, however, come with their set of issues.  These programs require successful navigation of various regulations placed on CCAs, and appropriate ordinances must be passed for the programs to launch properly. This complexity can lead to higher administrative costs, which can place some burden on municipal budgets and bandwidth.
The opt-in and opt-out clauses can also be a cause of confusion for some consumers, said the EPA. Community solar programs or residential solar ownership or leases are often more easily understood by homeowners making energy decisions.
The Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimated that in 2017, CCAs procured about 8.9 million MWh of voluntary green power, representing 21% of CCA sales. While this is a far cry from the 100% renewable energy a home solar or community solar program can provide, the figure is nearly double the rate that the U.S. saw for renewable energy end consumption in 2017, which was 10.6%.
About 13% of CCAs offer voluntary green power. New Jersey and Rhode Island do not have voluntary green power options as their CCAs are primarily focused on leveraging lower energy prices.

Roughly 9% of all nationwide voluntary green power sales in 2016 were attributed to CCA’s, said NREL. Colorado, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah have all considered CCA legislation, and NREL estimates these states could open voluntary green power options to an additional 18 million Americans.
NREL identified several key challenges to CCAs and their efficacy going forward. For one, maintaining cost savings in the long run may be difficult. Thus far, CCAs have largely been able to stay beneath utility prices, but they run the risk of opt-outs and lessened leverage if they cannot remain price-competitive.
There is also a balancing act that must be played between local autonomy and regional cooperation. Communities face tradeoffs in CCAs, where local aggregation of a single jurisdiction yields higher levels of autonomy over supply and rates, while aggregating across several jurisdictions can yield economies of scale and allow CCAs to offer more services. California has seen a rise in larger aggregation of jurisdictions, with joint power agreements being facilitated by state and national organizations.
For CCAs in restructured electricity markets, inability to sign long-term contracts poses a challenge to local renewable energy procurement. However, CCAs in restructured markets are exploring and implementing innovative ways to procure local renewables, such as through community solar and trust funds for local projects.
While a CCA does not provide the personal autonomy of solar ownership, it represents one more option at the disposal of homeowners and businesses to find alternative ways to source their energy.

Applicable projects will be 3 MW or greater in size, and would reach in-service dates in 2023 and 2024.
The utility has 2700 MW of active renewable energy in its portfolio, with another 2,700 MW set to come online by the end of 2024.
The request for proposal, or the 23-24 RFP, is the second of two utility-scale solicitations from Georgia Power’s 2019 integrated resource plan (IRP). The IRP authorized Georgia power to procure 2,000 MW of U.S.-based renewable energy.
Bids for the RFP will be accepted as soon as Q1 2022. Accion Group, Inc will serve as the independent evaluator. Both standalone generation and co-located generation-plus-storage applications will be accepted, said Georgia Power. Interested parties are encouraged to visit the Accion website to review RFP and power purchase agreement (PPA) documentation.
Georgia ranks 9th nationally in solar capacity installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA reports 3.65% of Georgia’s energy mix comes from solar, and there is enough PV installed to support the equivalent of 374,248 homes.

The program is aptly dubbed the Twin Cities Area Solar Co-op.
It is free to join the co-op for both homeowners and business owners. SUN educates the solar-curious in the costs and benefits of going solar, and connects the community to leverage greater numbers for better pricing. The organization also helps low-income homeowners access solar incentives for better affordability.
SUN runs a vendor-neutral competitive bidding process, and co-op participants select a solar company to perform the installation. The co-op in non-obligatory; members do not have to purchase solar once the bid is won and the installer selected.
In addition to residential solar systems, SUN connects co-op members to group rates for home electric vehicle charging.

SUN partnered with Minnesota Interfaith Power and Light, City of Minneapolis Sustainability Division, and Minnesota Renewable Energy Society in launching this program. The organization has played host to 15 co-ops across Minnesota since 2017, leading to about $3.3 million in solar investment in the state, said SUN.
Currently, the group is running a petition to U.S. Congress to include a 30 Million Solar Homes Plan. The organization estimates that such a plan could create 1.77 million U.S. jobs, bring consumers $69 million in savings, and cut total air and carbon pollution by 1.5%.

The researchers noted that base transceiver stations (BTS) are being built for 4G and 5G broadband cellular networks. And they said that off-grid PV systems are more frequently being used to provide the energy needed by these stations in isolated areas with no connection to power networks.

The scientists considered, through 3D modeling, an electromagnetic field with an energy of less than 12 eV, and a frequency ranging up to 3.10 Hz. Its field orientation was perpendicular to the junction of the solar cells. An isotropic antenna radiating power in free space was the emitting source.
The researchers said the presence of the magnetic field initially causes an increase in the PV system’s electric voltage and then makes the current produced by the solar panels decompose into two components.
“One is transferred to the external load, named the transferred current, and the other is lost in the pn junction,” they explained. “The magnetic field strength is weak, but it cannot be neglected and be deleted in the electromagnetic field produced by the BTS as assumed in some studies.”
Their analysis also showed that the variation of the electromagnetic field depends on the distance between the source and the PV system.
“In the presence of an electromagnetic field, an important current in the open circuit is created which can reach the short circuit situation current when the distance source-PV cell is weak,” the research team said, adding that the electromagnetic field is strong enough to cause an accumulation of the carrier’s charge at the junction by deflection. “That accumulation of the carrier’s charge will have an increase of the voltage as a consequence. Thus, the electric field is the main cause of the presence of the current in an open circuit situation.”
The academics said that the reported increase in the conduction current does not result in an improvement of the PV system efficiency. In turn, it causes an increase in the lost photocurrent density.
“The conduction current provides an increase of the current and contributes to the increase of the quantity of the extracted photocurrent of the solar cell,” they said. “The heating of the junction causes the quality degradation of the PV cell mainly due to the electric component.”
They said one should not install a solar power generator near an electromagnetic field emission source. They revealed their findings in “Polycrystalline Silicon PV Cell Efficiency in 3D Approximation versus Electromagnetic Field under Monochromatic Illumination,” which was recently published in International Journal of Photoenergy.

The project, sold via public auction, is set to be located in the northern Atlántico region of Colombia.
The energy produced by the system will be acquired by a pool of offtakers that signed an inflation-indexed, Colombian Peso-backed 15 year power purchase agreement. It is expected to begin delivering clean energy by 2023.
A consultation process with indigenous populations, “Consulta Previa,” was conducted, and now construction is set to begin by the second quarter of 2022.
This is the second Canadian Solar project win in Colombia. Previously the company was awarded with among the nation’s first utility-scale, stand-alone battery storage project, located in Barranquilla. The storage project is sized at 45 MWh.
“We seek to expand our diversified portfolio of solar PV and battery storage projects in this region and will continue to support the Colombian government’s targets to accelerate the deployment of clean, renewable energy,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO of Canadian solar.
Canadian solar is both a module manufacturer and developer of utility-scale solar and storage. Over the past two decades, it has delivered over 59 GW of PV modules. Since entering project development in 2010, the company has built and contracted over 6.1 GWp internationally. Currently, the Company has around 400 MWp of projects in operation, nearly 6 GWp of projects under construction or in backlog (late-stage), and an additional 16 GWp of projects in pipeline (mid- to early- stage).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/08/long-duration-thermal-storage-system-based-on-silica-sand/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 8, 2021",Long-duration thermal storage system based on silica sand,"Magaldi Green Energy, a unit of Italy-based dry bottom ash handling system provider Magaldi Power Spa, has developed a thermal storage system for long-duration storage based on a fluidized sand bed.
The Magaldi Green Thermal Energy Storage (MGTES) can be charged with renewable electricity or thermal energy such as waste heat generated by industrial thermal processes. Its discharge phase consists of the production of green thermal energy — steam or hot air — which can be used directly in industrial plants or for the generation of electricity using steam turbines. 
“Our storage technology can be used in the steam section of existing thermoelectric power plants based on the Rankine cycle or combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) plants,” Letizia Magaldi, executive vice president at Magaldi Green Energy, told pv magazine.
The system consists of a blower, a fluidization air blowing system, a fluidization air suction system, an air filter and fan, an air pre-heater, and an integrated thermal energy storage module. Silica sands are the system’s storage media.
The fluidization system is the core of the technology and is claimed to have high thermal diffusivity. The manufacturer ensures it is well insulated and that thermal losses are lower than 2% per day. The absence of convection and the insulation of the tank are said to limit the heat exchange with the outside of the casing, thus minimizing energy losses. The system is discharged by reversing the integrated heat exchanger within the fluidized bed and the stored energy is released as superheated steam.
The system’s operating temperature can reach up to 1,000 degrees Celsius and its roundtrip efficiency is reportedly over 90% for heat production and between 35 and 45% for electricity generation.
Magaldi Green Energy claims the MGTES has a 30-year lifetime and describes it as a customizable solution with different capacities. “By varying the mass of solid particles contained in each module, it is possible to configure a storage capacity between 5 and 100 MWh,” it further explained.
The system Capex is estimated by the company at around $65,000/MWh. “We expect to reduce costs by at least 50% over the next 10 years from economies of scale and design improvements,” Magaldi stated.
*The article was updated on November 5 to reflect that the system Capex is $65,000/MWh.
