Madison Gas will own 25 megawatts (MW) of solar energy and 7.5 MW of battery storage from the 325 MW solar plus storage facility, which was developed by Invenergy, a Chicago-based renewable energy developer.
WEC Energy Group subsidiaries We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service will own the remaining 225 MW of the solar output and 67.5 MW of battery storage from the project, which the PSC has not yet approved. The facility is expected to begin operating by December 2024.
“The Darien Solar Energy Center is another important step in our ongoing transition to cleaner energy sources, reducing carbon at least 80% by the end of this decade and achieving net-zero carbon electricity by 2050,” said Jeff Keebler, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Madison Gas.
WEC Energy has told the public that the Darien project is needed to help meet capacity requirements as the utility retires a fleet of 1.39 GW coal-fired power plants over the next four years.
Madison Gas is seeking to replace its share of the coal-fired Columbia Energy Center, which is scheduled to shut down by 2026, with renewable energy resources such as the Darien Energy Center.
Westwood Professional Services is the construction manager for the project.
Project Details
Located on 2,000 acres in the towns of Bradford and Darien, Wisconsin, the solar plus storage facility will use up to 850,000 solar panels and generate enough clean energy to power about 75,000 households.
Solar panels under consideration for use in the project include Canadian Solar, QCells, JA Solar, Jinko Solar, Longi, SunPower, Risen and Trina, according to documents submitted to the regulator by Invenergy affiliates.
The project developer favors bifacial silicon crystalline modules ranging from 350W to 600W DC per module. The developer highlighted the Jinko Eagle HC 72M-V and Longi LR4-72HBD as small to large case modules it may choose for the project.
For inverters, Invenergy flagged systems from Power Electronics (HEM), TMEIC (Solar Ware Ninja) and SMA Solar Technology (Sunny Central UP) for use in the project.
For trackers, the developer is evaluating products from Array Technologies, Soltec, Nextracker and FTC Solar for use in the Darien Energy Center.
Batteries for the storage system under evaluation range from 50 MWh to 200 MWh for the project.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Wisconsin ranked 26th in the country for solar deployments with 861 MW installed to date and 395 MW brought on in 2021 alone.  The state ranks 11th in the U.S. for growth projections with 4.93 GW to be installed over the next five years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/09/greenbacker-grows-operational-renewable-energy-capacity-61-year-over-year/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 9, 2022",Greenbacker grows operational renewable energy capacity 61% year-over-year,"Greenbacker posted its Q3, 2022 results, reporting a 61% year-over-year growth in its operational asset capacity. The independent power producer and climate technology investment manager raised nearly $60 million in capital in three months through September 30, 2022.
Assets under management by Greenbacker (GCM) are now valued at $2.8 billion through Q3. The company’s renewable energy fleet, consisting of solar, energy storage, and wind projects, added 31 assets with a combined capacity of 171 MW.
Total operating revenues exceeded $45 million, and net losses totaled $4.6 million. The company’s adjusted EBITDA was $14.6 million and it reported $5.4 million funds from operations.
The company’s operating solar fleet includes 270 assets combining for 788 MW of capacity. This unit generated $19.3 million in power purchase agreement revenue from 361,551 MWh of production in-quarter.
Greenbacker’s wind fleet includes 16 operational assets with 386 MW of capacity, generating $13.9 million in power purchase agreement revenues from 250,074 MWh of production through three months.
The power-generation capacity of Greenbacker’s operational fleet increased over 450 MW year-over-year. Through three quarters 2022, its assets produced 1.8 billion kWh of electricity, exceeding its 2021 total.
“Greenbacker’s performance this quarter reaffirms our position as a leader in the renewable energy industry throughout market cycles. GCM is now managing four investment vehicles and GREC’s [Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company] operational capacity continues to expand—this quarter alone, our fleet entered two new markets—allowing us to generate greater value for our investors,” said Charles Wheeler, chief executive officer, Greenbacker.
Greenbacker also expanded into new territory, acquiring its first solar facility in Virginia. The company now operates in 33 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Washington D.C.
The company had a notable acquisition of up to nine pre-operational Vermont solar projects in the third quarter. The projects are expected to lower power bills for local farmers and give new life to brownfield sites restricted from most uses. The projects have long-term net metering agreements in place with over 30 agricultural offtakers comprised of local farms and dairies across the state. The net metering aspect of the portfolio means that the utility will reduce the offtakers’ power bills by the amount of clean energy the projects supply to the grid. Each solar project is expected, on average, to save local farmers approximately $500,000 on energy costs over the lifecycle of the projects.
New reporting methodology
The company transitioned the basis of its historical accounting and the underlying presentation of its financial results from investment company accounting to non-investment company accounting. This third quarter report is under the new accounting format. Greenbacker’s Independent Power Producer (“IPP”) represents the active management and operations of renewable energy assets, including those that are currently pre-operational. The IPP business generally earns revenue from the sale of generated electricity and through the sale of other commodities such as renewable energy credits (“REC”).
Greenbacker’s Investment Management (IM) segment represents the company’s investment management platform – a climate focused investment management company with fund formation, capital raising, asset acquisition, financing, consulting and development capabilities that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser. The company’s platform will allow it to raise and deploy capital for the managed funds – consistent with its stated mission and expanding our ability to positively impact social and environmental challenges.

BLM said they are expanding on their “programmatic” process to move renewable projects through the development process that was produced in 2012. A formal version of the review – partially considered in this document – will be published for the general public.
There are 32 exclusion categories used in the programmatic review process.
One of these categories is used to define the 79 million acres where projects are forbidden, the 285,000 acres where solar is desired (Solar Energy Zones, or SEZ), and the 19 million acres of land available for development outside of SEZs and exclusion zones, for which availability is contingent on due diligence and a responsible proposal.
The BLM is considering whether they should add the 22 million acres of California’s Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan to their analysis area. Another exclusion under review is whether they should adjust the requirement stating that solar plants may only be built on areas with insolation values above 6.5 kWh/m2/day. That requirement was based on solar technology and pricing from before 2012.

In addition to the development support plan, BLM announced that they would begin reviewing three facilities in Arizona totaling 1 GWac.
An environmental analysis will soon begin on the first of the facilities, the Jove Solar Project. This facility will be deployed on 3,495 acres of land and have a capacity of up to 600 MWac. The power plant will be located in La Paz County.
Though the documents do not explicitly describe the facility’s ownership, it looks like Taurus Solar LLC owns the Jove Solar project, and that Jove used to be called Taurus Solar. Some of the documents, like the site plan below, still reference Taurus, but have the same outline as the Jove facility. All of these documents are made available on the BLM link above.
Image: BLM, Project Site Plan
The ownership chain of title is long on this project: the solar farm is owned by Taurus Solar LLC, which is fully owned by 174 PG LLC, a fully owned subsidiary of the Hanwha Energy USA Holdings Corp., which is presumably owned in some manner by the South Korean Hanwha Group global conglomerate.
In the Project Area Map above, the straight line bisecting the solar plant from east to west is a pipeline. The nearly horizontal line at the top of the map is I-10, which runs parallel to the proposed 500 KV transmission line. Note the proposed interconnection point at the top left corner, which will be built to connect the solar facility to the power grid.
The other two facilities – a 300 MWac Pinyon Solar project in Maricopa County owned by Avantus (formerly known as 8 Minute Solar Energy), and a 300 MWac Elisabeth Solar project in Yuma County – are still in early stages of development.
 
This article was amended on December 12, 2022 to reflect that the Pinyon Solar project is a 300 MW facility, rather than 250 MW as previously stated.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives will drive an increased pace of renewable deployment, NREL projects, as shown by the black line at the top of the nearby image. Other lines in the image show NREL’s projections from prior years, when there were no IRA incentives.

NREL also projects that through 2035, fossil generation will decline, nuclear generation will remain the same, carbon capture and storage (CCS) will be deployed at some natural gas units, and seasonal storage of renewable power will not be deployed.
These results reflect NREL’s mid-case scenario, which assumed central values for technology costs and fuel prices, demand growth of 1.3% per year, current state and federal policies, no high-voltage direct current transmission, the option to deploy some “nascent” technologies such as CCS, and “default” resource constraints.
NREL developed 70 scenarios overall, by varying projected technology and fuel prices, resource availability, demand growth due to electrification, the use of nascent generation technologies, and whether a national decarbonization constraint is instituted.
NREL presents its mid-case projections in a report, and presents all 70 scenarios through an online scenario viewer. NREL added that its recent study on reaching 100% clean electricity by 2035 considers additional technologies that could be deployed.
NREL projects that expiration of IRA tax credits sometime in the 2030s would result in a decline in the renewable share of generation from that time onward, as shown in the image above, and that electricity sector carbon dioxide emissions would consequently increase, as shown in the nearby image. “These reversals” would not occur, NREL projects, if decarbonization trajectories were enacted under new policies when the tax credits expire. 

The study also evaluated renewable curtailment, projecting it will decline from the current level of nearly 10%, and will stay lower than 10% in nearly all scenarios.
The report includes cost projections for small modular reactors, and for CCS retrofits of fossil generating units.
NREL will present a webinar on the study on January 10. The report is titled “2022 Standard Scenarios Report: A U.S. Electricity Sector Outlook.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/09/solar-cell-fabrics-to-power-every-surface/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 9, 2022",Solar cell fabrics to power every surface,"A research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has developed a technique to print durable, flexible solar cells that are thinner than a human hair. The lightweight PV can be easily affixed to any surface like a sticker, quickly turning any surface to a productive renewable energy generator.
The cells are one-hundredth the weight of conventional solar panels and generate 18 times as much power-per-kilogram. They are made from nanomaterial semiconducting inks using printing processes that the researchers can readily scale for large-area manufacturing.
The fabric solar cells are 50 microns thin and achieve a specific power of 370 W per kg. For reference, a human hair is 70 microns thick.
The thin, lightweight solar cells have many potential applications, including integration into boat sails, adhered to the side of tents, or applied to the wings of drones. The MIT team deposited the printed solar cells on Dyneema fabric, a sturdy tarp-like substance popular in the ultralight hiking world, making the cells sturdy while not sacrificing the flexibility and light-weight properties.
“The metrics used to evaluate a new solar cell technology are typically limited to their power conversion efficiency and their cost in dollars-per-watt. Just as important is integrability — the ease with which the new technology can be adapted. The lightweight solar fabrics enable integrability, providing impetus for the current work. We strive to accelerate solar adoption, given the present urgent need to deploy new carbon-free sources of energy,” says Vladimir Bulović, MIT researcher and senior author of the report.
Conventional solar cells are encapsulated in glass and aluminum frames, limiting where they can be installed. A typical Massachusetts rooftop solar installation is about 8 kW, adding about 1,000 lbs. to a roof. The Dyneema-affixed solar cell would only add 44 lbs. to produce the same amount of power.
The cells have resisted stress-tests well. After rolling and unrolling a fabric solar panel more than 500 times, the cells still retained more than 90% of their initial capacity.
In 2016, a team from ONE Lab produced solar cells using emergent thin-film materials that were lightweight enough to sit atop a soap bubble. However, the cells were manufactured using complex, vacuum-based processes, an expensive and challenging task to scale up. The new MIT-developed solar fabrics are entirely printable, making them scalable for large-area production.
The cells are made with printed electronic inks, coating the solar cell structure using a slot-die coaster, which deposits layers of electronic materials onto a prepared, resealable substrate. Using a screen-printing process similar to T-shirt design printing, an electrode is deposited on the structure to complete a solar module. The module is then peeled from the substrate, and later affixed to the Dyneema fabric for stability.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/09/usda-provides-funding-to-solar-powered-agricultural-dehydrator/,"MARKETING,PRODUCTS,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,INDIANA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 9, 2022",USDA provides funding to solar-powered agricultural dehydrator,"JUA Technologies, an agriculture technology start-up that manufactures solar-powered crop dehydrators, has received a two-year, $600,000 Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop its technology.
The goal of the Phase II project, titled Smart Multipurpose Solar Dehydration Device for Value Addition to Specialty Crops, is proof of concept toward product-design improvements and design for the company’s production of a multipurpose solar dryer, called Dehymeleon.
“It is an energy-intensive process with huge operating costs because food dehydrators are typically powered by gas, electricity or fuel oil,” said Dr. Klein E. Ileleji, chief executive officer and co-founder of JUA Technologies, and also a professor of agricultural and biological engineering at Purdue University. “The high operating cost limits the ability of small and midsize growers and processors in the U.S. to produce dehydrated foods. Small growers and processors are vital to the local foods and urban agriculture industry, which is currently a $1 billion and growing industry in the U.S.”

In developing tropical countries, where post-harvest losses of horticultural produce can be as high as 50%, dehydrating foods using solar energy will not only help support nutrition security but also provide growers an opportunity to increase their income from value-added processing.
Ileleji said dehydrating fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices, and medicinal plants still occurs using primitive, open sun-drying methods on mats or trays that degrade nutrients and reduce food quality.
“While there are a lot of solar dryer designs available in literature and online, none of them have been commercialized or utilized in large numbers,” Ileleji said.
JUA Technologies’ proposed high-efficiency multipurpose solar dehydrator fits the USDA’s and National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s priorities in four ways:

The USDA SBIR grant will cover four research and development goals. Ileleji said the goals will be addressed by JUA Technologies and contracted manufacturing and product engineering design firms:
In January 2021, Ileleji incorporated Dehytech East Africa Limited as a subsidiary of JUA Technologies. Dehytech is responsible for the import, distribution, marketing, sales and coordination of training and technical services for JUA Technologies’ solar food dryers, Dehytray and other products serving the East Africa region.
In 2019, JUA Technologies received an initial $100,000 SBIR Phase I grant from the USDA and a $50,000 investment from Elevate Ventures.
This year the U.S. Small Business Administration recognized Ileleji as the Indiana and the Great Lakes Regional Exporter of the Year, for the deployment of its portable solar dehydrator, Dehytray.
“Both the Dehytray and Dehymeleon technologies spun out from a United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-supported effort called Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Processing and Post-Harvest Handling,” Ileleji said. “It was a multi-institutional effort led by Purdue University to reduce postharvest loss, promote economic growth, improve nutrition and enhance food security in Feed the Future target countries.
West Lafayette, Indiana-based JUA Technologies was formed in 2016 by Dr. Ileleji and wife Dr. Reiko Ileleji  as an affiliate of the Purdue Foundry. The company’s PV-enabled dehydrating technologies are designed for households, small and mid-sized agriculture processes and growing.
Its first product, the Dehytray, has been sold in 28 states as well as more than 10 countries, and retails for about $139.50 on the company’s website and various retailers such as Walmart. In 2017, the company’s prototype technology was among the Top 10 innovations to receive awards at the first All-African Post-Harvest Congress and Exhibit, held in Nairobi, Kenya.

Growatt has unveiled its new SPF 6000 ES Plus inverters for residential off-grid solar power systems.
“The inverter’s string input current reaches up to 16A, making it compatible with 500W+ large power PV modules,” the manufacturer said. “The inverter includes dual MPP trackers for houses with multiple rooftop areas, supporting panel installation at different orientations and higher energy generation.”
The 6 kW inverters have an efficiency rating of 93% and 12,000 VA of surge power. They also feature input voltage of up to 500 V and 8 kW of PV input power.
The inverters are housed in IP20 enclosures and measure 460 mm x 395 mm x 132 mm. They weigh 15.5 kg. Their operating ambient temperature ranges from 0 C to 50 C, with an integrated automatic transfer switch (ATS) and two AC terminals for power input.
“In terms of performance and reliability, the new product has a power factor of 1.0 that allows the system to draw a power output of 6kW for the loads and 2kW for charging the battery when solar energy is sufficient,” said the Chinese inverter maker. “Also, by adding the dust-proof design, it prevents faults caused by excessive dust and improves product reliability, making maintenance easier while extending its operational lifespan.”
In April Growatt announced the Infinity 1500, a portable power station for off-grid applications. And a year ago the company launched the AXE LV, a residential, cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for off-grid applications.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/09/the-u-s-commerce-department-must-reverse-its-misguided-solar-tariff-decision/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 9, 2022",The U.S commerce department must reverse its misguided solar tariff decision ,"The U.S. Commerce Department’s preliminary decision on the Auxin Solar Anti-Dumping/Countervailing Duties (AD/CVD) case is not good for the solar industry. By extension, it is not good for our country or our communities. Solar is one of our best tools for reducing carbon emissions. Solar provides a significant boost to our economy, creating good local jobs that can’t be outsourced. And, when paired with energy storage, solar increases resilience for our communities in the face of increasing natural disasters exacerbated by climate change.
The world is not yet on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, but solar can help us change that trajectory. The U.S. can play a big role, but to lower carbon emissions sufficiently and achieve our country’s climate goals, we have to deploy 70 GW of solar a year in the next few years.
At this critical moment in the fight against climate change, we need more solar, not less. The Commerce Department’s decision will slow down solar deployment at a time when we must rapidly accelerate it.
Even before last week’s decision, the AD/CVD case had put a serious damper on the solar industry. In anticipation that the December preliminary decision could impose retroactive tariffs, many manufacturers immediately halted shipments to the U.S.  Our industry, already dealing with pandemic-related supply chain and labor issues, saw 24% less solar capacity installed in Q1 2022 than in the same quarter last year. This is the opposite of what was expected and the opposite of what should be happening.
Solar jobs have been growing five times faster than the overall economy and more rapidly than jobs in other energy sectors. Solar installations in 2021 broke records despite the pandemic. But the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimated that the AD/CVD case could result in 70,000 job losses and a 46% decrease in solar installations this year and next. Even domestic solar manufacturers anticipated negative impacts from the case.
What makes this even worse is that trade cases generally have little to no positive impact on domestic manufacturing. What does make an impact is supportive legislation. We have that now in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which SEIA expects to lead to a “renaissance in American solar manufacturing.” However, the effects of the IRA will not be immediate. It takes time for a solar panel factory to get up and running. SEIA has been clear that even with the IRA, it will be 2030 before U.S. domestic solar manufacturing reaches the capacity we need for the industry goal of 50 GW.
The Biden Administration’s two-year halt on tariffs, which did provide a reprieve from the worst effects of the AD/CVD case, will only take us to June 2024. That is simply not enough time to establish a robust solar manufacturing capacity in the U.S., which currently produces about 7.5 GW of solar panels yearly. The IRA could increase that number to 15 GW in the next two years, but that would still not be nearly enough capacity to rely solely on domestic panels.
The preliminary Commerce decision could have been worse. The decision did not target all imports from the countries cited in the case, and it left room for companies in those countries to certify that they are not circumventing the AD/CVD orders. But it remains to be seen what will be involved in the certification process. And as SEIA noted, the decision will still “strand billions of dollars’ worth of American clean energy investments and result in the significant loss of good-paying, American, clean energy jobs.”
Just a little over a year ago, the Commerce Department ruled that a similar trade petition had no merit. The current case is based on the false claim that solar cell manufacturing is a minor or insignificant operation in the countries cited; the reality in those countries is that solar manufacturing by far exceeds what is considered minor or insignificant according to the anti-circumvention statute.
With long-term projects making up a significant portion of the solar industry, we need long-term policy certainty, a robust supply chain, and predictable prices. The disruptive AD/CVD case has caused a serious distraction and impediment for our industry at a time when we should be seeing expansive growth.
It’s not too late to change course on this misguided preliminary ruling. Commerce’s final decision on the case is expected in May 2023. The Department can fix its mistake by amending it. If necessary, the Biden Administration can step in again to extend the tariff moratorium. Our nation’s clean energy goals are riding on this.
We must all pull together now to ensure that this baseless case brought by one small solar company does not derail an entire industry. This is the time for solar to shine, and we need to ensure the conditions are right for that to happen.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/09/doe-announces-8-million-for-six-agrivoltaic-research-projects/,"RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 9, 2022",DOE announces $8 million for six agrivoltaic research projects,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the Foundational Agrivoltaic Research for Megawatt Scale (FARMS) funding, which has allocated $8 million for six solar energy research projects across six states and the District of Columbia. The projects are intended to provide new economic opportunities for farmers, rural communities, and the solar industry. The funding supports agrivoltaics, defined as the co-location of solar energy generation and agricultural production, which can include traditional crops as well as livestock grazing and pollinator gardens.
“DOE’s research into agrivoltaics provides an incredible opportunity to pair solar energy generation with safe and robust crop production—ensuring rural communities reap the full economic benefits of a clean energy future,” said Jennifer M. Granholm, U.S. Secretary of Energy. “With these exciting projects, we’re supporting sustainable agriculture and investing in the technologies that enable us to make our climate goals a reality—a win-win for our planet and hardworking farmers coast to coast.”
In the U.S., less than 2% of solar energy projects are co-located with crops or pollinator habitats. NREL’s main research project on agrivoltaics, called Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE), developed a financial calculator to quantify the benefits of the practice. It also developed a list of best practices for those interested in entering the field. Additionally, InSPIRE tracks all the active agrivoltaics site across the U.S., which can be found here. The FARMS funding program goes a step further by seeking to develop replicable models for agrivoltaics that can provide new economic opportunities while potentially reducing land-use conflicts. DOE also wants to make agrivoltaic projects lower cost and easier to adopt, thus maximizing benefits for farmers, rural communities, and the solar industry.
The projects will examine multiple configurations of solar system design, crops and cultivation methods, and soil and environmental conditions. Researchers will work with agricultural extensions and develop resources to spread the best practices to farmers and communities.
The Solar and Storage Industries Institute (S12) project intends to reduce deployment barriers for large-scale agrivoltaic projects and maximize benefits for farmers, solar firms and utility cooperatives.
“Co-locating solar and farms has the potential to remedy some of the recent land issues that have threatened to undermine widespread clean energy deployment,” said David Gahl, executive director of SI2. “At the moment, agrivoltaics is a nascent market, but with the right resources and guidance this new market could take off. This project will provide a strong foundation for the growth of agrivoltaics, and we look forward to working with the Department of Energy on this important work.”
S12’s project will feature a partnership between the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). This project will examine the economic and legal issues that solar developers and farm operations must understand to make responsible investments in agrivoltaics. Partners will then produce case studies and best practices guides for solar developers, farmers and decision makers.
By selecting awardees such as S12, which have large extension networks, DOE aims to enable more collaboration among farmers, rural communities, and the solar industry.
The six projects will conduct outreach to and engage with regional rural and farming communities, including Hispanic, Tribal, and immigrant farmers. These investments will advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, supporting President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which is an effort to ensure that Federal agencies work with states and local communities to make good on President Biden’s promise that at least 40% of the overall benefits from Federal investments in climate and clean energy go to disadvantaged communities.
