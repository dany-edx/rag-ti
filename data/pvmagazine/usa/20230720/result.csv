Using the app, Tesla drivers can ensure their vehicle is fully powered by local, emissions-free electricity. 
Following a few simple prompts, users can set charge limits and locations, charging the battery to a predefined level while relying only on electricity produced by the homeowner’s rooftop solar array. The app will enable the vehicle to adjust charge power approximately every 10 seconds to match the excess solar power and power consumption elsewhere in the home. Tesla vehicle may delay the start of  
The battery will delay charging until there is at least 1.2 kW of stable excess solar to maximize efficiency and lifetime of the charging equipment. This helps account for variability in solar power and home loads. 
The Charge on Solar feature is compatible with existing Powerwall battery charge schedules including: 
Charge on Solar is currently only available to customers who own a Powerwall and a Tesla vehicle in the U.S. and Canada.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/20/federal-agencies-urged-to-tap-25-gw-potential-of-solar-on-canals/,"INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 20, 2023",Federal agencies urged to tap 25 GW potential of solar on canals,"The U.S. Interior Department and the Bureau of Reclamation received a letter signed by over 125 groups urging the agencies to develop an initiative to develop solar facilities above federally owned and operated canals and aqueducts.
The request, signed by many leading climate and environmental groups, highlighted the opportunity to cover 8,000 miles of open-air canals with solar capacity. An estimated 25 GW of renewable energy, enough to power nearly 20 million homes, could be installed on these locations, the group said.
“The Bureau of Reclamation has full authority to execute this plan. Congress has provided the Department of the Interior with the clear authority to grant leases to authorize uses of Bureau of Reclamation lands, including for utilities, transmission lines, and other appropriate uses,” said the letter. 
Installing solar over canals comes with significant co-benefits. First, it saves public land from development. The Energy Act of 2020 created a mandate to deploy 25 GW of onshore renewable energy on public lands without destroying an additional acre of habitat. Covering Bureau of Reclamation canals alone could meet this goal.
Further, a solar canopy over canals leads to less water evaporation through shading and cooling. The groups estimate that tens of billions of gallons of freshwater evaporation could be reduced as a result. This may prove critical, as despite having a wet winter, much of the western United States remains in a long-term drought that is likely to worsen as climate change intensifies.
“The Bureau of Reclamation and the states dependent on the Colorado River are already considering unprecedented water cuts to protect the water supplies for 40 million people who rely on the river,” said the letter. “In a study examining similar action on water canals within California, scientists estimated that shade provided from solar panels could reduce the water loss due to evaporation by 63 billion gallons of water per year, an amount equivalent to annual water consumption of roughly 2 million people per year.”
Many federally operated canals are located in Environmental Justice communities, meaning that adding significant solar capacity can help push out the use of fossil fuels in these communities that are most impacted by the negative health outcomes of fossil fuel production and consumption.
California’s Central Valley Project, a large canal system, alone uses approximately 1 billion kWh of electricity annually to pump water. Bringing solar power closer to these systems would offer an efficient system for moving water, displacing the diesel generators used today.
“Given the Bureau of Reclamation’s long history of creating hydroelectric power, the generation of gigawatts of solar power on its canals would be a purely additive benefit, and could even help address shortfalls in electricity generation as when hydroelectric facilities are unable to operate due to low water levels,” said the letter.
Installing solar on canals is gaining popularity worldwide. Projects in California, India, Spain, and France are underway, with many packing in large utility-scale capacities.

NineDot is expected to use the proceeds of this revolving credit facility to finance 14 battery storage projects and the company expects that number to grow to about 40 projects or more, each up to 5 MW. NineDot reports that a 5 MW battery site can power approximately 5000 New York City households for four hours on a hot summer day.
For NYGB, this transaction supports New York State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) goal to develop 3 GW of storage by 2030, on the path to developing a nation-leading 6 GW of energy storage. This facility is the first purely energy storage transaction completed by NYGB.
“We believe that climate change is the most critical issue of our time, and innovators like NineDot and NY Green Bank can work together to make a positive impact on the environment and the society in which we live and work,” said David Arfin, CEO and co-founder of NineDot Energy.
NYGB president, Andrew Kessler sees this type of community-scale battery storage as critical to the state’s decarbonization efforts. “We look forward to seeing these projects operating in support of a resilient future for New York City,” he said.
Founded in 2015, NineDot Energy is based at the NYU Urban Future Lab in Brooklyn, New York and backed by Carlyle. To date, the company has secured more than $150 million to acquire, develop and operate battery storage sites across the New York City, Westchester County and Long Island. Its goal is to develop, build and operate more than 400 MW of clean energy sytems by the end of 2026 in New York state, supporting the state’s mission to achieve 100% clean energy by 2040.

Rystad Energy has revealed that European warehouses currently host around 40 GW of Chinese-made solar panels.
The Norwegian consulting firm said that the stored solar panels are worth about €7 billion. It noted that solar module imports from China continued to increase this year, despite the high inventory levels.
“Imports in January were 17% higher compared to 2022, with February up 22%, March surging 51%, April up 16%, and May growing 6% over last year,” Rystad Energy explained. “If current import levels continue, 2023 will be a record-breaking year for imports and inventory. Annual imports look set to hit 120 GWdc, far surpassing expected capacity installations of 63 GW (DC).”
Rystad Energy said that Europe is “desperate” to secure PV components at affordable prices. It warned that made-in-Europe products may not be immediately available.
“Although efforts are underway to build a reliable solar supply chain in Europe, the need for panels now means leaders cannot wait until 2025 or later to buy European,” said Marius Mordal Bakke, senior supply chain analyst at Rystad Energy.
U.S. supply
The United States is faced with a similar crunch for solar panels as it pursues its own domestic manufacturing goals for the solar supply chain. The nation has excluded several major Chinese solar suppliers from entering the U.S. market under enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
Clean Energy Associates (CEA) shared that while module assembly has a strong presence today in the U.S., ingot, wafer, and cell production plans have not kept pace, and no plans for greenfield polysilicon plants have materialized.
CEA forecasts the U.S. to reach 17 GW of polysilicon production, 3 GW ingots, 3 GW wafers, 18 GW cell manufacturing, and 40 GW module manufacturing capacities by 2027, suggesting that the U.S. will continue to rely on energy imports for years to come. However, the recent UFLPA enforcement developments may pose a serious challenge to finding suppliers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/20/sound-waves-could-bring-iii-v-solar-cell-costs-down-to-earth/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 20, 2023",Sound waves could bring III-V solar cell costs down to Earth,"At the National Renewable Energy (NREL) lab in Colorado, researchers have found that sound waves could bring costs down in manufacturing solar cells traditionally used in space-based applications, making them affordable enough for use here on Earth.
Researchers used sound waves in a new process called acoustic spalling, which was developed at Arizona State University and is now being commercialized by Crystal Sonic Inc, a company located in Phoenix. The study found that the process, also called sonic liftoff, could reduce the costs of manufacturing this type of highly efficient solar cells.
III-V solar cells offer the highest solar PV conversion efficiencies of any technology, according to the NREL researchers. The problem is that the cost of manufacturing has been high, making them too expensive for use in anything but space-based applications.
The III-V solar cells are named for the elements used in their manufacture that come from the III and V groups of the periodic table. About one-third of the cost of the cell comes from the single-crystalline substrate on which is it grown, and the researchers found that acoustic coupling can potentially enable the substrate to be reused. The researchers studied the vapor growth of gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cells on previously “spalled” substrates in order to understand how it affects subsequent device growth and performance.
“This is super promising for the substrate reuse,” said Kevin Schulte, a scientist in NREL’s High-Efficiency Crystalline PV group and the lead author of the journal article detailing the success of acoustic spalling. “This alone will not make III-V solar cells cost-effective, but as part of this portfolio of research, we’re trying address cost from multiple different angles.”
The researchers describe their work in, “GaAs solar cells grown on acoustically spalled substrates with 27% efficiency,” published in the journal Joule.
The technique using sound waves could replace the existing process, which uses a sacrificial etch layer that allows a cell to be lifted off a GaAs substrate so the substrate can be reused. The drawbacks, however, are that it’s a lengthy process and it leaves behind a residue that adds an expensive polishing step.

Spalling, on the other hand, takes seconds. It works by creating a controlled fracture within the substrate nearly parallel to its surface, and the fracture allows the cell to be easily removed, revealing a new, contaminant-free surface from within the substrate that does not require polishing. Acoustic spalling uses sound waves to control the fracture, suppress the formation of facets and improve the flatness of the substrate.
“The surface is less corrugated,” Schulte said, “so when you grow a new device on it, it’s possible to achieve a high efficiency with relatively minimal, or potentially no, surface repreparation.”
The researchers indicated that additional research is needed to determine how many times the substrate can be reused after being subjected to acoustic spalling. The researchers were able to make a cell on a previously spalled substrate with an NREL-certified efficiency of 26.9%.
“I don’t think there’s any difference in that performance compared to what efficiency we could get on a brand-new substrate,” Schulte said.

Researchers at Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the Materials Research Center FMF at the University of Freiburg have set a new world record for organic photovoltaics. They achieved an efficiency of 15.8% for a 1 cm2 organic solar cell by using an anti-reflection coating that absorbs more light in the photoactive layer of the cell and thus generates a higher current.
The thin-film system required for the coating was developed by the researchers at Fraunhofer ISE. The efficiencies of organic solar are still rather low compared to conventional crystalline silicon cells, although they can also be produced cheaply. Researchers around the world are still working on improving their efficiency and scalability.
“We achieved the improvement in the record-breaking solar cell to a large extent by using an anti-reflection coating, which absorbs more light in the photoactive layer of the cell and thus generates a higher current,” explained Uli Würfel, head of the organic and perovskite PV department at Fraunhofer ISE.
The thin-film system required for the coating was developed by the researchers at Fraunhofer ISE. At the same time, the research center also developed electrodes for semi-transparent organic solar cells using this coating process. These consist of a photoactive, organic layer applied to a back electrode that lets visible light through and at the same time reflects near-infrared light back into the cell, according to Würfel.
