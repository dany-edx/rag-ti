https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/13/tesla-heralds-ease-of-installation-manufacturing-assembly-as-powerwall-3-shines-at-re/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2023","Tesla heralds ease of installation, manufacturing assembly as Powerwall 3 shines at RE+","In the eyes of some, Tesla has stolen the show at RE+. The company’s new hybrid battery, the Powerwall 3, has attracted significant attention by offering 11.5 kW of continuous power to homeowners and an installation time of between 30-40 minutes. Company representatives hope that the new battery will be cheaper by virtue of its quick installation and simplicity in terms of factory assembly.
Tesla representatives describe the Powerwall 3 as being a similarly evolutionary product like the company’s more affordable Model 3 EV.
The new battery differs from the Powerwall 2 in that it comes with an integrated inverter. This simplifies the installation, bringing both power conversion and energy storage together in one unit. As a hybrid system, it is suitable for new solar installations, but not for households with existing rooftop solar systems.
The Powerwall 2 will still be available “for some time.”
The new battery is narrower and has a smaller width than its predecessor – although it is slightly “deeper,” from front to back. The battery has a length of 43.25 inches, width of 24 inches, and depth of 7.6 inches.
Notably, the Powerwall 3 comes with 11.5 kW of continuous power, which should be sufficient to power most households and can switch seamlessly to offgrid operation in the event of grid outages. This power is an increase of more than 50% on that delivered by the Powerwall 2, note company observers. The energy capacity of 13.5 kWh is the same as the previous model.
For large homes that would like backup power capability for longer periods, Tesla staff say that a Powerwall 3 without an integrated inverter will be offered that can be “daisy-chained” to the hybrid battery unit. This, Tesla says, makes the system a simpler value proposition to homeowners.
Aesthetically, the system is certainly sleek. Its glass door includes an indicator light that will “go red” in the event of faults, with pure white indicating everything is operating smoothly.
Beyond aesthetics, the Tesla team report that all aspects of the Powerwall 3 “serve more than one function.” The glass door also serves as a heat sink, with the aluminum enclosure on the sides and rear serving the same purpose for the air-cooled battery.
Installation in focus
The glass door can also be removed during installation. Inside the box there is an AC terminal on one side, a DC the other. This allows two electricians to work on the solar and storage installation simultaneously, “getting an install done in 30-40 minutes.”
The obvious installation advantage of the hybrid battery, over the Powerwall+ system, is that the inverter comes fully integrated.
An additional feature on display at RE+ is a dolly that has been designed specifically for Powerwall 3 installation. At 287 lbs. it is lighter than the Powerwall+, but not light by any stretch of the imagination. By using the dolly, Tesla reports that a single-person install has been made possible.
“We want more people to have access to these products, so cost down has been our main focus,” the Tesla experts in Las Vegas report. “The ‘installability’ savings should be passed through to consumers.”
Soft launch
While this week’s unveiling is the main event, news of the Powerwall 3 has trickled out over the previous week. Tesla observers have been reporting on social media of pilot installations since late last week.
“We are testing thoroughly the new hardware before we are launching to our partners, so we can get a sense of validation and pilot process,” Tesla team members say.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed the arrival of the new product on September 7.
The launch of the Powerwall 3 comes in the same week that biographer Walter Isaacson launched his much-heralded biography of Musk.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/13/bluewave-secures-91-million-in-financing-for-five-agrivoltaics-projects-in-massachusetts/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2023",BlueWave secures $91 million in financing for five agrivoltaics projects in Massachusetts,"Northeast U.S. solar developer and operator BlueWave received $91 million in financing, which the company says will allow it to achieve long-term ownership and management of its portfolio of projects.
The financing will go toward the construction of five projects featuring dual-use solar development attributes, called agrivoltaics, in Massachusetts. These projects are “strategically implemented to benefit all parties impacted by the projects,” including landowners, farmers and the surrounding community, according to BlueWave. The financing includes a $64 million debt raise with KeyBank, and $27 million tax equity raise with U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance.
The five projects include a 3.6 MW facility in Dighton; 3.5 MW facility in Douglas; 2 MW facility in Haverhill; and 2 MW and 8.6 MW projects in Palmer, Jesse Robertson-DuBois, director of sustainable solar development at BlueWave, told pv magazine USA. 
The projects will use ATI racking and will all be elevated 10’ to accommodate agricultural operations under the arrays, Robertson-DuBois added. Moreover, the systems are spaced more widely than typical, and account for fence setbacks and turning clearances needed for agriculture equipment.
“These design decisions were all made to ensure efficient farm operations. The combination of added height and wider row spacings results in a minimum of 50% light availability for every square foot of ground,” Robertson-DuBois said. 
The project sites include a varied group of crops, pollinator habitats and livestock grazing operations, according to BlueWave. At four of the projects, farming operations will be able to continue uninterrupted beneath the solar arrays, and the fifth includes the creation of a new grazing pasture. All projects are scheduled to come online in 2023, and will be interconnected with National Grid. 
BlueWave’s projects will be included under the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program, and are expected to save money on the bills of around 770 low-income households. The 3,200 MW declining block incentive program was created by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources. Eligible projects must be interconnected by one of the state’s three investor-owned utilities, and are paid tariff-based incentives directly by the utility. 
Agrivoltaics are a combination of farming practices with solar photovoltaic energy production and is expected to become a $9.3 billion market by 2031. Experts at Allied Analytics say that the practice can help address food security while also transitioning to clean energy. The global installed agrivoltaics output rose from 5 MW in 2012 to 2.9 GW in 2020, according to the company. 
Massachusetts is a leader in agrivoltaics, thanks to its SMART solar incentive program, which includes an adder for agrivoltaic systems, Mark Sylvia, chief of staff at BlueWave, told pv magazine USA.
The state’s 2022 Climate Billl also included the creation of an agrivoltaics commission to make recommendations to remove barriers to the further development of agrivoltaic projects, Sylvia added. 
In May 2022, BlueWave announced it had been acquired by Axium Infrastructure, an infrastructure investment management firm with a North American renewables portfolio.
 
The quote by Robertson-Dubois was changed to say “The combination of added height and wider row spacings results in a minimum of 50% light availability”, rather than “maximum”.

Last month, five major suppliers, including BYD, Longi, Canadian Solar, Trina Solar and New East Solar were found in violation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws. The ruling means that these companies would have to pay tariffs on the circumvented goods to enter the U.S. market or find other pathways to compliance.
Past records of solar AD/CVD tariffs have shown that the fee can be as high as 50% to 250% of the cost of shipped goods. However, the tariffs will not apply until June 2024, when President Biden’s two-year pause lifts.
The note from Roth suggests that Longi panels made from OCI polysilicon are found not to be in violation of circumventing tariffs. Roth said that initial volumes released are limited, and that the move by CBP is an “initial release.”
It said that it may still take about four to eight months to have OCI polysilicon modules flowing smoothly into the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/13/how-local-is-local/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2023",How local is local in solar manufacturing?,"Manufacturing incentives in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have driven significant investment in the United States, to the relief of many investors; developers; engineering, procurement, and construction service providers (EPCs); and installers. Module manufacturers were the quickest to react to the climate action policy package, increasing production capacity of the final stage of module assembly, as this is the easiest segment to expand. More than a dozen module manufacturers have announced plans to set up or expand factories in the United States, mostly aiming for gigawatt-level annual production capacity, since the IRA was announced.
Notably, First Solar has been a major driving force behind this movement in the U.S. In fact, the company has just announced the location of its fifth manufacturing facility, which is located in Louisiana and will bring its total capacity in the United States to 15 GW by 2027, accounting for a quarter of total module capacity in the country. First Solar’s thin-film module capacity is critical for the realization of long-term demand in the US because it is immune to the riskier economic and political climate of traditional, crystalline-silicon supply chains. No other company has yet overcome the inherent technical challenges and higher costs of thin-film compared to crystalline modules, meaning that a technology shift will not likely be the way forward for the US to meet its energy independence goals.
Domestic content
In May this year, the Department of the Treasury issued clarifications about the 10% bonus tax credit available on top of the investment tax credit for using locally manufactured components in projects. Notably, the decision to list PV cells as the furthest upstream component has already started to drive a second wave of manufacturing capacity announcements at cell level. With 18 GW of cell capacity already planned, more announcements are expected, especially as project developers will require US-made cells to meet the higher domestic content threshold in 2026 and 2027.
Despite 22 GW of announced new wafer production capacity, by 2027, clarification of the domestic content bonus has disincentivized additional ingot and wafer manufacturing investment. The formula that determines what qualifies as “domestic” allows cell manufacturers to include the direct costs of sub-components as “domestic,” including polysilicon, ingot, and wafer production costs.
This applies even if, for example, the wafer is imported from another country. Ultimately, developers will be able to qualify for the domestic content bonus without those local components, which harms the business case for establishing such critical manufacturing nodes in the United States.
Geopolitical issues
The U.S. will build out a massive base of local cell and module capacity but many manufacturers will still largely rely on polysilicon and wafer imports from China and Southeast Asia. For the crystalline module supply chain, cell capacity will be the bottleneck for manufacturing self-sufficiency, based on currently announced capacity, a fact which is reflected in the crystalline module (cell-limited) values of the chart below.

The United States will reach 68% self-sufficiency in the current situation and guidance for the domestic content bonus is expected to drive cell production capacity. Wafers would then become the bottleneck, if cell capacity does expand as expected, but they would only add a 5 GW cushion in terms of planned capacity and would therefore only increase self-sufficiency potential to 76%. In either case, between one-quarter and one-third of demand will depend on module imports, a factor which continues to threaten critical manufacturing nodes economically.
In general, between 12 GW and 20 GW of demand, on an annual basis, over the next five years will be subject to potential risk from tariffs and restrictive trade policy, such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. That prospect threatens the timely supply of modules to developers and EPCs, from an availability standpoint. While the United States has shown the ability to recover from a tough year, in 2022, the inherent risks of an import-based supply chain have been demonstrated to affect the market.
Conversely, the United States has been one of the largest markets for solar installations globally, despite its historical reliance on foreign supply chains for more than 80% of its demand. The twin factors of the scale of IRA incentives and the price premium for modules that the U.S. market commands, will continue to make the U.S. a key target for module suppliers aiming to expand capacity and serve domestic customers. Even in the current situation, the United States will achieve record-breaking self-sufficiency levels that will make the market less risky.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/13/u-s-utility-testing-5-mw-10-hour-organic-solid-flow-battery/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,ARIZONA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2023","U.S. utility testing 5 MW, 10-hour organic solid flow battery","Salt River Project (SRP), a not-for-profit energy company serving more than 1.1 million people in Arizona, has announced plans with German battery manufacturer CMBlu for a pilot project to deploy long-duration energy storage (LDES).
The 5 MW, 10-hour-duration Desert Blume project will use CMBlu’s non-lithium technology. CMBlue will build, own and operate the batteries on behalf of SRP at its Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center in Florence, Arizona.
CMBlu said its Organic SolidFlow battery technology is based on fully recyclable organic materials. It uses aqueous electrolyte solutions that are non-flammable. The company said the batteries are characterized by free scalability between power and capacity because the system separates the electrolyte from the actual energy converter, and self-discharge is avoided. Furthermore, by replacing individual components, original performance can be restored.
CMBlu expects its battery system to cost-effectively store and deliver energy for two to three times longer per cycle than traditional lithium-ion technology, which typically targets a four-hour duration.
While the battery installations are a pilot, SRP is depended on to provide water to about half of the valley’s residents, delivering more than 244 billion gallons of water each year, and it manages a 13,000-square-mile watershed that includes an extensive system of reservoirs, wells, canals and irrigation laterals. The battery project is designed to store energy for SRP’s customers during daytime periods, largely from solar generation, and return that energy to the grid throughout the night. It will store enough energy to power about 1,125 average homes for 10 hours.
In 2022, a fire broke out at the Salt River Project when a lithium-ion battery began smoldering. Area businesses were evacuated out of an abundance of caution due to the potential hazards caused by off-gassing. As an alternative to lithium-ion, the project is implementing the Organic SolidFlow batteries in the pilot project. This is the first U.S. utility implementation of CMBlu’s batteries at this scale.
SRP selected CMBlu after issuing a request for long-duration storage project proposals from emerging energy storage companies. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) will monitor the pilot project and help validate the performance of the technology in Arizona’s hot and dry climate.
This pilot is part of the third phase of development at SRP’s Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center. The first phase will add two flexible natural gas turbines with a total output of less than 100 MW, and the second phase will add a utility-scale solar generation facility capable of generating up to 55 MW of solar energy. Construction of the third phase is slated to begin in early 2025, and the pilot is expected to be operational in December 2025.
CMBlu’s technology will also be deployed in other pilot projects including one in Burgenland Energie in Austria, and another pilot in Milwaukee, Wisc. with WEC Energy.
CMBlu was founded in Germany in 2014 by biotech entrepreneur Peter Geigle and a group of German energy and automotive executives. Since passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, CMBlu has entered the US market.
“Compared to Germany and the rest of Europe, the US is clearly marching ahead in the development and application of large-scale storage solutions,” said Peter Geigle, founder and CEO. He added that once the company’s products gain acceptance, it will remain “fully committed to a US manufacturing presence.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/13/a-terawatt-of-solar-module-capacity-expected-within-16-months/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2023",A terawatt of solar module capacity expected within 16 months,"The terawatt era has arrived, and the world is unprepared. As the industry explodes in volume, solar and related professionals must prepare, adapt – and deploy.
In its recent Q2 PV Supplier Market Intelligence report, Clean Energy Associates (CEA) highlighted significant growth in solar module manufacturing by Chinese solar module manufacturers. From a 405 GW manufacturing capacity in 2022, a projected 114% increase is expected, reaching 866 GW by the end of 2023. Following that, a subsequent 21% surge in 2024 will bring the total to an impressive 1.043 TW globally.

This rapid growth surpassed many industry predictions. Still, insiders within the Chinese government, having played a pivotal role in this boom, likely foresaw such a rise.
A closer look at the numbers reveals that by the end of 2024, Chinese domestic capacity could be responsible for approximately 0.93 terawatts of their total global capacity. Southeast Asia is anticipated to account for less than 7% (0.068 TW), the Americas just over 2% (0.023 TW), and non-China Asian markets might contribute about 1% (0.011 TW).
Major, European and American manufacturers, such as Meyer Burger and First Solar, were not considered in this study. The assessment predominantly revolved around:

The majority of this capacity is earmarked for n-type solar cells. Yet, a bottleneck seems evident in the production process. CEA’s data suggests that cell production lags behind module manufacturing, with wafer and polysilicon ingot capacities trailing by several hundred gigawatts.
China’s heavily centralized solar power market, underpinned by extensive governmental oversight, might see these predictions shift. Whether solar module manufacturing capacities will be fine-tuned remains uncertain.

Aligning with – and surpassing – these projections, Bernreuter Research suggests that long term Chinese plans include up to 3.5 TW of polysilicon manufacturing capacity by 2027. PVEL’s findings indicate that the 3.5 million metric tons of capacity might be operational by the end of next year. Considering 2.2 grams of polysilicon are required for a watt of solar panels, PVEL estimates that polysilicon supplies could generate 1.6 TW of solar modules.
If we build it, will they come?
The question remains: if this manufacturing capacity is available, will there be adequate installers, grid capacity, and batteries to absorb the surplus daytime production?
Analyst Jenny Chase of BNEF splashed a little cold-water on our enthusiasm, pointing out the reality that oftentimes, solar module factory capacity is 1.5 to 3 times greater than actual installed capacity. Underutilization of manufacturing capacity is normal.
Chase noted:
Maybe 1TW will be installed in 2025, but not just because the module factories exist.
BloombergNEF’s recent projections estimate 392 GW to be installed in 2023 and around 500 GW in 2025. These figures are based on their medium volume projections, though they also offer both lower and higher range projections.

Integrating such a large volume safely into the power grid poses daunting technical challenges. The U.S., the world’s second-largest solar market, has experienced delays in interconnections, slowing solar’s rapid ascent. Specifically, the PJM territory, within the broader United States’ Eastern Interconnection region, halted all new renewable energy projects for two years while grappling with hundreds of gigawatts of projects vying for grid access. As the U.S. interconnection queue nears 2 TW of capacity, both the time and cost of connections have escalated.

State markets have also put the brakes on their local distribution markets. When Massachusetts’ SMART program was launched, National Grid’s territory was overwhelmed with applications, causing unforeseen halts in development. Using public data, pv magazine USA predicted that National Grid’s area would instantly fill its entire 800 MW project tranche. Our prediction was spot on. Yet, the utility expressed astonishment, stating, “we’re all a little surprised by how quickly we got to this saturation.” As a result, they slammed the brakes on development, putting a billion dollars of projects on standby.
This unexpected turn prompted a state investigation. Despite this, grid connections remained sluggish, and currently, numerous substations within the state can’t accommodate additional solar projects.
China, the world’s largest renewable market, initially managed the surge in wind and solar by curtailing excess generation. They later developed a nationwide high voltage direct current (HVDC) network to channel power from the interior regions to the densely populated coast.
The growth rate of solar energy is undeniably accelerating. Having achieved our first terawatt of installed solar in early 2022, discussions swiftly transitioned to reaching 1 TW of capacity annually before the end of the decade. We then speculated that a second terawatt might be realized in just three years.
There’s a budding optimism that we might witness a unique milestone: a terawatt installed within a single year in the near future. Truly, that would be an accelerating transition.

“The use of round conductors in the 16-busbar system enhances power gain for each cell and reduces vulnerability to microcracks, which improves module reliability,” the manufacturer said. “The half-cell module has three small junction boxes, each equipped with a single bypass diode. This design reduces heat transfer to the cells above, thus increasing module longevity and overall system performance.”
