J.B. Pritzker that they have failed to reach compromise on a clean energy bill.
Because the two parties could not come to an agreement, it is now time for Pritzker and the state legislature to take the lead.
In independent but similar letters, the two groups outline that the impasse is centered around what to do with a trio of Nuclear power plants, two of which are expected to be shut down before the end of the year, that are deemed necessary short-term measures to getting Illinois on track to meet it’s climate, clean energy, and employment goals. There are also concerns regarding what generation that would replace the two nuclear plants if they closed, centered around coal and natural gas plant retirement dates.
The environmental groups, expectedly, want to see the coal and gas plants shut down as quickly as possible, with significant pollution-reduction measures to be performed on existing and upcoming plants until those retirement dates are reached. Under a previous compromise, the two groups agreed for broad retirement dates of 2035 for coal plants and 2045 for gas plants, with interim targets, and an extension until 2045 for two specific coal plants, so long as those plants achieve 90% carbon-capture by 2035.
The union representation wants to make sure that the workers that they represent are not left jobless and without future opportunity. The group’s letter recognizes the threat of climate change, and the massive employment potential that expanded commitment to renewables presents, but has concerns over jobs lost in the immediacy of closures. The letter also accuses ICJC of failing to negotiate in good faith.
As the issue is currently framed, shutdown of the two nuclear plants is an outcome that would make both sides unhappy, as thousands of jobs would be lost following plant closures and the capacity taken off the grid would likely be replaced by majority fossil fuel generation.
In a response letter to CJI, Pritzker slammed the union representatives, accusing CJI of shifting the goalposts throughout the negotiations and failing to negotiate in good faith. Pritzker referenced an allegation made in the ICJC letter, that CJI’s proposed compromise bill “would allow dirty power plants to stay open in perpetuity, threatening the health and wellbeing of the very communities that Climate Jobs Illinois’ letter states that it wants to protect.”
What’s more, a generally agreed upon framework is already in place that would keep the three nuclear plants open. An agreement was reached in the spring to divide a $700 million surcharge across all ratepayer bills to fund the plants for five years, which has been estimated to increase the average consumer bill by 80 cents monthly. This could be complicated upon the passage of a federal infrastructure bill, which would include support for nuclear plants, but is poised for success at the moment.
All delays in reaching comprehensive energy legislation in Illinois have a real-time adverse effect on the state’s solar industry, which has run out of incentive funding and has essentially stagnated. Once the funding ran out at the end of 2020, businesses could no longer take on new projects and, as a result, the state’s solar industry has lost roughly 3,500 jobs to date, according to the Solar Energy industries Association. This incentive-related employment loss was essentially piling on the tens of thousands of solar jobs that were lost nationally in 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Prior to that point, Illinois had been experiencing a solar development boom that had put the state on track to meet its 2008 RPS goal of requiring utilities to source 25% of their electricity from renewables by 2025. With seven months of job loss and stagnation in development, progress towards that figure is dangling just out of reach.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/05/three-more-companies-ask-the-itc-to-extend-solar-tariffs-for-four-more-years/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 5, 2021",Three more companies ask the ITC to extend solar tariffs for four more years,"Hanwha Q CELLS USA, Inc., LG Electronics USA, Inc., and Mission Solar Energy are the latest companies to ask the International Trade Commission (ITC) to extend import tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells.
The petition was made under Section 204(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 and Subpart F of part 206 of the rules of practice and procedure of the ITC. The companies said that they are representatives of the domestic industry producing CSPV cells and modules and, therefore, have standing to file the petition.
Days earlier, Auxin Solar and Suniva formally asked the ITC to extend solar tariffs for four more years.

“Extending this safeguard is essential for America to reclaim its lead in solar energy manufacturing and development, and it represents a critical step to achieve the broader goal of American renewable energy independence,” said Mamun Rashid, co-founder and chief executive officer at Auxin Solar. Rashid said that Auxin “is committed to re-shoring the solar supply chain” and filed the petition hoping that policymakers are “committed to the promise of green energy independence and the good-paying manufacturing jobs that will result.”
Auxin Solar said that its extension petition will prompt the ITC to determine whether the safeguard remedy continues to be necessary and whether evidence exists that the industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition. The ITC is expected to report its determination to President Biden by December 8.
In their separate 420-page filing on August 4, Hanwha Q CELLS USA, LG Electronics USA, and Mission Solar Energy said they had “not yet received the full benefit intended” by tariffs, which were put in place in 2018 and are set to expire in February 2022. The companies said they need more time to “complete their adjustment” to facilitate the domestic module production that they called “critical” to the Biden administration’s aim to make the energy sector carbon-free by 2035.

The remedy that the domestic industry received through the tariffs was “partially impaired” by what they said was import stockpiling before the tariffs took effect, the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, continued import underselling, and increased costs and tariffs on the inputs used to produce modules.
The companies also said the tariff’s overall effectiveness was “significantly limited” by the exclusion of bifacial products. This allegedly “opened the gates for the return of high import volumes of duty-free, low priced modules” only months after new CSPV module plants started production.
The current tariff rate quota of 2.5 GW per year, which they said was “adequate” during the first three years the tariff was in effect, will need to be adjusted in the future, said the three companies. They said an “adequate” quotient in line with domestic module production would be “essential to the module producers’ viability” and prospects for new investments in CSPV module manufacturing.
In an interview with pv magazine, John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy for the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said the trade group remains opposed to tariffs. He cited numbers that SEIA presented to the ITC as part of its mid-term review of the tariffs, which showed around 2 GW less solar being developed than was forecast prior to the tariffs.

He said that claims that the tariffs would lead to the creation of 45,000 jobs were “wildly, comically off.” He pegged the actual number of new jobs created as a result of the tariffs at no more than 2,000 through expansion at “three modest facilities.”
Smirnow said that the tariffs hurt overall solar sector growth and are not an effective incentive to spur new manufacturing investment. He said that business investments rely on a five- to 10-year time horizon and not on a four-year window of opportunity.
He called for a suite of federal manufacturing supports to help support domestic production. That suite would include long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit and addition of a direct pay mechanism to bolster demand certainty. It also would include investment in capital expenditures to help the U.S. compete in global markets for investment dollars. He said that low-cost loans and use of manufacturing tax credit are useful tools for that purpose.
And Smirnow called for long-term domestic production support to bring more parts of the solar supply chain to the U.S. He said that U.S. production of everything from glass to junction boxes to inverters could be catalyzed by a manufacturing tax credit similar to one proposed by Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA).
Smirnow warned that “billions of dollars” worth of contracts are being written with the expectation that the tariffs will expire at midnight on February 6. He said that project delays and cancellations likely could result if the tariffs are extended.
In their ITC petition, Hanwha Q CELLS USA, LG Electronics USA, and Mission Solar Energy said that extending the tariffs for another four years “at the highest possible” duty rates is “essential to the continued health and viability of U.S. manufacturers.”
They said that if the tariffs are left to expire, “all members of the newly revitalized U.S. industry would be exposed to a new wave of injurious imports.” Without an extension, they said that planned investments in equipment and workforce, new capacity expansions and product innovation will “have to be put on hold or may never come to fruition.”

The project aims to test the efficacy of curbside charging for plug-in electric vehicles and use the findings to streamline efforts to support a diverse array of EV drivers. 
About 80% of EV charging occurs at home, said the National Resources Defense Council, and often in a garage or carport. For renters, about two-thirds lack access to such spaces, and EV charging access can be a further barrier. The Kansas City project seeks to better provide access to communities that have a dearth of EV charging infrastructure. 
Image: MEC
One reason to look to streetlights was the excess energy that is often tied to LED lights. LEDs are more efficient than conventional high-pressure sodium bulbs, and have been increasingly installed across cities. At the same time, however, the related power capacity in the pole is not reduced to match the greater efficiency. This creates an energy gap, which chargers could tap into. 
As part of the program, Level 2 chargers are planned to be installed across the metro area. The chargers are rated AC 240V and typically provide about 10-20 miles of range per hour of charging. (By contrast, DC fast charging stations can achieve 480V and 60-80 miles of range per 20 minutes of charging.) 
MEC said it costs $0.03-$0.06 per mile to fuel an EV, while conventional vehicles consume fuel at a rate of about $0.07-$0.27 per mile. Currently, there are about 80,000 public charging stations in the U.S., said MEC.
(Read: “Home solar makes EVs cheaper, reduces emissions”) 
Project funding is through a competitive opportunity offered by the U.S. Department of Energy. MEC and its partners also are making in-kind funding contributions. 
The project began its design phase in 2018, ran feasibility analysis in 2020, and now is conducting public outreach and deployment, with installation expected to be finished by December. 
Pole-mounted EV chargers have found their way into various cities, including  London; Essen, Germany; Melrose, Massachusetts; Los Angeles; and Portland, Oregon. The World Research Institute is conducting a study of these sites and said it will release a report this fall on the findings of both streetlight and utility pole-attached EV chargers. 
The City of Kansas City, Evergy, Missouri University of Science and Technology, NREL, Black & McDonald, EV Noire, and LilyPad EV are working on the Kansas City program and are expected to monitor its progress to inform future investment.

ECA, which provides energy suppliers the right to petition the Commission for issuance of a certificate to provide regulated competitive retail electric services in Arizona, was confirmed in 2020 by an Arizona Supreme court decision. Green Mountain Energy is among the first companies to apply under the policy.
The application outlines that Green Mountain Energy is looking to serve customers currently within Arizona Public Service (APS) and Tucson Electric Power’s (TEP) service areas, which cover the majority of the state. This would be the first time that customers in these service areas would have a choice in not just their electrical supplier, but in the type of resources that will be powering their homes and businesses.
And while APS and TEP are expected to challenge the application to the Commission – and possibly enter court if the Commission petition fails – the language of Green Mountain Energy’s application makes it clear the the company believes this application is entirely in accordance with and protected by ECA. The law does contain a clause stating that “a competitive market shall exist,” in reference to the state’s electricity market.
Additionally, in an interview with The Arizona Republic, Mark Parsons, vice president and general manager for Green Mountain Energy, said that his company has conducted surveys and interviews with electrical customers in the state, finding that the “overwhelming response” was that customers wanted choice in their electric provider and to have the electricity that they purchase come from renewable resources.
Specifically, the company claims that, of survey respondents:
The claim that the electricity supplied by Green Mountain Energy will be 100% renewable is true – broadly. Green Mountain Energy doesn’t actually own any generation assets, rather it purchases renewable energy and the associated renewable energy credits from others, including its parent company, NRG. So while every single electron sent to a customer’s home may not have been renewably generated, the energy bills they pay fund renewable energy projects.
Included in the application, Green Mountain Energy is also asking the Commission to approve its rate plans, which look to lock in a fixed price for customers one year at a time. The application also includes a cap on prices and an option for commercial customers to choose fixed rates or contracts that have variable prices. All Green Mountain Energy customers would still receive some level of billing from their former utility, under a structure known as “utility-consolidated billing.” These bills would cover transmission and billing charges for either APS or TEP, whichever the customer was formerly served by.

Sunlight said its platform offers instant credit decisions and automated loan processing and funding, facilitating the sale of residential solar systems. The company provides loans with rates from 0% to 6.99%, and tenors from 3 months to 25 years.
More than 135,000 solar systems have been financed through the platform through the end of June, the company said. The loan provider also offers an iOS and Android version of its loan platform, which it said is used by many of their 1,500 home improvement and solar installation partners.
Sunlight said these products will help more customers install solar on their home with lower monthly payments.
And, while the rates are low, dealer fees typically are also associated with a lower rate. Solar loan dealer fees often range between 15-25% of the cash value of the solar array. In some cases, the solar installer absorbs some of the cost, and the rest is rolled into the principal of the loan.
(Read “Solar 101: How to pay for your rooftop solar investment.”
This race to the bottom for interest rates has been a trend in recent years, with installers taking note of the fact that when making decisions, homeowners often care more about the rate attached to their loan than the topline cost of the solar system.
Last October, Mosaic, another solar loan provider, released a loan program offering 0.99% APR 20-year and 1.99% for 25-year products.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/05/youve-got-30-billion-to-spend-and-a-climate-crisis-nuclear-or-solar/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 5, 2021",You’ve got $30 billion to spend and a climate crisis. Nuclear or solar?,"Nuclear power delivers almost 20% of all electricity in the United States, and about 50% of all low-emission electricity. Moreover, the U.S. has almost 100 nuclear power units operating more than 90% of the time, providing a steady base of power generation we can depend on.
Moving forward however, it seems nuclear has lost its swagger. Price increases, project delays, and cancellations have caused what may prove to be generational damage to nuclear power’s reputation. pv magazine USA has previously reported on industry pricing models, showing nuclear’s lagging pricing.
Now, Georgia Power’s Vogtle Units 3 & 4 – the nation’s only nuclear generating units currently under construction – have announced further delays and price increases. Conservative cost estimates suggest the two 1.117 GW facilities will require at least $30 billion to complete, including $3 billion in finance costs and $27 billion in construction costs.
As solar and energy storage professionals, we must be conscious of the limitations of the sun, and the cost of energy storage. As we all know, the sun also sets. And while research suggests we can power 80% of the U.S. with wind, solar, and 12 hours of energy storage, being able to replace a nuclear power plant that runs 24/7/365 in wind, rain, snow, and sleet simply hasn’t been financially viable.
But is it today?
The chart above shows the price of solar panels from 1976 through the end of 2019. Here, we see prices fall by more than 99.8% from over $100 per Watt down to nearly 20¢ per Watt.
Below, we see the price of battery packs starting in 2010 and ending in 2020, per Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Here, we see costs fall from $1,191/kWh to $137/kWh, a price decrease of greater than 88%.

In both cases, we can expect the prices to continue trending downward in both the middle and long term.
And so, what can we expect to pay when we replace a nuclear power plant with solar power plus batteries?
The new Vogtle reactors  are rated at 1.117 GW each. Roughly, they’ll run at a 90% capacity factor. On an annual basis, the two units will generate 17.6 billion carbon-free kilowatt hours of electricity. Already on site are two earlier nuclear units, #1 and #2, which have been running since 1987 and 1989.
To generate that volume of electricity from solar power on an annual basis, Georgia would need about 7.3 GWdc of solar panels running at a 26% capacity factor. That would be equivalent to roughly 7% of the current U.S. installed solar capacity, which currently sits at just over 100 GW.
Image: Georgia Power
However, this 7.3 GWdc figure does not take into account battery charging losses or reduced sunlight in winter. So let’s offset battery charging losses by upsizing two thirds of the solar (the amount to be stored) by 20%. Next, let’s account for reduced winter sunlight by increasing the total system capacity by another 20%.
The resulting total capacity is now 10.55 GWdc of solar power.
In order to replace the two nuclear plants while the sun is down, the batteries would need to replicate two 1.117 GW power sources for 16 hours. The total energy storage capacity would be 39.3 GWh, after we add an extra 10% for safe measure.
Roughly speaking, the total cost of these solar-plus-storage facilities would be:
So, Georgia, pv magazine USA just saved you more than $13 billion (as of today anyway).
It’s almost certain that a solar facility of this magnitude – roughly 27,000 acres or around 0.07% of Georgia’s land are – would be split among many landowners in the state. If land lease rates in Georgia are comparable to what might be earned in Pennsylvania, the project could provide as much as $27 million per year in income to Georgia landowners for decades to come.
Furthermore, the solar power plants would start generating electricity and revenue within about three years of the first signature, and two years after groundbreaking. The new Vogtle reactors began construction in 2013 (planning began much earlier), and are projected to complete in 2022/2023.
Image: Silicon Ranch
The nuclear facility will easily last 40 years, and potentially as long as 80. However, the ongoing operations and maintenance costs are significant, as well as upgrades and equipment replacements that start to become necessary after 40 years. And sometimes, those $1 billion dollar upgrades go wrong, and a nuclear power plant gets trashed.
With these considerations in mind, the repowering costs to get a solar+storage facility to a 40-80-year lifetime would likely be offset by the fact that the solar facility will enter service at least eight years earlier than the equivalent nuclear site. Additionally, during the solar plant’s operating lifetimes, it saves massive amounts of regular operations and maintenance costs, as well as specialist engineer labor costs.
When we do repower the batteries and solar panels, they almost certainly will be cheaper, and operate at a higher efficiency, likely stretching the life of the solar facility to 50+ years. Again, this solar+storage facility would generate 20% more juice in the summer (when the power is needed most in Georgia) because we oversized it for the winter.
In the end, it would be best if we had a healthy ecosystem of clean energy generation systems that include nuclear. However, if we’re going to debate the costs of nukes vs. solar, then it is no longer a discussion.

The agreement makes BlueWave Solar Laketricity’s first New England partner.
BlueWave said that water-based projects are important in places like Massachusetts, where building on man-made ponds and reservoirs address land use problems and “ensures no disruption to the state’s terrestrial habitats.”
Floating solar arrays can also be deployed as an alternative to land-based solar farms in areas were land is in short supply or in dry places where it can be installed at man-made reservoirs to help mitigate evaporation. In 2018, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated that installing floating solar photovoltaics on the more than 24,000 man-made U.S. reservoirs could generate about 10% of the nation’s annual electricity production.
In April, Pine Gate Renewables said it would site 9 MW of solar-plus-storage over cranberry bogs in southeast Massachusetts. Solar Carver 1 would be built on a 70-acre site and generate 5 MW of solar energy, accompanied by 30 MWh of battery storage. Solar Carver 3 would have a capacity of 2 MW and include a 12 MWh battery storage system across a 35-acre site.

To keep the locations dual-use, Pine Gate’s EPC team will engineer the projects to rest on more than 3,300 40-foot-long wooden utility poles, which are expected to be more durable for the wet terrain. The poles will be driven 15-30 feet into the ground to keep the trackers at least 10 feet above the cranberry bogs and allow for annual harvesting.
In March, White Pine Renewables completed a floating solar array in northern California that the company claimed to be the largest in the United States. The 4.8 MW Healdsburg Floating Solar Project was installed on ponds at the City of Healdsburg’s wastewater treatment plant. It will deliver energy to the city under under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
The project site and floating PV approach were chosen to help reduce evaporation and algae growth at the ponds, benefitting nearby vineyards that use the water for irrigation.
BlueWave Solar is currently involved in dual-use solar development, through agrivoltaics, a project design model that allows agricultural production and solar to coexist on the same space.
Ciel & Terre has installed over 230 floatovoltaic projects globally, and 21 projects in the U.S. representing more than 162 MW of power. BlueWave has developed and sold more than 155 MW of solar projects to date.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/05/researchers-develop-a-novel-design-for-agrivoltaics/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COST AND PRICES,RESEARCH,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 5, 2021",Researchers develop a novel design for agrivoltaics,"From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China has developed a design for agrivoltaic projects that, compared to other approaches, is claimed to reduce the shading effect of the PV installation and improve crops’ light environment and the crop growth process, yield, and quality.
“The system has a cost that is 10% higher than conventional agrivoltaic project, but the improved crop yield ensured by the optimized lighting management would compensate for this slightly higher investment,” research co-author, Jan Ingenhoff, told pv magazine.
In terms of economic feasibility, a system developed with the proposed approach should be built at a cost of approximately €715 per kW ($847) installed and a yearly cost for maintenance of about €6.5 per kW ($7.70).
Called Even-lighting Agrivoltaic System (EAS), the design methodology consists of using metal brackets as mounting structures, conventional solar panels, and a grooved glass plate placed between the solar panels. The latter occupies an area that is one-third of the light-receiving area of the entire system.
“With the installation of the glass plate, the density of PV panel arrays is the same as conventional photovoltaic power stations and very close to the optimum design for energy production,” the scientists said.
According to Ingenhoff, any regular glass with a high transmission coefficient can be used, as there are no special requirements, and silicate glass and ultra-white glass may be suitable.
The metal brackets are placed on columns that are high enough to allow the growth of tall plants and the use of big agricultural machinery. The optimum tilt angle for modules was determined to be 23 degrees, which the research group described as a good compromise between electricity generation and construction costs.
The scientists initially calculated and simulated optically the design of the grooved glass plate and then built a first pilot 35 kW agrivoltaic project in Fuyang city, in China’s Anhui province. Common vegetables such as lettuce, broccoli, garlic sprouts, garlic, rapeseed, Jerusalem artichoke, among others, were planted.
A second pilot system was deployed more recently in Hefei city, in the same Chinese province.
The EAS system provided improved growing conditions for some plants. For example, the Jerusalem artichoke harvest increased by over 20%. The reason behind this may be due to better soil moisture retained within the facility area, or that the plant can remain under photosynthesis between 11:00 and 2:00 pm in good sun radiation days, which is typically entering a dormant state for the plant outside, as leaf photosynthesis reaches a maximum in the late morning.
For both facilities, the height at which the solar panels were placed was 2.5 meters. Some of the plants also grew under the system equipped with supplementary LED lamps powered by the solar panels, which provided plants an extra 2 h light time every day compared to other treatments.
“The comprehensive economic benefits of EAS consist of the installation and maintenance costs, the electricity generation benefits and the crops harvest benefits,” the academics said. “To accurately evaluate the comprehensive benefits of planting different crops, we considered the time required to plant different crops and the amount of electricity generated by the PV panels during the crop growth.”
According to their measurements, the use of the transparent grooved glass plate improved the irradiation collected by crops in one day by 47.38% compared to a conventional system, and the yield of Jerusalem artichoke, which needs at least six hours of sun a day, improved by 23%.
Including solar power generation, the system has shown that a farmer’s average income increases by 5.14 times and performed a high land equivalent ratio (LER), which is the measure the productivity and effectiveness of intercropping. It also improved the economic benefits on the farmland per hectare.
“Under the EAS, crops grew fast, and the yield was similar or better than that under the natural state,” the Chinese group said. “By adding supplementary LED lamps into the EAS, the soluble sugar content of lettuce increased by 72.14% and the nitrate content of lettuce decreased by 21.51%.”
More details on the system design can be found in the paper Increasing the comprehensive economic benefits of farmland with Even-lighting Agrivoltaic Systems, published in Plos One.

It said that its ability to raise the private capital provides “third-party validation of the quality of its transaction portfolio” and demonstrates the “strong and growing appetite” among private-sector investors to gain more exposure to clean energy projects.
NY Green Bank had made cumulative investments of $1.6 billion as of June. It said it has consistently generated positive net income since 2017.
The bank’s pipeline totals $790 million and spans residential, agricultural, and commercial industrial, technology classes including solar, energy efficiency, wind and sustainable transport.
NY Green Bank is a unit of New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). In addition to the investment from Bank of America, global investment bank Moelis & Company acted as placement agent.
