https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/30/vistra-says-moss-landing-incident-likely-not-related-to-lithium-ion-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2021",Vistra says Moss Landing incident likely not related to lithium-ion batteries,"Vistra Corp.’s CEO Curtis Morgan said that the company does not think that lithium-ion batteries supplied by LG Energy Solution were the cause of a September 4 incident at the Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility. He said the problem is “fixable in the near term” but did not say when the facility might return to service.
In a statement, the company said it is continuing to work on its root cause analysis to address the damage at Phase I (300 MW/1,200 MWh). An initial review found that a “small, single-digit percentage” of the batteries had been impacted. The facility has been offline since the incident.
The company said its investigation into the cause of the incident includes evaluating multiple systems, including the battery, control, communications, ventilation, and safety systems. One area of focus is whether the water-based heat suppression system in the facility was activated by smoke in the building unrelated to the batteries themselves.
It said its review so far has not identified any battery temperature measurements in excess of established temperature limits at the time safety systems activated.
“We continue to evaluate this and other sources of data,” the company said. Morgan said on a conference call that a meeting with battery supplier LG Energy was scheduled for September 30.
The company said it was assessing a number of restoration paths at Moss Landing, including incrementally returning a portion of the facility’s energy storage capacity more quickly.
Vistra said the 100-MW/400-MWh Phase II facility at the Moss Landing site remains operational.

Aquamarine’s second 125 MW phase is under construction and is expected to be complete and operational by year-end. At full build-out, the Westlands park will have the capacity to deliver 2.7 GW of renewable energy.
(Read “The world’s largest solar parks.”)
WAAREE Energies, one of the largest module manufacturers in India, delivered 385Wp and 390Wp Mono PERC Solar PV modules.
Commercial operation was achieved following the approval by Pacific Gas & Electric authorizing Cal-ISO to connect Aquamarine to the power grid. Cal-ISO in turn authorized Aquamarine to begin synchronization and start a power generation test project providing power to the grid. The test period was successfully concluded and Aquamarine officially began commercial operations on September 17.
Aquamarine has Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) including a 50 MW contract with Valley Clean Energy Alliance, the City of Santa Clara (Silicon Valley Power) for renewable energy credits (REC) associated with 75 MW of capacity. CIM Group is currently negotiating additional PPAs with other potential counter parties for Aquamarine and future phases the park.
The energy park eventually could encompass more than 20,000 acres in California’s San Joaquin Valley in western Fresno and Kings Counties. It is identified as a Competitive Renewable Energy Zone through the Renewable Energy Transmission Initiative process.

The company said it can charge any EV fully in 15 minutes or less at the charger’s full output of 360kW.
The modular charger can charge up to four vehicles at a time and has applications for refueling stations, urban charging stations, retail parking and fleets.
ABB said its platform guides users through the charging process and shows the state of charge of the EV battery and the residual time before the end of an optimal charge session.
The company said its chargers have a small footprint and can be installed in locations where space is at a premium. 
“With road transport accounting for nearly a fifth of global CO2 emissions, e-mobility is critical to achieving the Paris climate goal. We will also lead by example by switching our entire fleet of more than 10,000 vehicles to non-emitting vehicles,” said Theodor Swedjemark, chief communications and sustainability officer at ABB.
ABB entered the EV charger market in 2010 said it has sold more than 460,000 EV chargers across more than 88 markets.

The purchase price was not disclosed, however this is not the first deal between the two companies. Arevon said it anticipates to install 250 MW/1,000 MWh of Tesla Megapack energy storage systems in California and Nevada by the end of the year.
“This agreement ensures that Arevon can deliver near-term storage solutions to our customers, mitigating the risk of supply shortages and project delays,” said Justin Johnson, Arevon chief operating officer.
The storage units purchased are expected to support the Falcon portfolio, a joint undertaking of Arevon and energy company Tenaska to develop standalone storage projects in California load centers over the next four years. These facilities can be configured to provide up to four hours of battery-delivered energy during peak times of day. Well-sited standalone battery systems improve local reliability and can help prevent grid outages.
About a month ago, Arevon and Nextracker came to a supply agreement for Nextracker to supply NX Horizon smart solar trackers with TrueCapture and NX Navigator software and control systems for a 1.5 GW portfolio of projects in Indiana and Nevada.
Of the seven projects, which are all expected to be operational by the end of 2023, five are located in Indiana: Elliott (200 MW), Gibson (280 MW), Ratts 1 and Ratts 2 (both 150 MW), and Posey (300 MW). The 250 MW Citadel project will be located outside of Reno, Nevada and the 232 MW Townsite plant will be in Boulder City, Nevada.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/30/commerce-asks-antidumping-group-for-more-info-keeping-solar-tariff-issue-alive-and-unsettled/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2021","Commerce asks antidumping group for more info, keeping solar tariff issue alive and unsettled","The U.S. Department of Commerce decided on September 29 not to dismiss a trio of petitions that seek to have antidumping tariffs imposed on solar equipment imports from three Asian nations. Instead, the Department asked the group of publicly unnamed companies to amend their petitions to provide more detail.
In a letter to lawyers who represent the companies, Abdelali Elouaradia, who directs the department’s antidumping operations, asked that the petitioners be named and that they have standing to initiate the petitions. The letter also asked lawyers to explain how the companies would face retaliation if they were identified. And it asked if any of the group had sales or production interests in Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam, the three countries named in the petitions, or whether they buy wafers, ingots, or other material from Chinese companies. The letter asked that names and details of items be provided.
The letter gave the petitioners until October 6 to reply. Commerce then would reset its review timetable by adding 45 days to review the amended petitions.
In a statement, Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said, the industry trade group was “disappointed that Commerce did not dismiss these meritless petitions outright.” She said that the detail and nature of the questions Commerce asked the anonymous petitioners “clearly indicates that the petitioners have produced a filing largely devoid of the information the department needs to assess whether to initiate this case.” She said that SEIA believe that “when and if the petitioners amend their original submission, it will become abundantly clear that they have no case for circumvention.”
In a separate statement, American Clean Power Association (ACP) CEO Heather Zichal said that her group believes the petitioners’ requests “will ultimately be denied since the case has no merit.” She said that  ACP member companies have indicated they will have to stop or cancel solar projects currently under development if the investigation is initiated. “Moving ahead with this matter would cause grave damage to the solar sector in the United States and put the Biden administration’s economic and climate goals at risk.”
Lawyers for the petitioners said that Chinese producers subject to the existing AD/CVD duties have set up affiliated operations in the third countries and moved the end of the production process while “retaining as much of the subsidized supply chain, labor, R&D, and investment as possible in China.” It said this was done to avoid paying the required AD/CVD duties. “Nearly all the raw materials, R&D, and capital investment is still coming from China,” the law firm alleged. “These factories exist only to serve the U.S. market and to avoid AD/CVD duties. This is the very definition of circumvention.”
In mid-August, a trio of petitions filed by the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention asked the Commerce Department to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

In a September 27 news conference, SEIA said that the petitions should be dismissed on their merits. More broadly, the industry trade group said that the tariffs would cripple the U.S. solar industry and impact the country’s plans to tackle climate change. The group said that almost 80% of all solar modules are imported from the countries, which include Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
AD/CVD tariffs could mean the loss of as many as 45,000 solar energy workers by 2023.

“This is absolutely the biggest risk and issue for our company and the industry,” Hershman said during the press conference hosted by SEIA. Hershman chairs the trade group’s executive committee.
Justin Baca, SEIA’s vice president of markets and research, said that AD/CVD tariffs could mean the loss of as many as 45,000 solar energy workers by 2023.
SEIA has said that not enough capacity exists outside the three countries to meet growing domestic demand for solar. Markus Wilhelm, CEO of Strata Clean Energy, said the solar energy is dependent on a global supply chain and so is “vulnerable” to a possible trade disruption.
Lawyers for the petitioning companies disputed claims that supply chains are inadequate to continue supplying U.S. solar demand. “There is plenty of fairly traded, non-Chinese available capacity to meet U.S. solar demand from non-subject companies in those countries and in the rest of the world, in addition to new and increasing capacity from U.S. producers,” the Wiley Rein law firm said. It said that “Tier One” solar module manufacturing capacity remains available that either is non-Chineseor not subject to the circumvention inquiries. It  estimated that capacity at 30 GW or more annually.
“Solar projects in the United States should not be reliant on unfair and illegal trade practices, whether it is dumped and subsidized Chinese pricing directly or the dumped and subsidized pricing of the Chinese-affiliated companies in the countries circumventing AD/CVD duties,” the firm said in a statement.

The publicly unnamed group of companies filed the petitions through the law firm Wiley Rein requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries. The group said that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
The group asked the Commerce Department to investigate the following companies:
If Commerce launches an investigation, any duties would be retroactive to the start of the investigation, which is why companies are reporting an immediate effect on their business.
Hershman told reporters that the largest solar panel manufacturers have already said they will not deliver product for his company’s projects. “We are not able to issue purchase orders,” he said.
