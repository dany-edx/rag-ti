SEIA has updated its earlier projection that the investigation will lead to a module import shortfall of roughly 8GW as hopeful, rather than expected, with the potential for a much worst-case scenario rising; ROTH said that the module procurement process has been turned upside down; and Standard Solar has called on the DOC and the Biden administration to immediately put an end to this “grave threat to the solar industry.”
Ask anyone involved in the American solar industry about the investigation, and you’re likely to hear that is has the potential to be a doomsday event. Well, almost anyone.
Martin Pochtaruk is CEO of Heliene, a Canadian PV module maker with factories in Ontario, Minnesota, and Florida, and soon-to-be 900MW of total manufacturing capacity, once the company’s $21 million manufacturing facility in Mountain Iron, Minnesota begins producing modules, which is expected to happen in Q3 of this year. While Heliene is a Canadian company and a US importer, its manufacturing operations in the US allow Pochtaruk to offer the perspective of a non-Auxin American manufacturer, as well as a somewhat dissenting position from the industry’s majority mindset.
“What SEIA attests of trade investigations, going all the way back to 2012, is that trade barriers, stop or slow the progress of development,” said Pochtaruk. “Sometimes that might be the case short term, in the case of the safeguard that never happened. So when the figure was applied on February 7 2018, in 2018, 2019, import levels continue to be the same. So what we’re seeing portrayed as what was going to happen did not actually happen. Will that be the same now? I think we’ll see in a year or so time.”
In building on his position, Pochtaruk shares that now, as in the past, Heliene takes no stance for or against the institution of tariffs, arguing instead that the history of the solar industry shows a consistent ability for the market to be flexible, and adapt to whatever constraints are placed on it. In the instance of AD/CV tariffs on Chinese goods, he expects manufacturers in other countries, namely Korea, Canada, Turkey, and India to step up faster than has been projected, helping to mitigate supply uncertainty.
“There is a demand for circumvention-free products that maybe wasn’t necessarily there before,” said Pochtaruk. “Developers are looking for manufacturing in the US or in countries like Korea, Canada, Turkey, India, with a stronger emphasis than two weeks ago. So this is not only for US manufacturing, I would say this would provide a stronger pull for any product that is made worldwide but not in the investigated countries. In the case of Heliene, we made a decision to invest in the US in 2018. Because of the safeguard, we understood that we needed to be a US manufacturer, besides being a Canadian manufacturer.”
Pochtaruk also outlined his belief that current discourse regarding the investigation is being considered through a strictly-American lens, and that this self-focused approach ignores the capabilities of the worldwide market to step in and alleviate pricing and demand stress.
“When the 2018 safeguard was put in place, the main complaint among developers was that price was going to increase according to the import duty imposed, and the duty imposed was 30%,” said Pochtaruk. “When you look at the pricing of solar modules sold in the market through 2018 and 2019, there was no increase in price. Why? Because the market is a global market. The demand in 2018 was low, compared to supply. Everybody lowered their costs and lower their margins so that they continue to sell at the same price. With this, what I’m trying to say is that there’s not an import duty in one country that will change the dynamics and the price of the product worldwide… I don’t think anybody knows what is going to be demand and supply on a worldwide level in six months, or a year, and we will continue to adapt to those situations with whatever the wind brings.”
However, all of that is not to say that Pochtaruk views the investigation as a good thing for the solar industry, nor American manufacturers. One position that he does share with the greater industry is that growth comes from long-term certainty and predictability.
“There’s no certainty on the result of the investigation to say; ‘This is going to double US manufacturing,’ or ‘It’s going to trigger solar cell and wafer manufacturing,'” explained Pochtaruk. “So when you look the value chain, we start with polysilicon. We know there’s no polysilicon in the US to supply the US demand for solar modules, but you need investment in ingot making, investments into workforce and investment into cells. And that would say that will only happen if if we are able to get either a confirmed long run on import control, or an incentive, which I think is the way to do it: not through instituting these measures, but through incentives.
Where Pochtaruk does take issue is in the claim that the accusations in the petition are baseless, and that it was uncouth of DOC to take up the investigation in the first place. He stands firm in the belief that it is the responsibility of DOC to investigate requests that come from within an industry, “whether it’s one player or 10 of them.” He shares that both he, personally, and Heliene, as a company, believe in the rule of law, and that DOC has an obligation to investigate claims, just as much as it has the right to determine no wrongdoing has occurred.
“What, irks me is when developers or SEIA, as an association, say, ‘The Department of Commerce cannot do this,'” said Pochtaruk. “That’s wrong. It’s like telling a jury that they should all go home and do nothing.”

The best approach could be public control of PJM and other regional grid operators, said law professor Shelley Welton.
Public control of grid operators is Welton’s preferred solution for fixing interconnection delays and high fees, as well as grid operators’ “heel dragging” on reforming rules to integrate renewables, and their practice of setting new barriers to renewables. Welton noted that California’s grid operator CAISO is publicly governed. In a law journal article, Welton also discussed three other possible improvements to governance of grid operators, short of public control.
The Clean Energy States Alliance hosted the webinar, to discuss how the 20 “clean energy states,” which have committed to reaching 100% clean energy, can influence grid operators to advance clean energy.
States have many options to exercise influence through existing channels, as described in a report for the 100% Clean Energy Collaborative, which the Alliance supports. Some states have also considered a partial exit, notes the report, as Illinois, New Jersey and Maryland explored options to bypass the PJM capacity market, with its anti-renewables “minimum offer price rule,” in 2020.
 
Asked on the webinar how clean energy states might prioritize their efforts, between seeking structural reform of grid operators versus influencing them through existing channels, Welton said “part of this is a strategic question about, can you get the leverage you need for the big reforms? Probably the answer depends on FERC’s appetite,” referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
“Maybe the best way to do this would be to backchannel with FERC as much as possible,” Welton said, “to understand which commissioners have an appetite for real change. And are they going to support you if you push for it?”
“The dynamics of what else is on their docket, what their priorities are, really matters, for how much states should push for big structural change versus, go along for the ride and try to accomplish some of their substantive goals as best as possible” through existing channels.
As for the clean energy states in the West and Southeast that are outside of a regional grid operator, the report and webinar discussed ongoing initiatives for regional coordination.
Welton’s article, titled “Rethinking Grid Governance for the Climate Change Era,” was praised by Bentham Paulos, author of the collaborative’s report, as a “page-turner” relative to other law journal articles. A recording of the webinar is available online.

Governor Hogan has said that he will not veto the bill, but will let it pass without his signature.

The Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 speeds up Maryland’s current goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 40% of 2006 levels to 60% by 2031, and it establishes 2045 as the state’s goal for becoming carbon neutral.
“We are grateful the Maryland General Assembly had the courage and vision to vote for a healthy future for Marylanders,” said Maryland LCV Executive Director Kim Coble. “Action by the legislature ensures Maryland is leading the nation in fighting the impacts of climate change.”
The legislation will accelerate the state’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, expand clean energy use, and invest in underserved communities.
“Many communities, overburdened with polluting industries and other hazards, will see new investments, thanks to the legislation. It also will create new opportunities in these communities to take advantage of the move to clean energy that is underway in Maryland,” said Staci Hartwell, Chair of the Environmental and Climate Justice Committee of the NAACP Maryland State Conference.
The legislation’s key components include provisions to:
Polling conducted by the Maryland League of Conservation Voters found that 77% of respondents agreed that Maryland should take steps to address climate change, and 76% support requiring existing large commercial buildings in Maryland to make needed improvements to reduce emissions.
The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) called the Act “one of the nation’s most robust climate and clean energy policies”, and said it’s legislation that other states can model as it “meets the moment and puts us on track for a sustainable, equitable future.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/13/86-of-florida-voters-regardless-of-political-party-want-gov-desantis-to-veto-anti-solar-bill/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 13, 2022","86% of Florida voters, regardless of political party, want Gov. DeSantis to veto anti-solar bill","Last month, the Florida state legislature passed House Bill 741, which phases down the value of solar net metering, and opens the door for utilities to add fixed charges to solar customer bills. Net metering is a vital policy that supports the value of rooftop solar, paying customers for exporting excess solar energy production to the grid.
If passed by Governor Ron DeSantis, the law takes effect in 2023, payments to solar customers will regress from a retail rate, like the one they pay utilities at around 10 cents a kilowatt, to the “avoided cost” to the utility, a minute fraction of the retail rate. The phase out will slash payment rates to solar customers by 50% in four years and would drop further still to the avoided cost rate by 2029.
The broad language in the bill that allows for fixed charges is likened to a now-stalled similar net metering proposal in California, NEM 3.0. The fixed charges, only levied on solar customers, even those who have batteries that support electric grid resiliency, are described by experts as “a tax on the sun.”
A recent Sachs Media poll confirms that the citizens of the Sunshine State want supportive solar policy to stay. Regardless of political affiliation or age, 86% of the 722 polled Florida voters said they want Governor DeSantis to veto the bill. This includes 82% of Republican respondents, and 90% of Democrats. This is information that will likely carry weight as it reaches Mr. Desantis’ desk, as it is an election year for his seat.
The poll also demonstrated the uncertainty Floridians are feeling about the future of electricity in the state. About 84% of respondents said they are concerned about a utility bill increase over the next year. Rooftop solar offers peace of mind to these voters, as solar contracts secure a clear picture of what the homeowner would pay for electric rates over the next 20+ years.
“This bill is a nightmare for anyone who believes in energy freedom and the rights of people to choose the energy that works for them and their families. Net metering has helped over 100,000 Florida homeowners make that choice, and utilities are now banking on the state government to strip those rights away and pad their monopoly hold on electricity.” Will Giese, southeast regional director, Solar Energy Industries Association.
The bill has been described as an attack on Floridians’ personal freedom of choice, wresting power out of their hands and back into the hands of the utility. In total, across party lines, only 3% of respondents said they are interested in Governor DeSantis passing the bill.
Founded on the idea of the “cost shift,” the bills are pitched as a protection for non-solar customers from raised rates through cross-subsidizing solar customers. Studies completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar.
(Read: “Coalition received $1.7 million from three California utilities to push NEM 3.0, a rooftop solar ‘killer’”)
The Berkeley study found that cost pressures from net metering don’t start making a tangible effect until solar penetration reaches 10%. Florida is nowhere near this figure, with 0.86% of households currently topped with solar. And when battery energy storage is attached to a home solar system, the “cost shift” argument dissolves.
The state’s solar industry employs over 40,000 people, has led to $18.3 billion in economic activity, created $3.3 billion in tax revenues, and led to $3.2 billion in household energy savings. House Bill 741 is expected to put much of that at critical risk.
On an election year, Governor Ron DeSantis has the opportunity to be a hero to the Florida solar industry and to the 86% of voters who seek his veto.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/13/our-nations-renewables-goals-are-at-risk-the-us-commerce-department-must-reject-the-latest-tariff-petition/,"GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 13, 2022",Our nation’s renewables goals are at risk; the US Commerce Department must reject the latest tariff petition,"Solar power was highlighted in last week’s report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as one of our best tools for reducing energy sector emissions. But to avoid catastrophic climate change and achieve the Biden administration’s carbon reduction goals, we must accelerate the pace of solar development. We have been headed in the right direction; solar deployment in the United States was expected to be up to 21.5 GW in 2022 despite supply chain issues, surpassing last year’s record.
Now is not the time to slow down solar deployment, but that’s the threat of the circumvention case that the Department of Commerce is considering on imports of crystalline silicon PV modules and cells from Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. An affirmative ruling by Commerce on the petition would have a devastating effect on this growing industry.
In fact, the effects are already being felt. Because Commerce could impose tariffs retroactively, many manufacturers have already halted shipments to the US. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) heard alarming news from the industry in an overwhelming response to a survey distributed last week.
Image: Standard Solar
Solar projects rely on long-term policy certainty, so even the threat of a change can have profound impacts. Early responses from the survey show that real damage to the industry is happening now as a result of the petition. At stake are tens of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars, and our nation’s ability to address climate change. SEIA estimates that the petition could result in the solar industry losing 70,000 of its 231,000 jobs.
An affirmative ruling by Commerce on the petition would not boost US manufacturing. Previous trade cases have led to job losses but have had little to no impact on domestic manufacturing, which is a long game. It takes years to get a manufacturing plant approved and running, and the solar industry, which is already dealing with ongoing supply chain issues, needs a steady supply of modules now.
While most solar jobs are in installation and related areas, not in manufacturing — which is being increasingly automated — it is indeed worthwhile to support domestic manufacturing to reduce our reliance on imports. But this petition is not the answer. Instead, we should pursue effective ways to promote domestic manufacturing that include long-term federal investment. The solar industry is currently pushing for legislation to substantially increase solar deployment while also establishing a strong solar manufacturing supply chain. That’s where we should be putting our effort as an industry.
The solar industry has enough obstacles without creating new ones. Despite the unprecedented nature of this threat, as a larger company, Standard Solar is in an excellent position to weather this storm. We have experienced numerous ups and downs and will survive. But we are only as strong as the industry as a whole. We should all be working together to make our industry more robust, not taking actions that could tear it down.
Commerce should be part of that effort. The Department’s mission is “to create the conditions for economic growth and opportunity for all communities.” Instead, by considering this petition, Commerce is contributing to the single biggest threat the growing solar industry has ever faced.
Even the COVID pandemic did not devastate the industry as this case could, but the petition’s threat is compounded by coming at a time when solar is already strained. Supply chain and trade issues slowed installation in Q4 2021, resulting in 3GW less than expected in utility scale solar deployments. According to SEIA, even before this case, the nation’s module supply was expected to run at least 8GW short for expected growth and potentially 16GW short over the next few years.
Commerce previously ruled that a similar trade petition had no merit, so it’s unclear why it’s considering the current petition, which is based on the false claim that solar cell manufacturing is a minor or insignificant operation in the named countries. The Department has a choice now: move forward with a baseless petition that will result in massive job losses and set back our clean energy goals or fix its mistake by immediately issuing a negative preliminary determination. Speed is of the essence to reverse the harmful effects already being felt.
We need to deploy 70 GW of solar a year in the next few years to achieve President Biden’s climate goals; according to SEIA, we will fall short by 20 GW this year. It doesn’t make sense for the U.S. government to pursue an action that runs so contrary to its own goals.
Standard Solar stands with thousands of solar companies and hundreds of thousands of solar workers in calling on Commerce and the Biden administration to immediately put an end to this grave threat to the solar industry and allow us to proceed with accelerating the transition to clean energy.
Responses to SEIA’s survey on the petition can be submitted here.

This new law expands energy freedom for consumers and creates an additional incentive to do business in the Commonwealth.
“With his signature today, Governor Youngkin has significantly strengthened customer energy choice in Virginia with a business-friendly approach to promoting the local clean economy,” said Will Giese, southeast regional director for the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “This new law empowers millions of Virginians to choose the energy that works for them, while increasing the value of their homes and creating certainty to attract new businesses and jobs.”
Virginia ranks ninth in the nation for installed solar, according to SEIA, with solar generating nearly 4% of its electricity needs. SEIA’s growth projection for the state is 5,114MW over the next five years, when the state is projected to be seventh in the nation. The property tax exemption follows on the heels of passage of the Clean Economy Act, which is expected create up to 29,000 solar jobs while providing market opportunities for distributed generation and utility scale solar.
“ Virginia now has a home-generation tax policy that is competitive with other southern states, and companies are ready to continue growing the local economy and lowering energy costs for people across the Commonwealth,” said Giese.
