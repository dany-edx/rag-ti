The projects combine for a total capacity of 620 MW of solar and 50 MW/ 200 MWh of energy storage.
The site is administered by the Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM). BLM designated the area as a Solar Energy Zone and Development Focus Area, land set aside by the federal agency for utility-scale renewable energy development.
The projects include:
The projects are estimated to bring an average local spend to Riverside County, Calif. of $24,000 a month during construction. Combined the projects create enough energy to power up to 217,000 average California homes. This equates to avoiding more than 1 million metric tons of CO₂ emissions annually, which represents the greenhouse gas emissions from 227,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven over the course of one year.
Construction began in early 2020 for Maverick 1 and 4, followed by Maverick 6 and 7 in early 2021. At peak construction, the sites employed over 500 personnel.
“The Maverick projects are the cornerstone of our large-scale solar and storage growth and expertise. The renewable energy industry has experienced significant volatility over the past years battling both unprecedented pandemic and supply chain constraints. We are excited to now have all four projects operating at full capacity and to contribute to California’s climate goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.” Benoit Rigal, senior vice president, implementation and projects management for EDF Renewables North America.
The company’s asset optimization group will perform operations and maintenance services for the life of the project. It will provide NERC compliance support, remote monitoring, and balance-of-plant management to maximize power production.
EDF Renewables is among the largest developers in North America, with over 35 years of experience and 24 GW of solar, wind, and storage projects developed. The company provides services from grid-scale power to electric vehicle charging.

The Air force contract provides funding for two installations of over 20 windows and additional scale-up and development funds for the product.
“We are seeing strong fiscal support for sustainability initiatives in the built environment right now,” said Hunter McDaniel, UbiQD founder and CEO. “Our expanded contract with the U.S. Air Force couldn’t come at a better time, right as we are scaling and ahead of the upgraded solar investment tax incentives.”
The company utilizes luminescent quantum dot tinting to concentrate solar energy and generate electricity while maintaining transparency. Quantum dots are photoluminescent particles so small that it would take 100,000 of them to span one fingernail, said UbiQD. The company said the technology has applications in localized DC microgrids and smart building solutions, including integration with sensors for climate and ambient controls.

Commercial buildings account for 36% of all U.S. electricity consumption at a cost of more than $190 billion annually. Additionally, windows represent 30% of a commercial building’s heating and cooling energy, costing US building owners about $50 billion annually, according to DOE.
UbiQD’s quantum-dot tinted window, called WENDOW, has recently been installed in a series of demonstrations projects, including a campus building at the Western Washington University, which the company said is the largest solar window installation to date. The WENDOW can be tinted, allowing for colorful designs. The university installation features vibrant yellow and orange windows. 
“This technology helps Western Washington University get closer to achieving our sustainability goals on campus,” said David Patrick, Vice Provost for Research and Dean of the Graduate School. “I was impressed by how easily the windows were installed and love how great they look. I’m hoping to see more projects like this on campus in the near future.” 
While the solar windows offer less efficiency than a conventional solar panel, they represent an alternative to blending photovoltaics with the build environment. Read more about solar in uncommon spaces.
UbiQD also builds translucent panels for greenhouses that are integrated with photoluminescent particles that are efficient at converting light into a preferable wavelength. The UbiQD “UbiGro” panels glow a spectrum of color that is optimized for plant growth, absorbing UV and blue light and emitting fruitful orange or red light.
In recent trials, UbiGro led to a 21% boost in flowering in geranium flowers, a 14 to 28% boost in winter strawberry growth, and an 8% yield increase in cannabis production. Increased crop yields are a welcome sign to any grower, and the two companies are set to take that benefit one step further, integrating productive solar PV in the greenhouse-topping modules.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/17/shoals-reports-record-q2-revenue-profit-despite-challenges/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 17, 2022","Shoals reports record Q2 revenue, profit despite challenges","From pv magazine global
Despite the headwinds the US solar industry faced in the second quarter of 2022, following the Department of Commerce’s (DoC) announcement of a solar antidumping investigation in late March, balance-of-system (BoS) manufacturer Shoals has reported record revenue and gross profit, as well as a gross margin within its targeted range.
The US-based provider of BoS solutions for solar, battery storage, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure attributed the results to a significant number of new customers purchasing components, as well as strong demand for its combine-as-you-go system.
Earlier this year, Shoals adjusted its guidance for the year due to the “challenging environment” caused by the DoC’s March 28 decision to act on a petition filed by California-based solar module manufacturer Auxin Solar. It asked the DoC to review solar panel imports from Chinese companies in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, resulting in an antidumping investigation. Despite this, Shoals reported robust growth across its business.
“Demand for our combine-as-you-go solution continues to grow,” said Jason Whitaker, chief executive officer of Shoals. “During the quarter we converted four additional customers, bringing the total BLA [Shoals’ in-line fuse and wire manufacturing technology] customers to 29. Customer interest in our recently introduced products is strong, particularly within battery storage, wire management, and EV charging.”
Turning point
According to Whitaker, the White House’s two-year tariff exemption for solar panels manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam was “a turning point in customer sentiment, and we have seen order patterns normalize as a result.” The company’s revenue grew 23% year 0n year to $73.5 million, driven by increases in its components and system solutions divisions.
The growth in components-related revenue was driven by increases in shipments of battery storage products and solar products to a significant number of new customers, the company said. It noted that new customers typically purchase components first, before transitioning to system solutions.
The company said the growth in system solutions revenue underscored strong demand for its combine-as-you-go system. Its system solutions division accounted for 77% of revenue in the quarter, from 86% a year earlier and 69% in the prior quarter.
Gross profit increased 9% to $28.6 million, compared to $26.2 million in the preceding year. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 38.9%, compared to 43.8% in the prior-year period. The company attributed this to a higher mix of components sales in the quarter, as they have lower margins than system solutions, as well as higher raw material prices and logistics costs.
For its full-year outlook, Shoals still expects revenues to be in the range of $300 million to $325 million, adjusted EBITDA between $77 million and $86 million, and adjusted net income between $45 million and $53 million.
Earlier this year, Shoals opened a new manufacturing facility in Tennessee. It is expected to double the company’s manufacturing capacity as demand continues to grow. It said that its BoS solutions have now been deployed on more than 20 GW of solar systems across the world.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/17/adopting-new-ieee-standard-could-ease-interconnection-says-epri-executive/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 17, 2022","Adopting new IEEE standard could ease interconnection, says EPRI executive","To ease interconnection of solar, wind and storage projects to the transmission grid, a technical executive with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) recommended “a unified minimum set of capabilities” for these inverter-based resources (IBRs), which “could mean” adopting the new IEEE-2800 standard “as soon as possible.”
EPRI is a utility-led research and development organization, and IEEE is a global body of engineers. IEEE published the 2800-2022 standard earlier this year.
When project developers submit interconnection requests, without “very detailed, sufficient technical requirements, it’s very difficult, if not impossible, to submit any models that really represent those interconnections” said Jens Boemer, EPRI Technical Executive for Grid Operations & Planning and DER Integration, in an online workshop hosted by the Energy Systems Integration Group. “DER” stands for distributed energy resources.
“Simply by agreeing on a technical set of minimum requirements, the expected performance can be narrowed down significantly,” Boemer said, which could “help inform some of the modeling.”
Boemer raised the issue of whether validated models can be submitted with the interconnection request in a case where the plant equipment has not yet been selected. Here again, he said “maybe the standardization of the performance through the IEEE standard can help fill this challenge.”
Even before the test and verification procedures for the IEEE-2800 standard are available, “sending a signal to the industry” of a future requirement to meet that standard “can be very welcomed and helpful” for project developers, he said.
Boemer said that EPRI plans to submit comments, which “will likely look similar” to his presentation, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, regarding its notice of proposed rulemaking on improvements to generator interconnection.
Boemer also discussed “challenges and opportunities” at other stages in the interconnection process. Feasibility studies, he said, often have limited screening for grid strength metrics that could help determine “whether at all, and what type of models and system impact studies would be needed to reliably connect the IBR.” He suggested that “maybe some screening based on site transmission hosting capacity maps, or brute strength measures could help inform what level of detail of modeling might be required.”
Regarding subsequent interconnection studies, Boemer said that where a change of plant equipment might trigger a re-study of the reliability study, “appropriate and sufficient and validated models based on the actual equipment that would be used in the field may become important.”
Boemer provided a link to an EPRI web page regarding validated, publicly available models for various types of studies.
Interconnection and reliability
Boemer indicated that his comments were intended to address “today’s interconnection process” and also reliability issues with inverter-based resources. The interconnection study process for large-scale renewables and storage is “highly diverse” across regional grid operators and “kind of backlogged,” he said, adding that the process lacks technical standards, requires different levels of technical detail for models and studies, and often is not automated.
Boemer also spoke of “significant reliability issues, with solar PV plants in particular,” pointing to resource disturbances as recently as last year, as analyzed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). “Those issues seem to be rooted in a mixture of insufficient inverter unit performance, and insufficient plant design and configuration.” He recommended pre-construction design evaluation, which “we see in other areas of the world being used much more thoroughly than here in the U.S.” Following plant construction, Boemer discussed a possible “as-built” plant-level evaluation that could show that the plant as installed matches what was designed and studied.
Learnings
“We do not have to reinvent the wheel,” Boemer concluded. The challenges he discussed “are new to North America” but “this is not new to many regions of the world.” North America “could leverage international learnings,” he said, listing resources developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the European association for the cooperation of transmission system operators (ENTSO-e), and national standards developed in Germany and Australia.
By referencing these learnings, Boemer said, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission “could fill in some important gaps that have not been identified” in its notice of proposed rulemaking.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/17/nrel-releases-a-list-of-easily-searchable-solar-ordinances/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 17, 2022",NREL releases a list of easily searchable solar ordinances,"The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has released a database of 838 solar ordinances from across the United States. The ordinances were collected after a “locality-by-locality review [of] zoning ordinances after completing an initial review of scholarly legal articles”. Afterwards, the collection of ordinances was put in a machine readable format that can be downloaded from NREL’s website.
The group also released an interactive map to allow individuals to browse the jurisdictions within their database. The legend tells viewers what information they can expect in the data for each jurisdiction.

The data contains information from 34 states. Four of the states – North Carolina, Illinois, Indiana, and Virginia – represent 48% of the entries. North Carolina makes up 135 of the total data points collected.
The majority of this data covers setbacks from property lines, rivers, roads, and highways. Other ordinances in the data are related to the volume of area covered by the solar modules (the ground coverage ratio – also known as GCR), the height of solar panels, noise produced by the system, and restrictions to the total system size. Notably, the data also references several moratoriums, and two outright bans. Some of the ordinances covered are at the city level, and a couple are at the state level, but the majority of the jurisdictions covered are at the county level.
One of the document’s goals is to assist researchers as they model the reality of what volumes of solar can be deployed across the nation, adding the local political climate to previous, simpler modeling that looked solely at the amount of available land.
The spreadsheet’s data is designed so that researchers can feed it into their models and produce more precise estimates of the amount of solar that can be deployed within the specific jurisdictions.
Broadly speaking, there is plenty of space for solar power to meet our needs. It has long been known that we could fully power the United States with a 100 km by 100 km square of solar panels in the southwest deserts of the USA. But since that solution isn’t especially practical, it’s worth noting that many analyses revealed how we can meet 100% of our electricity needs via rooftops, floating solar, windows, and parking lots.
However, there is significant pushback against solar in many areas – specifically in rural regions, mostly due to political reasons. Unfortunately, many politicians have already jumped on this anti-solar bandwagon.
