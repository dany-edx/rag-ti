https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/17/growatt-introduces-lfp-solar-generator-for-portable-off-grid-use/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 17, 2023","Growatt introduces LFP solar generator for portable, off-grid use","Growatt announced that its new solar generator, Infinity 1300, uses lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to achieve a 3000+ cycle lifespan. The generator can be fully charged with solar panels, resulting in 1,382 Wh capacity and 1,800 W output. It can perform a fast charge in 1.8 hours using an AC input.
The Infinity 1300 contains 14 DC and AC outlets and carries bi-directional inverter technology. The generator can be controlled through the SmartGro app.
Optional 200 W solar panels are available for off-grid use, and four can be connected for 800 W of charge. The foldable panels are made up of monocrystalline silicon solar cells and are made with an ETFE fluorine-based plastic material that makes them weather resistant. The modules have a waterproof rating of IP67, which means, that the International Electrotechnical Commission has determined that the unit can be dropped into a body of water up to a meter deep for up to 30 minutes.
The generator is designed for portable use. At 16.5 by 9.1 by 11.3 inches, the system weighs less than 43 pounds. Its optimal operating temperature is from 68 F to 86 F. The system includes Growatt’s battery management system (BMS) technology, and it also features an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) function and multi-unit expansion.
Growatt announced that it is taking pre-sale orders for its Infinity 1300 solar generator now through April 30 on Growatt’s official website.
In December, Growatt announced a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for residential and commercial rooftop PV applications. The APX HV battery has a storage capacity of 5 kWh with one battery module and up to 30 kWh with six modules. The smallest battery measures 27.2 inches x 7.3 inches x 26 inches and weighs 143.3 pounds. The largest one weighs 694.5 pounds and is made up of two columns of three battery modules, each measuring 27.2 inches by 7.3 inches by 49.2 inches. The system has a maximum parallel expansion to 60 kWh.
A year ago, Growatt unveiled the Infinity 1500 solar generator, which has a battery capacity of 1,554 Wh and an AC output of 2,000 W, which the manufacturer said can power nearly 95% of outdoor and home appliances, with 12 outlets available for diverse electric needs. The device can be charged with up to four 24 V solar panels in series or using eight 12 V solar panels.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/17/since-ira-150-billion-investment-46-factories-18000-jobs-in-renewable-energy/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 17, 2023","Since IRA, $150 billion investment, 46 factories, 18,000 jobs in renewable energy","Over the last eight months, following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, over $150 billion in domestic utility-scale clean power investments have been announced, according to the American Clean Power Association (ACP).
This unprecedented level of investment exceeds the total investment in utility-scale clean power projects brought online in the five previous years combined, spanning 2017 to 2021. Over 96 GW of utility-scale projects have been announced over the eight month stretch, said ACP.
Solar is set to play a central role in decarbonizing and onshoring U.S. energy. By 2030, it is estimated the IRA will drive the installation of 950 million solar panels, 120,000 wind turbines, and 2,300 grid-scale battery facilities.
While the investments are a clear sign of the promising progress towards a decarbonized economy, ACP warns that more action needs to be taken to ensure that future.
“To realize this clean energy future and ensure the full potential of these projects, ACP urges the Administration and Congress to continue improving trade policies, supporting next-generation technologies, finalizing effective tax implementation and working to enact commonsense permitting reform,” said the report, entitled Clean Energy Investing in America.
ACP shared in the report that in the eight-month period, 46 utility-scale clean energy manufacturing facilities were announced, bringing an expected 18,000 or more U.S. jobs.
Across the 46 announced facilities, 26 are solar manufacturing sites, 10 are utility-scale battery storage factories, 10 are wind power fabrications, two of which are for offshore wind technology development. The report contains a full roundup of each of the manufacturing sites, the expected jobs created, the expected online date, investment data, and other relevant information.
The largest single-site announcement was the Hanwha Qcells facility, which will entail an investment of $2.5 billion to expand the company’s manufacturing capacity in the U.S., and is expected to create as many as 2,500 jobs in Georgia. The factory will address several legs of the solar supply chain, from polysilicon ingots, to wafers, cells and modules.
A battery facility of note is American Battery Factory’s site to manufacture lithium-iron-phosphate battery cells for residential and commercial energy storage. The site, expected to come online in Q4 2024, would represent $3.1 billion in economic activity in its local county, bringing roughly 1,000 Arizona jobs.
In addition to the declared sites tracked in the report, 11 additional facilities have not yet announced locations, including: PV Hardware, Enphase Energy, SolarEdge, Enel, Canadian Solar, CubicPV, GameChange Solar, Hanwha & LG Solutions, Linton Crystal Technologies, Trading Philadelphia, and Mitrex.
The report said that over $4.4 billion in expected savings for over 24 million ratepayers was announced across utility markets. This includes $56 million in projected annual savings from Duke Energy Florida.
“We understand our customers need some relief, and this is an opportunity for Duke Energy to pass tax savings to our customers,” said Duke Energy Florida State President Melissa Seixas.
Utility WEC Energy Group projects customer savings of $2 billion as it targets 3.3 GW of new renewable resources, including 1.9 GW of solar, 720 MW of storage, and 670 MW of wind. Michigan utility DTE Energy said the Inflation Reduction Act lowered its 20-year resource plan by about $500 million.
Minnesota utility Xcel Energy estimates $490 million in incremental savings for existing projects through 2027 and an estimated $1 billion in additional savings for new projects through 2034 under the IRA.
“If completed, these investments and projects will strengthen our energy independence, improve air quality, support one million American clean energy jobs, and put us on track to produce enough affordable domestic clean electricity to power the equivalent of every American home by 2030,” said ACP.
IRA spending, which includes $369 billion for climate and energy, will be supported by closing tax loopholes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, said the law’s authors. The administration said 55 of the largest U.S. corporations paid no taxes in 2020, and the top 1% of earners are estimated to legally avoid $160 million in taxes annually. Closing those get-outs and levying a minimum 15% tax on the most profitable corporations will capture $124 billion in previously lost government revenue over a decade, said the Biden Administration.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/17/brut-wine-makers-turn-to-solar-plus-storage-microgrid/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 17, 2023",Brut wine makers turn to solar-plus-storage microgrid,"Three California wineries famed for their Brut sparkling wine have turned a new leaf for grid resiliency measures in an area prone to wildfires in recent years.
The Roederer Estate, Scharffenberger Cellars and Domaine Anderson wineries in Mendocino County, California have turned to Coldwell Solar and ESS Tech for solar-plus-storage solutions. All three are using ESS Tech’s iron and saltwater long-duration energy storage system providing up to 12 hours of back-up power.
ESS, a Wilsonville, Oregon-based long-duration energy storage system manufacturer, announced it will deliver three Energy Warehouse systems to Coldwell, a Rocklin, Calif.-based commercial, industrial and utility solar developer. ESS will provide three Energy Warehouse systems across the winery microgrid, providing 1.5 MWh of energy storage backup to the on-site solar systems.
The systems will be installed in a solar-plus-storage microgrid. Coldwell Solar worked with the wineries to design a system that met their needs and the microgrid is expected to be operational in late 2023.
To date, Coldwell Solar has developed solar istallations for several winery operations including a 1.2 MW ground-mounted solar array for J. Lohr Vineyards in Paso Robles, Calif.
“The wineries needed an energy storage solution that could withstand the elements and operate safely in a wildfire-prone region,” said Sean Hood, chief operating officer of Coldwell Solar. “With its inherent safety and low carbon footprint, ESS technology was the only option that meets the energy resilience and sustainability needs of our customer.”
The long-duration storage system will safeguard Roederer, Scharffenberger and Domaine Anderson against the impacts of Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events and other grid interruptions.  The measures support back-up power operations to enable around-the-clock wine production, showcasing the role that energy storage can play in rural agricultural applications.
In addition, the Mendocino County, Calif. Winery will avoid demand charges and realize energy savings by utilizing the 12-hour Energy Warehouse system to reduce grid electricity use during peak periods. The ability to reduce grid demand during late afternoon and evening periods will also support the stability of the local grid.
“We’re pleased to support these wineries’ commitment to sustainability while providing the energy security needed to continue delivering economic benefits to the Mendocino region,” said Hugh McDermott, senior vice president of business development at ESS.
The Energy Warehouse container provides 400 kWh of peak energy over a 12-hour battery discharge whose module’s average life is more than 20,000 cycles. The container weighs 41.9 tons at wet weight and measures 40 feet by 8 feet, standing 9.5 feet high. The system uses recycled iron components and abundant saltwater, making its electrolyte system fully recyclable.
Wildfire risk
After the Nash Fire of June 2020 consumed ten acres of Mendocino County woodland just three miles from Roederer, Scharffenberger and Anderson’s Philo, Calif., estates, more wine country mainstays could be turning to grid resiliency measures such as solar-plus-storage microgrids.
In January 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) adopted new rules, rates and tariffs designed to lower barriers to the development of microgrids. The CPUC noted that customers are already allowed microgrids, but determined more has to be done to facilitate microgrid deployments in Southern California Edison (SCE), Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) service territory.
Each California utility was ordered to create “a renewable microgrid tariff that prevents cost shifting in their territories, to jointly develop a Microgrid Incentive Program with a $200 million budget for funding new microgrids. These systems will support communities that have been or could be impacted by grid outages and the funding is aligned with new technologies to regulation that could help advance more projects, including long-duration storage such as the Energy Warehouse system.
In June 2022, Domaine Carneros, a Napa County, Calif., producer of sparkling wine and Pinot Noir, deployed a 250 kW solar array using a battery, allowing the winery to draw from stored energy during costly evening peak-demand times, with smart controls, enabling it to take the facility off the grid in the event of an outage. The Carneros microgrid supplies 75% of its electricity needs, according to a recent press release.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/17/solar-panels-on-downed-chinese-balloon-powerful-enough-for-advanced-radar/,"EVENTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 17, 2023",Solar panels on downed Chinese balloon powerful enough for advanced radar,"In February, a balloon determined to be sent by China was shot down off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. 
The balloon’s surveillance capabilities, outlined in a U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) document, were leaked recently on the chat and streaming website Discord by Jack Teixeira, a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard. Teixeira was charged on April 14 for unlawfully copying and transmitting classified materials.
The Washington Post reported that the leaked document confirmed the balloon contained enough solar panels to power an advanced form of radar that can generate imagery at night. The surveillance system, known as synthetic aperture radar, can also pierce clouds and thin coverings like tarps.
According to the NGA document, the vessel contained 10 kW of solar capacity. This is a similar amount of solar capacity one would find on a U.S. residential rooftop array.
The balloon also contained a parabolic dish measuring 1.2 meters in diameter, several unidentified sensors and a possible mast antenna, said the Washington Post.
The spy balloon was downed by a missile fired from a U.S. Air Force jet on February 4, 2023. China criticized the U.S. for its response to the balloon, saying that it is “irresponsible” and a demonstration of “information warfare” against Beijing.
The U.S. said it took action to disable capabilities of the balloon while it was in the air, before ultimately deciding to shoot it down, blocking it from collecting U.S. communications.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/17/best-practices-in-installing-power-optimizer-mlpe-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 17, 2023",Best practices in installing power optimizer MLPE systems,"Module level power electronics (MLPE) are becoming increasingly popular in commercial rooftop and ground mount solar installations due to their ability to improve return on investment (ROI) through a combination of factors: increased energy production, greater design flexibility, and lower O&M costs. The following are three common questions asked by installers when designing or installing power optimizer MLPE systems for commercial projects.
What is the best power optimizer-to-module ratio for my project?
When designing a MLPE system, it is important to determine the level of optimization required for each project. This should be based on several factors: available roof space, level of shading, and cost.
The two most popular configurations are:
Oversizing DC/AC ratio: how much is too much?
It is a fact of life that PV modules do not consistently perform at their nominal output rating. Module output power is affected by the weather, the sun’s position during the day/different seasons, local site conditions, and array orientation. In addition, module output power may decrease due to aging, soiling and shade. Using MLPE in your project maximizes power production in all scenarios, and can improve system ROI.
Oversizing the array (in comparison to the inverter’s AC power) also helps to increase energy production. This trend became popular when PV module price levels started to fall. Producing more DC power than the inverter can turn into AC energy means the system will produce peak power for longer on sunny days, and it increases the probability that it will produce maximum power in low-light conditions.
However, too much oversizing may negatively affect plant production, resulting in a longer payback period. This is because inverters are designed to generate output power up to a maximum AC power that cannot be exceeded, and they limit (clip) the power when the actual produced DC power is higher than the inverter can output. Added to this, as oversizing causes the inverter to operate at high power for longer periods, it can also reduce the inverter’s lifetime if its oversizing capacity is not sufficient.
Inverter oversizing capacity can range considerably from 135% to 200%, depending on the brand or model of the inverter. Therefore, it is essential to check the manufacturer’s information to ensure you keep oversizing within recommended limits. 
How can I avoid PV connector issues?
PV connectors are a crucial component of any solar system. However, if not installed properly during installation, there may be future consequences. Below are three common connector-related errors that can occur during installation. The good news is these can be easily avoided with a little know-how.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/17/maryland-passes-community-solar-bill/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MARYLAND",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 17, 2023",Maryland passes community solar bill,"Within days of voting for a 3 GW energy storage target by 2033, a Maryland delegate announced the passing of legislation that would solidify a community solar framework.
Maryland State Delegate Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) announced the passage of HB 908, which, once signed into law by Governor Wes Moore, will provide community solar access across the mid-Atlantic state of 6.2 million residents.  SB 908, cross-filed with SB 613 from State Senator Benjamin Brooks (D-Baltimore County), will replace Maryland’s existing community solar pilot program with a permanent, less restrictive, and more equitable community solar program, according to a Coalition for Community Solar Access statement.
Once signed into law by Governor Moore, Maryland will become the 23rd U.S. state with a statewide community solar program offering subscription access to all residents. The law is expected to take effect on July 1, 2023.
“Since passing the pilot program’s enabling legislation in 2015, community solar in Maryland  has proven fruitful,” said  Clippinger. “By the time the program expires at the end of 2023, it will have brought enough solar capacity to support some 90,000 Maryland consumers. And with the passage of this legislation, we’re one step closer to achieving the state’s clean electricity goals in a way that ensures the financial and economic benefits of community solar reach the communities where they’ll matter most.”
HB 908 eliminates the pilot program’s arbitrary cap on community solar projects at 580 MW, and allows community projects to be a permanent distributed generation option for consumers, alongside net metering.
Community solar projects are small to mid-scale solar facilities typically sited on private land, commercial rooftops, landfills, industrial sites and other preferred areas in proximity to the utility customers they’re intended to serve. Currently about 75% of Maryland households lack the ability to deploy rooftop solar systems based on inadequate roofing or shade conditions, as well as rentals or condominiums prohibiting access to solar systems, said the Sierra Club.
“Community solar is an ideal tool for achieving clean energy and equity goals for the state, and this bill expands the program at a unique time where it can leverage the billions of dollars in funds recently made available by the Inflation Reduction Act,” said Senator Brooks. “Most importantly, the LMI subscriber and siting provisions of the bill strengthen the business case for targeting Maryland’s overburdened and underserved communities.”
Under Maryland’s legacy community solar pilot program, Marylanders are afforded the choice to enroll as “subscribers” to community solar projects, whereby they are credited savings on their utility bills that are based on their share of the revenue generated by the project’s energy sales.
HB 908 moves Maryland’s solar market away from limits associated with the types of projects that can be developed and instead incentivizes the development of projects on a greater variety of sites, including commercial and industrial  rooftops, brownfield sites, as well as using agrivoltaics on farmland.
Underlying all these projects is the Federal government’s goal, called the Justics40 initiative, to have at least 40% of community solar capacity dedicated to low-to-moderate income (LMI) customers. This will ensure that disadvantaged Marylanders have equitable access to utility bill savings at a time when electric prices are driving up household energy costs.
We know from the pilot program’s outcomes that small-scale, distributed solar can bring a wealth of local and state-wide economic, environmental, and public health benefits,” said Kristen Harbeson, political director at the Maryland League of Conservation Voters.  “And we’re confident that with this legislation, Maryland will continue to build on its success and drive an accelerated transition toward a more equitable, resilient, and affordable clean energy future, and we applaud the General Assembly for its passage.”
Solar friendly laws
In February, Maryland legislators introduced a bill to boost residential solar adoption. Sponsored by Maryland Senator Brian J. Feldman and Delegate Lily Qi, Senate Bill 664 and House Bill 1239, would increase Maryland’s residential clean energy grant from $1,000 to $5,000 to boost adoption of rooftop solar and create local clean energy jobs.
This bill would fund rooftop solar grants through fees and penalties paid by companies that do not meet the state’s clean energy requirements, minimizing the cost to taxpayers and ensuring those fees are directed toward promoting renewable energy. It would also enhance clean energy incentives for low- and moderate-income residents, as well as those living in overburdened and underserved communities.
In June 2022, the state passed a pair of community solar bills. HB 1039 and HB 440 create tax incentives for the development of agrivoltaic community solar projects which serve low- and moderate-income customers on rooftops, brownfields, landfills, and clean fills. The bills provided a pilot framework for the state’s community solar market, with the current HB 908 replacing the former with a long-term framework.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/17/interconnection-delays-threaten-more-companies-each-year-says-gridstor-vp/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 17, 2023","Interconnection delays threaten more companies each year, says GridStor VP","Interconnection is an “urgent problem that threatens to become fatal for more and more companies each passing year,” said Jason Burwen, vice president of policy and strategy for GridStor, in a LinkedIn post. GridStor develops and operates large-scale battery storage projects.
And interconnection backlogs for utility-scale renewables and storage are “a problem for the entire clean energy transition,” he said, “not just the individual companies looking to do the work.”
Interconnection reforms proposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, involving cluster studies, developer readiness milestones, and study deadlines, “remain in limbo nine months after first being published,” Burwen said. FERC currently has two Democratic and two Republican commissioners, and one vacant commissioner position.
The proposed FERC reforms will “likely require” multiple years to fully implement, “presuming they stand up after the inevitable litigation” that will follow the order, Burwen said. He quoted FERC Commissioner Allison Clements as acknowledging earlier this year that the proposed reforms are “incremental.”
Meanwhile, leaders of some grid operators are making the case for pausing the planned retirements of fossil power plants, “many of which will pass 50 years in service,” because of the “interconnection dilemma,” Burwen said. The PJM Interconnection grid market has asserted that the pace of fossil power plant retirements must slow down to avoid reliability problems later this decade, he said. The Midcontinent System Operator’s CEO John Bear “has made similar assertions,” Burwen said, and “it appears lawmakers in Indiana are seeking to slow or stop fossil retirements as a response.”
In California, “quick fixes” proposed by grid operator the California Independent System Operator would “winnow the interconnection queues so they could move faster,” Burwen said. Some CAISO proposals “may prove existential for some businesses,” he said, such as auctioning off scarce interconnection opportunities or “outright refusing to consider projects outside (yet to be described) priority zones.”
The solution “seems to be to push down demand to match available supply,” he said, “yet these rationing mechanisms are contrary to the principle of open access to transmission, which is the foundation for competitive electricity markets.”
Billion-dollar gift, Manhattan Project
Burwen said he hoped that a “simple, blunt answer can speed things up starting right now,” suggesting:
These ideas “may sound fanciful,” Burwen said, “but if the U.S. can put the lion’s share” of the Inflation Reduction Act’s $370 billion, “maybe more like $1.2 trillion,” into renewables and storage deployment, “then we need to imagine actual near-term ways” to interconnect all those projects, “and fast.”
Asked how GridStor is weathering interconnection delays, Burwen said that GridStor is “as concerned as other industry members that interconnection processing times have become very long, and we urge much needed reforms at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and elsewhere.” As for GridStor itself, he said the company “enjoys a favorable capital position that allows us to be both patient developers and take well-timed actions in acquisition.”
