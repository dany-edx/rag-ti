With many entities– from utilities to grid operators to state, local and federal governments—taking action to reduce their carbon emissions, the  Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) partnered with Google, Microsoft, and Xcel Energy as well as other utilities, large energy consumers, local governments and electricity suppliers to gather feedback in order to develop a framework to help various entities reduce carbon emissions.
In the white paper “Tiers of Electricity Decarbonization,” SEPA outlines and explains the framework for identifying “tiers” of decarbonization, indicating ease of implementation and the carbon reduction impacts of actions and strategies entities can take to progress toward the carbon-free goal.
All actions are not created equal and not all actions make sense or are practical for all entities. SEPA has identified four dimensions to assess which action(s) to take to reduce carbon emissions: actor type, objectives, context and available actions.
In this video, two project partners, Nidhi Thakar from Portland General Electric and Caroline Golin from Google, share how this work will help their organizations achieve ambitious carbon reduction goals.
A worksheet walks an entity through five steps to help them develop a list of actions tiered by the impact of the action’s carbon reduction.
The objectives for different entities will vary widely. Some may focus on reducing their own carbon emissions according to a specific carbon accounting methodology, while others may focus on reducing carbon emissions locally in their community or grid, and others may plan to act more broadly, including globally. Timescale, location, public policy, and mission-critical objectives may also affect their choice of or outcome of certain actions.
An entity’s context refers to where its facilities, infrastructure, or actions are located, will influence both the actions available to it and the carbon reduction impacts of those actions. Factors influencing the availability of possible carbon reduction actions include: cost—incentives, funding, tax credits, etc.; product availability; data information availability and access. Taking all of these factors into account, along with the factors influencing the impacts of potential carbon reduction actions are important first steps.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/17/target-launches-its-first-net-zero-store/,"SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 17, 2022",Target launches its first net-zero store,"Big box retailer Target is testing its first net-zero carbon emissions store as a model to bring sustainable solutions to its operations. Located in Vista, California, the store will generate energy provided by the 3,420 solar panels on its roof and carports. The store is expected to produce a surplus of 10%, enabling the store to send excess solar production back to the local power grid. Target has applied for net-zero certification from the International Living Future Institute.
Target fit its HVAC system to the solar array, rather than using the conventional method of burning natural gas. The store also switched to carbon dioxide refrigeration, a natural refrigerant. Target said it will scale its CO2 refrigerant use chain-wide by 2040, reducing emissions by 20%. LED lighting conserves the store’s energy use by roughly 10%.
“We’ve been working for years at Target to shift toward sourcing more renewable energy and further reducing our carbon footprint, and our Vista store’s retrofit is the next step in our sustainability journey and a glimpse of the future we’re working toward,” said John Conlin, senior vice president of properties, Target.
The company’s sustainability strategy, called Target Forward, commits the retailer to net zero greenhouse gas emissions enterprise-wide by 2040. Since 2017, the company reports a reduction of emissions of 27%.
More than 25% of Target stores, about 542 locations, are topped with solar PV. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) marks Target as the top US corporate onsite installer with 255MW of capacity installed.
“Target continues to be a top corporate solar user, and we’re excited to see Target double down on its clean energy commitments with new solar carports and energy efficient buildings through this innovative and sustainable retrofit,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “We commend the Target team for their leadership and commitment to sustainable operations as the retailer continues to raise the bar for how companies can invest in their business and create a more sustainable future.”

The 390MW solar, 140.25MW/561MWh battery energy storage facility is one of the largest in the state. The project, which began development in 2015, was originally developed by Recurrent Energy, a subsidiary of PV manufacturer Canadian Solar.
The Kings County solar facility has five power purchase agreements (PPA) attached to California-based organizations. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), Stanford University, and the Power and Water Resources Authority (PWRPA), a publicly owned organization that serves major water purveyors for irrigation. PWRPA has energy demand that fluctuates from 20 to 120 MW from winter to summer consuming 290 to 520 GWH of energy annually to convey, treat, and recycle water for their growers and consumers.

Notably, Stanford University announced it recently achieved 100% renewable energy operations. The university is in pursuit of net zero emissions by 2050.
Also served by the project’s PPA are Central Coast Community Energy and Silicon Valley Clean Energy, both organizations that offer opt-in contracts for customers who desire a higher share of renewable energy generation attached to their electric bills.
“Slate is a landmark project that will help California meet its leading renewable energy targets. We started developing Slate in 2015, and we’re proud that this project was contracted as one of the first utility-scale solar and energy storage projects in the state, thanks to the forward-thinking leadership among the projects’ customers.” Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO of Canadian Solar.
The project is expected to generate power equivalent to 126,000 California homes, displacing roughly 369,310 metric tons of carbon annually in the process. Over the past year, the project employed 405 workers at peak construction, 90% of which were local King’s County residents. Skilled tradespeople from local unions were hired for the construction.
Goldman Sachs’ renewable team was established in 2017 and has now sponsored more than 2.6GW of capacity across 850 solar and storage projects in 27 states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/17/energysage-solar-market-report-finds-that-as-prices-rise-customer-choice-expands/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 17, 2022","EnergySage solar market report finds that as prices rise, customer choice expands","EnergySage released its fourteenth semi-annual Solar Marketplace Intel Report, which covers pricing, equipment, and consumer preference trends in the US residential solar and energy storage industries. The data in the report comes from quotes sent to homeowners shopping on EnergySage.com in 2021 for solar panels and batteries from solar companies in 37 states and Washington, DC.
A few of the key findings include: the price of solar increased, buyers have choices and strong preferences for paired modules/inverter, and shoppers showed a strong interest in energy storage, and while battery prices rose–three stalwarts remain while six manufacturers offer batteries below the $1,000/kWh stored threshold.
Price Increase
For the first time since 2014 when EnergySage began tracking prices, the quoted price of solar increased. The minor (0.4%) increase from $2.67/W to $2.68/W between the first and second halves of 2021 is though to likely be due to the effects of supply chain constraints and shortages.
“With solar prices on the rise, albeit slightly, the data in this latest report really speaks to the importance of, and the levels of, transparency, competition, and comparison-shopping offered on EnergySage,” said EnergySage CEO and founder Vikram Aggarwal.

Equipment Preference
The request for quotes on specific equipment pairing was strong. Silfab
remains the most quoted panel brand in the most states, while Enphase remains the most quoted inverter brand.
Energy Storage Interest
In 2021, the number of shoppers who installed energy storage with solar climbed 4% to 13%, and that is after 70% of all shoppers inqired about storage. The installed cost of energy storage quoted on EnergySage increased 5% between the first and second halves of 2021 to $1,289 per kWh stored. Most storage shoppers receive a quote for a single battery with either 10 or 13kWh of storage capacity, with the median installed cost of a battery quote on EnergySage at $13,000 in the second half of the year.

Battery Prices
Of the 22 different battery brands quoted at least once on EnergySage in the second half of the year, Enphase, LG Energy Solution and Tesla were the three most quoted options. Tesla remains the lowest cost option on a $/kWh stored basis. However, a half dozen other brands of batteries were quoted below the $1,000 per kWh stored threshold in the second half of 2021, albeit at a lower quote volume: Homegrid Energy, BYD Battery Box, Growatt, Tigo Energy, Fortress Power, and Q CELLS.
Other data includes the finding that the primary reason for shopping for storage is financial savings as opposed to the previous goal of resiliency. Further data points include the price distribution for residential solar–which states have the highest and lowest prices.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/17/iowa-politician-attacks-landowner-freedoms/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,IOWA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 17, 2022",Iowa politician attacks landowner freedoms,"In Iowa, a state known for growing corn, soybeans, hay and oats, a politician submitted legislation that could dictate to landowners that they are forbidden from leasing their land for commercial solar power, if their soil meets a minimum ‘corn suitability rating’. The legislation, submitted by Senator Dan Zumbach, has already moved past Iowa’s first round of political vetting and is being discussed in the broader state law making body.
The specific text of the legislation – SF 2321 – states:
The bill provides that the owner or manager of agricultural land shall not install a commercially owned solar panel field unless the solar panel field has a CSR of 65 or lower, the solar panel field is at least one-half mile from the next solar panel field, and the solar panel field is located at least 1,250 feet from the nearest neighboring landowner.
According to the farm management firm Hertz, the Corn Suitability Rating measures the potential soil productivity based on soil profile, slope, and weather conditions. The most recent version is labeled CSR2, and the values it assigns are used by appraisers, real estate agents, and farmland investors in order to evaluate land values and analyze comparable (agricultural/corn land) sales.
An Iowa academic uploaded a walkthrough for determining the CSR2 of any specific plot of land via an online mapping tool. This author picked a random plot of land in the middle of the state, and got an output of the below map:

Per this rating, if the legislation were passed, this 283 acre parcel wouldn’t be viable for solar power. While there is seemingly 53 acres of land rated below a CSR of 65, 18% of the land highlighted above, the spread out nature of it – the yellow sections – does now allow for the needed continuity and shape that solar requires.
According to the website IowaCorn.org, 57% of the state’s corn goes directly to ethanol – which makes up approximately 7.4 million acres of land. This volume represents 27% of all ethanol manufactured in the nation.
Roughly speaking, 7.4 million acres of ethanol fields (less than 10% of US corn) could be used to generate 64% of the electricity used in the United States in 2021. This relatively small amount of land is sufficient to power more than 100% of the 3.2 trillion miles of passenger vehicles driven annually, were we to convert to a fully electric fleet.
