https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/02/wisconsin-town-sues-utility-regulator-for-approving-a-300-mw-solar-farm/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WISCONSIN",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 2, 2022",Wisconsin town sues utility regulator for approving 300 MW solar farm,"Koshkonong Solar Energy Center is proposing a 300 MW solar facility and 165 MW Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) that would sit on approximately 4,600 acres of primarily agricultural land in the towns of Christiana and Deerfield in Dane County, Wisconsin. At 300 MW, the solar installation would be the largest in a state, which at the end of 2021, had 837 MW installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The Town of Christiana is asking the courts to reverse the Public Service Commission’s (PSC) approval of installation, which would produce enough electricity to power about a third of the county’s homes. The town’s complaints include the arguments that the PSC wrongly approved a project that violates the state Constitution, did not have an adequate environmental review and was presented under false pretenses, among other deficiencies. In a petition filed in Dane County Circuit Court, the town alleges that the project would unreasonably interfere with orderly land use and development plans and would adversely affect public health, as well as amenities such as “views, historic sites, geological formations, the aesthetics of land and water and recreational use.”
Koshkonong Solar Energy Center is proposing the project. The company is an independent power producer and a wholly owned subsidiary of Invenergy, a Chicago-based power generation development and operations company. As such, the project did not need to be reviewed by the PSC, and it voted 2 to 0 in April to build the facility. Koshkonong Solar Energy Center has stated that it intends to own and operate the project or develop and sell it to a utility or independent power producer. Subsequently, an application was jointly filed by Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, and Madison Gas and Electric Company to purchase the project for a reported $649 million. Another of the town’s complaints is that the PSC should not have issued a for what it called a “merchant” wholesale plant, pointing to the fact that the company plans to sell it to regulated utilities.
The PUC says it followed the law. The order states that “The fact that a project may be acquired by a public utility at some point in the future does not transform the project into a non-merchant plant.”
While the project has been met with opposition from the town in addition to the school district and village of Cambridge, its supporters include Clean Wisconsin, the Sierra Club, Clean Wisconsin and Dane County sustainability groups. The proponents argue the project is needed to help in the move to clean energy, and the impacts of solar panels pale in comparison to the alternative. The PUC found the impacts were “unfortunate but a necessary result” of maintaining reliable electricity service with clean energy.
If approved, construction is scheduled to begin in the Spring of 2022 complete and in service by December of 2024. The Town of Christiana would receive more than $250,000 a year in utility aid revenue from the plant.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/02/new-york-announces-2-gw-of-new-solar-across-22-projects/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 2, 2022",New York announces 2 GW of new solar across 22 projects,"New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced awards for 22 large-scale solar and energy storage projects to be constructed across the state, which together will add more than 2 GW of clean energy and roughly 160 MW of storage to the state’s grid.
The initiative is being touted as the state’s largest land-based renewable energy procurement to date. Construction and development of the portfolio is expected to create over 3,000 short- and long-term jobs across the state, more than $2.7 billion in private investment, and raise the state’s renewable energy total in its overall energy mix to around 66%. The project awards were divided by region across six regions: the Capital Region, Central New York, Mohawk Valley, North Country, Southern Tier, and Western New York. While it has not yet been decided what the duration of the storage projects will be, utility-scale installation in the region often use four-hour duration, meaning we will likely see 640 MWh of storage added to the grid.
Capital Region projects
Central New York projects
Mohawk Valley projects
North Country projects
Southern Tier project
Western New York projects
Particularly of note are the Columbia Solar, Rich Road, Fort Covington, Yellow Barn, and Ridge View projects, all of which are over 150 MW in capacity, a bit of a rarity for New York. While some utility-scale capacity has been built, especially in more recent history, the majority of capacity that has achieved operation within the state has come from residential solar and community solar projects, where New York is the nation’s leader.
In March, New York achieved the milestone of having more than 1 GW of community solar installed and operational, the only state in the country to achieve the feat. Much of the community solar developed in the state has received benefits from the state’s NY-Sun program, a state solar incentive program for distributed generation assets. Since being launched in 2011, NY-Sun has put forth more than $1.8 billion to advance the scale-up of solar and move the State closer to having a sustainable, self-sufficient solar industry.
The Columbia and Ridge View projects are especially noteworthy, as the two are among the largest projects ever approved in New York. Both edge out the recently-approved Excelsior Energy Center,  a 280 MW solar energy farm on 3,443 acres in the town of Byron, just west of Rochester. The true behemoth, however, is Hecate Energy’s $500 million, 500 MW  Cider Solar Farm in the towns of Elba and Oakfield, southwest of Rochester, which received approval in April.
Additional economic impact
In developing the 22 listed projects, developers have committed nearly $86 million in investments in disadvantaged communities throughout the state, including community-based investments such as new occupational apprenticeships, scholarship programs, and summer camps focused on supporting local disadvantaged communities. Additionally, all developers have committed to ensuring that workers associated with the construction of projects are paid a prevailing wage, a standard set by the NYS Department of Labor.
The average statewide bill impact for the typical residential customer will be approximately $0.13 per month once the projects are in operation, with all 22 projects having a weighted-average all-in development cost of $63.08 per MWh.
“With the largest portfolio of projects awarded to date, New York is strengthening an already massive renewable energy pipeline that is positioned to deliver increasing amounts of clean and affordable electricity to thousands of families across the state for years to come,” said President and CEO of NYSERDA and Climate Action Council Co-Chair Doreen M. Harris. “NYSERDA is committed to working with the awarded developers, local host governments and community stakeholders throughout the project development process to responsibly site projects, including the protection of prime agricultural land, and ensure that they cross the finish line on time.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/02/retractable-1-2-kw-solar-awning-for-rvs/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 2, 2022",Retractable 1.2 kW solar awning for RVs,"Fremont, California-based Xponent Power announced that it received the German Innovation Award for its 1.2 kW solar awning for RVs. The prestigious award was established in 1953 by the German Design Council.
The awning, called Xpanse, is a retractable solar array that provides shade for relaxing outside the RV during adventures. The 1.2 kW design packs a considerable amount of power into a small package attached to the exterior of the RV. The compact design deploys at the touch of a button integrated with the interior RV control system. Xponent Power said the awning can generate up to 6 kWh per day.
The awning can be integrated with existing rooftop solar. The company also designs 800 W and 1 kW models. When fully extended, it measures roughly 16 feet long by 7 feet wide.
The panels are bifacial, generating electricity both from sunlight above and reflective light from below. Bypass diodes are integrated with each module, meaning that if one module is shaded, it will not affect the performance of the rest.
Xponent Power said the awning is highly wind-tolerant, and under extreme weather conditions, the awning automatically retracts completely to protect itself. Small gaps between the modules allow wind to pass through, increasing the structure’s stability. 
The company includes a five-year warranty on the solar awning and one year warranty on labor.
Rather than covering the roof of the RV, which is limited in space, the awning folds out from the side of the vehicle. This prevents numerous roof penetrations and allows easy access to the roof for repairs and maintenance.
Rather than being closely ratcheted to the roof, which can cause heat management and performance problems, the array is exposed to open air for effective cooling and optimized power generation. Xponent Power tested the awning arm for 2,000 open and closed cycles with additional weight added to the array to confirm its durability.
Xponent performs the installation of the awning in-house, and the company said it has plans to have numerous installation locations across the United States. It said the design is compatible with most RV makes and models. The array can be installed on the opposite side of existing awnings, negating the need for removal.
The company said it expects to begin deliveries in 2023. The array may qualify for the 26% federal investment tax credit in 2022 and 22% in 2023.
Xponent said it is exploring modifications to adapt the Xpanse awning for residential, marine, and other applications.

“It is exciting to have the financial backing of investors who helped launch and scale the solar industry, as well as venture funds specializing in creating the needed infrastructure for the circular economy,” said Solarcycle CEO Suvi Sharma. “This funding will allow us to scale our advanced recycling operations in North America, enabling us to start handling the millions of solar systems that will be retiring in the coming years.”
Solarcycle, based in Northern California, was founded this year by industry experts from leading corporations and institutions such as Solaria, NEXTracker, Sierra Club, and the University of New South Wales. Solarcycle launched its recycling platform last month and announced that Sunrun was its first partner.
The recycling solution can recover more than 95% of vital materials that can be re-used, according to Solarcycle. Its technology allows it to extract metals including silver, silicon, copper, and aluminum and to recycle or repurpose 95% of panels currently in use.
“I firmly believe the transition to a renewable economy must be coupled with full attention to developing a circular economy for addressing the mineral scarcity and looming waste problem coming our way,” said Tom Dinwoodie, co-founder of Sunpower.
The market for solar recycling is strong and growing, as solar installations increase at a rapid pace. One group that is studying reuse of solar panels is at the National Renewable Energy Lab, which has published research that describes how to motivate the market first to reuse solar panels, and then recycle them by guiding national industrial policy to create a financially viable end-of-life solar panel industry. The researchers’ projections showed that 40% of all solar panels could be reused and recycled using subsidies equal to $18 per panel for 12 years. At that price, a profitable and sustainable solar panel recycling industry could establish itself by 2032.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/02/amaresco-to-develop-solar-and-storage-project-at-joint-base-pearl-harbor-hickam/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,HAWAII",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 2, 2022",Ameresco to develop solar and storage project at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam,"Ameresco and Bright Canyon Energy announced that the two companies have begun development on the proposed Kūpono Solar Project, a solar-plus-battery system to be built at the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam West Loch Annex in Hawai‘i.
The Kūpono Solar Project is planned to be a 42 MW solar array paired with a 42 MW/168 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) set to be constructed on 131 acres of underutilized land within the Navy West Loch Annex of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. In support of a Department of Defense long-term energy security initiative, Kūpono Solar signed a 37-year land lease with the Navy to provide critical energy resiliency upgrades.
“We are excited to be working with the Navy, Hawaiian Electric, and the community on this important sustainability project in Hawai‘i. The energy generated and stored on this underutilized land will directly benefit the residents, businesses, and communities of O‘ahu,” said Nicole Bulgarino, executive vice president, Ameresco. “In addition, it will replace energy generated by burning fossil fuel, thereby reducing emissions and greenhouse gases and create a cleaner, healthier place for residents to live, work and play.”
Construction is expected to be completed in early 2024. Kūpono Solar, the joint venture started by Ameresco and Bright Canyon, will own and operate this solar-plus-battery project under a 20-year power purchase agreement with Hawaiian Electric.
In May,  the Navy announced it will make progress toward achieving 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, with at least half of that from locally supplied clean energy from projects like the Kūpono Solar Project.
While the strategy document does not address the expected contribution of solar, it highlights an existing solar plant and a planned large-scale battery energy storage system at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California, and existing mobile and deployable solar-powered electric vehicle charging stations at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany in Georgia. The document also highlights geothermal and landfill gas generation.
In 2019, the Navy heralded the completion of a 53 MW solar project in Millington, Tennessee, 20 miles Northeast of Memphis, which was built on 72 acres of land leased from the US Navy at the Naval Support Activity Mid-South. While the majority of the solar array is located on the adjacent private land that Silicon Ranch purchased from the Millington Industrial Development Board, the naval installation received a brand new alternative electrical feed that will increase energy security and resilience at NSA Mid-South. This feature enables the installation’s more than 6,500 personnel to focus on their mission at the Navy’s Human Resources Center of Excellence.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/02/empire-state-getting-into-solar-development/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 2, 2022",Empire State getting into solar development,"New York state is seeking feedback on the processes involved in auctioning projects for its soon-to-launch Build-Ready program. The Request for Information (RFI) has set a comment response deadline of June 14, 2022 (extended from the original due date of June 6, 2022), and is structured around the department’s first potential Build-Ready project – the Benson Mines Solar Project.
Following a public presentation, the New York Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA) released the RFI presentation.

NYSERDA says the RFI aims to gather feedback from solar developers, owners, operators, and investors for three purposes:
The key page of the presentation (below) links to the main documents for review as part of the RFI.
Part A is the Build-Ready’s Proposed Auction Process, which is to be reviewed, while the Response Template is how those reviews should be communicated to NYSERDA by June 14 at 3 pm via the link that is also provided.  This due date was extended from the original due date of June 6.
Part B contains documents related to the new solar power project being developed: the Benson Mines Solar Project. The various links to Appendices contained tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of solar development documentation.

Benson Mines’ Interconnection Application, noted above in Appendix 8. Independent Interconnection Feasibility Report, shows a cost of $1.97 million, and 18 to 24 months to complete the grid upgrades needed.
The Built-Ready program
The purpose of the Built-Ready program is to derisk solar development at sites that the State of New York deems highly desirable for deploying solar power.
First, NYSERDA has a rolling Site Recommendation Form in place, with the team ‘prioritizing the development of existing or abandoned commercial sites, brownfields, landfills, former industrial sites, and other abandoned or underutilized sites.’

Once a site is submitted, NYSERDA will first do a remote (desktop) screening of the site to determine the highest layers of viability – they are looking for wetlands, species considerations, or other digitally discoverable variables. After the screening, there will be further assessments and designs to determine financial viability, as well as other pre-screening techniques.
The next step is one that greatly affects how project development will occur. The state will take on the financial and time risks of getting landowners to agree to host a solar power project (i.e., gaining site control), gaining zoning approval from the local jurisdictions, and working through interconnection with the local utility or the New York ISO.
The projects will be sold at auction with a 20-year Renewable Energy Certificate contract. NYSERDA says they’re working through about 30 of the 5,000 initial site submissions. The group says most of the sites have 5 to 20 MW of solar hosting capacity.
This article was amended on June 3 to reflect the date extension for the RFI.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/02/us-department-of-energy-launches-partnership-to-speed-interconnection/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 2, 2022",US Department of Energy launches partnership to speed interconnection,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) is building the Interconnection Innovation e-Xchange (i2X) partnership to develop solutions for faster, simpler and more fair interconnection of utility-scale solar, wind and storage projects, through “better data, roadmap development, and technical assistance.”
The partnership engages grid operators, utilities, clean energy developers, regulators, and DOE’s national laboratories. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) tweeted that it is a “proud inaugural partner,” noting that more than 1,400 GW of clean energy capacity awaits interconnection to the grid. The participating labs include: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Solar and wind capacity will need to “dramatically expand” to meet the Administration’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, said DOE in its announcement. Meanwhile, current rules, costs and procedures for connecting to the grid “cannot handle the rapid increase” needed in clean energy projects, and “more efficient processes” are needed to bring the projects online.
The rapid increase in clean energy projects cause uncertainty among project developers due to lengthy interconnection wait times and high project withdrawal rates.
“Eliminating the gridlock that’s slowing down clean energy deployment is critical” to bring cheaper electricity to American families and businesses, said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm.
SEIA and allies have previously asked federal energy regulators to speed the interconnection process by establishing enforceable timelines and competition. Many grid operators and utilities have declined to disclose the quantity of solar and storage projects for which they completed facilities studies last year—the final step that enables project developers to contract for interconnection.
The “core issues” that the partnership program aims to solve include “a lack of data, shortage of human resources, and more complicated grid impact assessments,” DOE said.
The program will provide technical assistance to partners to develop solutions to specific regional, state, and local interconnection issues. It will also address the inequities caused by burdensome interconnection processes, in line with the Administration’s Justice40 initiative, and with the involvement of energy justice organizations.
DOE staff from the Solar Energy and Wind Energy Technologies Offices and DOE’s national laboratories will develop a 5-year roadmap that sets goals and identifies research gaps and benchmarks for success.
Register here for an online kick-off event on June 7, and a link for those who would like to join the partnership.
