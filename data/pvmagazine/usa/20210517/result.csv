Along with the launch, Blue Ridge Power acquired the solar division of Horne Brothers Construction, one of the largest mechanical and civil contractors in the country.
With the addition of Horne Brothers, Blue Ridge Power said it will be one of the largest independent solar energy EPC companies in the U.S.
The move by Pine Gate reinforces a recent trend of large solar companies outsourcing their EPC to third parties or subsidiary companies. The trend began in July 2019, when Cypress Creek Renewables announced it would wind down its internal EPC business, shortly after acquiring North Carolina-based FLS Energy. According to Cypress Creek, “EPC made sense when we were concentrated primarily on deploying solar in the Carolinas, but as we have expanded outside of the Carolinas, it makes less sense.”
Later in 2019, First Solar also announced it would shed its EPC arm to “leverage third-party EPC services.”
The rationale was much the same for Pine Gate, with new Blue Ridge CEO, Chris Dunbar, stating that the shift will enable the company “to serve a broader market and cater to the needs of clients looking for a turnkey project solution.”
Blue Ridge Power will maintain its partnership with Pine Gate, serving as exclusive EPC contractor. Pine Gate Renewables said it expects to construct more than 5 GW of projects over the next three years. Beyond of the 5 GW pipeline, the Blue Ridge Power has 700MW currently under construction with 2,500MW forecasted for 2021/2022. It counts more than 550 employees and a construction presence in 17 states.
Pine Gate Renewables was represented on the transaction by Gibson Dunn. Truist Securities Inc. served as financial advisor to Horne Brothers and Smith Anderson provided legal representation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/17/more-solar-modules-are-being-shipped-at-lower-prices-eia-data-shows/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 17, 2021","More solar modules are being shipped at lower prices, EIA data shows","More solar modules are being shipped at lower prices than ever before, according to the latest edition of the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Monthly Solar Photovoltaic Module Shipments Report.
In January, 1.725 GW of modules were shipped at an average price of $0.36 per watt, tied for the lowest per-W price since EIA began tracking module shipments in 2017. In February, prices fell to new record lows, as 1.728 GW of modules were shipped at an average price of $0.34 per watt. In March, the per-watt price was extended, while a new record was set for total modules shipped, as 2.712 GW of modules were shipped at an average price of $0.34 per watt.
The jump in capacity recorded during March was noteworthy as it happened in the first quarter. Historically, module shipment spikes have occurred later in the year, as developers look to lock in that year’s investment tax credits (ITC) through a safe harbor provision that allows them to pay 5% or more of the cost of a project. Considering that modules represent more than 5% of total project costs, securing modules at the end of the year has been a common way to lock in the prior year’s ITC.
In March, California led the way, as it typically does, with 574 MW of modules shipped to projects in the state. Texas was a close second, with 544 MW of capacity shipped to in-state projects. Five other states recorded more than 100 MW of module shipments in March, a milestone that had not before been accomplished.
The five states were Georgia, shipping 190 MW; Illinois shipping 116 MW; Nevada shipping 131 MW; North Carolina shipping 118 MW; and Virginia shipping 110 MW. Unlike previous versions of the EIA report, the top states for shipments did not feature any surprises, as most of the leading states are known solar hotbeds. Illinois was perhaps the only outlier, although it has solidified its solar commitment in recent years.
Price per watt on the decline
February and March also featured the lowest cost per watt in the history of the report. Both months notched an average cost per peak watt of $0.34, edging out the previous record of $0.36, set in January. That price had been reached four other times since early 2020. The mark also was lower than March 2020’s average price of $0.37 per watt, though drops in average price have become less significant as the solar market has matured. It used to be common for prices to fluctuate a couple of cents per month. That trend leveled out in February 2020, and no single-month change has been greater than 2 cents since.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/17/green-hydrogen-venture-aims-for-1-50-kg-for-la-by-2030/,"HYDROGEN,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 17, 2021",Green hydrogen venture aims for $1.50/kg for LA by 2030,"The Green Hydrogen Coalition, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and other partners launched HyDeal LA, an initiative to achieve at-scale green hydrogen procurement at $1.50/kilogram in the Los Angeles Basin by 2030.
HyDeal LA aims to overcome the biggest barrier to the green hydrogen economy—its high cost—by launching a commercial green hydrogen cluster at scale.
Green hydrogen can be produced from renewable electricity and water or organic waste, can be used as a carbon-free fuel, and provide long-duration seasonal energy storage.
Phase 1 of HyDeal LA will design the supply chain needed to achieve $1.50/kg delivered green hydrogen in the LA Basin. It also will strive to agreen on terms and conditions to achieve production, storage, transport, and delivery of green hydrogen at scale.
LADWP said that green hydrogen “is the key to reliably achieving 100% renewable energy.”  The HyDeal LA effort aims to catalyze the supply chain needed to achieve large-scale, low-cost green hydrogen power supply for LADWP’s local power plants.
In March, a study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory said that Los Angeles’ goal of reaching a 100% renewable, reliable, and resilient grid could be met as early as 2035. Doing so will require adding new solar, batteries, wind, and transmission, along with operational practices that make more efficient use of those assets. The study did not address specific costs, but said that economic impacts to the city would be “small relative to the overall size” of LA’s economy.
LADWP is currently leading the conversion of the Intermountain Power Project in Delta, Utah, to become one of the world’s first gas turbines designed and built to operate on 100% green hydrogen.
Dubbed “IPP Renewed,” Intermountain project includes retiring existing coal-fired units at the power plant site and installing new natural gas-fired electricity generating units capable of utilizing hydrogen for 840 MW net generation output. Additional investment will modernize the power plants transmission system to southern California, and develop hydrogen production and long-term storage capabilities.  The new natural gas generating units will be provided by Mitsubishi Power and designed to use 30% hydrogen fuel at start-up, transitioning to 100% hydrogen fuel by 2045 as technology improves.
HyDeal LA is part of HyDeal North America, a commercialization platform launched by the Green Hydrogen Coalition. It is modeled after HyDeal Ambition, a similar project in Europe committed to producing and buying 3.6 million tons of green hydrogen per year for the energy, industry, and mobility sectors at €1.5/kilogram (kg) before 2030.
In addition to LADWP, HyDeal LA leaders include 174 Power Global, Mitsubishi Power, and SoCalGas. Key implementation partners include Clifford Chance, Corporate Value Associates, Cranmore Partners, Energeia, Marathon Capital, Sheppard Mullin, and Strategen.
Earlier in May, Mitsubishi Power and Texas Brine Co. agreed to develop large-scale long-duration hydrogen storage to support decarbonization efforts across the eastern United States.
This collaboration expands Mitsubishi Power’s capability to store hydrogen in salt caverns across North America. As one of the nation’s largest brine producers, Texas Brine and its affiliates have salt positions in New York, Virginia, Texas, and Louisiana that will enable access to major load centers in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and the Gulf Coast.
Expanding the use of salt caverns for hydrogen energy storage offers an opportunity to create an infrastructure for clean energy resources throughout the U.S. to benefit industries such as power, transportation, and manufacturing that are targeting net zero carbon emissions.

The 2.45 MW battery project was developed in partnership with ENGIE North America.
ENGIE will own and operate the battery unit, which is located on the site of the co-op’s 2 MW solar array in central New Hampshire. The battery unit will charge from the cooperative’s distribution system during times of low demand and discharge during periods of peak regional electricity use.
The co-op may discharge the battery to supply energy to its members up to 70 times a year. It estimates these discharges will save its members $2.3 million over the next 12 years.
The battery storage unit can fully charge or discharge within two hours. The battery is housed in a pre-fabricated 40-foot container in Moultonborough, New Hampshire.
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and energy supplier Enovos said they will build two solar arrays at the tire maker’s testing facilities in Luxembourg.
The first will be a photovoltaic carport consisting of 1,500 solar panels, covering a parking lot of around 4,000 square meters. With an annual production of 657,500 kWh, the carport is expected to be completed in August. Plans for the second array are targeted for 2022.
When finished, both stations will produce around 5 GWh of electric power annually and reduce carbon emissions by around 50,000 tons for the next 20 years.Goodyear manufactures its products in 46 facilities in 21 countries around the world. Its two Innovation Centers are in Akron, Ohio, and Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg.
NextEra Energy Partners said it amended an existing convertible equity portfolio financing agreement with KKR to upsize it by $150 million. The additional capital will be used in part to fund the acquisition of a 400 MW portfolio of operating wind projects.
Under terms of the amended agreement, NextEra will receive an incremental $150 million as part of the second draw of the financing, which is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter. The second draw is expected to total around $500 million, bringing the total expected proceeds from the 10-year convertible equity portfolio financing agreement to roughly $1.25 billion.
Solar FlexRack said that its Fixed Tilt FlexRack Series G3-X racking product was used for Azimuth Energy’s 1.1 MW solar project on Highbourne Cay in the Bahamas. The project was designed to withstand up to 180 mph winds and includes a 2 MWh battery plant that enables all resort generators to be switched off for the first time in 50 years.
The project has a return on investment of five to six years due to diesel powerplant savings alone, the company said. In total, about two-thirds of the island’s diesel fuel island owners are expected to save more than $700,000 on operating expenses a year in addition to the significant non-financial benefits.
California’s revised state budget for 2021-22 includes money earmarked for zero emission vehicles, clean energy, and energy efficiency updates. Budget revisions that were released in mid-May expand zero emission investments to $3.2 billion over the next three years, and include proposed funding for clean transportation programs that will improve air quality by expanding zero-emission short-haul trucks, transit buses, and school buses. Funding also supports additional charging and fueling infrastructure.
The revision also includes $912 million ($905 million General Fund, $5 million reimbursements, and $2 million special funds) to accelerate California’s progress on meeting its clean energy goals and better position California as a leader in advancing clean technologies.
Major investments include:
• $35 million General Fund to carry out critical resource and transmission planning to support the clean energy buildout needed to meet the state’s energy and climate goals,
• $350 million General Fund to support pre-commercial long duration storage projects that are critical to the success of California’s efforts to decarbonize the electricity system,
• $250 million General Fund for energy efficiency in the industrial sector,
• $125 million General Fund in the Food Production Investment Program to reduce energy use at food production facilities,
• $20 million General Fund to spur environmentally responsible development of offshore wind energy, and
• $110 million General Fund in green hydrogen production to accelerate the transition away from using fossil fuels to produce hydrogen and to displace the use of gas at power plants.
