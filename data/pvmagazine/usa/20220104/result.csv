The projects are named IS245: Indigo solar, a 125 MW project; IS206, a 300 MW project; IS416, a 180 MW project; and IS408, an 85 MW project.
The first, Indigo solar, is a 950 acre site located in Fisher County. It has a posted ERCOT interconnection cost of $15,191,000, and had a favorable result in congestion studies for ERCOT North or South hub settlements. The project has completed PVSyst and 8760 reports, and is FAA 7460-1 compliant. Indigo has a 20-year executed lease, and contains four five-year extension options. The site has undergone environmental study and facility study, and no zoning approval is required.
Indigo solar has an estimated commercial operation date of May 15th, 2022, and has two power purchase agreement offtake options.
The larger of the two, IS206, is sited on 2305 acres and totals 300 MW in capacity. The Jones County project has an estimated commercial operation date of Q1 2023. The project has undergone initial design and equipment selection, has acquired all utility interconnection request documentation and required attachments. A 20-year lease has been executed, with four 5-year extension options. No zoning approval is required. Screening study has begun for the site, and insurance documentation is secured. The project’s FERC 556 form is ready for filing.
The company additionally seeks acquisition for an 85 MW solar project in Medina, Texas, and a 180 MW project in Castro County, Texas, both with estimated commercial operation date of April 20, 2023.
ISS also actively seeks land suitable for solar development. Land of over 300 acres with three-phase transmission lines on or near the property may qualify. Eligible land is not located in flood zones or areas with wetlands issues, and the land owner must retain above/below surface mineral rights, or have executive rights. There must be no underground utilities such as gas or oil within the proposed site.
Over eight years, ISS has developed and sold over 2.4 GW of utility-scale solar farms, equivalent to powering over 1.5 million homes. The company said it has a 13 GW development pipeline across 35 states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/04/renewables-provide-2-5-gw-of-new-generation-capacity-per-month/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 4, 2022",Renewables provide 2.5 GW of new generation capacity per month,"In its latest analysis of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Energy Infrastructure Update and the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Short-Term Energy Outlook, the SUN DAY Campaign, a non-profit research and educational organization, has found that solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources (biomass, geothermal, hydropower, etc.) are now adding more than 2,250 MW of new generating capacity each month.
Specifically, utility-scale renewable facilities, which are defined by FERC as being larger than 1 MW in capacity, added 18,255-MW of new generating capacity during the first ten months of 2021, for an average of 1,826-MW per month. Distributed resources, which are defined by EIA as being smaller than 1 MW in capacity, have been forecast to grow by about 5,100 MW across the whole of 2021, good for an average of about 425 MW per month.
In all, total utility-scale renewables plus rooftop solar (the majority of distributed resources are rooftop solar) are now providing an average of over 2,250 MW of new capacity each month. The 9,604 MW of new utility-scale solar reported by FERC for the first ten months of 2021 is the most ever added in the U.S. in a 10-month period and dwarfs the 6,516 MW added during the same time period in 2020, or the 3,758 MW added in 2019.
Due in part to these impressive monthly additions, SUN DAY outlines that renewables now provide roughly a quarter of total U.S. available installed generating capacity, at 25.47%. This share is significantly greater than that of coal, which represents 18.77%, and more than three times that of nuclear power, which represents 8.32%.
“The breath-taking pace at which solar and wind are adding new capacity explains why renewable sources combined have eclipsed the generating capacity of nuclear power and surpassed that of coal as well as whittled down the lead of natural gas,” noted Executive Director of the SUN DAY Campaign, Ken Bossong.
A year ago, renewables’ share was 23.31%. Five years ago, it was 18.58%, and a decade earlier it was 14.12%, according to SUN DAY.
SUN DAY’s analysis attributes this overall renewable expansion to a nearly threefold increase in wind’s share of installed generating capacity and a 35-fold increase in solar’s share. Wind is now 10.54% of the nation’s generating capacity, while utility-scale solar sits at 5.21%, which is up from 0.15% in October 2011 and does not include distributed solar.
“Conservatively, over the next three years, renewables should expand from about a quarter of the nation’s generating capacity today to at least thirty percent and probably more,” said Bossong.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/04/iberdrola-pnm-merger-rejected-by-regulators-notice-of-appeal-filed-with-state-supreme-court/,"ACQUISITIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW MEXICO",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 4, 2022",Iberdrola-PNM merger rejected by regulators; notice of appeal filed with state Supreme Court,"Public Service Company of New Mexico’s (PNM) parent company, PNM Resources, announced in October 2020 that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Avangrid, Iberdrola’s subsidiary in the U.S., under which Avangrid would acquire PNM Resources, including PNM.
The agreement, which was unanimously approved by both companies’ Boards of Directors, intended to create a leading U.S. regulated utility and renewable energy platform. New Mexico utility regulators, however, recently rejected Avangrid Inc.’s proposed $8 billion acquisition of PNM Resources Inc., saying the deal’s risks outweighed its promised benefits to state ratepayers.
Avangrid disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it has agreed with PNM Resources to extend the longstop date of their merger agreement until 20 April 2023, which may be extended with the consent of both parties under certain circumstances for a further three-month period.
The companies have also filed a notice of appeal before the Supreme Court of New Mexico against the order issued by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission dated 9 December, 2021 rejecting the agreement entered into by Avangrid, PNM, certain of their respective affiliates, and certain intervenors in the approval process with respect to the proposed merger of Avangrid and PNM.
Iberdrola, Avangrid and PNM thus begin to defend their interests, as they consider the decision taken by the NMPRC to be “unfair”. In this regard, it should be noted that the transaction, which was amicable and recommended by PNM Resources’ board of directors, had the backing of stakeholders and had received the approval of various state and federal agencies during the merger approval process, which lasted more than a year.
The stipulated agreement would have provided more than $300 million in benefits to New Mexico customers and communities, while implementing safeguards to ensure continued local control of utility operations and reliable service to customers. Additional community supporters voiced their opinions, including the New Mexico Attorney General, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 611, environmental advocates and organizations representing tribal interests. In total, 23 of the 24 intervening parties supported or did not oppose the agreement.
The affected companies will have 30 days to file a Statement of Issues outlining the argument for appeal against the NMPRC’s decision. There is no statutory time frame for the New Mexico Supreme Court to act on the appeal.
Avangrid is headquartered in Orange, CT and has approximately $39 billion in assets and operations in 24 U.S. states. The company has two primary lines of business: Avangrid Networks and Avangrid Renewables. Avangrid Networks owns and operates eight electric and natural gas utilities, serving more than 3.3 million customers in New York and New England.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/04/build-back-better-act-is-in-urgent-need-of-a-new-sales-pitch/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 4, 2022",Build Back Better Act is in urgent need of a new sales pitch,"Over the first year of Joe Biden’s presidency, the news has been dominated by the administration’s efforts to pass two major pieces of legislation. The first, often called the “bipartisan infrastructure bill,” was signed into law in November and allocated $1 trillion in spending on everything from transportation to utilities to roads and bridges. The second bill, the Build Back Better Act (BBBA), is frequently referred to as the “social bill,” designed to address and fund programs for childcare, housing, education and addressing climate change.
For a period of time, these pieces of legislation were linked in the hopes of passing them together, or one immediately after the other. However, different priorities, ideological perspectives and agendas from both Members of the House and Senate dictated them moving separately. The outcome of this decision created a specific problem: how should we talk about the second piece of legislation?
While Biden’s first major spending bill passed with bipartisan support, its companion piece of legislation is taking longer to progress to the President’s desk. One reason for this is the challenge of landing on tangible ways to define what the BBBA is. The ongoing messaging around both the already-passed infrastructure bill and the BBBA obscures one of its important aspects: it’s also an infrastructure bill. Nearly one-third of the funding allocated in the BBBA is dedicated to clean energy and climate-related infrastructure investments; an unprecedented amount that represents the largest step taken in American history to tackle greenhouse gas emissions and to meet net-zero goals.
The details of the BBBA are often lost in the discussions of political horse trading, but the clean energy provisions of the bill will make it significantly easier for everyday Americans to adopt clean energy technologies. This in turn will allow individuals to lower their monthly energy costs, build resilience against outages, and simultaneously make a difference in the fight against climate change. These concerns are top of mind for American voters. According to a recent survey conducted by SunPower, the top reasons cited by homeowners with solar energy systems are lower energy costs (92%), resilience during power outages (88%) and a reduced carbon footprint (73%). Notably, the survey included homeowners across the political and geographic spectrum.
The most important infrastructure provision in the BBBA for our industry is a ten-year extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), restoring both the residential cash and loan credit for individuals and the commercial, utility-scale, community, and residential third-party ownership credit for businesses to a tax credit value equivalent to 30% of the capital cost of the solar system. The solar ITC has been federal policy since 2006, and it has proven over the last 15 years to be the single most effective policy tool to support the adoption of solar energy in the U.S.
Remarkably, the BBBA doesn’t just extend the solar ITCs — it strengthens them. These crucial policies are modified as part of this bill’s extension, making it easier for both individuals and businesses to implement solar energy, battery storage, microgrid solutions and associated grid interconnection. This supports the critical resilience investments we so desperately need as Americans deal with climate change-induced outages.
In addition, the bill provides an option for the tax credit to be refundable for individuals, and a direct payment for businesses. This means that low-income families without sufficient tax liability can still benefit from the individual tax credit, and businesses who don’t have easy access to tax equity financing can still benefit from the business tax credit. Finally, the BBBA provides an additional boost to qualifying solar projects in low-income and historically disadvantaged areas, representing an additional step towards environmental justice in the U.S.
It’s impossible to overstate the importance of the ITC in supporting renewable energy growth in the U.S. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the residential and commercial solar ITC has helped the U.S. solar industry grow by more than 10,000% since its implementation. Over the last decade, the industry has seen average annual growth of 50%. The ITC hasn’t just resulted in an increase in solar installments — it has also injected billions of dollars into the American economy and created hundreds of thousands of well-paying solar jobs across the country.
According to the original legislation, the solar ITC was scheduled to drop from 26% to 22% in 2021. However, a federal spending package passed in late 2020 extended the 26% rate for an additional two years. This seemingly small difference — an extra 4% for two months — is expected to inject an extra $22 billion into the American economy while spurring an additional 20 GW of solar development over the next five years.
To be clear, a 26% tax credit for two years is projected to inject an additional $22 billion into the U.S. economy. The BBBA would provide up to a 30% tax credit for ten years to those who meet specific criteria. This level of certainty for the clean energy sectors provides a market signal that will result in an unprecedented boost to the economy and jobs market.
In 2021, the news was dominated by climate change, from wildfires and deep freezes to the major promises made at the COP26 UN Summit. The looming threat of climate change is top of mind for American voters, and the Biden administration can demonstrate the historic steps they’re taking to address our warming planet by emphasizing the clean energy provisions in the BBBA. This is a perfect opportunity for Congress and the administration to pivot on messaging and to clearly define parts of the BBBA as clean energy infrastructure legislation.
President Biden and members of Congress can stress the significant benefits the BBBA will bring to American homeowners, particularly those who live in communities that have historically had limited access to solar energy. Most importantly, they can highlight the clean energy infrastructure that will be supported by this new legislation — delivering key enhancements to our aging electricity grid and providing members of Congress with endless opportunities to attend the openings of new solar, battery storage, and microgrid projects serving constituents and communities across the country.
The BBBA is a winning message for grid resilience, the environment, for elected officials, and for everyday Americans. It’s time to get it over the finish line.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/04/rystad-residential-solar-soars-past-ci-in-2021/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JANUARY 4, 2022",Rystad: Residential solar soars past C&I in 2021,"Residential PV achieved a 30% increase in installations in 2021, in a standout figure from Rystad Energy’s year-end summary. According to the analysis, solar installations on homes or small businesses grew from 18.9GW in 2020 to 25.2GW.
The result means that residential PV surpassed the C&I segment for the first time, which registered a decline to 19.9GW in 2021, from 20.6GW in 2020.
One reason for the shift is cost dynamics. With PV module prices having largely increased throughout 2021, as a result of a number of supply chain challenges, larger PV projects are more likely to be postponed or delayed, including those planned for C&I rooftops. The residential segment, by contrast, is more insulated from price increases, with labor and sales costs contributing a larger share of overall PV system cost for the end customer.
Rystad reports that PV module costs increased 57% in 2021, from US$0.21/Wp in 2020 to $0.33/Wp this year. Module material cost increases have been blamed for the increase, which was further compounded by high shipping costs.
The burgeoning Chinese residential rooftop segment, which had been long-awaited and arrived with gusto in 2021, is another driver of residential PV expansion. While not noted in the most-recent Rystad analysis, IHS Markit said that in the first seven months of 2021, China saw 7.66GW of residential rooftop installations – and expected 17GW to be installed throughout the year. Chinese homeowners and developers, in figures reported by IHS Markit analyst Holy Hu in October, installed a massive 1.8GW of rooftop PV in July alone.
Turning to the big end of town, Rystad found that the utility scale solar segment grew by 15% in 2021. Dampening growth has been some 20GW of PV power plant projects that were deferred or delayed in 2021.
“The renewable energy industry is facing some of its most significant challenges yet over the short term,” reported Rystad Energy’s Head of Renewables Research, Gero Farrugio, in a statement. “But the future has never looked brighter with new and aggressive commitments from governments and companies alike.” Farrugio said that carbon-neutral pledges made at the COP26 negotiations in November are likely to result in “major growth in the coming years.”
Across the renewable energy sector, offshore wind, utility scale battery storage, and hydrogen electrolyser installations all saw growth in 2021. Large scale battery installations increased three-fold, and hydrogen electrolyser capacity expanded from 0.04GW in 2020 to 0.08GW in 2021.

Rystad expects 270GW of renewable energy installations to be installed in 2022 – with solar and green hydrogen leading the way. This is despite ongoing PV module price hikes, with the analysts expecting prices to continue to increase to $0.41/Wp in Q3 2022. Rystad says that 50GW of utility scale projects could be threatened by such high prices, “as their economic feasibility dwindles.”
Renewable project transactions point to continued growth, notes Rystad, with 195GW of utility scale wind project transactions having been concluded as of November 2021. This contrasts to just 14.9GW in 2020. Leading greenfield developers for the year were BP and 7 X Energy, and Repsol and Hectate Energy.
Renewable energy’s arrival on the energy sector mainstage was also highlighted by Rystad, with notable acquisitions such as German developer and EPC ib vogt, by DIF Captial, and Italian developer Falck Renewables, which was snapped up by JP Morgan’s infrastructure investment fund.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/04/wallbox-launches-bidirectional-home-ev-charger-with-blackout-backup/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 4, 2022",Wallbox launches bidirectional home EV charger with blackout backup,"At Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2022 in Las Vegas, Wallbox announced a new model of bidirectional EV charging: the Quasar 2. In addition to charging their EVs, homeowners with a Quasar 2 can discharge power from their vehicle to their home, or to the grid.
Adding a new capability to its predecessor model, the device can isolate the home during grid blackouts, drawing backup power from the car’s battery. Wallbox said depending on the battery size and energy use patterns, the device is expected to power a home for more than three days.
The device is optimized for North American markets, and can provide 11.5 kW / 48 A in both directions, marking an increase from the 7.4 kW / 32 A Quasar 1. It can connect to the myWallbox app through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, or 4G for management.
“The average American experienced more than eight hours of power interruption in 2020,” said Douglas Alfaro, General Manager of Wallbox North America. “Whether it’s caused by an earthquake, hurricane, wildfire or simply related to an overload on the power grid, a power outage can have a detrimental impact on homeowners that can last for hours or even days. With blackout mode, we are able to offer EV owners some relief by helping mitigate the impact of a major energy disruption in the home.”
The charger can unlock savings through smart energy management. In locations where electricity rates are tied to demand, homeowners can schedule charging during low-rate periods, and discharge from the car to power the home when rates are high. Homes with PV can store excess energy in their EV, like a home battery, during low usage periods. When rates rise, the stored solar energy can be used during peak times, reducing dependence on the grid.
Quasar 2 joins Wallbox’s line of residential EV chargers, public charging stations, and business/commercial charging solutions. For attendees of this year’s trade show, Wallbox will demo Quasar 2 at CES Unveiled (Table #507) and during the Expo in the West Hall 6627 of the Las Vegas Convention Center.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/04/gaf-energy-launches-timberline-nailable-solar-tile-this-week-at-ces-2022/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 4, 2022",GAF Energy launches Timberline nailable solar tile at CES 2022,"GAF Energy, a provider of solar roofing in North America, announced the launch of Timberline Solar, which the company is calling the world’s first nailable solar shingle.
This week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Timberline Solar Energy Shingle will receive three awards, including its highest honor, the Best of Innovation award, for ‘Smart Cities.’ The product was also named an Innovation Award honoree in both the ‘Smart Cities’ and ‘Smart Home’ categories.
What sets this apart from other solar shingles, Tesla’s for example, is that the roof system directly integrates solar technology into traditional roofing processes and materials. The shingles will be assembled domestically at GAF Energy’s facility in San Jose, California, which was constructed last year after the company moved manufacturing out of South Korea. At the time the facility was expected to be able to produce 50 MW of solar panels annually, and provide jobs to about 400 people in manufacturing, engineering, and R&D.
In an interview with pv magazine, Martin DeBono, GAF Energy’s president, said that R&D teams will be a short stroll away from the production line. And while California and Silicon Valley are not known for their low costs, the company chose San Jose for its proximity to a talent pool that is used to innovating for Apple, Google, and others.

GAF Energy reports that Timberline Solar shingles are water-shedding, strong and warranted to withstand winds up to 130 mph. Rack-mounted solar installations require the drilling of dozens of holes into the roof membrane. Any resulting damage related to those holes is not typically covered by roof warranties. GAF Energy is the sister company of GAF, a leading roofing and waterproofing company. With access to GAF’s national contractor network, GAF Energy is uniquely positioned to bring residential solar to the mass market.
“Solar roofs are the future of clean energy, and Timberline Solar is the game-changing innovation that will get us there,” said Martin DeBono, president of GAF Energy.
“Realizing our vision of a breakthrough mass-market solar roof has been our mission since we launched GAF Energy in 2019. What the team has accomplished is nothing short of extraordinary,” said David Winter and David Millstone, co-CEOs of Standard Industries, parent company of GAF Energy.
The Timberline Solar design achieved UL’s 7103 certification, which authorizes GAF Energy to install the system on residential roofs as a roofing product and a solar energy product, the first of its kind to be recognized as both. In addition, GAF Energy worked with Sandia National Laboratories, a U.S. Department of Energy research and development lab, to verify the product’s strength, durability, and overall market-readiness.
