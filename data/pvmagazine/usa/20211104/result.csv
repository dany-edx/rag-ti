Their model showed that reducing average building energy usage by about 60% would be key to achieving the least-cost 100% renewable grid with building electrification. The cost-optimal amount of building energy savings ranged from 52% to 68% across five selected climate zones in the U.S.
For each climate zone, the model also found the cost-optimal levels of renewable capacity, allowing for oversizing, as well as long-term storage capacity and battery capacity. The model also chose an optimal mix of solar and wind generation, based on solar costs of $1,900 to $2,500 per kW, wind power costs of $1,400 to $1,900 per kW, and transmission costs.
Optimal oversizing of renewable capacity to handle year-round energy needs would be 3.2 times annual electricity demand in a climate zone stretching from Kansas to New York, the model showed. Solar in this case would contribute 15% of total renewable capacity with wind contributing 85%. Oversizing renewable capacity is associated with curtailment during mild seasons.
In a climate zone from Texas to Florida, optimal oversizing of solar would be 1.4 times annual demand, with solar providing all renewable capacity.
The study modeled long-term storage as being hydrogen storage in caverns, and using fuel cells to convert the hydrogen back to electricity. It used a capital cost of $161/kWh capacity. Optimal long-term storage capacity in each climate zone, measured in kilowatt-hours, ranged from 1 to 5 times annual average daily kWh consumption.
The authors said that most long-duration storage technologies “are either geologically constrained or still underdeveloped.”

Battery storage was modeled based on a capital cost of $380/kWh. Optimal battery storage capacity in each climate zone, measured in kilowatt-hours, ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 times annual average daily consumption.
Costs of a building’s energy efficiency improvements were based on case study data points found through a literature search. The authors reported those results as being “robust:” if the actual costs were 50% lower or higher, then changes in the optimal amount of energy efficiency would be within 5% of the reported results.
The study also assessed the technical potential of buildings’ load flexibility, such as flexible air conditioning control, and building-sited thermal storage either in ice or in high-temperature ceramic brick. Load flexibility associated with such measures had the technical potential of reducing daily storage requirements by anywhere from 37%–81%.
The authors said that many U.S. states, cities, and municipalities are developing plans to shift to 100% renewable energy.
The study, titled “Optimal strategies for a cost-effective and reliable 100% renewable electric grid,” was conducted by Sammy Houssainy and William Livingood, both with NREL.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/04/summit-ridge-completes-first-project-in-200-mw-maine-portfolio/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MAINE",TIM SYLVIA,"NOVEMBER 4, 2021",Summit Ridge completes first project in 200 MW Maine portfolio,"Summit Ridge Energy has completed a 6.3 MW community solar installation in Hermon, Maine, the first project in the company’s 200 MW Maine community solar portfolio to reach completion.
The 6.3 MW installation will serve roughly 850 households and small businesses across the state. The project is also part of a 24 MW portfolio of projects that Summit Ridge is developing through a joint venture with Osaka Gas USA.  The portfolio will be financed in partnership with Foss & Company and Live Oak Bank. Foss & Company will be providing tax equity, and Live Oak Bank is holding long term debt.
In July, Summit Ridge entered a joint venture with Osaka Gas USA Corporation to construct, own and operate over 120 MW of community solar projects throughout the state of Maine. The Foss & Company and Live Oak-financed projects represented a portion of that portfolio. Portfolio inception, if you will.
Those 120 MW are expected to provide approximately 11,000 residential and commercial ratepayers with monthly utility savings.
The project will operate under Maine’s NEB program, which, similar to community solar, allows customers to benefit from clean energy savings by offsetting their electrical bills with either owned or shared energy projects.
Simultaneously with the announcement of the Osaka deal, Summit Ridge also acquired a portfolio of three Maine community solar projects from Cianbro, totaling 19.5 MW in capacity.

Survey details trends on solar sector pay and benefits","Renewable energy recruitment company RO shared  results from a salary survey of over 400 respondents in the U.S. solar industry. 
The survey found that above-market salaries, guaranteed first-year bonuses, and flexible remote work options all were important to successful job offers in 2021. In fact, 82% of respondents said remote work was important to them. At the same time, only 17% of survey members said they do not work remotely. Nearly half (46%) said they work fully remote, and the rest reported a blended approach.

On average, respondents reported a 3-5% pay raise each year. Despite this, individuals were not likely to seek new opportunities unless the starting salary at a new company was on average 12% higher than their current salary.
Last year’s survey reported a 6% pay gap between males in females who worked in the same role and offered the same experience. In 2021, that gap widened to 10%.
When asked what the most important benefit of work was, 29% said the culture and work environment mattered most. This was the top response for those who reported 0-5 years of experience as well as for those with 16+ years in the industry. A work from home option was most important to 29% of respondents; it was the top benefit for industry members with 6-15 years of experience.

Other popular benefits included flexible working hours, (18%) health insurance, (13%), and retirement contributions (8%).  Childcare support, and per diem expense coverage each garnered 2%.
When asked what they felt was missing from their current compensation packages, respondents said equity and salary increases (12% each), 401k retirement plans (11%), more paid time off (9%), and a bonus (9%).
On average, a solar industry member had 15 days of paid time off. Around 10% of respondents said they have unlimited holidays.
According to the survey, construction jobs across all sectors paid around $84,600 entry-level. Construction workers with six to 10 years experience made $126,000, and those with 16+ years reported making $170,600. In development jobs, the first two years of experience led to an average pay of $87,600. That rose to $129,200 by years six to 10, and $187,100 for those working in the industry for 16 or more years.

Engineers and operations and maintenance (O&M) workers started off with the lowest salaries, $77,500 and $67,500, respectively. By year six to 10, engineers were paid an average of $94,200 annually and O&M pros made $121,800. By year 16, engineering jobs paid $127,600 on average, and O&M roles made $174,000.
Finance offered the highest pay levels in solar: an average of $94,000 for the first two years of experience, $149,100 years six to 10, and $195,000 for experience beyond 10 years.
The survey said that utility-focused solar jobs pay more than commercial and industrial (C&I), as well as distributed generation (DG). In the first two years of experience, C&I/DG workers averaged $75,500. Meanwhile, utility-focused jobs started off with salaries averaging $88,000.
Interestingly, mid level (six to 10 years) C&I/DG averaged $120,400, while utility-scale was slightly lower at $116,800. Highly experienced utility-sector workers with more than 16 years of experience made on average $173,000, while similarly experienced C&I/DG workers averaged $169,300.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/04/50-year-solar-heres-how-the-numbers-may-work/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 4, 2021",50-year solar? Here’s how the numbers may work,"Solar modules that last 50 years with very little degradation will significantly increase the value of solar power projects.
In an example, below, we see how the discounted cash flow from a project’s electricity generation increases by 46% when shifting the project from today’s standard 25-year lifetime to a 50-year time scale.
This low degradation value results from the near perfect seal that a pure glass-glass encapsulated solar panel offers compared to a standard glass-plastic backsheet product.
We will have solar panels that are guaranteed to last 50 years with little degradation. In fact, these panels are likely being installed right now.
In recent conversations with Meyer Burger’s CEO, Erfurt Gunter, it was mentioned that the company’s glass-glass bifacial solar panel showed virtually no degradation during its durability testing. But a number had to be chosen for the warranty, so the company’s power production warranty states that Meyer Burger will replace the solar panel if its generation falls below 93.2% of its original capacity after 30 years.

What might that panel look like in 2071?
The U.S. Department of Energy funded 50-year glass-glass solar panel research in 2018, and recently funded two projects looking at inverter failure and operations and maintenance as plants reach the half century mark.
The program, Towards50, is led by Dr. Roger French. French has been publishing papers on this research, and told pv magazine USA that degradation levels below 0.2% per year suggest that the possibility of 50-year solar panels is very real. (We will cover these papers in depth in later articles.)
Investors pay for the “net present value” of full earnings, minus all costs, subtracting an estimation of figure interest rates from those earnings. The point to remember is that investors pay for this value at the moment they buy the asset, decades before that cash arrives.
Thus, when calculating the discounted cash flow of a solar power project, this value can be predicted and sold. In our case, a solar power project that generates 1,000,000 kWh per year of electricity that is sold at 4 cents/kWh with a 2% electricity inflation rate, generates a discounted cash flow of $677,357 in the project’s first 25 years.
If the site were to continue running for another 25 years, that would add $316,357 in discounted electricity revenue to the value of the project.
This represents a 46.8% increase over the first 25 years of the project. A substantial fraction of this money would be paid to the solar developer when construction is complete.
There will be arguments from investors on what discount rate should be used, and what should be paid for the project’s net present value, as we attempt to forecast several decades into the future of a complex world.
However, an electricity inflation clause which protects investor revenue can be added to any solar power purchase agreement. This clause also protects the energy buyer’s savings by guaranteeing that the inflation is always lower than actual electricity inflation.
There are multiple indications  that investors are already banking on 50-year timeframes for solar power projects.
A power grid interconnection’s value goes far beyond the current 25 year lifetime of solar panels – in fact – the value goes on in perpetuity.
This was recently shown when a Portuguese renewable auction drew record low bids. Local commentators suggested that the reason the bid price was below the hard costs of a solar power project was that while the electricity contract was short – 15 years – the land and interconnection rights were indefinitely long. Investors clearly were betting that they could make up for their low bid prices over the long term.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Jenny Chase has likened the value of an interconnection on the power grid to “gold dust” sprinkled atop the value of a solar power plant’s original power purchase agreement.
This author has seen long term solar land lease agreements offered to Midwest farmers with 25-year contracts, including a developer’s option on a second 25-year extension of the original land lease period. Most other electricity generation assets have 40-year lifetimes and longer. And  nuclear power plants in the U.S. are now seeking the opportunity to run for 80 years.
So, what will you be doing in 2071?

A bill adder of at least a $0.005 per kilowatt-hour would come on top of current monthly price plans.
The program replaces SRP’s earlier EarthWise Energy and Community Solar programs. SRP said the price is 50% less than its EarthWise Energy program.
It said that if a residential customer uses 1,500 kWh each month and chooses to offset all of her or his household energy use, the premium would be $7.50 for the month. If the same customer offset half of hr or his energy use, the premium would be $3.75.
In August, NextEra Energy Resources said it would build the $600 million 260 MW Sonoran Energy Center solar project in Buckeye, Arizona, near Phoenix. The project will include 260 MW of energy storage.
Salt River Project contracted for the output from the energy center, which will include one of the largest solar-charged battery projects in Arizona. The utility also contracted for a large-scale solar and battery storage project at Pinal Central Solar Energy Center, and is bringing online a new grid-charged battery storage project at the Agua Fria Generating Station.
Late last year, SRP brought online the 100 MW East Line Solar and the 100 MW Saint Solar. The two utility-scale solar fields serve commercial, municipal, and educational customers who participate in SRP’s Sustainable Energy Offering.

The border action was taken under a Withhold Release Order (WRO) issued by CBP in late June.
LONGi said the detained modules accounted for roughly 1.59% of its total 2020 export sales volume to the U.S. It said it established a tracing protocol last year and would be able to prove that the detained modules used silicon that meets U.S. requirements. It also said that module shipment to the U.S. are proceeding normally.
LONGi said that module shipment to the U.S. are proceeding normally.

The LONGi filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange was careful not to mention allegations of forced labor in the silicon supply chain, which is the focus of the WRO. It mentioned, instead, unrelated tariffs dating back to 2011 and said the recent detention was in response to what it referred to as “the Temporary Detention Order.”
Beijing has long denied that any forced labor exists in China. It has passed legislation that penalizes companies for cooperating with U.S. and other governments’ efforts to ban imports of goods produced with forced labor. In the U.S., laws that are intended to combat forced labor date back to the 1930s.
LONGi said that starting in the second half of 2020 it had established and improved management measures to respond to “temporary detention orders (WRO),” including “product traceability and system construction, external agency certification, and supplier management.”
On June 24, the Biden administration ordered a ban on U.S. imports from Chinese-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. over forced labor allegations. The U.S. Commerce Department separately restricted exports to Hoshine, three other Chinese companies, and what it said is the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.
The three other companies added to the U.S. economic list included Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co, a unit of Daqo New Energy Corp.; Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co, a unit of Shanghai-based manufacturer East Hope Group; and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material Co., part of GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd.
Industry analysts believe that Hoshine provides around 60% of the world’s metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) used in the solar industry. The silicon provides feedstock material used in the polysilicon refining process.
In August, reports first emerged that CBP was detaining solar modules that they suspected contained material subject to the WRO. Reports said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents. Canadian Solar also was said to have had four testing samples detained, and Trina Solar was reported as having had six testing samples detained in July.
