The paper recommends actions for both federal and state regulators.
Regional transmission providers and utilities must add staff to speed interconnection, and should be encouraged to do so, SEIA said. State regulators should also add staff to oversee utility interconnection work.
SEIA added interconnection timelines should have detailed timeframes that are enforced with penalties, in contrast to the “reasonable efforts” standard that the Federal Energy Reglatuory Commission (FERC) claims it has never found to have violated.
Infrastructure upgrade costs must be reasonable, directly related to the connecting project, and reasonably close to the initial estimate. Cost estimates should be transparent, showing prices for materials and labor. SEIA renewed its call for large-scale interconnection customers to have the option to use third-party consultants to produce required studies.
Regulators should require the use of state-of-the-art processes for data collection and studies, and require publication of real-time data showing “how quickly or slowly” projects are moving through the interconnection process—with the data used for enforcement, SEIA said.
When a state enacts a clean energy mandate, policymakers should also enact reforms to speed interconnection, or “at the very least” direct regulators to review interconnection rules.
Large-scale solar reforms
SEIA proposed that transmission providers be required to provide project developers with information on points of interconnection with the lowest likely interconnection costs, as well as detailed information, on a secured website, on other locations, so that developers may estimate network upgrade costs before entering the interconnection queue.
Other proposed reforms include standardizing queue management practices, such as a “first-ready, first-served” process, exploring new models for paying for network upgrade costs, and developing forward-looking transmission planning, as FERC proposed in an April notice.
Rooftop solar reforms
SEIA proposed more transparent distribution system planning, open to stakeholders, to forecast growth of rooftop solar and other distributed resources, identify saturation points, and plan solutions to increase hosting capacity. SEIA advocated a “connect and notify” approach for distributed solar projects under 25 kilowatts.
Utilities should establish a low-cost pre-application process for project developers, SEIA said, that would provide a good estimate of the interconnection upgrade cost needed at a given site—an approach used by 12 states. To reform cost sharing for those upgrades, SEIA pointed to a New York approach authorizing utilities to pay for the cost of a distribution upgrade, and then to collect that cost from the developers whose projects ultimately benefit from it, on a pro rata basis.
In the longer run, SEIA suggested that regulators could enable large-scale and small-scale developers to choose “flexible” interconnection for projects at constrained locations. Flexible interconnection avoids major infrastructure upgrade costs, by instead using controls to monitor the state of the grid and adjust the project’s output to respond to changing conditions.
SEIA based its recommendations on discussions with SEIA member companies and interconnection experts.
FERC is expected to publish a proposed rule on June 16 that will cover “many of the same topics” raised in the white paper, SEIA said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/15/tin-lead-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-25-5-efficiency-improved-stability/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 15, 2022","Tin-lead perovskite solar cell achieves 25.5% efficiency, improved stability","Research scientists at the Department of Energy (DOE) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published in the journal Nature Energy that they have achieved 25.5% efficiency in a new tandem perovskite solar cell that uses a tin-lead compound for improved stability. The US Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office funded the research.
Perovskites are under focus by federally backed research teams as an abundant, highly efficient photovoltaic material, but they suffer from resilience and lifecycle limitations.
The new NREL tin-lead tandem cell retained 80% of its maximum efficiency after 1,500 hours of continuous operation. The stability was demonstrated in an accelerated aging test in a lab. It significantly outlasted other perovskites under the same test conditions.
“At this tandem efficiency level, the best reported stability in literature is normally several hundred hours,” said Kai Zhu, a senior scientist at NREL.
The new cell demonstrated a record in the voltage generated, at 2.1142 volts. In comparison, the best certified tandem device registered 2.048 volts.
As opposed to being classified by a specific material, like silicon or cadmium-telluride, perovskites are defined by their crystalline structures. The cells are made from a chemical solution affixed to a substrate. Tandem perovskites involve joining two layers with slightly different photovoltaic reactions to the solar spectrum. Tandem cells have shown efficiencies exceeding 30% in lab demonstrations.
The results build on a 2019 paper published in Science in which a team achieved 23.1% efficiency. In that study, the researchers discovered that deficiencies caused by tin could be addressed by adding the chemical compound guanidinium thiocyanate. The compound made marked improvements in the structural and optoelectronic properties of the cell.
The scientists also found success in adding phenethylammonium iodide to the tin layer of the cell. Combined with guanidinium thiocyanate, the two increased the carrier lifetime of the layer from 20 nanoseconds to 9 microseconds, an increase of 4,500%. Carrier lifetime is a key feature of the efficiency of a solar cell. The researchers found the compounds also reduced the defect density associated with tin oxidation at a level unprecedented for tin perovskites, and previously only achieved by lead-only perovskites.
Perovskite funding
This month, the DOE announced it selected 19 projects for a total funding of $6 million for solar energy research and development projects through its Small Innovative Projects in Solar (SIPS) 2022 Funding Program. Three projects were awarded $300,000 each for the development of perovskites.
The University of Hawaii received an award to test a new sealant material for the outer layer of perovskite cells that can be applied at low temperatures to avoid damage to the cell. The material could potentially replace glass in cells, reducing their overall cost, said the researchers.
The University of Arizona received funds to develop a device that detects defects or degradation of cells. The device would be optimized to perform in a high-throughput production line.
The University of Alabama also received $300,000 to advance high-speed printing of perovskite cells, overcoming challenges of instability and long processing times in manufacturing. The team said it aims to use a “slot-printing” method to make mini-modules with efficiencies exceeding 20%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/15/50-states-of-solar-incentives-new-jersey/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,NEW JERSEY",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 15, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: New Jersey,"One of the country’s most historically healthy and active solar markets, New Jersey has perennially been a top-10 state in terms of installed capacity and projects in construction. The state’s new incentive program, passed in July 2021, is set to bring nearly 3.8 GW of new solar capacity to the state by 2026, but concerns over interconnection delays have some advocates questioning how much of that solar will actually get built.
Solar in New Jersey
New Jersey currently ranks 8th in the country in total installed solar capacity with just under 4 GW of installed capacity, and solar accounts for 6.66% of the state’s electrical generation.

Unlike other states, where capacity figures can be driven by one specific type of solar installation, New Jersey has a healthy mix of residential, commercial and industrial (C&I), utility-scale. The state also has an emerging community solar market, which will be explored in more detail below.
Over the next five years, the state is expected to bring online an additional 2 GW, good for 15th in the country over that period.
Incentives and programs
In July 2021, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) voted unanimously to implement a new solar incentive program that it said will enable up to 3.75 GW of new solar generation by 2026.
The Successor Solar Incentive Program (SuSI) was part of a nearly three-year process mandated by the Clean Energy Act of 2018 to replace the state’s Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) program with new incentives that encourage solar development while minimizing ratepayer cost.
The SuSI Program contains two sub-programs:
The Administratively Determined Incentive: A fixed incentive payment for net metered solar projects of 5 MW or less, including all residential customers and most commercial and industrial buildings, and all community solar installations. The incentive value will vary based on project type and size, and will be guaranteed for 15 years.
The Competitive Solar Incentive: A competitive solicitation designed to incentivize the lowest financial contribution from ratepayers for grid supply projects and net metered commercial and industrial projects larger than 5 MW.
SuSI will provide one New Jersey Solar Renewable Energy Certificate-II (NJ SREC–II) for every megawatt-hour of solar electricity produced by a qualifying facility, with an additional $20/MWh for public entities such as school districts, municipalities, and public colleges and universities, as well as a temporary incentive for projects built on contaminated lands.
Incentive levels for the ADI Program range from $70 to $120/SREC-II. Regulators said this would provide ongoing support for solar development while also offering “significant savings” over the prior SREC value of roughly $220.
In addition to the state’s net metering program, there are additional incentives and tax exemptions in place to spur solar adoption.
The state offers a full exemption from the state’s sales tax for all solar energy equipment, as long as said equipment has previously been approved by BPU and serves one of the following functions: providing heating, cooling, electrical, or mechanical power by converting solar energy to some other usable energy source. This definition also includes energy storage devices.
In addition to the sales tax exemption, in 2008, the state passed legislation exempting renewable energy systems used to meet on-site electricity, heating, cooling, or general energy needs from local property taxes. This exemption extends to solar, wind, fuel cell, and sustainable biomass, systems, as well as other, more niche generation systems.
Community solar
In Oct. 2021, state regulators announced that New Jersey would transition its the two-year-old pilot community solar program to permanent status. The decision to move to a permanent program now rather than wait for a third year of the pilot to commence was driven by the pilot’s success so far.
In two years of the pilot program, a total of 242 MW were awarded to developers by BPU. The pilot required that at least 40% of all approved projects reserve at least 51% of their capacity for low- and middle-income households, and all of the approved projects met that goal.
Scott Elias, senior manager of state affairs, mid-Atlantic for SEIA, said that the trade group is working with the state to develop a program that adds at least 150 MW of solar energy capacity each year.
“We are pleased that every one of the 105 approved community solar projects in New Jersey will provide low-to-moderate-income communities with clean, affordable energy,” Elias said in a statement. He said that regulatory changes to the community solar program, including improvements to the low and moderate-income subscriber verification rules, “are another positive step in improving access to the benefits of clean electricity for lower income communities and communities of color.”
EV and fleet electrification incentives
New Jersey has also taken a leadership role in developing incentives aimed at increasing the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) among both general consumers and fleet operators.
Chief among the consumer incentives, individuals who sell, rent, or lease a new or used zero-emission vehicle are exempt from sales and use taxes on that vehicle. The state is also home to the Charge Up New Jersey Program, which provides incentives to residents who purchase or lease new battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles that have an MSRP of less than $55,000.
New Jersey residents are also eligible for the federal Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle Tax Credit, which provides a base credit of $2,500, for the purchase of an electric vehicle, and an additional $417 for each kWh of EV battery capacity in excess of 4 kWh.
On the fleet side, New Jersey has its It Pay$ to Plug In program, which provides grants to offset the costs of purchasing and installing electric vehicle charging stations for businesses, governments, educational institutions, multi-unit housing properties, and non-profit organizations. The program covers up to 100% of costs for government public charging stations, 80% of costs for privately-owned public charging stations, and up to 60% of costs for workplace charging stations and multi-unit dwelling charging stations.
The maximum incentive for a level-1 EV charging station is up to $750, with the incentive rising to up to $4,000 for level-2 charging, and up to $200,000 per location for installation of at least two Direct Current Fast Charging ports.
In addition to the incentives for charging infrastructure, the New Jersey Zero Emission Incentive Program is a $15 million pilot voucher program that provides incentives for businesses and other similar entities purchasing new, medium-duty zero-emission vehicles that will operate in greater Camden Newark areas.
For vehicles from 8,501 to 10,000 lbs, the voucher is $25,000, which raises to $55,000 for vehicles 10,001 to 14,000 lbs; $75,000 for vehicles 14,001 to 16,000 lbs; $85,000 for vehicles 16,001 to 19,500 lbs; and $100,000 for vehicles 19,501 to 26,000 lbs. Woman, minority, and veteran owned business are eligible for $4,000 bonus per vehicle, while small businesses are eligible for a 25% increase in base voucher amount per vehicle and $2,000 per vehicle scrapped and replaced.
In addition to these existing incentives, in February 2021, Gov. Phil Murphy announced $100 million for the following clean transportation projects:

Longroad has the option to expand its equity investment over the next three years as part of the deal.
Longroad’s equity investment will provide growth capital to Valta’s development pipeline, which currently exceeds 200 MW of contracted solar assets in development, construction, or operations. Valta’s operating assets are primarily in Massachusetts, California, and Hawaii.
“We are very pleased to establish this partnership with Valta.  We are impressed with its business and market focus, and anticipate the funding will unleash the highly capable management team to do even greater things in the DG space,” said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad. 
Valta Energy CEO Mark Milius said he looks forward to the benefits of the investment, in which Valta will leverage its customer-focused in-house distributed generation development team, and Longroad will bring renewable energy expertise and capital efficiencies. Valta was founded in 2009 and grew its business without outside financing to date.
Longroad was founded in 2016 with a focus on development, operating assets, and services. It has quickly grown to own and operate 1.6 GW of solar and wind projects across the United States. Through third parties, it operates and manages 3.5 GW of solar and wind facilities. It is owned by the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, Infratil Limited, and Longroad Energy Partners, LLC.
Longroad Energy has developed high-profile large-scale solar projects, including a 200 MW facility for a Microsoft datacenter, and a 294 MW Muscle Shoals, Alabama solar facility it sold to Ørsted for operation in Tennessee Valley Authority territory.
The company has 497 MW of solar acquired and owned, 628 MW of solar developed and owned, 1 GW of solar developed and sold, and provides services for 1.4 GW of solar facilities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/15/us-grid-scale-energy-storage-quadruples/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 15, 2022",US grid-scale energy storage quadruples,"The volume of grid-scale energy storage installations in the United States increased four times over that seen in Q1 of 2021, setting a new record in Q1 2022. According to Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association’s (ACP) latest US Energy Storage Monitor report released today, grid-scale installations total 2,399 MWh.
“Quarter one of 2022 was the largest first quarter on record by far for grid-scale installations, a notable milestone since installations are typically back-weighted to the second half of the year. The West Coast and Southwest regions continue to dominate for both standalone and hybrid systems,” said Vanessa Witte, senior analyst with Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team.
The record-setting growth occurred despite significant challenges in the industry. And those risks remain, including supply chain disruptions caused by the anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) solar tariff investigation initiated by the Department of Commerce (DOC) when the DOC said that it was launching an antidumping investigation into solar panel imports from Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
“The Biden Administration’s recent decision to pause AD/CVD solar tariffs for two years restores predictability to both the solar and energy storage markets. With well over 50% of utility storage projects being paired with solar farms, this important executive action will help the energy storage market continue to accelerate,” said John Hensley, vice president of research and analytics at ACP.
As battery costs drop and the need for resiliency amid grid fluctuations, residential storage was also on the rise, having its strongest quarter to date. The report estimates that 334 MWh were installed in Q1, improving on the previous quarterly record of 283 MWh in Q4 of last year. By 2026, the residential storage segment is forecast to grow by 5.7 GWh annually, driven in part by adoption in California in reaction to the proposed Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0.
“Despite challenging supply conditions continuing to suppress residential storage, the segment saw over 20,000 installations in a single quarter for the first time and we’re seeing large and small installers forge new vendor partnerships to help meet rising customer demand,” said Chloe Holden, analyst with Wood Mackenzie.
AD/CVD-related procurement delays have slowed the non-residential storage market, which has been downgraded and predicted to grow 1 GW annually by 2026. “A meaningful share of residential solar-plus-storage projects not yet procured are being pushed to 2023, which has impacted paired storage,” Holden added.
Overall, the US energy storage market added 955 MW and 2,875 MWh across all segments in the first quarter of 2022.
“California continues to dominate the sector, with the Valley Center and Slate projects taking the top two spots for largest projects installed in Q1. We also saw more than 90 MW of storage come online outside the top seven states, including projects in Oregon and Alaska,” Witte said.

The six projects are among 12 utility-scale solar sites Alliant Energy is developing as part of its Clean Energy Blueprint, a plan that will add nearly 1.1 GW of solar energy generation to Wisconsin’s energy grid, effectively increase the state’s installed solar capacity by just under 130%, and make Alliant the largest owner and operator of solar generation in the state.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie, the state has installed 855 MW of solar thus far, but is expected to construct 3.2 GW over the next five years, good for 12th in the nation over than span.
The six new projects will be constructed in mostly rural parts of five counties. The company expects to begin construction this summer and finish in late 2023. Alliant Energy will contract with Burns & McDonnell and utilize craft labor from several local union halls.
Five of the project are being self-developed by Alliant Energy, and include:

Once the projects are operational, Alliant said local communities will receive around $50 million in shared revenues for the next 30 years. Over the same period, local landowners are set to receive a combined $60 million in lease payments.
“We are excited to break ground and begin construction on these solar projects as we accelerate toward a cleaner energy future,” said David de Leon, president of Alliant Energy’s Wisconsin energy company. We expect our solar development plans to create hundreds of new construction jobs and deliver safe, reliable, affordable energy for years to come.”
In total, the 12 solar projects proposed under Alliant’s Clean Energy Blueprint will create more than 2,000 local construction jobs, provide an estimated $130 million in local tax revenues over the next 30 years and help customers avoid more than $1.6 billion in long-term costs, if all come to fruition.
Combined with upcoming retirements of the Edgewater Generating Station and Columbia Energy Center, Alliant Energy said it is well positioned to achieve its goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fueled generation in half from 2005 levels by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/15/real-time-pricing-that-balances-renewables-could-save-33-billion-per-year-study-finds/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,MAINE,NEW HAMPSHIRE,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 15, 2022","Real-time pricing that balances renewables could save $33 billion per year, study finds","If consumers could vary their electricity consumption up or down based on wholesale electricity prices, demand for power would be more flexible. That would help balance variable renewable generation, and yield annual system savings of $33-50 billion nationwide across several scenarios, found a modeling study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
Most of the savings would result from lower capacity payments to hold generation capacity in reserve to meet peak load. Reserve capacity can help prevent steep increases in wholesale energy prices when power demand surges, or many generators go offline. The demand flexibility from real-time pricing would reduce peak load, reducing the need for reserve capacity and the amount of capacity payments, the study found.
Additional savings would result from lower wholesale energy prices and greater consumption of energy when prices are lowest, for instance at times of high renewable generation. Customer electric bills would be reduced by up to 17% for participants, and by 10% for non-participants, in a moderate renewables case.
Pilot studies
Following a pilot study in southern California that showed real-time pricing worked on a distribution circuit, utility SCE has launched a follow-on $2.5 million real-time pricing pilot to help prepare for potential extreme summertime weather. The pilot is open to residential, commercial, and industrial customers with price-responsive end-uses, such as electric vehicle charging, behind-the-meter batteries, and controllable loads, which are equipped with suitable software.
Also in California, state regulators approved a $3.25 million pilot program to offer dynamic hourly pricing for agricultural pumping loads. Regulators directed utility PG&E to implement the pilot in coordination with community choice aggregator Valley Clean Energy, which proposed the pilot. VCE’s agricultural pumping load represents 15% of its annual load.
For a real-time pricing pilot project that will involve residents of three rural communities in Maine and New Hampshire, the US Department of Energy has granted $6.65 million. The Post Road Foundation is leading the project, which involves New Hampshire Electric Cooperative and Efficiency Maine, a quasi-state agency.
“Several jurisdictions currently offer real-time pricing rates,” noted the California Public Utilities Commission, in a decision approving the two California projects. Those include ComEd and Ameren in Illinois for 30,000 customers, Georgia Power for 2,000 customers, and Spain, where it is the default rate for 10 million customers, the commission said.
Sending prices to devices
For its modeling study, researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory modeled the consumption of electricity under real-time pricing in the ERCOT grid region in Texas, which they considered generally representative of the United States, and which enabled them to compare their modeled end-loads to actual end-loads in ERCOT. They then scaled up the results to the United States as a whole.
As shown in the featured image above, the modeled system requires automated, price-responsive device controls, a price-flexibility curve set by each consumer, a service provider that aggregates those consumer choices, and a price-discovery mechanism that determines the price at which the grid objective is achieved. That price is then sent to the device controls, to achieve the grid objective, explained Hayden Reeve, senior technical advisor at PNNL, in a webinar. The modeling used both day-ahead and real-time wholesale energy prices.
The real-time pricing scheme modeled by researchers involved four price elements: the wholesale locational marginal price of electricity, a congestion cost, a distribution cost, and a fixed meter charge. The congestion cost was not modeled as revenue to utilities, but was distributed back to customers.
The modeled scenarios involved two separate deployments of distributed energy resources: flexible loads (HVAC units and residential water heaters) and behind-the-meter batteries. Each type of deployment was evaluated under a business-as-usual case, a moderate renewable generation scenario, and a future higher-renewables scenario that included the deployment of rooftop solar and electric vehicles.
Although ERCOT does not have a capacity market, the researchers modeled a system with a capacity market, in order to represent the entire United StatesMaine where capacity markets are widespread.
Texas has outlawed retail rates indexed to wholesale prices, following surging wholesale prices during the Texas freeze, noted Reeve, during a presentation on the study at a conference organized by IEEE, the global society of engineers. Reeve questioned the state’s use of “a five-minute economic signal to guide multi-decade investments,” and suggested that end users should be protected by capping price signals. “Beyond that, there’s open space in terms of what is the right economic signal to make these multi-decade investment strategies worthwhile to people.”

While we know that the cathode is primarily manganese oxide, the anode is a different metal oxide, and the electrolyte is water-based, the company has not yet disclosed the exact battery chemistry. It has indicated, however, that the battery uses no lithium, cobalt or nickel to avoid the problems associated with material supply and cost.
The company said it expects the batteries to cost less than half of current lithium-based batteries. An added benefit is that the batteries are easier to recycle because of the use of non-toxic materials.
“We’re seeing global competition to bring new batteries to market. Most companies are focused primarily on performance and put little thought into also making their batteries safer and more cost-effective—especially for the developing world where consumers are more price-sensitive,” said Nitin Nohria, Ph.D., chairman of Alsym Energy’s board of business advisors and former Dean of the Harvard Business School. “The team at Alsym Energy is working to ensure that their batteries not only meet performance expectations at reduced cost, but also avoid most of the supply chain challenges associated with lithium-based technologies.”
Founded in 2015, Alsym raised $32 million to date from investors including Helios Climate Ventures. The company’s team of scientists and product developers, based in Woburn, Mass., is currently developing a 500 kWh prototype manufacturing facility. Alsym said its batteries can be manufactured in existing lithium-ion battery factories with little to no retrofitting required and without the need for expensive dry rooms, fire locks, and solvent recovery systems.
Alsym has partnered with an automaker based in India in a joint effort to develop the batteries for EVs. The automaker is expected to contract with Alsym to supply a minimum of 3 GWh of battery systems annually, providing that key performance levels are being met. Alsym said it is in discussion with marine shipping and electric two-wheeler companies to develop similar partnerships.
