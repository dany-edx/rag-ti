The blame is being laid on rising fossil fuel costs. 
“We are disappointed that the Public Service Commission continues to pass 100% of rising fuel costs to customers without addressing the fundamental problem: heavy reliance on fossil fuel resources exposes customers to substantial cost risk, as opposed to the significantly cleaner, more affordable resources that are available and ready to go,” said Kate Mixson, staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. 
Earlier this year the Public Service Commission rejected Duke’s attempt to plan for increased use of renewable energy. Yet this is the third time this year that the Public Service Commission has approved utility rate increases due to rising gas costs without addressing its impact on customers and the underlying problem.
“The risks of relying too heavily on fuel-dependent resources will be visible in customers’ bills during a time when many families already have to make tough financial decisions,” said Megan Chase-Muller, state policy director at Upstate Forever, a nonprofit conservation organization that protects land, water, and the unique character in upstate South Carolina “We hope Duke and Commissioners recognize the impact they have on regular customers burdened with absorbing all of the cost risk for fossil fuels and take steps to prioritize renewables,” Chase-Muller said.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, almost 90% of U.S. homes are heated primarily by natural gas or electricity. As noted in its Winter Fuels Outlook, which was released this month, the EIA expects wholesale prices for natural gas to be higher this winter than last winter. Because natural gas is the most common fuel used to generate electricity in the United States, higher natural gas prices lead to higher retail prices for electricity.
“Our current system puts all the risk on customers. Customers pay for all the gas and coal burned in Duke power plants; the utility’s shareholders do not,” said Maggie Shober, Research Director at Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “South Carolinians will continue to be hit with fuel rate increases until the Commission requires utilities to expand affordable clean resources that lower customer bills like energy efficiency and renewable energy.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/13/global-polysilicon-capacities-may-nearly-double-by-end-of-2023-to-536-gw/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",Global polysilicon capacities may nearly double by end of 2023 to 536 GW,"In its Q2 2022 PV Supplier Market Intelligence Program Report (SMIP), solar and storage supply technical advisory Clean Energy Associates (CEA) said polysilicon production capacity may reach 295 GW by the end of 2022, and 536 GW year’s end 2023.
CEA said it expects this production capacity to far exceed solar installations next year. While this may suggest supply problems could begin to be alleviated, CEA said module capacity expansions are slowing. Many manufacturers are instead expanding cell production capacity, catering to the trend of n-type TOPCon and HJT manufacturing.
Ingot capacity grew almost 30 GW this quarter, most of which can be attributed to two facilities bringing 23 GW online.
Wafer capacity decreased slightly, said CEA, primarily due to a major provider retiring its multi-crystalline wafer capacity. The 17 suppliers covered in the report boosted cell capacity by 22% in Q2 2022, bringing 47 GW of capacity online, reaching a total of 262 GW.
Module production reached 324 GW in Q2. CEA forecasts this may expand 20% by the end of the year, reaching 400 GW.
Only seven suppliers covered by the CEA report are fully vertically integrated from ingot to module production, with most others operating at the cell and module link in the supply chain. “With growing merchant wafer options, there is little need for most suppliers to expand upstream,” said CEA.
The report said suppliers are working to optimize wafer sizes after the industry standardized 210 mm (G12) and 182 mm (M10) module dimensions. The “182 mm Plus” (182P) has increased wafer heights to further reduce “white space” caused by intercell gaps to achieve up to 5 W of additional output, said CEA. The “210 mm Reduced” (210R) reduced wafer widths for niche rooftop applications at the expense of power output. CEA said it expects new module sizes for the residential solar market to be introduced.
Many analysts have predicted China will break 100 GW of installations this year. CEA expects slightly lower installations in China during 2022 due to high module prices impacting utility-scale projects. It said many investment decisions have been deferred as projects could not meet their internal rate of return thresholds.
Most of the polysilicon supply chain originates in China. Outside of China, production capacities are 11 GW of ingot, 42 GW of cell, and 50 GW of module capacity. By end of 2023, these capacities are expected to expand to 23 GW, 73 GW, and 74 GW, respectively.
“Policy uncertainties continue to defer expansion plans of suppliers as they remain cautious due to lingering policy uncertainty in the United States surrounding the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and anticircumvention investigation,” said CEA in the report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/13/sunrun-partners-with-enel-x-way-to-offer-home-ev-charging-stations/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",Sunrun partners with Enel X Way to offer home EV charging stations,"Enel X Way and Sunrun, a major residential solar provider, announced the two have partnered to offer Enel X Way’s Level 2 EV charging stations. The co-branded EV charger joins Sunrun’s rooftop residential solar and battery energy storage offerings.
The partnership will result in EV owners being able to charge their vehicles with their own locally-produced clean energy. Enel X Way’s level 2 chargers are grid-connected, meaning they use off-peak and automated charging to help balance the grid, delivering energy cost savings that allow EV owners to boost the value of their investments.
A study by SolarReviews found home solar energy is cheaper and greener than pulling your EV’s power from the grid. Grid-sourced energy can range from $.10 to $.40 per kWh, and averages about $.13 per kWh, while the levelized cost of energy for home solar across the country landed at $.11 per kWh, according to SolarReviews. Both of these options are significantly cheaper than a public charger, which ranges from $.28 to $.69 per kWh.
From a carbon standpoint, home solar performs the best as well, reported SolarReviews. Home solar has an implied emission of 368 pounds of carbon dioxide per 3,780 kWh, while grid power and EV chargers stand at 1,531 pounds, and 450 gallons of gasoline (an equivalent to 3,780 kWh) would emit a whopping 8,830 lbs. of CO2.
“EV owners want to charge their vehicles with a more cost effective, clean, and reliable energy source —saving money and time with home charging convenience,” said Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun.
The co-branded EV charging stations are available now in select markets, including California, New Jersey and Vermont, and are expected to be available nationwide by the beginning of 2023.
“With one-third of Enel X Way EV charger owners using solar to power their homes, there’s no denying the strong correlation between solar adopters and EV owners,” said Chris Baker, head of Enel X Way North America. “Not only does this partnership mark a pivotal convergence between two adjacent industries, the ability to combine efforts and use solar energy to power charging also furthers our progress toward national decarbonization targets. We’re honored to partner with Sunrun to offer an affordable, smart EV charging solution for climate-conscious customers.”
Electric vehicle decade
Over 26.4 million electric vehicles may be on the road in the U.S. by 2030, according to Edison Electric Institute, and BloombergNEF predicts as many as 21.7 million private EV chargers will be needed to meet that demand.
In February, the US announced a $5 billion plan to build electric vehicle charging stations across the country. The funds come as part of the $7.5 billion approved for EV charging as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The network of chargers will be built in “Alternative Fuel Corridors”, some 165,000 miles of national highway spanning 49 states.
The Inflation Reduction Act will also support EV adoption. It extended a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases for 10 years, and a new $4,000 credit for the sale of used EVs. The federal tax credit on charging equipment has also been extended through 2032. For residential customers, the tax credit is 30% of the cost of equipment, up to $1,000.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/13/california-school-district-saves-70-million-with-8-1-mw-solar-installation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",California school district saves $70 million with 8.1 MW solar installation,"Energy costs are the second largest expense for U.S. schools, according to the report Brighter Future: A Study on Solar in U.S. Schools by Generation 180, SEIA, and The Solar Foundation and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). One way to save is to go solar—and many schools are. In 2019 5.5% of all K-12 public and private schools in the U.S. had installed solar power, and it’s on the rise.
This week Chula Vista Elementary School District in California and ENGIE North America announced the completion of the district’s solar project, bringing the total amount installed to 8.1 MW across 48 sites. The district is also finalizing the installation of a microgrid system, which will provide backup emergency power to the district’s IT department, additional servers, and the Child Nutrition freezer. The microgrid’s battery storage system will also provide electricity during the peak time period of 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. when electric rates are highest.
The solar installation includes 18,050 panels installed as shade structures at 46 schools and on other buildings throughout the district. The $32 million project was funded through a G.O. Bond and is expected to save the district more than $70 million in electricity costs over the next 25 years.
“That is $70 million in savings even after project costs have been paid for,” said Oscar Esquivel, deputy superintendent. “By the end of this project, we think we will be able to generate about 90 percent of the District’s overall energy demands. That is a tremendous amount of energy—and savings for our District. This is a ‘green’ project both environmentally and fiscally.”
Houston, Texas based ENGIE North America works with clients on meeting energy efficiency, reliability, and sustainability goals through energy efficiency projects, providing energy supply (including renewables and natural gas), and the development, construction and operation of renewable energy assets (wind, solar, storage and more).
“ENGIE North America team is proud to deliver customized solar and microgrid solutions to customers like Chula Vista Elementary School District,” said Stefaan Sercu, managing director Energy Solutions Americas at ENGIE. “In addition to this technology serving as a critical resource during potential power outages, the bigger picture impact of the District’s move toward sustainable energy ensures long-term financial savings and resiliency.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/13/a-lot-more-than-solar-on-the-floor-at-re/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",A lot more than solar on the floor at RE+,"It’s understandable why RE+ (renewable energy plus) changed their name from “Solar Power” International. Even though solar still dominates the floor at the show, there are many other clean energy products to see!
Parked near the entrance, electric and hydrogen buses were the first products to come into view as attendees approached the show. The 60 foot articulating bus (combines two 30’ segments) from BYD comes with a 578 kWh battery (buses as community batteries), has a range of 193 miles, a top speed of 65 miles per hour, and takes about five and a half hours to recharge.

The vehicles are built in Lancaster, California.
Longi, in addition to its solar panels, also shared its hydrogen aspirations (pv magazine USA will expound on this story at a later date). A small scale mockup of their Alkaline Water Electrolyzer was on display. Longi’s LHy-A1000 5 MW was noted as their most efficient unit.
A Google search suggests 1 MW of alkaline electrolyzer can produce 100 to 200 kg of green hydrogen per hour.

As of 2021, the company had 500 MW/year of manufacturing capacity of this product class. They’re scheduled to reach 1.5 GW this year, and they are seeking 5 to 10 GW of capacity by 2025.
While no formal pricing information was available at the booth, Bloomberg NEF recently reported that a Chinese manufacturer’s alkaline electrolyzer cost only $343/kW – a price that is expected to fall at least 30% by 2025.
GeoThinQ integrates the many tools needed to analyze a piece of land – into a fast, easy to navigate website.

The header image of this article is Renu Robotics’ 1,100 pound lithium battery-driven electric automated electric lawn mower. When the unit finishes mowing the lawn, it returns itself to the charging station – a 12-foot by 7.5-foot building – to ready itself for its next round of work.
While charging, the unit will wirelessly connect to the company’s “Mission Control” software where owners can add additional programming to the unit, such as cutting schedules, add/remove cutting paths, and software updates.
Slick Tools was onsite with their critter guard wire mesh forming AG Bender. The unit weighs 13 pounds, outputs customizable sizes of guard material, and is listed at a price of $799.

In addition to selling you the forming tool, Slick Tools has put together a solar critter job pricing guide using the hardware on their website. The tool accounts for project size, wire mesh material choice and volume, the labor to produce the product with the AG Bender, and the labor to install the critter guard.
The Capstone “Green Energy” waste gas powered microturbine can generate electricity from waste heat. The system is supposedly eligible for a 30% tax credit, so long as it is paired with the optional, integrated Combined Heat-Power system. From what we were told at the booth, the key is making use of the waste heat from the gas turbine actions to heat structures or other uses for green heat energy.

One specific use for this technology might be in location seeking to build a solar+storage+gas microgrid that uses the gas electricity as a backup to the main generation ability of the solar.
We finished the conference with a quirky device from Scott E Wyssling of Alpine, Utah who was showing off his custom built solar powered hydrogen generator/propeller thing. When he flipped the switch in the hand held unit, little bubbles appeared in the tubes and the unit’s propeller came to life.
During Scott’s 9-5 hours he does solar, structural, and electrical engineering, as well as commercial design. Wyssling is licensed in all 50 US states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/13/rooftop-solar-adoption-rises-sharply-as-system-value-to-homeowners-increases/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,MINNESOTA,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",Rooftop solar adoption rises sharply as system value to homeowners increases,"Annual rooftop solar installations more than double from six systems per thousand households, when households break even on a rooftop solar investment, to 14 systems per thousand households, when adding rooftop solar earns them a net present value, or “profit,” of $1,000 over 20 years, a study has estimated. The numbers of systems are based on an average residential rooftop PV system size of 5 kW.
The rooftop solar adoption model was based on solar installation data from California, Massachusetts, Arizona, Germany and Japan from 2005 to 2016. A study presenting the model was published in the journal Renewable Energy.
The Sierra Club used the model, along with other arguments, to persuade Minnesota regulators to require utility Xcel Energy to evaluate, in its next resource plan, incentivizing distributed solar to substitute for more costly types of generation, thereby saving all customers money.
50-state model
The Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) launched the work with a 50-state model that identifies the likely solar adoption rate in each state, based on state-specific data including solar resources, or insolation, and compensation for distributed solar generation. The spreadsheet model has 50 sheets, one for each state.
The model can be adjusted based on policy change, said John Farrell, an ILSR co-director. By focusing the model on the number of households in Xcel Energy’s service area, and the compensation for solar power sent to the grid, he said ILSR found that Xcel Energy’s forecasts “seemed very low,” at just 276 MW of all types of distributed solar over 15 years. In comparison, ILSR’s model, which counted only residential solar and not other types of distributed solar, projected at least 550 MW of residential solar over 15 years.
ILSR then worked to “figure out how much more solar could you get if the utility were to incentivize local solar at a price point that is lower than they would pay for other resources,” Farrell said, in a webinar hosted by the Sierra Club.
ILSR considered incentive levels ranging from one cent to four cents per kWh of solar generation, beyond existing compensation, over a 15-year period.
Near-term victory
The Sierra Club then challenged, in formal comments to Minnesota regulators, the utility’s treatment of small-scale solar as more expensive than large-scale solar. Although large-scale solar has lower capital costs, the group pointed out that individual ratepayers pay most of the capital costs of small-scale solar, “so it’s not reasonable” for the utility to model those costs as being paid by the utility and its ratepayers generally, said Laurie Williams, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club.
Distributed solar also avoids the need for transmission lines, Williams said, and transmission is “very constrained” in the upper Midwest.
Challenging Xcel Energy’s assumption that “they have no control over the level of distributed solar that would be adopted,” Williams said that utility programs, such as rebates, “can incentivize customers.”
The Sierra Club then “made many corrections to Xcel’s modeling assumptions,” Williams said, and conducted its own modeling, including the option for financial incentives to increase distributed solar adoption, and recommending an alternative resource plan that it said would save all consumers money.
Williams claimed a near-term win resulting from its work and that of four other groups, as the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission ordered Xcel Energy, in its next resource plan, to model distributed solar as a resource that can be incentivized, not as a fixed-quantity resource, and to “address” the costs of distributed solar borne by the utility, versus the costs borne by the customer. The four other groups were Vote Solar, ILSR, Cooperative Energy Futures and Environmental Law and Policy Center, which jointly filed separate formal comments with regulators.
The Sierra Club modeled Xcel Energy as having the ability to categorize owners of rooftops according to their willingness to install solar, and to offer the lowest incentives to those most willing to add solar, and the highest incentives to those least willing to do so.
Offering different incentive levels to different customers “could have proven to be a difficult program to administer,” said Will Kenworthy, Midwest regulatory director with Vote Solar, on the webinar. “So one of the lessons we learned during the back and forth with the utility and other stakeholders during the proceeding is that it may make sense to model a single incentive level in each given year.”
The research study used by ILSR is titled “Empirical development of parsimonious model for international diffusion of residential solar.” The study is available for free as an “open manuscript” at this page.
