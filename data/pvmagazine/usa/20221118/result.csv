However, one Canadian company that recently deployed a 323-foot stretch of solar on a sidewalk on a Tampa, Florida street corner hopes to buck the trend of ineffective grid intermittency solutions.
Hurricane Ian knocked out the power to more than 295,000 residents as utility TECO Energy began to restore power on September 29. With that effort came scores of fallen trees and debris on streets and restoring traffic signals.
Since then, the City of Tampa’s Smart Mobility group has been piloting a sidewalk-mounted PV system that has produced enough energy to power about 75% of a traffic intersection’s power in the event of an outage, meaning TECO Energy will have to provide the remaining power by battery or another generator source.
In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times this week, the city’s smart mobility manager Brandon Campbell says the city has been tinkering with solar powered traffic light solutions since 2017’s Hurricane Irma dealt just as steady a blow on the city as Ian.
Compared to 35 generators on hand to power traffic lights during outages, the city’s mobility group said at least 71 traffic signals were still in the dark in the 176 square mile city just across from Tampa Bay.
After more than a half-dozen tests in Daxing, China and around the Vancouver, British Columbia suburbs, Solar Earth Technologies Ltd. demonstrated the ability to provide 3.2 kW to 6.1 kW of peak power, though the Tampa pilot falls on the lower end of that range.
For the cost of $45,000, Solar Earth’s sidewalk PV system in Tampa stretches about 323 feet at the intersection of East Cass and North Jefferson Street, in the city’s downtown district.
The city deployed 84 Solar Earth (42W) modules along the downtown stretch and the pilot test found the system provided 3.2 kW of peak back-up power with projected 10-year savings of about $5,000.

Solar Earth uses a monocrystalline half-cell construction with a single cell measuring at about 22.4 inches square with 3 x 3 celled panels weighing 7.3 pounds, with cells providing 12W of power per square foot of surface area.
The company’s proprietary anti-skid surface has a 30-day water submersion rating and 12-hour oil submersion rating, with a maximum 11,000 pounds static load and 25 mph speed rating, with systems operating safely in ambient temperatures of -4 degrees (F) to 122 degrees (F).
Cells are encased in an IP-68 waterproof connector and UL-rated junction box connected to 10 American Wire Gauge (AWG) wiring whose open circuit voltage is 12.2V and maximum power voltage is 4 amps.
In construction solutions, Solar Earth’s PV solutions are best placed in asphalt and solid surfaces using direct mounted adhesives or clamps, or a molded base foundation using paver or polymer adhesives, creating a low-profile mounted solar strip.
In September, Solar Earth partnered with BASF to co-develop Paving Integrated Photovoltaic (PIPV) panels, which can be installed on new or existing roads and other surfaces.
Solar Earth has deployed more than 12 projects, with installations in the U.S., Canada, South Africa and China. The company has more than 50 projects in development.
The company was formed in July 2015 by a group of scientists, engineers and roadway experts, and in July 2022 was acquired by Nexii Building Solutions Inc, a designer and manufacturer of low-carbon buildings and sustainable city solutions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/18/solar-windows-cut-emissions-and-energy-use-by-40-in-glass-skyscrapers/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 18, 2022",Solar windows cut emissions and energy use by 40% in glass skyscrapers,"Looming over many major metropolitan areas are tall, windowed skyscrapers. These highly glazed buildings are not particularly efficient, but research published in One Earth found that photovoltaic windows can help considerably.
“There are preconceived notions of what an energy-efficient building looks like, and it usually is not highly glazed, and it probably isn’t very tall,” said Lance Wheeler, a scientist at NREL who specializes in integrating PV technology into windows. “We found that there are other ways to build high-efficiency buildings.”
A team of National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that highly glazed skyscrapers can reduce their energy use and associated carbon emissions by 40% with PV windows.
Twin brothers Lance and Vincent Wheeler developed a new open-source software, available on GitHub, called PVWindow to model the impact of the technology. The brothers co-authored a Department of Energy funded report with NREL scientists Janghyun Kim, Tom Daligault, Bryan Rosales, Chaiwat Engtrakul, and Robert Tenet.
The report outlines building design rules that can lead to a net-zero or even net-positive energy consumption structure. This evolution of design is needed, as buildings account for more than one third of the world’s energy consumption, and much of its carbon emissions.
Skyscrapers built today often have a high ratio of window-to-wall. For example, the 1915 Equitable Building in New York, has a window-to-wall ratio of 25%. This compares to the Bank of America Tower of 2016, sporting a ratio of 71% window-to-wall.
For the analysis, the researchers modeled a window-to-wall ratio of 95% to demonstrate the impact glazing has on building energy performance. The team also found triple-paned windows to be highly effective in reducing energy use, a practice that has not yet been widely adopted.
Windowed skyscrapers often have to spend a lot on cooling the building as large amounts of light and heat shine through. Solar windows not only provide thermal insulation for a building but also use the absorbed energy to generate electricity. The PVWindow simulations showed that in Denver, for example, on-site solar generation halves the average daily electricity demand for a highly glazed 12-story structure, avoiding 2 million kg of carbon dioxide emissions annually.
“Picture a skyline in, like, New York City where there are these high-rise buildings that are entirely glass,” said Lance Wheeler. “They’re fully glazed. The Freedom Tower has millions of square feet of glass. It could be a power plant in itself.”
Last January, Ubiquitous Energy, a buildings-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) commercial windows manufacturer, announced the closing of a $30 million Series B funding. Over 20 billion square feet of windows are installed each year, creating an opening for the company and other players in the space to integrate their technology.

The project includes 2 MW of solar and a 1.25 MW battery energy storage system to be integrated with a new Rockell/Allen Bradley distributed control system. The array will generate an estimated 3.2 million kWh per year at the Keyes, California biorefinery.
The $12 million solar microgrid with battery backup and AI-enabled controls was supported by an $8 million grant by the California Energy Commission.
Foundations for the array are now under construction, with commissioning of the microgrid expected to come in the second quarter of 2023. TotalEnergies is supplying the project’s PV components and is responsible for engineering, procurement and construction.
The facility is expected to offset approximately 8,000 MT carbon emissions per year. “The microgrid creates energy resiliency and will assist with off peak load shedding and energy efficiency,” stated Eric McAfee, chair and CEO of Aemetis.
The system has AI-enabled controls run on virtualized servers, which Aemetis said will reduce the amount of computer hardware needed by 80%, thereby saving on power usage. Virtualized systems do not require changing hardware to upgrade obsolete operating systems or security changes, and the systems are expected to reduce planned and unplanned downtime.
“This microgrid, along with other energy saving technologies being implemented at our low-carbon ethanol facility, will further reduce the carbon intensity score of the fuel ethanol produced,” said McAfee. “Aemetis can also displace natural gas with carbon negative Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) upgraded and injected at the same facility in Keyes, California.”
Founded in 2006, Aemetis is expanding a California biogas digester network and pipeline system to convert dairy waste gas into “renewable natural gas.” The company owns and operates a 65 million gallon per year ethanol production facility in California’s Central Valley near Modesto that supplies about 80 dairies with animal feed.
Aemetis also owns and operates a 50 million gallon per year production facility on the East Coast of India, producing high-quality distilled biodiesel and refined glycerin for customers in India and Europe. In another project, the company is developing Carbon Zero Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel fuel biorefineries in California from renewable oils and orchard and forest waste.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/18/lithium-ion-database-of-north-american-supply-chain-from-raw-materials-through-battery-packs/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NORTH AMERICA",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 18, 2022",Lithium-ion database of North American supply chain from raw materials through battery packs,"The effort underway in the United States to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is placing increased emphasis on going “all electric”. The electrification of transportation is well underway, but is creating a huge demand for battery energy storage. With China dominating the lithium market, it’s time to shore up the domestic production of  lithium.

China currently holds over 80% of the world’s lithium refining capacity, over 60% for cobalt, and more than a third of global nickel refinement, according to a report from Wood Mackenzie.  
In a recent OpEd in pv magazine USA, Jose Francisco Velasco, vice president of commercialization of Mangrove Lithium, noted that with increased manufacturing of electric vehicles, demand for lithium will outstrip supply. He pointed to a report from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence that forecasts the lithium supply gap to be 725kt by 2040 in North America and Europe, or enough to hold back 350 million electric vehicles.
Last year Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm announced funding to increase lithium production, pointing to the newly published National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries 2021 to 2030 as the guiding force behind the investment. The report projects a need for a 70% rise in U.S. production of nickel by 2040; 200% for cobalt; and 600% for lithium.
The Blueprint expresses the need to strengthen U.S. competitiveness in lithium battery innovation and manufacturing with a plan for domestic supply chain development. To this end, the National Renewable Energy Lab developed the NAATBatt Lithium-Ion (li-ion) Battery Supply Chain Database, a directory of North American companies in the lithium-ion supply chain: manufacturing, research and development, services, end of life management, and product distributors.
The database is an initial step in understanding the strengths and gaps in the North American lithium-ion battery supply chain, and it will be regularly updated as the li-ion battery technology market evolves. NAATBatt and NREL are sharing this database with the public, industry, investors, and decision makers to help them better understand the status of the North American li-ion supply chain, identify strengths and gaps, promote collaboration, and identify potential investments.
Source: NREL
The collaboration between NAATBatt International and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) intends to identify every company in North America involved in building lithium-ion batteries from mining to manufacturing to recycling. First released in September 2021 and funded by NAATBatt International, the database was recently updated and significantly expanded after extensive work by a team of NREL researchers and support from three NAATBatt committees—Manufacturing in North America, Battery Recycling, and Battery Markets.
The database lists North American companies in the li-ion supply chain, including manufacturing (raw material through battery packs), research and development, services (e.g., battery repair, consulting), recycling, and product distributors. In addition, where available, the database summarizes critical information such as installed battery manufacturing capacity (in gigawatt-hours) and material production capability (in tons per year), plans for future capacity, types of chemistries and processes, and expansion plans by sector (e.g., transportation, stationary).
“One of the early challenges we identified when assessing the strengths and gaps in the North American lithium-ion supply chain was insufficient data about domestic companies involved in every aspect of battery manufacturing,” said Ahmad Pesaran, senior energy storage researcher at NREL . “This database is an initial step in better understanding the lithium-ion battery market and its North American players.”
Researchers developed the database by exploring business directories, trade show information, market data, literature, and reports to identify existing companies within the lithium-ion supply chain. The team also performed extensive outreach through direct calls, interviews, and a questionnaire that sought clarification about facilities.
As a result, the database now identifies more than 480 companies and over 560 facilities within North America’s lithium-ion supply chain, including mining, material processing, manufacturing, research and development, services, end-of-life management, and product distributors. For each facility, the database lists key information about the company, location, workforce, and products and services. In addition, the database summarizes critical information such as installed battery manufacturing capacity and material production capability, plans for future capacity, types of chemistries and processes, and expansion plans by sector. The updated database also has advanced search and mapping capabilities to help visualize the evolving market.
“This database brings a unique value to the booming lithium-ion battery market, which is bolstered in part by growing electric vehicle sales,” Pesaran said. “We’ve already received significant interest in this database with more than 800 new downloads from users.”
NREL notes that the value and accuracy of the database will depend on new information from industry members. For inclusion in future updates, companies are encouraged to reach out to LIB.SupplyChain@nrel.gov.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/18/all-perovskite-tandem-solar-cell-with-27-4-efficiency-high-voltage/,"RESEARCH,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 18, 2022","All-perovskite tandem solar cell with 27.4% efficiency, high voltage","From pv magazine global
Scientists from Northwestern University, the University of Toronto, and the University of Toledo have fabricated an all-perovskite tandem solar cell with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC), due to limited recombination at the electron transport layer (ETL).
They initially coated the surface of the perovskite layer with a substance known as 1,3-propanediammonium (PDA). This increases the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), defining the number of photons emitted as a fraction of the number of photons absorbed. They then spin-coated the perovskite film onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate and the ETL and deposited an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60).
“PDA has a positive charge, and it is able to even out the surface potential,” said researcher Hao Chen. “When we added the coating, we got much better energetic alignment of the perovskite layer with the electron transport layer, and that led to a big improvement in our overall efficiency.”
Common monoammonium surface treatments do not energetically align the perovskite film and the ETL, but the diammonium molecules have the ability to modify the perovskite surface states and achieve a more uniform spatial distribution of surface potential.
“Using 1,3-propane diammonium (PDA), QFLS increases by 90 meV,” the scientists explained.
The cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.3% and an open-circuit voltage of 2.13 eV, as certified by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The cell was also able to retain 86% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours of continuous operation.
The scientists said that a prototype of the cell even achieved an internally certified efficiency of 27.4%, a record-breaking open-circuit voltage of 2.19 eV, a short-circuit current of 15.1 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 83.1%.
“The 2.19 V VOC represents a significant improvement over the previous highest reported VOC among the best all-perovskite tandems (2.05 V), due to the high VOC of the PDA-treated wide bangap subcell,” they said.
They described the cell technology in “Regulating surface potential maximizes voltage in all-perovskite tandems,” which was recently published in Nature.
“In our cell, the top perovskite layer absorbs well in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, as well as some visible light,” said researcher Chongwen Li. “The bottom layer has a narrow band gap, which is tuned more toward the infrared part of the spectrum. Between the two, we cover more of the spectrum than would be possible with silicon.”

Combined with an initial agreement signed in July for 2.4 GW of First Solar modules, the add-on order brings the total commitment for Intersect to 7.3 GW of modules procured.
San Francisco-based Intersect Power, which is backed by investors Climate Adaptive Infrastructure, Trilantic and Generate Capital, will receive a combination of First Solar’s Series 6 Plus and Series 7 modules for deployment on the IPP’s solar, energy storage and green hydrogen projects starting in 2025.
“We have an unprecedented opportunity to decarbonize our economy while simultaneously bolstering our manufacturing sector and providing clean energy security,” said Sheldon Kimber, chief executive officer of Intersect Power.
Prior to 2022, Intersect Power had placed cumulative orders of 4.1 GW in total in 2019 and 2021.
In 2021, Intersect Power closed eight separate transactions representing an aggregate of $2.6 billion of financing commitments to build and operate a six-project portfolio. The deals cover construction financing, tax equity, land financing, and portfolio-level term debt. The closings enabled San Francisco-based Intersect to execute on 2.2 GWdc of late-stage solar projects with 1.4 GWh of storage that will be in operation by 2023. The portfolio includes Athos III, Oberon I, and Oberon II in California, and Lumina I, Radian, and Lumina II in Texas.

Since the passing of the federal Inflation Reduction Act in August, the Tempe, Arizona-based solar module producer has landed two other large orders of 2 GW thin-film modules apiece from Arevon Energy and Swift Current Energy.
Yesterday, First Solar selected Lawrence County, Alabama, as the location for its fourth solar module manufacturing facility in the U.S. The recently announced Alabama factory is part of the company’s plan to scale its U.S. manufacturing footprint to over 10 GW by 2025.
In addition to its U.S. manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building its first new manufacturing facility in India, which is scheduled to begin operations in the second half of 2023.
