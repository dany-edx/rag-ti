Despite lower electricity demand, significant declines in both wind and hydro generation resulted in minimal growth in total clean electricity.
The data was released by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), along with The Business Council for Sustainable Energy, in their Sustainable Energy in America 2024 Factbook.

For the year, the U.S. set a record in utility scale solar, deploying 23.7GW of capacity, some of which were projects delayed from the previous year due to supply chain issues. Small scale solar totaled nearly 11.6GW of capacity, a record as well. The total capacity deployed, 35.3 GW, was 52% greater than the new capacity of just under 24 GW in 2022.
The Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) and Wood Mackenzie Renewables & Power project at least 50 GW of solar being deployed in 2024.
Along with the solar, seven GW of wind was deployed, and 7.5 GW of battery storage. The battery capacity deployment increased by 62% over the prior year, bringing the nation’s total deployed capacity to 19.6 GW. In 2024, the EIA sees 15.3 GW of new battery capacity being deployed, which would be a 78% expansion of the nation’s battery fleet.
In total, demand for electricity fell 2.2% from 2022, even while the nation’s GDP expanded by 2.4%. The report notes that, with these two pieces of data taken together, U.S. energy productivity (the ratio of US GDP to total U.S. energy consumption) increased by 3.8% year-on-year. In fact, since 1990, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for electricity has been slowly decreasing, hitting 1.0% in 2023 – while the nation’s GDP has grown over 400% during that period.

The addition of significant new wind and solar capacity, combined with steady electricity demand, has contributed to a reduction in emissions from both the sector and the nation as a whole.
Collectively, low-emissions electricity sources, excluding nuclear, saw a marginal increase from 962 TWh to 972 TWh of generation. The flat growth was a balance of hydroelectricity falling by just over 6%, while wind fell by almost 2%. Overall, accounting for the 1% growth and a 2% decrease in electricity demand, renewables met 23% of all generation, setting a new record. Adding in nuclear power, 41.1% of all electricity generated was from zero-carbon sources, another all-time high.

One reason for the large volume of deployment growth in 2023 was a rebound from the slowdown in 2022 due to COVID and supply chain constraints. The biggest price increase was in solar modules, with pricing heavily influenced by a significant increase in polysilicon costs. However, since then, polysilicon prices have dropped sharply, with module prices remaining near record lows for the past several months.

The first is called Photon (Pulling Hardware & Optimized Tensioning On-the-Go) Kit, and it uses winch technology to assist with wire tensioning.
Above-ground cable management systems traditionally have required installation and tensioning of thousands of feet of messenger cable one pile at a time. AWM said this is a lengthy process that requires regular checks to temperature-dependent sag charts. 
The Photon Kit instead uses a calibrated scale and winch to allow for precise end-to-end tensioning. The company said it speeds the process while diminishing the potential from cable snap or human error.
“Our Photon Kit has been proven to reduce project install times, often improving installation rates by 2.5 times or more,” said Scott Rand, chief executive officer and co-founder of AWM. 
The kit was used in the Escalante Solar project, a 200 MW project in New Mexico. 
“Construction crews were able to tighten 1000-1500 feet of cable in mere minutes and the 200+ MW project was completed in just a few months. That is record time, thanks to AWM’s innovations,” said David McElroy, electrical operations manager, Gridworks. 
AWM’s other new product is called Helios (Heightened Elevation Load Integration & Outreach System). The product is a beam rod that is compatible with multiple pile types, attachable with a screw. It can also be attached to cylindrical piles via a U-bolt system.

“Manufactured through an extrusion process, our Helios Beam Rod is stronger, more scalable, and more corrosion-resistant than its predecessors, making it robust enough to handle even the most challenging conditions,” said Rand. 
AWM’s products and all of their subcomponents are produced in the United States, making them eligible contributions to the Inflation Reduction Act’s domestic content requirements. Projects reaching the required domestic content threshold may be eligible for a 10% installed system cost tax credit adder.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/28/the-importance-of-community-solar-in-all-of-the-above-renewable-energy-strategy/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-28,The importance of community solar in all-of-the-above renewable energy strategy,"With an estimated 6.6 GW of community solar installed across the United States the nation has a long way to go toward achieving the Department of Energy’s target of 20 GW installed. Yet it is potentially achievable, according to recent reports.
A recent Wood Mackenzie report projects that cumulative installations could reach 14 GW by 2028, more than doubling the total in less than five years. Community solar is in early stages, with only 18 states and Washington D.C. having policies and programs that encourage its growth. The WoodMac reports points to strong markets like New York and Illinois that can serve as models for implementing a successful community solar program. 
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) released a seminal report that found that community solar has the technical potential to reach nearly one terawatt of capacity. This would be enough energy to serve more than 53 million households and more than 300,000 businesses in the U.S. that cannot access rooftop solar.
One of the major benefits of community solar is it opens access to customers that may not have a suitable roof or financial situation for rooftop solar. It allows residents, businesses, organizations, and municipalities to subscribe to a portion of a solar asset’s electricity generation to receive credit on their electricity bills for the power it generates.
The NREL report acknowledges that market, economic and policy constraints mean that the actual number potentially served by community solar would be much less. At its annual summit, the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP) challenged the community solar industry to meet a target of 20 GW of community solar by 2025, enough energy to power 5 million households and create $1 billion in energy savings for subscribers. The NREL report concedes that using the 20 GW target set by the NCSP as a more realistic goal.
According to the NREL report, “if all technically viable potential community solar is deployed, it could save customers billions of dollars on their electricity bills, serve tens of millions of LMI households, generate billions of dollars in grid resilience and grid service values, drive billions of dollars of economic benefits into host communities, and support hundreds of thousands of jobs.”
If the U.S. were to achieve the NCSP 20 GW target, that would power the equivalent of 5 million households and create $1 billion in energy savings for subscribers. To meet this goal, the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) advises that policymakers, regulators and stakeholders from across the country must work together, and quickly, to enable third-party community solar programs, by far the largest source of community solar deployed on the grid today.
“These announcements further demonstrate the immense potential of community solar and its ability to build a more equitable, affordable, and modern electric grid while harnessing both small and large resources to reach our goals,” said Jeff Cramer, CEO of CCSA. “The community solar industry and billions in private capital stand ready to build capacity right now to meet this potential. But to unlock the tremendous promise that community solar holds, we need state policymakers to open new markets and expand existing ones.”
Annual installation volumes have been about 1 GW for three years in a row, and 8% average annual growth is expected through 2028. To meet the goals set by the federal government and the industry, however, more enabling state legislation must be passed, according to the CCSA. And utilities can encourage growth by viewing third-party developers as partners in deploying clean energy, not opposition.
As the community solar capacity serving residential customers has rapidly increased, so has the share of community solar serving low- to middle-income (LMI) subscribers.  The numbers of LMI subscribers has grown from 2% in H2 2022 to 10% in H2 2023, with the cost to subscribe LMI customers declining 30% year-over-year. According to NREL’s report, community solar reduces the cost of electricity for subscribers. NREL estimates that if the U.S. achieves the 20 GW of community solar capacity by 2025, the cumulative benefits would be substantial:
A ramp-up in community solar installations will be due in part by federal funding. According to the Wood Mackenzie report, the community solar industry will begin to experience the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act as soon as this year, and LMI subscribers will benefit as credit adders begin to be awarded.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/28/first-solar-plans-to-double-manufacturing-capacity-by-2026/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-28,First Solar plans to double manufacturing capacity by 2026,"First Solar, U.S.-based manufacturer of cadmium telluride thin-film solar panels, now in its 25th year of operations, released its Q4, 2023 earnings. Revenues totaled $1.16 billion, coming in slightly below expectations of $1.32 billion. The company reported earnings per share of $3.13.
The company has a strong outlook for 2024, issuing guidance of revenues of $4.5 billion and 16 GW of solar module shipments. The company expects an average selling price (ASP) of $0.286 per watt.
Gross margins were 43% in the fourth quarter and 39% for the whole year 2023. This compares to 3% in 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the recognition of Section 45X tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act.
In 2023 the company continued its momentum, securing 10 new customers and 28.3 GW of net bookings with a base ASP of over $0.30 per watt. The company’s total contracted backlog is now over 80 GW, with orders stretching to the end of the decade.
First Solar produced a record 12.1 GW of solar modules, growing 33% over 2022 totals. The company has cumulatively produced 60 GW of solar. It produced 9.7 GW of Series 6 modules and 2.4 GW of Series 7.
The company has plans to continue to expand its production capacity significantly. It announced a $1.1 billion investment in a new manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which is expected to add 3.5 GW of capacity. Year-end 2026, the company expects to have 14 GW of U.S. solar capacity and 11 GW internationally, reaching 25 GW of global solar module production.
First Solar also acquired Evolar, a perovskite specialist operating in Sweden, for $38 million. The acquisition is expected to accelerate the development of next generation PV technology, including high efficiency tandem devices.
“Over the past year, we expanded manufacturing capacity, mobilized at our latest announced facility in Louisiana, produced and shipped a record volume of modules, expanded our contracted backlog to historic levels, and increased R&D investment, and continued to evolve our technology and product road map,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer.
Vertical integration
First Solar recently commissioned an economic analysis of its vertically integrated solar value chain in the United States, something that makes it unique among major U.S. module providers.
The study found that its operations support nearly $2.8 billion in value added and almost $5.3 billion in total output, including indirect and induced economic effects. The study found that in 2023 First Solar supported an estimated 16,245 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, representing $1.59 billion in annual labor income.
By 2026 it is projected to grow to a total of more than 30,000 jobs and almost $2.8 billion in labor income. Operating at that scale would support an estimated nearly $5 billion in value added and over $10 billion in output to the U.S. economy including direct, indirect, and induced economic effects.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/28/solar-at-twice-the-natural-capacity-factor-of-the-sun/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-02-28,Solar at “twice the natural capacity factor of the sun”,"Two unique power plants with high-capacity factors, one using wind and the other using solar, are set to come online. These facilities are designed to maximize the value of their interconnection (IX) connections by transmitting as much electricity as possible to the grid.
Nearly two years ago, a Portuguese project by Energias de Portugal (EDP) highlighted the enduring value of owning an interconnection (IX) location. In a grid connection auction, EDPR won the project by agreeing to pay the electrical system €4 for each megawatt-hour generated by their floating solar plant over 15 years.
Eland Solar
Eland Solar’s development team, Arevon Energy, recently announced that it closed on $1.2 billion in financing for the construction of Eland 2, the second phase of the project, located in California. This phase includes a 200 MWac/374 MWdc solar power facility paired with a 150 MW / 600 MWh energy storage system.
Initially, when the project hit the news, its former owner, 8Minutenergy, stated that the facilities would have a 60% AC capacity factor. This claim was noteworthy because the sun is only above the horizon for 50% of the time annually.

The Eland Phase 2’s high-capacity factor is at the inverter and IX level – meaning it is based on an output of 200 MW, not the solar panel volume. The solar plant’s modules total 374 MW of capacity, which is a 1.87 module to inverter ratio, much higher than the average, which is closer to 1.25 to 1.3.
For a 200 MW facility to reach a 60% capacity factor, it would need to generate an average of 2,880 MWh daily. Given that the plant is equipped with a 600 MWh battery, the solar plant would need to produce 2,280 MWh each day during sunlight hours.
Given that a 200 MW plant is limited to generating a maximum of 2,400 MWh over a 12-hour period, the Eland 2 solar facility would need to operate at full capacity for 11 hours and 24 minutes, or 95% of the day. This means it would have to start producing maximum output just 18 minutes after sunrise and continue until 18 minutes before sunset.
In a November 2022 interview with Investment Reports, the CEO of Avantus, formerly known as 8Minutenergy, reaffirmed that the facility operates with a 60% capacity factor:
We also created the Eland Solar & Storage Center, the first large-scale solar power plant with a 60% capacity factor — twice the natural capacity factor of the sun. We found optimal economics hovered at around a 60% capacity factor and designed a power plant to meet the customer’s needs.
Skeleton Creek
In 2019, NextEra announced the Skeleton Creek Energy Center, located in Oklahoma. This wind-plus-solar hybrid power plant combines a 250 MW wind farm, a 250 MWac solar power plant, and a 252 MW / 1.008 GWh battery, all connected through a single 250 MW interconnection point.
Last summer, BayWa r.e. told pv magazine USA, “These days, the name of the game is ‘maximizing sites.’” The company is boosting the output at wind sites by integrating solar and batteries, optimizing the energy flow at each IX point. BayWa’s strategy involves prioritizing wind energy, followed by charging batteries, and curtailing solar output as necessary.

When first announced, NextEra projected the Skeleton Creek facility’s annual output at 1.8 million MWh, translating to an 82% capacity factor for the 250 MW interconnection (IX). For comparison, a 250 MW facility operating at 100% capacity factor would produce 2.19 million MWh/year.
The combined hardware capacity exceeds 1.5 GW, all funneling into the 250 MW IX.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, the hybrid Skeleton Creek Energy Center is listed with a 250 MW power plant capacity in its 860M report.
Local reporting from the Enid News indicates that NextEra has presented plans to local planning boards, suggesting that construction will commence soon, with completion expected in 2025.
