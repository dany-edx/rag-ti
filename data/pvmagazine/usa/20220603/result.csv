The legislation sets a path for the state to source 100% of its retail electricity sales from renewable sources by the end of 2033.
The legislation now shifts to the House, after which – if passed – it would then move to the Governor’s desk. The House and Governor have both voiced support for the legislation, but the politics of Rhode Island are complex.
Minor amendments appeared in the final version of the legislation passed by the Senate. The House version of the legislation (H 7277) has not yet been fully aligned with the Senate version of the document.
The ramp to get to 100% is rather aggressive. In the Senate’s version of the amended legislation, 20.5% of the state’s electricity must come from renewable sources by the end of 2022. To reach 20.5%, the state has had to add 1.5% of renewable electricity to its sourcing since 2015.
Going forward, the amounts to be added must increase annually:
Interestingly, all of the required increases in renewable electricity add up to 101.5%.
The legislation does not yet require municipal electricity companies to move toward 100%. A report recommending how these companies should move forward must be submitted by September 1, 2024.
Rhode Island reported it had 1.08 GW of clean energy generation located within the state at the end of 2021. Of that capacity, 458 MW comes from solar, 430 MW from offshore wind, 148 MW from onshore wind, 35 MW from landfill gas/anaerobic digestion, and 9 MW from hydroelectricity.

According to the Energy Information Administration, 89% of the electricity generated within the state’s borders came from fossil gas in 2020, and the rest was generated by wind, solar, and other clean sources.
The state also imports a large amount of electricity. For instance, in 2018, a 400 MW request for proposal received a total of 41 project bids, cumulatively 2.5 GW of capacity, from eleven unique developers.
Since Rhode Island is the smallest state in the Union, it doesn’t require a huge amount of electricity. A report by the Brattle Group last year, projected that 4,600 GWh of additional renewable electricity generation per year should meet the needs.
If that generation demand were split equally between wind and solar, and the solar were to have a 17% capacity factor, the total required solar capacity would be 1.5 GW. The total installed capacity would probably be higher, due to lower capacity factors, as much of the solar in the state has been installed on rooftops.

The New York State Build Public Renewables Act would authorize the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop and implement renewable energy projects that will ensure New York State can meet the goals laid out in the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), achieving  70% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and the governor’s goal to achieve 10 GW of solar by 2030.
The Build Public Renewables Act would:
While we don’t yet know the scope of renewables that would be installed if this bill were to pass, it would likely be significant capacity, as NYPA would be looking to replace the 461 MW of natural gas fired peaker plants that it operates across New York City and Long Island.
The bill also has a carveout for equitable access to the proposed clean generation capacity additions. It would authorize NYPA to sell renewable energy to residential end-use customers and Community Choice Aggregation communities, but any excess renewable energy not used for state or municipal buildings is to be directed to low-to-moderate (LMI) income customers first, at a rate that is fifty percent less than the energy supply rate of the local utility in the customer’s service territory. The bill also asserts that LMI customers in disadvantaged communities are to be prioritized.
“As the largest public owned utility in the country, the New York Power Authority has led the way in providing affordable energy in New York State,” said Senator Kevin Parker, bill sponsor and chair of the Committee on Energy and Telecommunications. “It is imperative that we convert our electrical grid to renewable energy to meet our climate goals in New York State, and this bill will enable NYPA to fully power State and municipal properties with renewable energy by 2030 and 2035 respectively.”
Renewable acceleration
The beginning of June has been a busy legislative and renewables period for the state of New York. On June 2, the New York Energy Research & Development Authority shared it is seeking feedback on the processes involved in auctioning projects for its soon-to-launch Build-Ready program. The purpose of the Built-Ready program is to derisk solar development at sites that the State of New York deems highly desirable for deploying solar power.
First, NYSERDA has a rolling Site Recommendation Form in place, with the team ‘prioritizing the development of existing or abandoned commercial sites, brownfields, landfills, former industrial sites, and other abandoned or underutilized sites.’ Once a site is submitted, NYSERDA will do a remote screening of the site to determine the highest layers of viability, with further assessments and designs to determine financial viability, as well as other pre-screening techniques to follow.
After those steps have been completed, the state will take on the financial and time risks of getting landowners to agree to host a solar power project, gaining zoning approval from the local jurisdictions, and working through interconnection with the local utility or the New York ISO.
Also on June 2, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced awards for 22 large-scale solar and energy storage projects to be constructed across the state, which together will add more than 2 GW of clean energy and roughly 160 MW (likely 640 MWh) of storage added to the grid. These projects are also being procured in pursuit of achieving  70% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and the governor’s goal to achieve 10 GW of solar by 2030. Once on-line, they are anticipated to raise the state’s renewable supply of its energy mix to around 66%.
In developing the 22 listed projects, developers have committed nearly $86 million in investments in disadvantaged communities throughout the state, including community-based investments such as new occupational apprenticeships, scholarship programs, and summer camps focused on supporting local disadvantaged communities. Additionally, all developers have committed to ensuring that workers associated with the construction of projects are paid a prevailing wage, a standard set by the NYS Department of Labor.
The average statewide bill impact for the typical residential customer will be approximately $0.13 per month once the projects are in operation, with all 22 projects having a weighted-average all-in development cost of $63.08 per MWh.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/03/thousands-of-californians-rally-before-utility-commission-to-preserve-rooftop-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 3, 2022",Thousands of Californians rally before utility commission to preserve rooftop solar,"A few months ago, public protest in San Francisco and Los Angeles led to the successful delay of California’s Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0. The proposal sharply cut payments made to solar owners for sending excess energy back to the grid to be used by their neighbors.
Renewable energy data firm EQ Analysts said the proposal would lead to a 57-71% overall reduction in solar savings for homeowners. At the time, grid controls expert and economist-at-large Ahmad Faruqui lambasted the proposed decision as a “proposed dystopia” and offered ten reasons why.
Recently, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) revisited the issue, and the revised NEM 3.0 is still packed with provisions to slash payments to homeowners and increase payments to utility companies. The revision replaced monthly fixed charges based on system sizes with new solar-unfriendly provisions, including a payment “glide path”, non-bypassable charges, and a tariff to boost community solar.
(Read: “Coalition received $1.7 million from three California utilities to push NEM 3.0, a rooftop solar ‘killer’“)
The “non-bypassable charges” provision would add $0.05/kWh to a customer’s bill, whether or not they have solar panels on their roof. These charges would apply to all end-use electricity, including the electrons generated by the customer’s rooftop solar array and delivered directly to their own homes. To place this in context, the average US customer pays about $0.13/kWh for electricity nationwide. Regulations make it very difficult, or even illegal, to disconnect from the grid entirely in many areas in California.
Governor Gavin Newsom and the CPUC are decision-makers here, and as such, they were addressed by thousands of solar-supportive Californians on June 2 in a public comment event. Many testified in front of the CPUC, arguing that the non-bypassable charges and other provisions were essentially a “tax on the sun.”
Organized by the California Solar and Storage Association, large crowds gathered in Los Angeles and before the CPUC building in San Francisco. Many gave public comment, and comment can be submitted online until June 10.
Analysis by Environment California found that rooftop solar could prevent the development of 148,000 acres of land. This is based on a state regulator estimated deployment of 28.5 GW of rooftop solar through 2045 in order to meet clean energy goals. That is an area about half the size of Los Angeles that could be preserved versus a utility-scale-only model.
The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) reports the U.S. solar industry employs about 230,000 workers, and 68,000 or more are employed in California. Over one million homes are topped with solar in the state, representing about half of US rooftop solar deployment to date.
Public comment can still be submitted to the CPUC online by June 10th, by following this link.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/03/redflow-announces-integration-with-us-inverter-company/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 3, 2022",Redflow announces integration with US inverter company,"From pv magazine Australia
Australian battery supplier Redflow is moving forward with its planned US expansion strategy, announcing after extensive testing that its zinc-bromine flow battery energy storage solution can now be integrated with hybrid inverters produced by Texas-based storage technology specialist Sol-Ark.
Redflow CEO Tim Harris said the company’s ZBM3 battery zinc-bromine flow battery is now certified to be integrated with Sol-Ark’s North American code-approved products. Harris said the development is an important step in the execution of the company’s plans to expand into the US market, which he described as one of the biggest markets for storage in the world.
“Integration with Sol-Ark’s well-established product line enables Redflow to deploy its zinc-bromine flow batteries in the United States SME (small to medium-sized enterprise) and C&I (commercial and industrial) markets,” he said, adding that the collaboration would create “exciting opportunities” for Redflow and Sol-Ark to work together to deploy new smaller scale systems across the United States.
The announcement comes just months after US non-profit standards development organization Underwriters Laboratories revealed that it would include Redflow batteries in a test program to study the key technical attributes of redox flow batteries under nominal and off-nominal conditions. The research aims to enhance the knowledge base around the operating and safety characteristics of zinc-bromine flow batteries, enabling interested parties to better understand and compare a broad range of product chemistries.
Months earlier, Redflow had signed a deal with tech company Anaergia to supply a 2 MWh energy storage system, featuring 192 zinc-bromine flow batteries, for Anaergia’s bioenergy facility in California.
Redflow’s 10 kWh 48 V ZBM3 ZBM3 battery is the world’s smallest commercially available zinc-bromine flow battery. Its modular, scalable design makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small commercial installations to multi-megawatt hour storage systems.
Sol-Ark CEO Tom Brennan welcomed the successful completion of integration testing. He said the flow batteries have an important role to play in the future energy storage eco-system.
“From small to large commercial installations, our innovative product range is the enabler of scalable and sustainable renewable energy deployments in this rapidly growing market,” he said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/03/more-than-half-of-all-us-generation-was-emissions-free-for-10-of-this-year/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 3, 2022",More than half of all US generation was emissions-free for 10% of this year,"Emissions-free electricity generation is expanding at stunning rates across the United States, largely due to the dawn of the solar and wind energy decade. Based on the Energy Information Administration (EIA) hourly data reports, the combined forces of solar, wind, hydropower, nuclear energy, and solar thermal energy generated more than half of all US electricity for 10% of the hours reported thus far in 2022.
This is remarkable progress considering not long ago in 2014, solar had a negligible impact on the energy mix, and emissions-free power represented roughly 30% of the energy mix. Now, for the month of March, it supplied 45% of US electricity. We can expect that number to reach even higher over the next two to three months, where solar, wind, and hydropower begin to ramp up production, and decreased demand leads to a reduction in gas-powered peaker plants firing up.
Solar electricity is increasingly making its mark. In 2014, it was less than 1% of the mix. But this year through March, it contributed 5.03% of total electricity generation. Based on the EIA near-term outlook, solar is 48% of the planned capacity additions over the next two years. Solar and battery storage combine for 60% of capacity additions over the two-year horizon.
This growth and contribution to the grid is right in line with EIA’s late 2021 projections, which pegs solar as a 5% contributor to total generation in 2022, 14% by 2035, and 20% or more by 2050. This includes both utility-scale and small-scale distributed solar generation.
Through the first quarter, solar generated 28.5 TWh, up from 20.9 TWh in the first quarter the year prior. That is a solid growth of 36% year over year for solar generation.
For the first quarter year-over-year, emissions-free power, including nuclear, grew 15%.  Over the same period, wind generation grew 23%, hydropower increased 6.85%, and nuclear fell by 5.61%.
The growth in hydropower was largely due to 2021 being a drought year rather than new capacity additions. Nuclear power has not made any significant capacity additions, and several retirements are expected going forward.
Why solar, and not nuclear and hydropower?
This data begs the question: what about nuclear and hydropower? If the United States has goals to decarbonize the grid, why do trend lines show nuclear and hydropower in a flatline or decreasing, while solar and wind are ramping up? And why is solar power 50% of planned capacity additions over the next two years?
A few reasons are cost, project time, and some external problems related to hydropower and nuclear energy. Solar is fast becoming one of the cheapest sources of energy, and it’s relatively easy to deploy. It doesn’t require massive amounts of startup capital compared to nuclear power plants or hydropower dams. Nuclear plants and hydropower dams can have project times in excess of 30 years, and given a climate-driven need to decarbonize rapidly, the United States can’t afford to wait for these projects to go through. It makes them less bankable than a quick turnaround on a utility-scale solar project.
The Solar Energy Industries Association indicates that even the largest utility-scale solar projects in excess of 250 MW can take about 6 years to complete, from planning and site acquisition through the date of commercial operations. This makes solar a more attractive prospect to early stakeholders and developers.
Solar may continue to speed up its processes too, as the Department of Energy is exploring ways to streamline permits, lower soft costs, improve interconnection queue times, and encourage solar innovation. With long-term industrial policy like the provision introduced in the Biden infrastructure bill and the possibility of a long-term extension of the solar investment tax credit, the bankability of solar may continue to improve.
It is likely that renewable energy generation declines will cause solar and wind to play an even larger role than expected.
FERC data for projects through 2025 suggest that nuclear’s share in generation may decline from 8.2% to 7.9%, suggesting that it is not a significant part of procurement plans going forward. Nuclear power plants are unpopular with many in the public due to its production of radioactive waste. 
There are also safety concerns with nuclear meltdown, or exposure to attack due to its centralized nature. Recently, a Russian missile strike hit a solar plant in Ukraine, damaging part of the array. The next day, the undamaged parts of the array were quickly reactivated and producing power again.
Hydroelectric power is running into some issues, too. Declining water levels, especially in the rapidly drying western United States, are causing production challenges.
As reservoirs dry up, a phenomenon known as a vortex formation can occur, where a tornado-like structure forms in the water. This can cause a number of issues, like decreasing turbine efficiency and increasing vibration, increasing hydraulic losses at the intakes, pulling debris into the system that may block trash tracks, and injecting air into the power tunnel, thereby reducing the longevity of the hydroelectric dam.
Hydroelectric dams come with their own environmental baggage, too. While hydropower does not directly emit air pollutants, it can have harsh impacts on water. Fish migration, water temperature, water chemistry, river flow characteristics, and silt loads can all be shifted by dams. All of these changes have effects on the ecology and physical effects of the river biome supporting the dam.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/03/california-solar-bill-would-create-one-of-the-most-equitable-community-solar-programs-in-the-us/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 3, 2022",California solar bill would create one of the most equitable community solar programs in the US,"California’s State Assembly recently passed AB 2316, which calls for 51% of the power generated by the new community solar program to benefit low-income customers or service organizations. A unique feature of the bill is that it avoids energy rate increases among nonparticipating customers by basing bill credits solely on the benefits provided to the grid and ratepayers.
Community solar enables utility customers to subscribe to a portion of a solar array, usually located in or near their community. As the solar array produces energy, subscribers receive a portion of the revenue from the energy produced, typically as a savings on their monthly electric bill — a critical factor for low-income and disadvantaged communities whose energy burden is three times higher than for non-low-income households. Additionally, low-income residents may not have a high enough credit rating to secure low-cost financing, and renters don’t have the rooftops to put the solar panels on.
“Community renewable energy is an opportunity to ensure working class communities of color can receive the health and economic benefits of clean energy in their neighborhoods while combating climate change. Pairing AB 2316 with a $1 billion state budget investment will ensure communities most harmed by pollution are positioned to lead this transition,” said Alexis Sutterman, energy equity program manager at the California Environmental Justice Alliance.
AB 2316 also provides accountability for results and transparency through routine reports to lawmakers on program growth and low-income subscriber participation. It also ensures livable wages for workers and helps builders meet state building code requirements that mandate solar systems for new construction. The California Public Utilities Commission will be required to evaluate existing programs based largely on their ability to meet the criteria described above, and to justify in a report to the Legislature reasons for terminating, modifying, or retaining them.
“Community renewable programs are taking off in other states and it’s time for California to take a proven, cost-effective path to clean energy access and utility bill savings for all,” said Charlie Coggeshall, director of policy and regulatory affairs at the Coalition for Community Solar Access, sponsor of the bill.
The bill has the support of the California Environmental Justice Alliance, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resource Defense Council, Vote Solar, The Utility Reform Network, among others.
“We can’t win unless clean energy access is a right equally available to all Californians,” said Susannah Churchill, Western Regional Director at Vote Solar. “This bill provides a proven solution we can scale to finally enable millions of Californians to access clean energy. California has been the cradle of solar power but its policies have unfairly excluded half the state, making this bill a vital and overdue reform.”
Next the bill goes to the Democrat-controlled Senate, must be agreed upon by both chambers, and then eventually on to the desk of Governor Newsom.
