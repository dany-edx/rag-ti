Skyward Solar is a 2.5 MWac photovoltaic solar facility located on 12 acres. The facility is now fully operational and 100% subscribed. It consists of modules on a fixed-tilt solar racking system, supported by stationary piles. The clean energy will be fed into the Portland General Electric (PGE) grid, thus benefiting the entire community.
Common Energy is the subscriber manager for the community solar project and manages all interactions with the subscribers, interfaces with the utility, and ensures everyone gets their savings and renewable energy credits. Earlier this year, Common Energy secured $16.5 million from S2G Ventures to expand consumer access to local, community solar projects across the country, scale Common Energy’s energy management platform, and grow the company’s management and operating teams. 
“We are proud and excited to bring more world class partners into the community solar sector,” said Richard Keiser, founder and CEO of Common Energy. “We hope that Microsoft and Nike’s leadership on climate solutions will inspire other businesses and non-profits to support community solar projects across the country.”

Oregon’s Community Solar Program permits large corporations to subscribe up to 50% of the community solar project, and Microsoft will make up the commercial allocation of the Skyward project.
“At Microsoft, part of our vision for a sustainable future is advocating for innovative technology that empowers and benefits everyone,” said Katie Ross, global sustainability program manager. “We are proud to be a lead partner in this initiative that helps achieve environmental goals while also supporting low-income residences with clean, affordable energy. We are excited to partner on this project and be part of bringing a greener grid to the entire Clackamas County community.”
Approximately 100 Nike employees have subscribed the residential portion of the project. Like all subscribed residents, they will receive a contracted discount on their electric bills each month and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) proportional to their share of the project’s energy generation.
“Nike and our employees are proud to support this new and innovative way to lower carbon emissions and reduce the cost of energy in our backyard,” said Seana Hannah, vice president of sustainable innovation. “We’re also excited that a portion of the project’s savings will be directed to households in our community who need these benefits most.”
In addition, 10% of the Skyward generation has been allocated to qualified low- and moderate-income households, who in turn will receive a substantial discount on their electric bills.
“We’re excited that our first completed project in Oregon, a state that requires 50% of electricity come from renewable sources by 2040, not only serves the residents of Clackamas County, but also some of the large corporations that employ them,” said Mike Streams, chief development officer at Standard Solar.
Last year several changes were made to Oregon’s Community Solar Program. In addition to opening up to development a remaining 80 MW of PGE and Pacific Power’s combined allotment, other policy changes made include increasing the discount from 20% to 40% for low-income customers, reducing the bill credit for participating non-residential customers to 90% of the customer’s retail rate, adding an annual 2% escalator on the bill credit rate to support subscribing more residential customers and to reflect expectations that retail electricity rates will increase over time, and retaining the 25% carve-out for community-based projects, to ensure that smaller, more innovative projects and projects managed by local non-profit organizations have an opportunity to participate.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/13/solar-carport-tax-incentives-suggested-in-california/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 13, 2022",Solar carport tax incentives suggested in California,"According to some estimates, the United States has two billion parking spots. The average parking spot is about 18 feet long and eight feet wide, for a total of 144 square feet. A 480 watt QCells Q.PEAK DUO XL-G10.2 is approximately 24.8 square feet. So, we can fit nearly six modules in a parking spot, with a capacity of 2,880 watts.
If we were to cover just 25% of the country’s parking spots with 2.88 kWdc per spot, the capacity of those 500 million parking spots would total 1.44 TW. And if we assume a lower average generation capacity factor due to suboptimal angling of the panels – let’s assume 15% – they would generate 1.89 PWh of electricity. The total electrical consumption of the US is currently around 4 PWh per year.

California Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo) submitted a new piece of legislation with a goal to motivate solar carport installations in California via a tax incentive. The bill, SB 49, is light in its initial wording:
SECTION 1. It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to provide tax incentives for the construction of solar canopies over large parking lots to boost the local generation of clean electricity in urban and suburban areas while reducing the need for dedicated land in rural areas and transmission to deliver the clean energy into population centers.
The bill will be up for debate in early 2023.
Senator Becker’s press release notes that, “pavement makes up 35%-50% of the total surface area in cities, and 40% of that pavement is parking lots.” It also cites California-specific solar carport figures.
For example, Los Angeles County has 101 square miles of parking lots, and about 25% of the state’s population. The press release extrapolates these numbers by population, inferring that there should be approximately 400 square miles of parking lots in the state, equivalent to 26 GW of solar canopies.

An analysis by Yale University suggests that carports in the state could meet about one-third of the state’s electricity demand.
The Senator also notes that California’s energy agencies estimate that the state needs about 110 GW of new solar power to meet its 100% clean energy target by 2045.
Some states have already put in place incentives for solar carports, offsetting the additional costs of steel, installation and grid connection. These additional costs would normally add as much as $1 per watt versus the price of a typical commercial rooftop installation.

Massachusetts’ SMART program offers a 6¢/kWh incentive for twenty years for any “Canopy Solar Tariff Generation Unit”. Rhode Island’s RE Growth program offers a twenty year, 5¢/kWh incentive for solar carports, though it looks like this incentive was not renewed for 2023.
France recently passed a law that makes solar carports mandatory for all parking lots greater than 1,500 square meters.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/13/solar-invention-achieves-patent-for-silver-saving-configurable-current-cells/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 13, 2022",Solar Inventions achieves patent for silver-saving Configurable Current Cells,"Solar Inventions, based in Atlanta, Georgia, announced it has been awarded patents in the United States, China, and Israel for its invention of a novel architecture for PV cells and modules.
Dr. Ben Damiani, chief technology officer, Solar Inventions, discovered that a manufacturer can create multiple “lanes” or subcells on a single wafer by electrically dividing each cell during the metalization process.
The process, called Configurable Current Cells (C3) requires no capital expenditure or process change for solar cell manufacturers to implement. For cell manufacturers, C3 requires only small changes in metalization print patterns and selective doping.
The process creates a new architecture that makes improvements on cell, module, and system performance while saving up to 18% of the silver required. This equates to $2 million to $5 million in savings per GW at prevailing silver prices. Silver typically represents about 10% of a solar module cost structure.
Select pilot tests and modeling have shown up to 3 Watts per panel in additional power, as well.
Most recently, the U.S. issued a continuation patent that broadens claims from Solar Inventions’ first patent and includes configurations for most modern cell structures.
“As the solar industry shifts to new cell structures such as Topcon and HJT and production continues to accelerate around the globe, the economic benefits of our Configurable Current Cell (C3) technology gain importance,” said Dr. Ben Damiani, the firm’s chief technology officer. “C3 dramatically increases silver cost savings for solar cell manufacturers, while adding power and resiliency.”
The technology won first place in the U.S. Department of Energy’s American-Made Solar Prize contest for innovative technologies, in September 2019.
C3 cells are based on Damiani’s Resistively Bound Subcells (RBS). C3 creates isolated changes in cell resistance through a combination of metalization laydown changes. The patent identified specific metalization patterns, both on the top and bottom of cells, that together create precise areas of higher cell resistance. These, in turn, are used as electrical boundaries around the hybrid subcells. These subcells exhibit characteristics that have previously only been possible with exotic wafer processing techniques or physical cleaving such as half-cells, said Solar Inventions.
“While scientists have long understood the idea of subcells (also called ‘monolithic cells’), creating them required specialized processing and was prohibitively limited in efficiency. Now, any manufacturer can immediately improve their profits, fabrication losses, and warranty returns — all without risk to throughput or quality,” said Solar Inventions in a whitepaper.
The technology has also demonstrated benefits for large-format wafer-based cells. Cells greater than six inches benefit from reduced current loss due to electrical heat dissipation for elevated current flows. RBS works with 95% of all silicon cell architectures including monocrystalline, polycrystalline, PERC, HJT, and bi-facial.
Solar Inventions said the technology has several applications, including:
“Cherry Street Energy, one of the largest and most innovative renewable energy providers in the Southeast, installed the first C3 cells in a commercial rooftop installation in Athens, Georgia over two years ago and has enjoyed fantastic performance,” said Gregg Freishtat, chief executive officer, Solar Inventions.
A full whitepaper on RBS and C3 performance and testing can be found here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/13/dragon-scale-solar-panels-chosen-for-new-space-station-housing-units/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 13, 2022",“Dragon scale” solar panels chosen for new space station housing units,"Albuquerque, New Mexico-based mPower Technology announced its DragonSCALE solar power system has been chosen by Gravitics to power its space station units.
Gravitics is currently developing StarMax, a flexible-use space station module that provides up to 400 cubic meters of habitable space. The units are designed to retool the manufacturing processes with updated techniques and design goals based on the next generation of space launch vehicles. Gravitics said the design has achieved the highest safety factor of any human-rated spacecraft.
The dragon scale-like solar modules are a flexible, interconnected mesh of silicon cells. The cells were chosen for their high efficiency and ability to wrap around the cylindrical space station. mPower said the solar cells are lightweight, low-cost, and resistant to orbital debris damage.
The solar cells are made of silicon, bucking the trend of gallium arsenide (GaAs) as a top choice for space solar applications. mPower said GaAs cells are extremely expensive and supply constrained, and emerging silicon-based alternatives are unproven, untested, and not yet ready to scale.
Its DragonSCALE solar modules use more traditional silicon materials similar to those used in the residential solar space, which the company said leads to low cost, high packing factors, radiation recovery, damage resilience, low weight and stowage volumes, mechanical flexibility and ease of system integration. 
mPower said its current manufacturing capacity is 50 kW per year and is currently being expanded to 200 kW per year. Its production facility is 100% automated and leverages silicon terrestrial PV cells and microelectronics assembly processes and materials. For large-scale deployments, the company said it can scale up to 1.5 MW per year per line, expand to hundreds of MW per year with relatively small manufacturing investments. 
Double dragon
The mPower DragonSCALE is not the only dragon-inspired solar technology that has found a partnership. European solar panel provider Sunstyle installed a building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) array for Google on its Silicon Valley campus. 
The internet giant, which also is a world-leading clean energy procurement company, has installed around 7 MW of the product on two buildings at its Silicon Valley campus. The 90,000 individual solar panels will generate enough electricity to cover around 40% of the electricity used in the buildings, known as Bay View and Charleston East.
The solar cells are embedded into a sturdy, but flexible, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) layer. Six millimeters of hardened solar glass protects the face of the panels; the back is protected by a layer of fire resistant Tedlar (polyvinyl fluoride). Because the edges of the tiles are sealed to keep out moisture — much like a glass-glass solar panel — aluminum framing on the panel is not necessary. 
The polyvinyl layer is a highly textured “prismatic” surface, which traps photons within the solar panel that would normally escape from traditional flat solar panels. The result is an increase in the solar panel’s generation.
One panel installed alone sports an efficiency of 15%. That is because the standard shingle doesn’t have a solar cell in the top square due to the product’s overlapping nature. But when one takes into account the overlapping configuration, the effective efficiency rating is closer to 17%, which is what the company lists on its website.
The warranty covers the product’s ability to generate electricity as well as its integrity as a building material. The shingles are guaranteed to last 30 years. Energy output is guaranteed to remain above 90% of its rated efficiency after 10 years, and above 80% after 25 years.

With this transaction, Manulife IM holds a minority stake in PowerFlex and joins its Board of Directors with EDF Renewables retaining majority ownership.
“We are happy to partner with EDF Renewables and play a role in PowerFlex’s growth to help its customers achieve their sustainability and decarbonization goals,” said Pradeep Killamsetty, managing director, infrastructure investments, Manulife Investment Management. “We see a strong growth opportunity for PowerFlex’s intelligent solutions, which enable organizations and enterprises to reduce energy costs and increase resiliency by integrating and co-optimizing multiple technologies, including solar, battery storage, EV charging, and microgrid systems.”
PowerFlex will use the proceeds of this capital raise to further invest in PowerFlex X, and it will enable the company to accelerate the deployment of onsite solar, storage, and EV charging. The company reports that it has seen increasing customer demand driven by corporate sustainability commitments, individual state renewable portfolio standards and targets, and climate-friendly federal legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act.
 “We are excited to partner with Manulife Investment Management, whose team brings an in-depth understanding of infrastructure trends that will help us continue providing our clients with reliable and cutting-edge clean energy solutions,” said Raphael Declercq, CEO of PowerFlex. “PowerFlex’s accompanying digital products optimize the system performance of all onsite energy assets to generate greater cost savings and increase efficiency. The investment will help advance our mission of electrifying the transportation sector and deploying low-carbon infrastructure in a way that also supports a cleaner, more decentralized and resilient grid.”
 PowerFlex said it has more than 400 MW of commercial solar installed. It has also deployed approximately 10,000 of its intelligent EV charging solutions. Many of its customers are top cleantech adopters, according to PowerFlex. One large customer, for example, is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), which has 1,000 PowerFlext EV chargers installed in its new parking facilities.
As part of the investment, Manulife IM has also acquired a portfolio of existing PowerFlex operating assets to serve as the basis for a dedicated financing vehicle for future projects.
PowerFlex was acquired in 2019 by EDF Renewables, as part of EDF’s strategic growth in the distributed energy market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/13/impact-of-inflation-reduction-act-delayed-by-trade-and-supply-chain-issues/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 13, 2022",Impact of Inflation Reduction Act delayed by trade and supply chain issues,"The United States added 4.6 GW of new solar capacity in Q3 2022, a drop of 17% from the same quarter last year. According to the U.S. Solar market Insight Q4 2022 report, released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie, despite the best efforts of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, trade barriers and ongoing supply chain constraints are to blame for the decrease. The total drop for the year will be 23%, according to the report.

Detainments under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) are depressing near-term solar installation forecasts and delaying the impact of the IRA, the report contends. UFLPA presumes that goods manufactured in the Xinjiang region of China are made with forced labor, and the onus is on the manufacturer to prove otherwise. The Act went into effect in June 2022, and resulted in U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizing and retaining more than 1,000 shipments of solar equipment. In August, ROTH Capital Partners said over 3 GW of components were held up at Customs. It estimated that much as nine to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering U.S. markets by the end of the year.
The U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision earlier this month to apply anti-circumvention tariffs on solar products from Southeast Asia risks future solar deployment, however the ruling was not taken into account in the outlook. The Commerce Department had thrown out an earlier request in 2021 by an anonymous group of solar companies seeking tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules, but then Auxin Solar (a small U.S.-based panel assembler) filed new round of antidumping/anti-circumvention (AD/CVD) cases against Malaysia, Thailand, and now Cambodia. In June 2022, the Biden Administration paused the issue with a 2-year tariff exemption. Now the threat is that after the 2-year pause, the tariffs will be back in play. Authors of the Wood Mackenzie/SEIA U.S. solar market insight note that while the AD/CVD ruling was not issued in time to be incorporated into the forecasts, they see new tariffs as a downside risk to the outlook.
“America’s clean energy economy hindered by its own trade actions,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “The solar and storage industry is acting decisively to build an ethical supply chain, but unnecessary supply bottlenecks and trade restrictions are preventing manufacturers from getting the equipment they need to invest in U.S. facilities. In the aftermath of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), we cannot afford to waste time tinkering with trade laws as the climate threat looms.”
In addition to hampering the flow of goods to the U.S., the supply chain challenges have caused prices to escalate across the solar industry. For the fifth consecutive quarter, year-over-year prices have increased across all market segments. Utility-scale prices, for example, are 12.7% higher than they were a year ago. As a result, 2022 installation forecasts show deployment dropping from 30 GW to 15 GW over the last year.

“Installations this year were significantly depressed due to supply chain constraints” said Michelle Davis, principal analyst and lead author of the report. “It has proven more difficult and time-consuming to provide the proper evidence to comply with the UFLPA, further delaying equipment delivery to the U.S.”
There is good news, however. Solar accounted for 45% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid, through the third quarter. The residential sector has not experienced a drop—in fact it saw a 43% increase over Q3 2021, with 1.57 GW installed. Some of this came from California, where residents scramble to get solar installed before net metering changes kick in. And overall, the report forecasts that growth, resulting from the IRA, will begin in 2024, with annual solar growth averaging 21% between 2023-2027.
Q2 2023 pivotal
Further good news is that the solar industry is expected to return to growth after 2022. Supply chain relief should arrive after Q2 2023, and at that point “the true impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act will manifest in our outlooks,” according to the report. Annual installations of solar will consistently reach 30 to 40 GWdc by 2024. From 2023-2027, the report forecasts 21% average annual growth across all solar segments, although report authors note that AD/CVD tariffs present a downside risk that will be included in future outlooks.
