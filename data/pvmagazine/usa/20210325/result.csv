The project is a 10 MW community solar and energy storage project in Warren, about an hour west of Boston. Under rules of the SMART program, any project with a capacity greater than 500 kW must also include energy storage. The company did not disclose the project’s storage capacity.
Agilitas is building two other community solar-plus-storage projects in the state; those two total 16 MW of solar and 18 MWh of energy storage.
The SMART program is implemented in 200 MW incentive “blocks,” with each block having a 5% capacity reservation for community solar.
The three-installation portfolio makes Agilitas one of the biggest developers in the SMART program. The projects also support Massachusetts’ goal of installing 1 GWh of energy storage by 2025.
Agilitas did not disclose equipment providers; the SMART program offers incentives for projects that incorporate trackers.
Outside of the SMART program, Agilitas is developing or constructing 300 MW of solar and energy storage projects throughout the Northeast.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/25/pennsylvania-lawmakers-introduce-a-community-solar-bill/,"COMMUNITY,PENNSYLVANIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 25, 2021",Pennsylvania lawmakers introduce a community solar bill,"Pennsylvania lawmakers introduced legislation March 24 to enable community solar projects in the Keystone State.
Senate Bill 472 would make it possible for two or more entities to subscribe for electricity generated by a solar photovoltaic system no larger than 5 MW in size.
Electric distribution companies would be compensated for efficiently and reliably integrating the resources into their distribution systems, using cost recovery mechanism and treating payments for grid services as regulatory assets.
The bill also would enable a community solar market to develop through innovative technologies without the need for full retail rate net metering.
Senate Bill 472 would enable homeowners and renters to acquire solar energy from a specific community solar project.

Earlier this month, Pennsylvania executed one of the largest solar commitments by any state government in the country.  Gov. Tom Wolf (D) said the state will power nearly half of the government’s electricity needs through seven new solar energy arrays totaling 191 MW. Lightsource bp will build, own, and operate the solar arrays. The commonwealth’s General Services agency contracted with utility Constellation to secure a 15-year fixed-price supply agreement.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said that 40 states currently have at least one community solar project on-line, with 2,579 MW installed through the third quarter of 2020. Of those states, 19, along with the District of Columbia, have specific policies and programs for community solar. SEIA said that the U.S. community solar market could add as much as 3.6 GW of capacity.
The Pennsylvania bill has 20 co-sponsors and was referred to the Senate’s consumer protection and professional licensure committee for consideration.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/25/arkansas-legislators-consider-bill-to-slash-solar-net-metering-value/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,ARKANSAS",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 25, 2021",Arkansas legislators consider bill to slash solar net metering value,"A bill has been advanced in the Arkansas House of Representatives to cut the net metering rate that residential solar customers receive for their excess energy.
House Bill 1787 would change the structure of net metering so that solar customers receive a credit equal to the utilities’ avoided-cost rate for their excess power. The wholesale rate is currently around 3 cents/kWh. As it now stands, the retail rate for net metering is about 11 cents/kWh.
Bill proponents justify the proposed rate cut, saying the current structure shifts cost burdens from solar customers to other utility ratepayers. They argue that the net metering rate is higher than if the utilities procured power elsewhere; doing so forces non-solar customers to pay more.
This is a frequent argument that typically overlooks the benefits that distributed generation brings to the table, beyond just electricity.
Lowering the net metering rate also throws a wrench into project payback timelines for Arkansas homeowners. Those who have already installed systems could see years added to those payback periods. Those considering installations could find them to be financially unviable.
Residential solar has already had a tough time in Arkansas, which has just 381 MW of solar installed. Of that capacity, most has come from utility-scale projects. If the proposed net metering structure is approved, it could hurt residential solar’s viability.

The analysis was done by Concentric Energy Advisors for the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) as part of the Macro Grid Initiative in coordination with the American Clean Power Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The report said that existing transmission planning processes have been insufficient in preparing the electric grid for a future resource mix that includes large amounts of renewable energy. Because transmission construction involves long lead times, typically between seven and 10 years, the window “may be closing to develop the needed transmission expansion” to achieve a range of renewable energy goals.
ACORE President and CEO Gregory Wetstone said in a statement that current transmission planning processes “are not working to deliver the affordable clean energy that states, businesses and consumers are demanding.”
The report identified what it said are “primary deficiencies and potential solutions” for greater renewable deployment in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), and the PJM Interconnection (PJM).
It said that the focus in SPP, MISO, and PJM has been on developing solutions to meet current reliability and economic needs. Those approaches were not designed to identify the necessary transmission expansion to enable future renewable energy development.
What’s more, transmission development in recent years “has primarily focused on reliability and low voltage projects,” many of which fall outside regional planning processes. As a result, development has “essentially stalled” on transmission projects rated at 345 kV and above, the report said.
Based on a interviews with market participants and stakeholders in the three regions, the report concluded:

The project would consist of single-axis, ground-mounted, tracking photovoltaic panels, and associated facilities.
In approving the project, regulators said that the utility’s community solar program is fully subscribed and has a two-year wait list.
The utility’s first community solar project was a 1 MW facility at St. Louis Lambert International Airport. Development there began in the fall of 2018 and was fully subscribed 55 days later. Construction was completed by Azimuth Energy in August 2019.
The utility asked to expand its community solar program, and filed an application for the Montgomery County facility last fall. By mid-October, the facility was 93% subscribed. Around 7,800 blocks of solar energy were available for customers. Each block is equal to 100 kWh of power.
Construction work is expected to begin this summer.

Doing so will require adding new solar, batteries, wind, and transmission, along with operational practices that make more efficient use of those assets. The study did not address specific costs, but said that economic impacts to the city would be “small relative to the overall size” of LA’s economy.

Each pathway included anywhere from 73%-92% of renewable energy generation from solar and wind resources. The study said that achieving this range would be enabled by deploying battery storage technologies and new or upgraded transmission lines that would allow LADWP to reserve and dispatch power to meet high demand periods.
To meet remaining demand, LADWP will need to bring “more nascent forms” of clean energy generation into the mix. The report said that infrastructure to produce and store green hydrogen power is a leading option. It left room for other forms of energy generation that will need to be developed to help store and and deliver power during high demand periods.

The study said that achieving the city’s goal of 100% renewable energy by 2035 instead of 2045 means that LADWP will need to make the necessary investments more quickly. “This results in earlier accumulation of debt, ultimately leading to greater costs” over the LA100 timeframe, the study said.
Among other findings in LA100:
The study said that LADWP’s distribution grid can manage the expected growth in local solar, along with growth in electricity demand. It said that almost all parts of the city’s distribution grid will need upgrades. Even so, the LA100 study estimated that, after correcting deferred maintenance on the existing system, a “modest number of equipment upgrades” would be needed. It said that upgrade costs would represent a “small fraction” of the total cost of the clean energy transition.
Vehicle and building electrification would lead to “substantial improvements” in air quality and related public health benefits. The study said that realizing these benefits would depend on achieving high energy efficiency and electrification, “independent of any particular renewable energy pathway for the power sector.”
A review by the SUN DAY Campaign of data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said that solar and wind had a strong start in 2021.
SUN DAY reported that utility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic (PV) plants tracked by EIA produced 23.1% more electricity in January 2021 than they did a year earlier. Estimated small-scale solar rose by 18.8%. Combined, solar grew 21.7% and provided 2.4% of the nation’s electrical output.
Wind generation grew by 6.6% in January, compared to a year earlier, and provided 8.6% of U.S. electrical output. Together, wind and solar rose by 9.5% and accounted for a bit more than 11.0% of net generation in January.
Meanwhile, FERC’s latest monthly “Energy Infrastructure Update” report found that solar and wind provided all of the new electrical generating capacity added in January. Twenty-seven units of utility-scale solar provided 724 MW. Two units of wind added 554 MW.
The SUN DAY report said that renewable energy sources collectively now account for 24.30% of the nation’s total available installed generating capacity and continue to expand their lead over coal (19.43%) and nuclear power (8.50%).
The Energy Information Administration projects that  up to 59 GW of battery storage will serve the power grid in 2050. Falling battery costs, growth in non-dispatchable renewables, and applying the Investment Tax Credit to co-located storage systems were key assumptions in its projections.
The projection also assumed that battery storage either would be built on a standalone basis to charge from the power grid, or as a co-located system that charges from an onsite solar photovoltaic power generator.
