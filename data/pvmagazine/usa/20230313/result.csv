https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/community-power-coalition-of-new-hampshire-announces-electricity-rates/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NEW HAMPSHIRE",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 13, 2023",Community Power Coalition of New Hampshire announces electricity rates,"The Community Power Coalition of New Hampshire (CPCNH) announced its base electric rate of 15.8 ¢ per kilowatt-hour, which starting in May 2023 will generate $5.8 million of dollars in savings for electric customers in 10 New Hampshire communities in the first three months alone. Community power was enabled by the New Hampshire legislature in 2019, now it is launching with 10 communities signed on.
Community power, also called community choice aggregation (CCA), allows towns to procure power on behalf of its residents, businesses and municipal accounts from an alternative supplier. Transmission and distribution services are still provided by the local utility provider. By aggregating demand, towns are able to negotiate better rates with competitive suppliers and choose cleaner energy sources. Many states have seen electric rates soar in recent months, and many towns are turning to community power as a way to have more local control over electricity sources (such as choosing more renewable energy), and lower or stable elecrtricity rates.
New Hampshire is just one of eleven states in the country to have authorized community power, with the other states being California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Virginia.
CPCNH provides service to New Hampshire communities served by three utilities, and it reports that its base rate beats the electric rates set by all three entities: 22% less than Eversource’s energy supply rate; 28% less than Liberty Utilities; and 39% less than Until. The lower prices are possible because, through aggregation, the town is buying electricity for a group, which has greater purchasing power than an individual acting alone. For example, the National Renewable Energy Lab showed in a solar cost benchmark study the connection between scale and prices. The study showed that procuring 100 MW of solar instead of 10 MW can reduce development costs per watt by 16%.
“Innovation is central to the mission of Community Power,” said Clifton Below, CPCNH board chair, “our Coalition power agency is equipped to build community-scale renewable energy projects that directly benefit our cities and towns for the long-term, and to push other innovations that empower customers with distributed energy resources.”
Community power must be voted on in each town that is interested in its benefits, which for many towns can be a process that takes years. To date, 10 N.H. towns have launched community power programs including: Enfield, Exeter, Hanover, Harrisville, Lebanon, Nashua, Peterborough, Plainfield, Rye, and Walpole. In May the Coalition takes over as the default electricity provder for these communities,
Many more New Hampshire towns and cities have begun the process to launch their own programs in the coming months and years. A total of 30 communities have already voted to join the Community Power Coalition and are currently in the process of launching their own Community Power Programs.
“A key value of the Coalition is the ability to manage a portfolio of energy resources and hedge risk, and for communities to control and adjust rates over time to ensure they can maintain discounts relative to utility pricing. The benefits of Community Power are made possible by a combination of local and state leadership working together to ensure that every city and town in New Hampshire has the opportunity to chart a better energy future for their community” concluded Henry Herndon, consultant to CPCNH.
Energy customers in Nashua, N.H. are expected to save $2.6 million in the first three months of Nashua Community Power service, according to the CPCNH.
“Nashua is proud to be among the first ten communities that are charting a new path when it comes to where we get our energy,” said Nashua Mayor Jim Donchess. “Community Power Coalition is a brand new institution that gives Nashua and other communities the ability to control price volatility in the short- and long-term, and the tools to accelerate the transition to a more economically and environmentally sustainable energy system.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/solar-asset-owner-operator-navisun-secures-235-million-in-funding/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 13, 2023",Solar asset owner-operator Navisun secures $235 million in funding,"Navisun, an independent power producer and solar asset owner, announced it has secured up to $235 million in debt financing through two separate facilities. The financing is expected to help the company scale its business and execute its project pipeline. The company co-develops, acquires, owns, and operates distributed small utility-scale solar projects.
The first facility is a $105 million, five-year revolving construction credit facility, including a letter of credit facility. The financing also incorporates an up to $50 million accordion feature, which offers the company flexibility to upsize as the portfolio grows.
MUFG acted as administrative agent, issuing bank, and coordinating lead arranger for the financing. Export Development Canada acted as mandated lead arranger.
The second facility is a 5-year, up to $130 million deal that includes a letter of credit facility and a delayed-draw term loan. It includes a $75 million accordion feature.
MUFG led the financing of this round and operated as administrative agent, issuing bank, and coordinating lead arranger. Wells Fargo and Export Development Canada acted as mandated lead arrangers. Wilmington Trust acted as collateral agent and depository for both facilities.
“The financing facilities we have secured provide us with the necessary capital to continue to innovate and expand our portfolio of solar and storage projects,” said Doug Johnsen, managing partner and co-founder of Navisun.
The funding announcement comes at a time when many solar developers in the small utility and community scale are facing potential financial troubles. Silicon Valley Bank, which was put into receivership by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), financed roughly 62% of U.S. community solar projects.
Renewables are mainstream
Bloomberg NEF reports that global investment in renewables totaled $226 billion in the first half of 2022, an increase of 11% year-over-year from 1H 2021. KeyBanc managing director Andrew Reddinger said renewable energy in the institutional investment world has gone “from niche to mainstream.”
Renewable energy’s share of electricity generation has grown 42% from 2010 to 2020, said the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, increasing to about 20% of utility-scale generation in the U.S.
While project-based financing has carried the torch for the energy transition, Redinger said he sees a new massive source of capital opening to the industry. Once potential source is the multi-trillion-dollar Term Loan B marketplace.
“That marketplace tends to lever these deals up more than banks, they tend to be less restrictive and, I think, that will end up being a better source of capital for renewables,” said Redinger.

As mechanical failures become a steady occurrence at both its Alamo 1 and Alamo 2 plants, it was time to upgrade. OCI Solar Power, a utility-scale solar developer based in Texas, served as the EPC to upgrade its 4.4 MW (AC) Alamo 2 solar farm.
The company reached out to Array Technologies, and with some brainstorming, they came up with a plan to remove the old tracker, which was a combination of single- and dual-axis trackers, and replace it with a state-of-the art system. In 2019 they finished upgrading the 39.2 MW (AC) Alamo 1 plant, and the trick to completing it while keeping the plant energized was to swap out the tracker in sections.
Because they were only upgrading the tracker system and keeping the solar panels and electrical balance of system (EBOS), Sabah Bayatli, VP of project development, EPC and Operations, told pv magazine usa that they first removed the panels and EBOS from just one section and stored them until the old tracker was replaced with the new system. Then the panels and EBOS were remounted, and the team moved on to the next section. Working on one section at a time enabled OCI to keep the plant partially energized so that it could continue providing power to CPS Energy, the nation’s largest public power, natural gas, and electric company.
OCI Solar Power is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, and develops, constructs, finances, owns, and operates solar PV facilities, specializing in utility and distributed generation solar projects. The company reports that it developed, designed, procured, and constructed 500 MW in Texas, all of which are operating in the ERCOT maket. In 2016 the company completed the 106 MW (AC) Texas Solar 7 project, the seventh project in the deal that jump-started large-scale solar in Texas.
OCI Solar Power is a subsidiary of OCI Company Ltd., a South Korean firm that has a portfolio of products and solutions for a broad spectrum of industries in the renewable energy sector, including making polysilicon. OCI Company established OCI Enterprises Inc. in 1990, which is its U.S. holding company that is the parent of OCI Solar Power, established in 2012, and Mission Solar Energy, established in 2014.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/teslas-investor-day-ramping-up-the-megapack-business/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ECKHART GOURAS,"MARCH 13, 2023",Tesla’s Investor Day: Ramping up the Megapack business ,"At the recent Tesla Investor Day at its Austin, Texas Gigafactory, the electric vehicle (EV) and battery storage manufacturer revealed some interesting tidbits about its Megapack energy storage business. Tesla’s energy business was one of the many parts of this three and a half hour long Investor Day on March 1st. Relegated toward the end of the conference, it provided some new insights into the rapidly expanding Megapack business.
Providing the overview was Mike Snyder, senior director, Megapack at Tesla. Snyder has worked at Tesla for nine years, so a little under the ten year track record of Tesla’s large-scale energy storage business. As on the car side of the business, the first ten years have been grueling as Tesla ramped up its Megapack production facilities in the U.S. to meet the increasing demand for its utility-scale stationary storage product. Its Megapack factory in Lathrop, California, is fittingly referred to as the “Megafactory”, though it’s the smaller cousin to the four Gigafactories Tesla runs in Austin, Fremont, Berlin and Shanghai, which together churn out 40,000 EVs per week. 
According to Snyder over 16 GWh of Megapacks have been installed globally so far with the goal being to ramp that up to 100 GWh already this year. He sees 100 GWh as the annual run rate for the next few years, so a big ramp up after just 16 GWh in the initial ten years. The latest product is the sixth generation Megapack XL, packing 3 MWh per unit of the lithium-ion battery. Snyder calls the Megapack XL the stationary battery storage product with the highest energy density on the market, capable of packing up to 300 MWh on a single acre of land. According to Snyder that’s twice the power density of a typical gas peaker plant. 
Snyder was joined on stage by Drew Baglino, Tesla’s senior vice president, Powertrain and Energy Engineering. Both Baglino and Snyder highlighted Tesla’s mastery of power electronics, with the company “delivering more power electronics than the solar and wind industries combined on an annual basis.” The cumulative output so far has been 1.4 TW across Tesla’s vehicle and stationary storage products. Coupled with Tesla’s extensive in-house capabilities in software development, the Megapack can function in “virtual machine mode”, providing synthetic inertia to the electricity grid. According to Baglino, it’s no longer simply a matter of injecting clean energy to the grid, but “adding power stability” to the mix. As Megapack costs continue to decline, these utility-scale energy storage units will replace conventional fossil fuel power plants to provide both energy and stability to power grids. 

As on the car side, Tesla’s ambitions on the Megapack side are impressive: the long-term goal is to boost annual output to 1 TWh, which would represent 25x the annual production capacity of the current factory in Lathrop. Lathrop itself was quite an achievement with Tesla transforming an existing JC Penney distribution center into a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for its Megapacks in under twelve months. The Lathrop Megafactory was completed in September last year. 
Speed is also of the essence when it comes to getting Megapack projects built. Snyder highlights the plug & play nature of the Megapack and that Megapacks can be easily strung together to form massive and intelligent power blocks that can readily connect to electricity grids across the world. In the past four years alone Tesla has increased the installation speed of Megapack projects fourfold, while at the same time reducing the required workforce by a factor of three. 
Tesla’s Investor Day also covered developments on the distributed storage front, where Tesla’s Powerwall is the flagship product. Whether it’s the Megapack and front-of-the-meter storage or the Powerwall and behind-the-meter storage, we can expect all of Tesla’s stationary energy storage products to complement what the automaker is doing on the EV front. Both are key elements in Tesla’s vision to get to a “sustainable energy earth” to use Elon Musk’s phrasing at this Investor Day. While the 2030 goal on the EV front is to produce 20 million vehicles annually, the 2030 goal on the energy storage front is to hit the 1 TWh mark. According to Tesla this will require an investment of $150 to $175 billion, which is actually less than one third of Tesla’s current market capitalization. On the other hand, it’s about five times the amount of Tesla’s cumulative investment so far ($28 billion).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/breaking-silicon-valley-bank-financed-62-of-community-solar/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 13, 2023",BREAKING: Silicon Valley Bank financed 62% of community solar,"Thursday night, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was put into receivership by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). As part of standard practice when a bank collapses, the FDIC created a new bank – the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara – making available account deposits of up to $250,000.
Sunday evening, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) announced that all deposits were going to be secured, and available to depositors on Monday morning. SVB has locations in California and Massachusetts.

The bank’s $209 billion in assets make it the second largest bank failure in U.S. history, and the 16th largest in the United States. The bank’s challenges, some of which were known, accelerated when it announced a sale of $21 billion in assets at a 9% loss in order to make sure it could still cover all assets.
This action led to multiple hyper-connected business groups to quickly withdraw $42 billion in assets. Amongst the leading groups pulling their capital was Peter Thiel’s Founder Fund. Reports of thousand-strong WhatsApp groups telling people to pull their cash circulated.
A second bank also collapsed, Signature Bank in New York, and was also being managed by the Fed in a similar manner as SVB.
Solar development finance
The bank’s website stated they had a hand in financing 62% of community solar projects as of March 31, 2022. A Google search verifies a definite relationship.

pv magazine USA has reached out to multiple community solar involved companies to get their reactions to these events.
Industry reactions 
Over the weekend, publicly-traded residential solar companies Sunrun, Sunnova Energy and others issued statements on SVB’s failure. 
Sunrun said SVB was a lender on two of its credit facilities amongst many banks, but said SVB was less than 15% of its total hedging facilities. Sunrun does not anticipate significant exposure. Sunrun does hold cash deposits with SVB totaling nearly $80 million, however, the Fed has stated these are protected.
Sunnova stated its exposure to SVB was negligible because it does not hold cash deposits or securities with the financial group. However, one of its subsidiaries is part of a credit facility where SVB serves as a lender.
Stem, an energy storage development company, said it estimates less than 5% of cash deposits and short-term investments could be impacted by SVB’s closure, though the company holds no credit facilities with the bank.
Sunrun’s stock lost 12.4% in value since SVB’s collapse late last week, while Sunnova and Stem were down 11.4% and 10.4% respectively.
Other energy industry comments were made, mostly with little to effects announced.
On Sunday, before the Fed announcement, reports were circulating that hedge funds were offering to buy depositor accounts for 60% to 80% of their value. The report noted that the bids represented how much the “uninsured deposits will ultimately be recovered once the bank’s assets are sold or wound down”.
On March 9, a few days before the failure, Forbes announced that SVB was its 20th ranked bank on their annual list of America’s Best Banks.
First Republic Bank’s stock is massively down this Monday morning, March 13, 2023. As well, general markets are down, along with bank sector stocks.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/agrivoltaics-market-valued-at-9-3-billion/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ILLINOIS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 13, 2023",Agrivoltaics market valued at $9.3 billion,"Agrivoltaics, the combination of farming practices with energy produced by solar photovoltaics (PV), is forecast to become a $9.3 billion marketplace by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1% in that timeframe from $3.6 billion a year ago.
According to a research note by Allied Analytics, experts believe agrivoltaics can minimize barriers to food security and the transition to clean energy. While the agrivoltaics market is still in the growth stages, it is expected to grow as the solar market continues to boom, owing to demand for clean energy and sustainability.
The agrivoltaics sub-sector market has seen progress as the industry learning curve grows around best use cases in recent years, with the global installed output of agrivoltaics rising from 5 MW in 2012 to around 2.9 GW in 2020, according to Allied Analytics.
To promote a healthy growth environment, subsidies from governing authorities will be required. The implementation of agrivoltaic solutions will require joint ventures, lease agreements, reduced loan rates and risk exposures, said the market research notes. In addition, since there is a significant reduction in crop yield, regulations regarding solar installations need to be enforced for minimizing land exploitation.
Based on climate change and increasing drought and extreme weather events, agrivoltaics offers key advantages such as zero-emission solar power coupled with food production and the protection of crops from drought and damage caused by hail or heavy rain.
To date, the world’s largest agrivoltaics installation has been built on the edge of the Gobi Desert in China, where berries are cultivated underneath solar modules, with total output of 700 MW to increase to 1 GW.
Additional drivers for agrivoltaic implementation are land scarcity and drought conditions in many regions as well as technological optimizations. The prerequisite is to interfere with agricultural use as little as possible and to cooperate closely with farmers for a broader application of agrivoltaics.
Challenges to agrivoltaic project installation include international standardization, the removal of regulatory hurdles, incentive systems, monitoring, farmer involvement, and further improvements in the economic efficiency of energy plus farming applications.
While all crops need sunlight for growth, too much can cause some plants to get stressed, especially cool-season plants such as brassicas. Plants growing under the diffused shade of PV panels are buffered from the day’s most intense rays. Shade reduces air temperature and the rate of soil water evaporation, a win-win for both plants and farm workers on hot summer days. The plants in turn give off water vapor that helps to naturally cool PV panels from below, which can increase panel efficiency.
Agrivoltaics is segmented into system design, cell type, crop, and region. By system design, the agrivoltaics market is bifurcated into fixed solar panels and dynamic. The fixed solar panel segment dominated the market share in 2021 and is projected to continue its dominance through the projection period owing to ease of handling and high-power generation.
In dynamic systems applications, agrivoltaics panels are moved or adjusted as and when required, which may be a hassle if needed to be done routinely whereas, in fixed panel systems, no such hassle is to be dealt with.
By crop, the agrivoltaics market is segmented into four categories: vegetables, fruits, crops, and others. The Crop segment dominated the agrivoltaics market growth in 2021 based on a rise in extreme weather, as solar panels shielded crops from excessive sun and dehydration. The same is expected to continue its dominance during the 2031 projection period followed by the vegetable segment.
Highlights of the agrivoltaics study:
According to Allied Analytics, major agrivoltaic market developers include BayWa, Insolight SA, JA Solar, Enel Green Power, Sunseed APV, Mirai Solar, Namaste Solar, Ombrea, Sun’Agri and Next2Sun.
The inaugural Solar Farm Summit 2023 conference is taking place this week, March 14 to 15 at the Hilton Rosemont/Chicago O’Hare in Rosemont, Ill., with 460 registered attendees across 70+ companies and agencies in the solar, agriculture, government/academic and media agencies, including pv magazine USA.

Recent research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory analyzes trends related to rooftop solar PV on houses of worship to understand this small but outsized portion of the non-residential solar PV market.
Currently there are 2,509 rooftop PV systems on houses of worship (HoW), representing about 1.9% of all HoW properties.  The growth of solar on HoWs has largely followed the non-residential market with a peak from 2016 to 2018. The HoW market share of all non-residential PV systems is about 2% while only making 0.6% of all non-residential buildings.
Roughly half of all PV systems on houses of worship are in California, compared to only one-third of all non-residential systems that are in California. In terms of demographics, solar penetration in HoWs largely reflects the larger market and trends towards wealthier communities. Washington D.C. is an exception to this with the highest relative penetration with 18% of their HoWs having solar with over 70% of those serving local non-white and Hispanic communities.
PV systems on HoWs average 80 kW of power capacity, but can vary widely in size. In comparison to the broader non-residential market, there is a smaller share of systems above 500 kW in HoWs, suggesting possible rooftop or financial constraints, according to Berkeley Lab.
Prices for PV systems on HoWs are in-line with similarly sized systems in the non-residential market. The cost for pairing storage with solar was lower on HoWs than across the broader non-residential PV market. Virtually all paired solar plus storage on HoW projects are in California, driven in part by state incentives and outages caused by wildfires, according to Berkeley Lab.
Third-party ownership, through solar leases and power purchase agreements, was much higher than the non-residential market, at 28% of all PV systems for HoWs. The share of third-party HoW PV ownership was even higher in states like Illinois, New Jersey, and Washington D.C. that have additional incentives. In the past, third-party ownership allowed tax-exempt entities the ability to monetize federal tax credits like the Investment Tax Credit and the Production Tax Credit. The Inflation Reduction Act is eliminating that need through the “direct pay” option which would allow them to directly monetize the benefits.
While the market has slowed down, with only 150 new PV systems being installed on houses of worship in 2021, there are new efforts to further adoption in this unique market. The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is targeting equitable access to solar in the third round of the Solar Energy Innovation Network (SEIN) with analytical, financial and facilitation help. Part of this work is supporting non-profits like Green the Church, RE-Volv and Interfaith Power & Light to help underserved communities overcome existing barriers to equitable adoption of solar through houses of worship.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/50-gw-of-solar-and-storage-for-tva-by-2035-plus-evs-could-save-customers-money/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 13, 2023","50 GW of solar and storage for TVA by 2035, plus EVs could save customers money","Robust deployment of solar and storage, along with a transition to electric vehicles and added transmission to import wind power, would enable the federally owned utility Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to run on 100% clean energy from 2035 onward and save its customers about $200 billion through 2050.
Those results, in comparison to a projected “baseline” TVA resource plan that reaches 99% clean energy by 2050, are from a modeling study sponsored by the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity and the consultancy GridLab, and conducted by Synapse Energy Economics. GridLab also served as technical advisor.
A policy brief by the Center for Biological Diversity released alongside the study called on TVA’s board of directors to “demand a concrete plan” for the utility to achieve 100% clean renewable energy by 2035. President Biden has appointed six of the nine members of TVA’s board, who constitute a majority of the board.
TVA is expected to prepare a draft resource plan this year. A spokesperson said the plan will be informed by TVA’s Valley Pathways Study, which according to a press statement will explore opportunities in “new nuclear,” renewable energy, electric vehicles, energy storage and hydrogen.
The clean energy plan for TVA would add about 50 GW of solar and storage by 
2035, as shown in the nearby image, including 1.7 GW of distributed solar. The utility last year targeted adding up to 10 GW of solar by 2035.
Modeling for the clean energy plan assumed that by 2030 all light-duty vehicle sales would be EVs and all new space heating and water heating installations would use heat pumps. TVA would continue to rely heavily on nuclear and hydropower generation, while phasing out all coal units by 2033 and nearly all gas units by 2035.
Although the clean electric system would have somewhat higher costs than the projected “baseline” plan, as shown in the table below, net savings would result due to almost $240 billion in fossil fuel savings and other reduced costs for transportation and buildings.

Costs not counted in the table include $45 billion for added transmission to import wind power from 94% of the wind capacity projected by 2050, and $21 billion for energy efficiency and distributed generation costs. “These unaccounted-for costs would need to exceed $255 billion for the 100% clean energy scenario to be uneconomic,” the study said.
Benefits not shown in the table are public health benefits from early retirement of fossil generating units, estimated at $27 billion through 2050, and societal benefits of $265 billion due to greenhouse gas reductions.
Through 2050 about 100 GW of solar capacity could be sited by building an average of 480 MW of solar, or “two large solar farms,” in each county in TVA’s service area, and building 4.4 GW of distributed solar, the study found.
The clean energy plan includes 1.5 GW of long-duration storage by 2050, while an “ambitious DER” scenario also includes 32 GW of flexible load.
Synapse used the Encompass modeling software and four other modeling tools in its study. For renewables cost projections, Synapse used the “moderate” scenario of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s 2022 Annual Technology Baseline.
Policy aims
The policy brief, beyond calling for a concrete plan for TVA to achieve a clean, renewable grid by 2035, calls on U.S. national laboratories to analyze TVA’s energy pathways, as they have done for Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. The brief also asks Congress to “hold TVA accountable through oversight hearings,” and to pass legislation to “open the TVA system to greater competition” via increased transmission access and to require 100% clean, renewable energy by 2035.
TVA is the nation’s largest public utility, serving 10 million people across Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, and portions of Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/semi-transparent-organic-photovoltaics-for-greenhouse-applications/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 13, 2023",Semi-transparent organic photovoltaics for greenhouse applications,"From pv magazine Global
UCLA researchers have developed organic solar (OPV) cells that can provide energy to greenhouses while also blocking ultraviolet rays to prevent overheating.
“We already established a startup that will scale up production of these organic solar cells for industrial use,” researcher Minhuan Wang told pv magazine.
The new device features the L-glutathione antioxidant as a reductive interlayer. This facilitates charge transfer between the cell’s zinc oxide (ZnO) layer and the photoactive layer made, which is made of a non-fullerene acceptor known as PM6:Y6, the scientists said in “Achieving sustainability of greenhouses by integrating stable semi-transparent organic photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Nature Sustainability.
They built the cell with a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), the novel interlayer, the photoactive layer, a hole transport layer made of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
“The l-G molecule can effectively nullify both major defects in the ZnO film and reduce the carrier recombination at the interface,” the academics said, in reference to the passivation effect of the interlayer. “The charge transfer from the ZnO surface to the O 2 is impeded by the l-G molecule, preventing the formation of the superoxide molecule.”
According to their findings, the new interlayer has two different functions. On one side, it acts as a passivation agent and, on the other side, it suppresses superoxide formation, which is usually triggered by the oxygen vacancy on the ZnO surface.
“The suppressed superoxide and hydroxide radical generation notably led to enhanced operational stability of the encapsulated semi-transparent OPV devices with the PM6/Y6 photoactive layer,” the US group said. “The devices with the l-G interlayer retained over 84% of their initial efficiency after 1,008 h continuous exposure under illumination.”
With the addition of the interlayer, the cell efficiency also increased – from 11.6% to 13.5% – with an enhancement of the short-circuit current density from 20.5 to 22.2 mA cm−2. “Additionally, due to the strong reducibility of the l-G molecule, the production of the radicals is reduced,” the scientists said.
They also tested the growth of common crops such as wheat, mung beans, and broccoli in a setup with a transparent glass roof with segments of inorganic solar cells and a setup with a roof made entirely from semi-transparent organic solar cells.
“The crops in the greenhouse with the organic solar roof grew more than the crops in a regular greenhouse,” they stated, noting that the L-glutathione layer blocked ultraviolet rays, which are detrimental to plant growth, as well as infrared rays, which can cause greenhouses to overheat.
“We didn’t expect the organic solar cells to outperform a conventional glass-roof greenhouse,” said co-author Yepin Zhao. “But we repeated the experiments multiple times with the same results and after further research and analysis, we discovered that plants don’t need as much sunlight to grow as we’d originally thought.”
