With its participation in the utility program, Stellantis will be able to attribute 100% of its electricity use at 70 Michigan manufacturing and office facilities to solar by 2026, which will reduce the company’s emissions in North America by 50% and across its manufacturing facilities by 30% overall.
The clean energy commitment represents BloombergNEF’s second largest corporate PPA on record, and the agreement with DTE Energy represents enough clean energy to power 130,000 homes each year.
The 400 MW agreement trails the 650 MW solar agreement that rival automaker Ford signed with DTE Energy in August to provide clean power to its respective Michigan operations.
“While this day and this historic agreement are about clean and efficient power, I’d like to suggest that today is also about the power of partnerships in this new era of sustainable mobility,” said Mark Stewart, chief operating officer of Stellantis North America.
DTE Energy’s MIGreenPower program has procured more than 800 businesses to date as well as more than 75,000 residential customers. On an annual basis, MIGreenPower customers have contributed to 4 million megawatt hours of clean energy in the program.  More information and to enroll in the utility program can be found here.
DTE is Michigan’s largest producer renewable energy. In its CleanVision Integrated Resource Plan filed last month with the Michigan Public Service Commission, DTE proposed increasing investment in solar and wind energy, accelerating the retirement of coal plants, and investing in the development of new energy storage – all reinforcing DTE’s commitment to cleaner energy.
If the CleanVision plan is approved by regulators, the utility will add more than 15 GW of new renewable energy projects over the next two decades.
Michigan is currently ranked 24th in the country for solar installations, receiving 0.8% of its electricity from its 937.7 MW installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The state has more than 3.5 GW of growth stage assets for deployment over the next five years.

Stellantis committed to a 2021 ESG plan which called for the addition of self-production and on-site renewable energy generation across its global manufacturing operations.  In 2021, the company consumed 16,058 GWh of energy, of which renewable energy was 7.5% of its usage.
In Europe, the company has signed 12,000 MWh PPA agreements in Zaragoza, Spain to procure solar power and 4,000 MWh of solar at the Mangualde manufacturing plant in Portugal. Its Zaragoza plant is Spain’s largest renewable energy self-generating project, with 19,200 PV modules installed with 8.64 MW of total power capacity.
In Asia, Stellantis powered its Ranjangaon, India facility with wind and solar energy of about 8.5 GWh per year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/12/ranking-the-top-15-nations-for-solar-energy-capacity/,"INSTALLATIONS,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 12, 2022",Ranking the top 15 nations for solar energy capacity,"Solar photovoltaics is set to be the number one technology deployed across the globe for energy production, increasing the world’s installed capacity by 75% through 2027, adding 2,400 GW over the period, said the International Energy Agency (IEA).
The IEA report said that renewable energy expansion is 90% of the planned additions worldwide, and solar accounts for over 60% of all forecast renewable capacity expansion, setting records for annual additions every year through 2027. Cumulative PV capacity nearly triples in the IEA forecast, growing by almost 1,500 GW, and exceeding natural gas by 2026 and coal by 2027.
Cost declines and the desire to boost national energy security and climate resilience are driving widespread adoption. In the U.S., the cost of utility-scale PV fixed tilt was $4.75 per Watt in 2010, and it declined to $0.94 per Watt by 2020.
The world will need 5.2TW of solar power generation capacity by 2030, and 14TW by mid century, to have any chance of limiting global average temperature rises this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, said the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Below is the list of the 15 largest producers of solar energy today, ranked in terms of operational capacity as reported in the BP Statistical Review of World Energy:
15) Ukraine – 8.06 GW
14) Brazil – 13.05 GW
13) Spain – 13.65 GW
12) United Kingdom – 13.69 GW
11) Netherlands – 14.25 GW
10) France – 14.71 GW
9) Vietnam – 16.66 GW
8) South Korea – 18.16 GW
7) Australia – 19.07 GW
6) Italy – 22.69 GW
5) India – 49.34 GW
4) Germany – 58.6 GW
3) Japan – 74.19 GW
2) United States – 93.71 GW
1) China – 306.4 GW
The world will have to install 450GW of new solar capacity each year – most of it utility scale – for the rest of this decade, with China and India to lead Asia to a roughly half share of the world’s installed PV capacity in 2030, estimated IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook report.
Elsewhere, North America will need to install 90GW per year of solar to claim a 14% share of the world’s operating panels at the end of the decade, and Europe’s 19% slice of the pie will require 55GW of annual solar capacity additions.
The world will have to start devoting $5.7 trillion per year to the energy transition for the rest of the decade to reach these targets, said Irena. That can be feasible if the $700 billion per year channeled into fossil fuels is immediately diverted to the transition, the publication stated. Public investment in the transition will have to immediately double, too, said IRENA, to attract the remaining money needed from the private sector, which would bear most of the financial burden.
Francesco La Camera, director-general of IRENA said, “Progress across all energy uses has been woefully inadequate.”
IRENA said policymakers also need to usher in sufficient international grid connections and flexibility; training; utility scale batteries; electricity demand-side management; digital tools; peer-to-peer power trading; community ownership of renewables; time-of-use energy tariffs; and net billing systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/12/free-genx-model-recommended-for-renewables-advocates-to-conduct-utility-resource-modeling/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"DECEMBER 12, 2022",Free GenX model recommended for renewables advocates to conduct utility resource modeling,"Most states require utilities to plan their future generation mix, as shown on the nearby map from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
When state regulators hold a hearing on a utility resource plan, stakeholders routinely testify how the utility biased its modeling against renewable resources and storage.

To take their game up a level, trade groups and citizens groups have sometimes used a computer model to prepare their own utility resource plan, using unbiased modeling choices, and finding that substantially more solar, wind and storage than the utility proposed would yield lower customer costs.
In rare cases, groups have been able to use the same model as the utility used; to enable that approach, Arizona now requires transparent utility modeling. But groups typically cannot access the proprietary model used by the utility. So stakeholder groups have turned to other models to prepare an independent utility resource plan, either hiring consulting firms to run their own proprietary models, or using free models such as the Switch model or the ReEDS model.
The energy-focused nonprofit group RMI now proposes that the free, open-source GenX model is a promising tool for stakeholders to use, to “reveal better planning outcomes” than those presented by utilities in their integrated resource plans (IRPs).
When RMI itself used GenX to develop a resource plan for two Kentucky utilities, the modeling results showed that the utilities could save customers money by developing more solar, wind and storage capacity than the utilities had proposed, and retiring a coal plant sooner.
The GenX utility planning model was developed by researchers at MIT. “GenX incorporates several state-of-the-art practices in electricity system planning, to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape,” says the model’s documentation. Jesse Jenkins, one of the model’s two original developers, now co-leads a joint MIT-Princeton team that is continually developing the model.
A “growing network of grid modeling experts and practitioners” has the capability to run a model such as GenX, RMI says, in a report that describes how RMI used the model. As evidence, report co-author and RMI Senior Associate Aaron Schwartz estimated that a GenX virtual workshop earlier this month drew more than 80 participants, and noted that the Sierra Club used GenX in June to model a resource plan for Florida utility JEA. Schwartz also pointed to similar modeling work with the GridPath open-source power system platform and other models.
“The tools are available; now it’s time to empower stakeholders to lead on this type of analysis through training, skills-building, and recruiting,” Schwartz said.
Requirements
Computer programming experience is not required to run the GenX model, Schwartz said, although RMI did program certain changes to customize the open-source model. Many stakeholders already understand capacity expansion planning,from their work in reviewing and commenting on utility IRPs, he added, so they can properly set up the model’s inputs and assumptions and interpret the results.
Useful experience for running GenX, Schwartz said, would be familiarity with downloading software from the website GitHub, comfort with a computer’s command-line interface, and experience with Microsoft Excel software, for configuring the data inputs.
RMI primarily used public data for its own analysis of an IRP for two Kentucky utilities. RMI also used utility modeling data that intervenors in Kentucky’s regulatory proceeding for the IRP obtained through the legal process of discovery. While RMI used that utility data, so that its analysis would be more aligned with that of the utilities, the nonprofit was also exploring alternative public data sources in case those would be needed, Schwartz said.
RMI used a standard laptop computer to model all 8760 hours per year in the planning horizon. By using several “commonly used” modeling simplifications, RMI kept the model “tractable,” Schwartz said, so it didn’t need to use cloud computing resources.
The modeling and analysis effort required about six weeks of full-time effort, Schwartz said. RMI used the free, open-source optimization solver Clp in combination with GenX.
Resources
The RMI report is titled “Power Planning to the People: How Stakeholder-Driven Modeling Can Help Build a Better Grid.”
The GenX model is available free on the website GitHub, as is the optimization solver Clp.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/12/new-jersey-community-solar-landfill-project-to-serve-lmi-residents/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,RACKING,NEW JERSEY",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 12, 2022",New Jersey community solar landfill project to serve LMI residents,"CEP Renewables and CS Energy have begun construction of two co-located solar projects on the Big Hill Landfill in Southampton, N.J. Not only does the project convert previously unusable land to a clean energy generating asset, energy generated by the solar installation will serve low-to-moderate income (LMI) residents and enable the township to recoup 40 years of back taxes and interest. Construction of this project is expected to be complete by May 2023.
“We are excited to be able to build upon the success of our redevelopment project in Mount Olive, N.J. – the largest solar landfill project in North America, by utilizing a similar process with this project,” said Chris Ichter, Executive Vice President at CEP Renewables.
 Earlier this month, CEP Renewables and CS Energy announced the completion of what is reportedly the largest North America landfill solar project, at 25.6 MW(DC). According to New Jersey’s Environmental Protection website, the capped Mount Olive landfill is a 65-acre brownfield site that ceased accepting waste in 1981. The project involved the purchase of the landfill by way of the redevelopment and tax lien foreclosure process.  As a result, the project won the 2021 Award for Innovation in Governance from the New Jersey League of Municipalities.
The BEMS project was also purchased by way of the redevelopment and tax lien foreclosure process, which the companies report is a structure that was entirely unique before the Mount Olive project. The Big Hill landfill site in Southampton had been abandoned by its former owner, resulting in the site accruing millions of dollars in tax liens. As part of the public-private partnership between CEP and the Township of Southampton, CEP acquired the tax liens from the township, paying back all past-due taxes in the process, and foreclosed on the landfill property.
“We’re proud that CEP Renewables has selected us to provide our expertise for this impactful landfill solar project due to our proven ability to complete these challenging projects safely and cost effectively,” said Michael Dillon, director of operations at CS Energy. “We look forward to working alongside CEP Renewables to convert a previously unusable site into a solar generating field that will provide substantial environmental and financial benefits to this local community.”
Like the Mount Olive project, the Southampton project will use ballasted solar racking systems from Terrasmart.
This project represents just one of 16 landfill or brownfield projects that CEP currently has under development, and brings CEP’s New Jersey installations to over 100 MW, contributing to New Jersey’s ranking as the number one U.S. state for installed solar capacity per square mile, according to CEP, as well as for the most planned community solar capacity serving LMI households.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/12/world-to-deploy-as-much-renewable-energy-in-the-next-five-years-as-the-last-20/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 12, 2022",World to deploy as much renewable energy in the next five years as the last 20,"Solar, wind and other renewable energy sources are expected to continue building momentum, increasing installed capacity by 75% through 2027, said the International Energy Agency (IEA). The growth in deployment would represent as much capacity added in the next five years as the last 20, adding about 2,400 GW over the period.
The IEA report said that renewable energy expansion is 90% of the planned additions worldwide, and 90% of that number will be represented by solar and wind energy. Cumulative solar PV capacity almost triples in the IEA forecast, growing by almost 1,500 GW over the period, exceeding natural gas by 2026 and coal by 2027.
“Renewables were already expanding quickly, but the global energy crisis has kicked them into an extraordinary new phase of even faster growth,” said Fatih Birol, executive director, IEA.
In five years, global renewable capacity would represent an amount equal to the total installed power capacity of China, said the report. The growth projections are 30% more than was expected last year.
IEA said two major drivers for global renewable energy adoption are low prices and security.
“First, high fossil fuel and electricity prices resulting from the global energy crisis have made renewable power technologies much more economically attractive, and second, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused fossil fuel importers, especially in Europe, to increasingly value the energy security benefits of renewable energy,” said the report.
“This is a clear example of how the current energy crisis can be a historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure energy system. Renewables’ continued acceleration is critical to help keep the door open to limiting global warming to 1.5 °C,” said Birol. Limiting global warming to this level is key to staving off the worst effects of climate change.
Solar PV on its own accounts for over 60% of all forecast renewable capacity expansion, setting records for annual additions every year through 2027. Although module prices have increased, utility-scale solar PV is the least costly option for new electricity generation in a significant majority of countries worldwide.
Commercial and residential solar PV systems make up 26% of the global renewable capacity additions forecast for the next five years, and the outlook for distributed solar PV applications has been revised upwards due to high natural gas prices raising retail electricity bills.
Competitive auctions remain the main driver of forecast growth, with increasing contributions from corporate power purchase agreements, bilateral contracts and merchant activity. Through nine months 2022, about 77 GW of new renewable auction capacity was awarded globally, mostly solar and wind projects. This is a 70% increase from the same period in 2021, with China and Europe accounting for three-quarters of total awarded capacity.
Elevated commodity prices, high freight costs and ongoing supply chain disruptions have caused onshore wind investment costs to increase by 15-25% and solar by 10-20% from pre-Covid levels, reversing a decade-long declining trend in prices. 
Through the first nine months of 2022, the price of solar-grade polysilicon almost quadrupled, aluminum more than doubled, copper rose by 90%, steel by 40%, and freight fees rose fourfold.
Renewable energy capacity in the United States is forecast to increase 74%, or over 280 GW from 2022 to 2027. This year’s forecast was revised upward by 25% from last year’s following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. 
IRA incentives are expected to support the Biden Administration target of 100% carbon-pollution-free electricity by 2035. In addition, 37 out of 50 states have renewable portfolio standards and goals supporting expansion. Now that the country has clear long-term policy visibility, uncertainties in the U.S. renewable electricity buildout are due to project delays related to supply chain constraints, trade measures, the availability of grid infrastructure and long permitting timelines.
IEA said renewable energy buildout may have to accelerate even faster to meet increased demand due to electrification of transport, heating and cooling, and more. It laid out a scenario where renewables add 25% more on top of the above forecasts.
To unlock this accelerated growth, advanced economies would need to address various regulatory and permitting challenges, and a more rapid penetration of renewable electricity in the heating and transport sectors would be needed. In developing economies, the increased forecast would require addressing policy and regulatory uncertainties, weak grid infrastructure and a lack of access to affordable financing that are hampering new projects.
IEA also noted a trend of diversification in global PV supply chains, with new policies in the United States and India expected to boost investment in solar manufacturing by as much as $25 billion over the 2022-2027 period. While China remains the dominant player, its share in global manufacturing capacity may decrease from 90% today to 75% by 2027, said IEA.
Renewable energy generation dedicated to hydrogen fuel production is expected to grow over the five-year span as well. IEA projects 50 GW of PV and wind capacity to be dedicated to this process by 2027.
Renewables, including solar, wind, and hydropower, are forecast to account for almost 40% of global electricity output in 2027, making up for declining shares of coal, natural gas and nuclear.

The document can be found in the Clean Energy Clearinghouse’s Training for Safety Officials series, which is being hosted and distributed by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC).
The guide is meant to serve as a high level, non-technical, training reference for fire and explosion risks, providing key standards for equipment and installations (along with the applicable hardware codes), and describing inspection techniques for energy storage systems.
Battery stress testing

Chapter 4, Fire & Explosion Risk in Lithium-Ion Battery Energy Storage Systems, describes how fire events develop, including a breakdown of the 2019 APS battery fire in Arizona. The chapter discusses fire and explosion risk mitigation techniques that are integrated at the multiple levels of battery construction. It also discusses the tools and safeguards integrated into the battery systems, such as smoke, flame, and gas detectors, fire control panels, and fire suppression systems.
The guide lists 24 unique battery standards. While all of these standards are necessary, five of the standards are described as “most relevant and applicable for the majority of modern ESS applications”, including NFPA 855, UL 9540, UL 9540A, NFPA 68/69, and IEC 62933.
The handbook also includes a table of the applicable sections of various installation code books, including the International Fire Code, the International Residential code, the International Building Code, and the National Electrical Code. Of course, not all codes are applicable to all projects.
\
The handbook ends with a series of checklists, and the “Basis of Requirement” that drives the actions in the checklists. For instance, the first item in the “Document Submittal Checklist” is the Commissioning Plan – whose Basis of Requirements is the IFC 1207.1.3. The other checklists are the “Utility-Scale BESS Enclosure Inspection Checklist”, the “UL 9540A 4th Edition Unit Level Report Checklist”, and the “Residential or Small Commercial Packaged BESS Inspection Checklist”.
In IREC’s 2021 Solar Jobs Census, the 255,037 jobs that were primarily focused on solar energy in solar power companies were complemented by another 21,910 jobs focused specifically on installing battery storage. The addition of battery storage jobs outside of the solar industry, for example, in the automotive industry – increases the number of battery storage jobs to nearly 70,000.
Headlines like “US grid-scale energy storage installations quadruple” are already becoming the norm. Since the IRA now provides 30% tax credit for standalone energy storage, these job numbers can be expected to continue growing.

The 2-hour energy storage system is designed to store and dispatch excess renewable energy, including solar and wind power, and will be charged and discharged on a daily basis. The BESS is designed to dispatch stored renewable energy at peak consumption hours to help meet the high demand during Nevada’s peak load hours.
“Energy Vault is pleased to be selected by NV Energy for a mission critical project supporting Nevada’s largest electric provider in achieving its goal of net zero emissions by 2050,” said Marco Terruzzin, chief commercial and product officer of Energy Vault. “This is Energy Vault’s first public utility customer for our short duration energy storage solutions, which furthers our strategy to be the energy storage company of choice for utilities, IPPs and large energy users. We look forward to beginning our relationship with NV Energy to help them meet their IRP needs for both short and long duration energy storage.”
In August, Energy Vault and Jupiter Power announced the signing of two contracts whereby Energy Vault will supply equipment, engineering, procurement, construction, balance of plant services and the energy management software for two of Jupiter’s battery energy storage projects, one in Texas and the other in California. For the Texas project, Energy Vault will supply a 100 MW (200 MWh) battery energy storage system at a Jupiter Power Facility, which will provide energy and ancillary services to ERCOT. For the California installation, Energy Vault will construct and commission a 10 MW (20 MWh) BESS for Jupiter Power in that will participate in the CAISO Resource Adequacy program.
Energy Vault announced in its Q3 earnings report revenue of $1.7 million, driven by revenue from these energy storage projects with Jupiter Power in Texas and California. The company reported project awards of approximately 2 GWh of energy storage systems, including its first 48-hour long-duration hybrid system using green hydrogen. In total, Energy Vault reports that it currently has a portfolio of approximately 4.8 GWh of contracted and awarded projects, equally distributed between short and long duration.

Over the course of the initiative, about 3,200 direct jobs will be created, of which 2,000 will be produced directly through PSEG’s newly launched Clean Energy Jobs Program.
Based in Morristown, N.J., RWA is a social enterprise and nonprofit educational consulting group which began to train residents in underserved communities of the tri-state New York and New Jersey following the Covid-19 pandemic for hiring opportunities in the clean energy market.
For its part, PSEG  also sought to launch a jobs program post-pandemic in order to bolster the clean energy sector. The New Jersey utility’s Clean Energy (CE) Jobs Program was developed to meet the growing renewables sector by expanding opportunities for energy efficiency workforce diversity.
By launching its CE Programs in the New Jersey, PSEG’s concept was to partner with local nonprofits that provide professional development services and wrap-around support for any individual, unemployed or underemployed person.
RWA has worked with clients ranging from 13 to 55 years old.  About 34% of clients served have a household income of $20K to $40K, and another 34% have a household income of less than $20K.
Through its partnership with the NJ-STEP (New Jersey Scholarship and Transformative Education in Prisons) Program, formerly incarcerated individuals (ex-offenders) have also been included in the clean energy program.
RWA’s partnership with Newark Workforce Development Board under its Newark Green Infrastructure Project allows the non-profit agency it to serve unemployed and dislocated workers.
“What RWA has known since its inception is that regardless of the demographic, all individuals need support in self-actualizing and understanding how to navigate the world around them in order to achieve whatever they define as success. RWA’s purpose is to provide this support,” said Lincoln Farquharson, chief executive officer of RWA and executive director of the PSEG partnership.
PSEG and RWA will be launching a new cohort in February 2023 which includes free virtual classes for any NJ resident over 18 years of age  on professional communication, finances, business etiquette, cover letter & resume writing, interviewing, and additional professional tips.
Those seeking support must register with RWA prior to February 1 to be eligible for the 2023 program.
Just last week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) launched the Competitive Solar Incentive (CSI) program, a new program designed to encourage grid scale solar generation in the Garden State.
The new CSI program has a goal of incentivizing at least 300 MW of solar annually until 2026. The program will be open to qualifying grid supply solar installations and non-residential net metered solar installations with a capacity greater than 5 MW, as well as to eligible grid supply solar installations in combination with energy storage.
New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy has committed to 100% clean energy by 2050 and at least 50% Class I Renewable Energy Credits by 2030.
“Our growing solar program, which not only includes CSI and [Administratively Determined Incentive] ADI, but also Community Solar, is one of the core programs in achieving Governor Murphy’s goal of a 100%  clean energy future,” said Joseph L. Fiordaliso, president of NJBPU.
Prior to the utility-scale program’s launch, New Jersey already ranked eighth in the nation for solar development after achieving 4 GW of deployments over the last year, enough clean energy to power 662,947 homes.
As of Q2 22, the Solar Energy Industries Association states 6,237 employees work in the New Jersey solar market, with 70 manufacturers and 203 installers and development companies operating in the state.
