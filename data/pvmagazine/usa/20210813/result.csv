The battery is based on a low-cobalt, nickel-rich layered cathode known as NCM88, which the scientists said offers a high energy density and improved stability for the battery compared to commercially available organic electrolytes known as LP30. “In the LP30 electrolyte, particle cracks occur on the cathode,” HIU professor, Stefano Passerini explained. “The electrolyte reacts within these cracks and destroys the structure and thick, moss-like lithium-containing layer forms on the cathode.”
According to the researchers, this reaction negatively impacts the battery stability and is currently the main issue preventing their technical and commercial maturity. In order to address this matter, they used a low-volatility and non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) incorporating two anions known as bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI).
They further explained that the combination of the new cathode and electrolyte favors the formation of a cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer in the electrolyte which protects the NCM88 surface against detrimental reactions with the electrolyte itself, thus avoiding the formation of microcracks. The dual-anion electrolyte is also said to show compatibility with the lithium metal and the high-voltage positive-electrode material used for the device.
“This electrolyte enables initial specific capacity of 214 mAh g−1 and outstanding capacity retention of 88% over 1,000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.94%,” the German group said, noting that the new configuration of the electrolyte significantly reduces the structural changes in the nickel-rich cathode. The Coulombic efficiency is the ratio of discharge capacity to charge capacity within the same cycle.
All the details on the battery can be found in the paper Dual-anion ionic liquid electrolyte enables stable Ni-rich cathodes in lithium-metal batteries, which was recently published in Joule.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/13/report-shows-strong-solarstorage-market-growth-and-plenty-of-room-for-improvement/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 13, 2021",Report shows strong solar+storage market growth… and plenty of room for improvement,"Interest in pairing solar with battery storage has surged over the past few years, largely driven by concerns about the reliability of the country’s outdated electric grid and the reality of increasingly severe power outages.
Tesla recently announced that there may be more than 50,000 Powerwall battery systems installed at homes and business in California alone.
Despite soaring deployment numbers and increasing customer demand, little data has been available to understand the current state of the solar+storage market. A new report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory provides a valuable initial look at residential and non-residential distributed solar+storage markets, showing significant growth and huge potential for the future.
In Behind-the-Meter Solar+Storage: Market Data and Trends, researchers at Berkeley Lab looked at data from 50,000 residential solar+storage installations and 1,000 non-residential installations, representing about 90% of paired systems installed through the end of 2020.
They found that, overall, about 17% of all installed U.S. battery storage capacity is paired with solar behind a customer’s utility meter. Surprisingly, all those customer-sited systems add up to more than the entire solar+storage capacity installed directly on the grid: roughly 550 MW of customer-sited solar+storage versus 420 MW of grid-sited systems. Two-thirds of the customer capacity comes from small residential systems, which tend to be sized around 5 kW.
Even so, most home solar systems are still being installed without storage. Roughly 6% of residential solar systems installed in 2020 included battery storage. Non-residential system attachment rates were even lower, with 2% of those solar systems paired with storage. As might be expected, the numbers vary greatly depending on location.
In Hawaii, where exported solar energy is either prohibited or compensated at a much lower rate, 80% of home solar and 40% of non-residential installations are being paired with storage. And in California, where wildfire-related utility outages have become a concern, a significant number of existing PV systems are being retrofitted to add storage.
Both states may offer a look into the future of solar+storage across the country as states reevaluate solar net metering policies and more regions experience an uptick in power outages resulting from extreme weather conditions.

Another finding of the report concerns system sizing. Two battery manufacturers have dominated the residential storage market, Tesla and LG Chem. Both offer 5-kW batteries, with 13.5 kWh of energy storage capacity for Tesla’s Powerwall and 9.5 kWh of storage for LG Chem’s RESU 10H.
When comparing solar PV sizing to storage capacity, the researchers found that the batteries could storage an average of 30-80% of daily solar generation. Commercial installations have a greater variation in sizing, but are typically much larger than residential systems, with a median battery size of 100 kW and 200 kWh.
The report also explored the cost premium of adding storage to a solar installation. Across both residential and non-residential systems, incorporating battery storage was found to increase the cost of a solar installation by an average of $1.2 per watt. That represented about a 33% price increase for residential solar, increasing the average installed cost from $3.8 per watt for solar-alone to $5.0 per watt for solar+storage. For a typical residential PV system sized at 7 kW, that would translate into an added cost of $8,400 to incorporate battery storage.
The report also considered equity issues. It comes as no surprise that households installing solar+storage generally have higher incomes than regional averages, which also is the case for solar-alone. Berkeley Lab researchers found that the income gap for solar+storage is even more pronounced. Solar+storage adopters had median incomes that were 66% higher than average regional incomes as opposed to 41% higher for households only installing solar.
The findings illustrate the need for targeted low-income battery storage incentives and higher compensation levels to ensure more equitable solar+storage development, particularly for lower-income households with medically vulnerable members and those located in regions subject to extreme weather conditions where access to reliable electricity is a critical need.
The equity gap can also be seen in non-residential solar+storage. The researchers found that 70% of non-residential solar+storage systems have been installed at for-profit companies. Schools represent the one nonprofit sector realizing more significant development of solar+storage projects. Schools account for the majority of non-commercial solar+storage, representing 25% of non-residential installations. A minority of systems were installed to support nonprofit entities like community organizations, affordable housing providers, and local governments.
The report’s findings highlight a few key points.
First, customer-sited solar+storage has a large (and often underappreciated) potential to provide grid benefits, representing a larger combined capacity than all grid-sited projects. These small systems can be aggregated together to replace the capacity currently provided by fossil fuel power plants, cleaning up the grid while strengthening resilience by decreasing reliance on large-scale, centralized points of grid failure.
Second, the potential of customer-sited solar+storage is being underutilized. While paired solar and storage systems are becoming more common, they still represent only a small fraction of solar installations.
Every solar system installed without storage is a missed opportunity to turn a source of intermittent generation into a flexible grid resource and source of local reliability. There is also a massive opportunity to retrofit existing solar installations with battery storage.
Third, more needs to be done to ensure that solar+storage is being installed in lower-income areas. Low-income households and frontline communities are often more vulnerable to the impacts of power outages and have fewer resources available to respond and recover to extended outages. These communities should be prioritized in the design and implementation of policies and programs incentivizing greater solar and battery storage deployment.
So, customer-sited solar+storage has clearly come a long way and, clearly, still has a long way to go to reach its full potential.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/13/new-class-of-photocatalyst-has-implications-for-hydrogen-fuel-production/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 13, 2021",New class of photocatalyst has implications for hydrogen fuel production,"Research on a new type of photocatalyst called a covalent organic framework (COF) has led to significantly increased hydrogen production rates in photocatalysts, which scientists at Shoonlini University said in a published Science Direct article could have implications for clean energy production in the future.
Photocatalysts are materials that absorb energy from light to perform a chemical reaction. Best known among photocatalysts is chlorophyll, a green pigment in plants that turns sunlight into carbohydrates.
In a photocatalytic reaction, light causes electrons to break their bonds and move freely through the catalyst. The excited electrons then react with the raw materials of a chemical reaction, and produce a desired end product.
A priority by the alternative energy research field is to use photocatalysts to convert solar energy into fuel, a process called “solar-to-fuel production.”
The current performance of these materials has been limited due to poor light absorption, fast photogenerated electron-hole recombination, and inappropriate active sites. However, the development of COFs has worked to address some of these limitations.
COFs are able to add special molecules called “functional groups” to their structure, which provide a way around some of the limitations of traditional photocatalysts. COFs have higher chemical stability, controllable porosity, and strong electron delocalization, which makes them extra stable.
Strong electron delocalization means that unlike in semiconductor catalysts, excited electrons recombine midway infrequently, leading to more excited electrons for the chemical reaction.
COFs consist of organic molecules, and can be tailored to suit various applications. The modifiable porosity and stability of the material make it particularly well suited for fuel production, as well as in carbon dioxide conversion.
The researchers said COFs have the ability to convert CO2 into methane gas, providing a dual benefit of fuel production and carbon reduction. COFs can also be used in nitrogen fixation processes, plastics production, and the storage of gases.
A new class of COF, covalent triazine frameworks (CTF) are currently at the cutting edge of hydrogen production research. This new material has been shown to produce 20-50 times the hydrogen that traditional graphitic photocatalysts make, making it a potential option for future fuel production.
COF-based photocatalysts are still in an early stage of development, and at this time do not produce power as efficiently as semiconductors. However, their unique properties and diversity of structure make them promising candidates for future solar-to-fuel research.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/13/blue-is-not-the-new-green/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA,NEW YORK",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 13, 2021",Blue is not the new green,"from pv magazine Global
Proponents of blue hydrogen produced with fossil fuels and carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) technologies often present it as a cleaner alternative to hydrogen produced with the steam methane reforming (SMR) process, or so-called “gray hydrogen,” which is now the prevailing generation source globally. Blue hydrogen advocates also view it as a potential partner for green hydrogen produced with renewables in facilitating an emissions-free energy transition.
The blue fuel, however, is not as green as described, according to a new study from Stanford University and Cornell University. The research concludes that the CO2 footprint of hydrogen produced with fossil fuels is more than 20% greater than heat generated by natural gas or coal and around 60% greater than burning diesel oil for heat.
“We emphasize that our analysis in this paper is a best-case scenario for blue hydrogen,” the scientists said. “It assumes that the carbon dioxide that is captured can indeed be stored indefinitely for decades and centuries into the future.”
They said that blue hydrogen emissions include carbon dioxide and unburned fugitive methane and said that their modeling considered the lifecycle emissions linked to the mining, transport, storage, and use of methane. They considered several CCUS techniques for blue hydrogen, including the carbon dioxide released by the SMR process, and the removal of additional carbon dioxide from the gases created by burning methane to provide the heat and high pressure needed to drive the SMR process. They also looked at the carbon dioxide and methane from the energy used to produce electricity for the carbon-capture equipment.
According to their modeling, the carbon dioxide emissions of blue hydrogen were only between 9% and 12% lower than those of gray hydrogen.
“While carbon dioxide emissions are lower, fugitive methane emissions for blue hydrogen are higher than for gray hydrogen because of an increased use of natural gas to power the carbon capture,” the research group explained.
Fugitive methane emissions are estimated at 43 g CO2 equivalent per megajoule of hydrogen produced, the researchers said. They defined the recent bet on blue hydrogen by many fossil fuel companies as a “distraction,” and they argued that it might only delay the much-needed decarbonization of the global economy.
“We further note that much of the push for using hydrogen for energy since 2017 has come from the Hydrogen Council, a group established by the oil and gas industry specifically to promote hydrogen, with a major emphasis on blue hydrogen,” they said.
They described their findings in “How green is blue hydrogen?,” which was recently published in Energy Science & Engineering.

A CES of 80% by 2030 is the focus of current federal policy discussions. The goal would evolve into a target of a net-zero-emission economy by 2050.
Voters in Colorado supported the proposal by a 51-point margin, including Democrats by a 96-point margin, Independents by a 53-point margin, and more than two-fifths of Republicans.

Support also was strong in Arizona, where voters who were polled supported the proposal by a 44-point margin, including Democrats by an 89-point margin, Independents by a 41-point margin, and, more than two-fifths of Republicans.
The results also showed that respondents across party lines favor infrastructure and policy action that would support clean energy and create jobs in the sector.
From June 12 to 20, Data for Progress conducted a survey of 567 likely voters across Arizona using short message service (SMS) and web panel respondents. The sample was weighted to be representative of likely voters by age, gender, education, race, and voting history. The survey was conducted in English. The margin of error is ±4 percentage points. The survey methodology was the same in Colorado, but included 511 likely voters. The margin of error there also was ±4 percentage points.
The polls were conducted in states that already have existing CES policies.

Colorado’s Climate Action Plan to Reduce Pollution, signed in 2019, set targets of reducing statewide greenhouse gas pollution 26% by 2025, 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050 from 2005 levels. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis released earlier this year his Colorado Greenhouse Gas Pollution Roadmap outlining a plan to reach those targets.
Colorado legislators, also this year passed measures to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from most electricity production 80% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, cut energy waste, and power homes and businesses with clean electricity. Further action to  achieve these goals is still needed.
In May 2021, Arizona regulators approved an Energy Rules update that would require the state’s electric utilities to reduce carbon emissions 50% by 2032 and 100% by 2070. The 2070 date falls short of what scientists say is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. A more urgent timeline is supported by the state’s utilities, businesses, and citizens.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/13/solar-mandate-for-new-commercial-buildings-approved-in-california/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 13, 2021",Solar mandate for new commercial buildings approved in California,"California’s Energy Commission panel has voted to require the inclusion of solar and battery energy storage on many new commercial buildings, as well as high-rise residential constructions. The panel of five voted unanimously on the mandate.
The proposal will now be taken up by the Building Standards Commission, which said the solar mandate will likely be included as part of the greater December revision of the state’s building code.
The plan, if approved, would go into effect the first day of 2023.
Also included in the plan is a requirement of new homes to have wiring that encourage and facilitate an easy transition from gas heating and appliances to all-electric.
The commercial buildings covered by the plan include offices, hotels, medical buildings, clinics, restaurants, schools, theaters, grocery stores, retail, auditoriums and convention centers.
This provision would build on existing California legislation that requires new single-family homes and multifamily dwellings up to three stories high to include solar power.
The commission said construction costs from this project are expected to be minimal, as it is more cost effective to build solar and storage at construction, rather than retrofitting.
Homes and buildings make up 70 percent of California’s electricity use and about a fourth of its greenhouse gas emissions, said the commission. Over 30 years, the commission said it estimates the emissions abated would equal taking 2.2 million cars off the road.
While it is not guaranteed the Building Standards Commission will approve the plan, they have not denied the California Energy Commission’s proposals in the past.
The plan has met some opposition, namely from Southern California Gas, and has seen support from environmental groups like the Sierra Club and utilities Sacramento Municipal Utility District and Southern California Edison.
Net metering to be changed?
The dynamics of solar continue to shift in the state, as the California Public Utilities Commission has been considering modifying net metering, the program in which solar owners are paid for their excess energy generation.
A sizable change, or elimination of, net metering could leave solar customers with significantly reduced savings, and the act is coming under fire from leaders in the solar industry.
“Net metering is the one opportunity for the little guy to get relief, and they want to put the kibosh on it,” Bernadette Del Chiaro, the executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.
