SEIA submitted the brief in advance of a USITC hearing November 3 during which the Commission will hear arguments on the effectiveness of the Section 201 tariffs. The 143-page public version was edited by the trade group to remove information that it considered confidential in nature. In the next few weeks, the Commission will make a recommendation to President Biden on whether to extend, modify, or phase out the tariffs.
The tariffs, imposed by President Trump in January 2018, have produced “marginal investments” in domestic module assembly facilities that “fall well short” of the capacity needed to serve U.S. demand and meet President Biden’s climate and clean energy goals, SEIA said in a statement. They also failed to create jobs, instead resulting in “significant” job losses.

In August, Hanwha Q CELLS USA, Inc., LG Electronics USA, Inc., and Mission Solar Energy asked the ITC to extend import tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells.
The petition was made under Section 204(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 and Subpart F of part 206 of the rules of practice and procedure of the ITC. The companies said that they are representatives of the domestic industry producing CSPV cells and modules and, therefore, have standing to file the petition.
Days earlier, Auxin Solar and Suniva formally asked the ITC to extend solar tariffs for four more years.
At the time, Mamun Rashid, co-founder and CEO at Auxin Solar said that “extending this safeguard is essential for America to reclaim its lead in solar energy manufacturing and development, and it represents a critical step to achieve the broader goal of American renewable energy independence.” Rashid said that Auxin was “committed to re-shoring the solar supply chain” and filed the petition hoping that policymakers would be “committed to the promise of green energy independence and the good-paying manufacturing jobs that will result.”
The ITC is expected to report its determination to President Biden by December 8.
A tariff extension would be “yet another barrier” to clean energy deployment and will “undermine any hope” the U.S. has to mitigate the climate crisis, said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. She said the U.S. has collected $2.6 billion in Section 201 solar tariffs, but “not one cent of that helped the domestic manufacturing industry.”
She said that U.S. lost 6,000 solar manufacturing jobs over the last four years. Proponents of the tariffs “promised we’d create more than 45,000 jobs.”
In 2020, the average worker installed more than 200 kW of solar, double the amount in 2017, and more than three times the amount recorded in 2011.

The jobs report said the drop was largely split evenly among states. Labor productivity rose in all three market segments, up 19% in the residential sector, 2% in the non-residential sector, and 32% in the utility-scale sector. Less labor-intensive utility-scale installations contributed to a record amount of solar capacity added in 2020, the report said.
However, the pandemic took a toll on residential jobs in the summer of 2020, the report said, and those jobs did not fully recover by the end of the year.

The report also said that labor productivity improvements were a result of growth in average system size, less labor-intensive customer acquisition, and increased competition for skilled labor. In 2020, the average worker installed more than 200 kW of solar, double the amount in 2017, and more than three times the amount recorded in 2011.
SEIA now argues that since the Section 201 tariffs were imposed in 2018, the U.S. solar industry has “missed out on” more than 62,000 jobs, $19 billion in private sector investment, and more than 10 GW of solar deployment. “Extending the tariffs will compound these economic losses and worsen the supply chain bottlenecks that are already throttling America’s clean energy sector.”
Hopper said, “The solar industry is already facing major supply chain constraints.” She said that extending the Section 201 tariffs “will only exacerbate these problems, prevent President Biden from reaching his clean energy goals, and worsen the global climate crisis.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/01/when-oversized-is-really-the-right-size/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 1, 2021",When oversized is really the right size,"Researchers recently published a paper in which they seek to understand how far we can go with wind and solar.
The research analyzes 39 years of hourly wind and solar generation data across 42 countries. An evaluation of “perfect” transmission without energy storage finds that the most reliable renewable electricity systems are wind-heavy and satisfy countries’ electricity demand in 72–91% of hours (or in 83–94% of hours by adding 12 hours of storage).
The research found, however, that even in systems which meet more than 90% of demand, “hundreds of hours of unmet demand” may occur each year.
The research quantified the power, energy, and utilization rates of additional energy storage and demand management, (curtailment), as well as the benefits of regional aggregation. The models evaluated three levels of excess generation (1x, 1.5x, and 3x) and storage (none, 3 hours, and 12 hours).
Notably, the researchers concluded that wind and solar generation resources that were sized at 1.5x along with three hours of energy storage would meet all but 200 hours of demand scattered throughout any given year.

Prior research by Caldeira suggested that the United States could reach a dependable power grid made up of 80% wind and solar power with approximately 12 hours of energy storage. This 80% model would require no additional power grid transmission resources.
The models found that countries with larger land areas can (obviously) build wind+solar power grid systems with greater reliability. For systems without integrated energy storage, the ability to meet energy demand increased by 7.2% for every factor of 10 increase in land area.
When three or even 12 hours of energy storage are added, patterns begin to emerge.
The top left of the above chart shows a standard volume of generation with no energy storage. It shows a clear linear increase in reliability associated with the country’s area. But, in cases where three or 12 hours of energy storage are added, generating capacity increases by 50%, and reliability increases dramatically.
In fact, when looking at the lower right box with 12 hours of batteries and 1.5x standard generation, the ability of wind and solar to meet electricity demand brings all of the nations analyzed in the study above 97%; several countries were modeled as meeting 100% of demand.
The research suggested a trade-off point exists for excess generation and energy storage as a 10% increase in excess annual generation is equivalent to 3.9 hours of storage.
The paper showed that even with energy storage, gaps in the schedule of heavy wind plus solar systems still find periods where dispatchable resources will be needed. And though it is easy to suggest fossil-based facilities as a solution to these down times, it will become economically challenging to do so, as the mined volume of those fuel sources — coal and gas — declines.
Additionally, technologies like hydrogen, vehicle batteries, nuclear, and hydro will be needed to fill in the weak spots. If we do figure out how to limit our political squabbling and build intra- and international transmission, we will achieve maximum renewable energy resource utilization.
If we do find that “oversizing” wind and solar deployment beyond currently defined standard system sizing is in fact the best way to size things, then the word “oversize” is a misnomer.
When these projects are generating electricity in amounts greater than the power grid’s demand, entrepreneurial spirits and asset owners no doubt will seek ways to make better use of these resources.
Generally, it would not make sense to place expensive hardware — such as hydrogen electrolyzers or bitcoin mining rigs — at renewable generation project sites to run “only” when the sites are overproducing.
It would make sense, however, to place energy-hungry industries near renewable generation, with the intention to run on both grid power and on summertime peak generation power which otherwise would have been curtailed. In this way, we can bring down average electricity prices for these facilities, and create a valuable resource out of necessary, seasonal excess.

The award represents just under one-third of all capacity awarded under year two of the solar pilot program. It also represents a greater than five-times increase in projects and a more than doubling of capacity for the company, compared to what it was awarded in the first year of the statewide program.
In year one, Solar Landscape was awarded eight community solar projects totaling 20 MW in capacity, with half of all available capacity being reserved for primarily for low- and middle-income (LMI) New Jersey residents.
The community solar program is administered by New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program. It provides access to solar energy through a subscription-based model.
To date, Solar Landscape has completed seven of the eight community solar projects approved in the first year. It said it expects to finish the final installation by the end of the year. The seventh community solar installation, located in North Bergen, will have a capacity of greater than 2 MW and is scheduled to be energized Friday, November 5.
Solar Landscape’s community solar installations are installed on the roofs of large warehouses and distribution centers. Earlier this year, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed into law A3352, which requires all new warehouses in the state to be solar-ready buildings.
Warehouse sprawl has become a big issue in the Garden State. A survey conducted by Newmark, a commercial real estate advisory firm, found the aggregate area of leased warehouse space in the northern and central parts of the state grew by 11.1 million square feet in the first quarter of 2021. Alongside this, South Jersey has become a hotspot for construction.
Efforts are also being made to ensure that new warehouses in New Jersey not be developed on environmentally sensitive areas such as sensitive farmland and near residential areas, due to concerns over stormwater runoff, traffic congestion, and increased pollution.
At the time of A3352’s passage, Megan Steele, communications coordinator for the Sierra Club New Jersey Chapter, proposed that the legislation could be used to expand community solar programs for low- and moderate-income families by opening up warehouse projects to these customers, exactly what Solar Landscape set out to do.

According to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA’s) Annual Electric Generator Report, most utility-scale (greater than 1 MW of capacity) battery storage applications perform several roles depending on revenue opportunities or system support requirements.
The most commonly cited use case for batteries is frequency response, a service that maintains grid frequency as close to 60 Hz as possible. EIA said that batteries are well suited for this service because their output does not require any startup time and batteries can quickly absorb surges. At the end of 2020, 885 MW of battery storage capacity (59% of total utility-scale battery capacity) cited frequency response as a use case.

At the end of 2020, some 583 MW of battery storage capacity (39% of total) cited ramping or spinning reserve as a use case. Spinning reserve is a set of ancillary services in which generators respond to system disruptions, such a sudden loss of generation or a rapid change in demand. Regions that have a relatively high proportion of electricity generation from sources such as solar and wind tend to require resources that can respond quickly.

EIA said that arbitrage is a strategy of buying electricity during low price periods and selling during high price periods. Battery storage supports this by charging when power prices are low and discharging when prices are high. This use case increased by 390 MW from 2019 to 2020, the greatest capacity increase among use cases, EIA said. At the end of 2020, some 586 MW of battery storage capacity (37% of total) was used for arbitrage.
Finally, EIA said that load following is an operating strategy in which generators change their output to match changes in electric demand, or load. Batteries are used for load following because their output can be digitally controlled and can respond to load changes with less stress than mechanical systems. Nearly 400 MW of battery storage capacity was used for load following in 2020.
