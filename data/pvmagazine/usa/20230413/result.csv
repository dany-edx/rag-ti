https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/13/california-utilities-commission-rejects-solar-microgrid-proposal/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 13, 2023",California utilities commission rejects solar microgrid proposal,"Last September, a new proposal came across the desk of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) as Energy-as-a-service provider Sunnova Energy announced it applied to install a “micro utility” on a new homes community.
The company seeks to develop largely self-sustaining micro utilities by equipping new home communities with solar and storage. Under the plan, new home construction communities are selected so that Sunnova can work closely with developers to design and implement distributed solar microgrids backed with energy storage.
Microgrids, which connect solar, energy storage, and smart appliances, come with a bouquet of benefits like localized backup power and resilience, insulation from volatile utility rates, and a more efficient use of energy by connecting what would otherwise be stranded assets.
Sunnova filed a formal request for a certificate to construct and operate microgrids under Section 2780 and Section 1001, respectively, of the California Public Utilities Code. The microgrids would be capped at 2,000 connected homes.
In February, the Public Advisor’s Office suggested CPUC reject the application.
A large coalition of industry advocates and environmentalists, called the Microgrid Resources Coalition (MRC), filed a response to the PAO’s suggested rejection. “We believe that the Proposed Decision, if adopted, would become the latest in a long line of decisions in which the Commission does a disservice to the citizens of California by ignoring the contribution that distributed generation, and microgrids in particular, can make to resolving the state’s ongoing crisis of grid inadequacy.”
This April, the CPUC moved forward with a rejection of Sunnova’s application.
Sunnova, dissatisfied with the result, argued that there is not enough time for a rulemaking process to approve microgrids.
“The fact is that we are closing in rapidly on five years since the enactment of SB 1399 and not only has the widespread deployment of microgrids envisioned by the statute not materialized, but the Commission has not taken the necessary actions which would enable it to start materializing,” said the Solar Energy Industries Association in a filing with the CPUC.
Nutting said at this rate, rulemaking processes could push out to as late as 2030. Solar is now required by law on new home constructions in California, at a time the state is embroiled in a housing crisis. This delay results in what Nutting views as a missed opportunity for Californians to have more affordable and more reliable power.
Monopoly
A CPUC representative contacted pv magazine, explaining the rejection, “The Sunnova application sought to provide microgrid power as a monopoly public utility. It sought significant changes in how the state defines the roles and obligations of a public utility. The Public Advocates Office believes that changes of this magnitude are best addressed a rulemaking rather than a one-off application.”
Sunnova pushed back on the argument that it would be establishing a monopoly.
“I find this accusation a somewhat odd,” said Meghan Nutting, executive vice president, regulatory and government affairs in a pv magazine interview. “Californians must take service from a utility if they are in investor-owned utility territory. This microutility application provides customers with an alternative to the monopoly.”
What’s more, on the same day the Sunnova application was rejected CPUC approved a $200 million program for the major investor-owned utilities to run their own microgrid programs.
“It is interesting because that is, in fact, a cost shift. The non-participating rate payers will have to contribute to that $200 million, that the utilities will then have to build the microgrids. Then [investor-owned utilities] will receive a rate of return for any money they spend to build them, causing another cost shift onto nonparticipants,” said Nutting.
The cost shift argument was the lynchpin in justifying NEM 3.0, a rulemaking that slashed compensation rates for residential solar owners exporting excess production to the grid. NEM 3.0 was supported by the major investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric, and heavily opposed by California citizens, solar industry members, and environmentalists. Despite an apparent cost shift from the new investor-owned utility microgrid program, CPUC sided with the utilities in the Sunnova microgrid filing.
Microgrids are a new concept for the power grid that recognizes the strengths of the input (solar energy), building the grid in a decentralized, distributed fashion. This leads to increased resilience in adverse conditions, less transmission bottlenecks and congestion costs, decreases land use or “energy sprawl”, lessens utility monopoly control over a territory, and significantly reduces the need for transmission buildout, relying only on the local distribution grid.
In its 2021 to 2022 transmission plan, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) announced 23 transmission projects at an estimated cost of $2.9 billion. A significant portion of these costs could be avoided if California instead pivoted to a decentralized model of energy.
Delays
New home communities in California also struggle with interconnection delays from utilities, a process that can take many months to years. Nutting said that some developers in Humboldt County have reported interconnection processing timelines as long as ten years.
The problem is bad enough that California state senator Scott Wiener has introduced Senate Bill 83, which would assess fines on utilities that do not approve grid connection applications in a timely manner. The law would require investor-owned utilities to complete interconnection within eight weeks after a building is “green tagged,” meaning local officials have inspected construction work and approved the project to be processed for interconnection.
“It’s completely unacceptable for completed projects to just sit there gathering dust because PG&E can’t get it together to turn on the power,” said Wiener. “We’re in the middle of a housing crisis.”
Undeterred
Despite the rejected application, Nutting said Sunnova is “undeterred” in its commitment to advancing distributed clean energy in California.
While the rejection was not the result the company had hoped for, there were some silver linings in CPUC’s decision. First, it removed an earlier-issued rulemaking on microgrids that prohibited proposals like Sunnova’s. It also removed a footnote that had deemed that Sunnova did not qualify as a microutility. The decision also highlighted the strong support industry-wide for microgrid buildout in the state.
“In the face of this disappointing decision, we remain resolute in our commitment to developing innovative energy services and solutions that enhance grid stability and provide affordable and reliable energy for customers in California,” said Nutting. “As utility rates continue to soar and grid instability worsens, the end user bears the brunt of the consequences, and the urgency of this reality is not lost on us. As we move forward from here, we will continue to work tirelessly on future applications to advocate for consumer choice and to push for a more competitive energy market that prioritizes the needs of the people over the interests of monopolistic utilities.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/13/how-many-solar-panels-would-have-been-needed-to-power-the-death-star/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"APRIL 13, 2023",How many solar panels would have been needed to power the Death Star?,"From pv magazine Global
With the race on to eliminate carbon emissions from the world’s energy systems, solar power has long since been accepted as having made the transition from an energy source of the future to a mainstream option.
But, with an eye on solar’s history of deployment on space missions – combined with an enthusiasm for big screen classics – the folks at West Yorkshire-based PV installer Solar Fast have put their heads together to have a stab at estimating how many 400 W panels would be needed to power the technology in some of our favorite on-screen moments.
Let’s start with the world’s most famous DeLorean.
“Great Scott, Marty, we need 1.21 GW!”
That’s the kind of energy you were only going to find in a bolt of lightning in 1955 – at least in a small town in the US.
The 1.21 GW weren’t to power the car itself, of course, they were needed to kick-start the nuclear reaction in the flux capacitor (see Busted’s forthcoming UK tour for more details).
That means Doc would have needed 3.025 million 400 W panels set up in Hill Valley’s main street to get Marty back to 1985 in sustainable fashion, not to mention a fair wedge of batteries, given Marty was travelling at 10:04 p.m.
Solar finds a way
By contrast, the task of juicing up the electric fences needed to keep Jurassic Park’s velociraptors at bay would be much more achievable.
With the fences charged to deliver 10,000 V, and with agricultural electric fences today able to reach that level and use a single energizer to power 14 km, we reckon you’d need only nine panels to power the 80 miles of fencing on Isla Nublar. None of which solves the problem of grasping employees switching them off, of course.
As far as Star Wars’ Death Star is concerned, the member of Solar Fast staff who tried to work out how much energy would be required to power the planet-destroying laser had to be taken for a lie down in a darkened room so we reined in our ambition and instead looked at the load required to simply keep the lights on.
I am your … installer
Wikipedia authoritatively states the Death Star has 85 levels and 257 sub-levels with more than 2 million staff occupying a floor space of 120km x 120km for a volume of roughly 9.05e14m3.
If we estimate around 101.76 billion 100 W lights bulbs would be needed, that’s more than 25.4 billion panels needed on the surface of a spaceship upon which windows appear to have been at a premium, although, Darth Vader would probably have been quite handy at securing a bulk purchase discount.
Staying with space opera, we pondered how many panels would be needed to power the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D Federation Galaxy-class starship captained by Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Now there’s a chap likely to be on board with the energy transition.
The Treknology website informs us “Warp drive in Star Trek works by annihilating matter (in the form of deuterium, a kind of hydrogen gas) and antimatter in a fusion reaction mediated by dilithium crystals. This produces the enormous power required to warp space-time and drive the ship faster than light.” But y’all knew that already, right?
With the potential to produce 2.5 PW of energy – to get the ship to warp 9 – and 2.5 million panels needed per gigawatt of output, the Enterprise would have needed 6.25 trillion panels.
How about, then, the Ghostbusters’ proton packs, desired by every kid attending a fancy dress party in 1984 and enjoying a renaissance since their appearance in Netflix smash Stranger Things?
The GBFans.com website informs us each pack was powered by Curium-246 and needs 1.5 MW to trap a Focused, Non-Terminal Repeating Phantasm or a Class 5 Full-Roaming Vapor.
With that kind of load, each pack would have needed 3,750 of our panels to get going but we’re confident Egon would have trimmed the number by using batteries and having a decent rooftop system installed at the station.
Genius, billionaire, playboy, solar champion?
The Proton Pack requirement is considerably less than what’s needed to fire up the arc reactor that powers Tony Stark’s Iron Man suit and just think, it had gone through 42 designs by the third film, all apparently powered by a domestic socket!
As Stark says during his big screen debut, “If my math is right – and it always is – three gigajoules per second” is the load required. That would equate to 3 GW of generation capacity and, therefore, 7.5 million panels.
Still, if anyone would be able to rise to a technical engineering challenge like that, it would be our man Tony, although, given it’s a palladium-powered fusion power source, maybe Stark Industries wouldn’t have been the most likely candidate to be pursuing solar power.
And don’t get us started on the subject of the reputational damage recent Daniel Craig whodunnit Glass Onion has caused to the green hydrogen industry. That’s a whole ‘nother debate entirely.

The funds are expected to help the company meet rising demand for its solar and storage loan program.
The funding round was led by HASI, and Crédit Agricole CIB, two leading climate and sustainability investors. The financing vehicle will acquire loans made to SunPower customers and is non-recourse to the company.
SunPower’s loan programs offer residential customers 25-year terms to secure a more predictable cost for electricity when compared with volatile utility rates. The company launched SunPower Financial in 2021, and its loan business grew 99% year-over-year in 2022. With a SunPower project, installation, design, sales, financing and warranty are all provided by one entity.
“Among our leading value propositions is full consumer choice when it comes to how our customers purchase our solar and storage systems. We continue to build and strengthen our suite of world-class financing products to meet growing demand. This new transaction also illustrates the health and resilience of consumer credit markets during the recent period of shifting conditions,” said Guthrie Dundas, SunPower interim chief financial officer.
SunPower said it is also a leader in solar lease financing. The company said it sees opportunity to participate in the Energy Community tax credit carve-out created by the Inflation Reduction Act, which adds a 10% credit on top of the 30% base Investment Tax Credit. Guidance has recently been released by the Treasury department on how to qualify for this credit adder. 
(Read: “SunPower solar to top three multi-family buildings in California”)
“The new guidance is a great opportunity to ensure many more Americans receive the critical bill savings and job growth benefits residential solar and battery storage provide,” said Jason MacRae, executive vice president of financial products, SunPower. “We continue to work with our financing partners to grow SunPower’s lease financing facilities in anticipation of continued strong customer demand, which is further boosted by this bonus credit.”
Business activities
SunPower has continued to evolve its customer offerings over the last year. In September, the company introduced two new batteries for residential energy storage applications. The two devices, called SV-BASE13-C and SV-BASE19.5-C, respectively are part of the company’s Sunvault energy storage series.
“With this launch, SunVault is now available in five configurations: 13 kWh, 19.5 kWh, 26 kWh, 39 kWh and 52 kWh. Some of these options include multiple inverters,” it said in a statement released.
Also in September, SunPower announced it partnered with retailer giant IKEA to offer its solutions in select California IKEA stores.
Members of the IKEA Family customer loyalty program will have in-store access to four custom designed SunPower solar packages, which all include a SunPower Equinox solar system, a 25-year warranty for power, product and labor, and a 10-year monitoring warranty. IKEA U.S. customers will work directly with SunPower to access its energy solutions, which contain all the products, services, and warranties that customers will need. 
Last May, the company released SunPower One, a holistic energy management system designed to interface with home solar arrays, battery energy storage systems, as well as the full set of energy loads in the home, including heating and cooling, appliances, lighting, and more.
The platform takes a step beyond monitoring the system, proactively advising homeowners on ways to optimize their energy usage. It is capable of recognizing patterns of electricity consumption and suggests further actions for energy bill savings.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/13/50-states-of-solar-incentives-idaho/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,IDAHO",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 13, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Idaho,"Idaho has much wide-open space as it ranks the 13th least populous and 7th least densely populated of the 50 states. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2021 Idaho generated 74% of its electricity from renewable sources, the fourth highest share of any state after Vermont, South Dakota and Washington. Idaho’s primary energy source is hydropower, the reason given by the EIA for the state having the lowest electricity rates in the country. The state gets only 4.12% of its electricity generation from solar.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Idaho has 644 MW of installed solar, or enough to power about 83,000 homes. It’s ranked 29th in the country for solar, up from 38th in 2022, and SEIA expects another 890 MW to be added in the next five years.
Solar incentives
For homeowners shopping for solar in Idaho, there are a few incentives and programs that can make it an attractive investment. First, all residential solar installations in the U.S. qualify for the 30% investment tax credit, eligible for all final installed system costs. For those who don’t have the tax liability, they can take the credit as a direct payment.
Idaho does not have a statewide net-metering policy, but each of the three investor-owned utilities has a net-metering tariff on file with the Public Utilities Commission. Net energy metering (NEM) is a process in which solar owners send their excess daytime production to the grid in exchange for credit on their utility bill, covering nighttime and cloudy day energy use. The process has been instrumental in launching distributed rooftop solar across the United States, helping homeowners secure a more resilient source of energy while saving on bills.
The net metering offerings of three utilities,  Avista Utilities, Idaho Power and Rocky Mountain Power, are similar, offering: net metering to customers that generate “clean” electricity through solar, wind, hydropower, biomass or fuel cells; net metering is limited to 0.1% of its retail peak demand in a baseline year; residential systems are limited to 25 kW; and the customer is restricted from generating more than 20% of such peak production.
Slashing rates
In November 2022, private investor-owned utility, Idaho Power, announced plans to slash net metering rates for rooftop solar by as much as 60%, an unfortunate trend with ongoing NEM rulemaking cases in California and Florida, as more utilities continue to push the idea that local, distributed clean energy causes grid issues and cross-subsidization of the rich by the poor. These concepts have been debunked in California, and now an independent study of the Idaho energy market appears to have found critical issues with Idaho Power’s analysis of the value of rooftop solar.
“Idaho Power’s study fails to quantify important benefits of distributed solar that are known and measurable, will impact rates, and will benefit Idaho ratepayers and citizens,” said the report.
Idaho Power’s internal study determined that excess power generated by rooftop solar owners is worth 2.8 to 4 cents per kWh, while an independent study by Crossborder Energy determined that same energy is worth nearly five times that value at 18.3 cents per kWh. Currently, net metered rooftop solar is paid at the retail rate of energy, about 8 to 10 cents per kWh.
“This study shows what many of us already expected, that Idaho Power would use a biased approach to protect its own interests of owning and profiting from solar power,” said Lisa Young, director of the Idaho chapter of the Sierra Club. “Regulators need to step up here and make sure Idahoans interested in rooftop solar have a chance to produce their own affordable, clean energy.”
A positive trend in favor of rooftop solar are bills that state that homeowner’s associations (HOA) may keep residents from installing solar. In 2019, HB 158 was passed in Idaho, which says that HOAs may not limit or prohibit the installation of solar panels or collectors on any property rooftop or structure within its jurisdiction. They may, however, enforce reasonable rules regarding appearance of the panels.
Landmark installation
The 108 MW Grand View Solar Two in Grand View, Idaho was developed by Clenera and built by Swinerton. Clenera is a privately-held renewable energy company headquartered in Boise, Idaho that acquires, develops, builds and manages utility-scale solar farms and energy storage facilities throughout the U.S. The facility, which came online in 2016, sits on 670 acres of farmland in Elmore County and produces enough electricity to power nearly 17,000 homes. Backed by a 20-year power purchase agreement with Idaho Power, it was among the first utility-scale projects to be brought online in Idaho.

TrendForce says in a new report that the top six module manufacturers in 2022 shipped around 205 GW to 211 GW of solar modules, accounting for 76% to 78% of 270 GW of module demand last year.
All of the main manufacturers are based in China. Longi Solar took the first spot with 45 GW to 47 GW, followed by Trina Solar with around 43 GW and JinkoSolar with 42 GW to 43 GW. JA Solar came in fourth with 39.75 GW, followed by Canadian Solar with 21.1 GW, and Risen Energy with 16 GW.
High-power, large-format modules dominated the market last year, according to TrendForce. With advancements in n-type technology, 210 mm products have already become mainstream and will continue to rule the market, said the research firm.
As of the first quarter of 2023, cumulative shipments of 210 mm modules have exceeded 120 GW, and the power of 210 mm n-type modules has surpassed 700 W. TrendForce estimates that large-format wafers, cells, and modules will account for more than 90% of the total production capacity, with 210 mm modules accounting for nearly 60% of the total production capacity.
The market share of large-format wafers might increase from 83.45% in 2022 to 95.74% in 2023, according to TrendForce.
“In 2023, the production capacity for large-format wafers will hit 792.4 GW, showing a stronger tendency toward larger formats, while 210 mm wafer production capacity will hit 320.8 GW, increasing by 74.6%, with a market share of 38.76%,” it said in a statement.
As for cells, large-format units will reportedly reach 822.3 GW in 2023, or 94.99% of the total capacity. The market share of 210 mm cells may reach 67.9%, with a capacity of 587.75 GW, an 83.7% increase from 2022.
On the module front, large-format PV panels may reach 767 GW with a market share of around 90%, TrendForce said.
“Among them, 210 mm module capacity will reach 508 GW, a 68.14% increase from 2022, with a market share of 59.62%, indicating continued strong growth,” it concluded.
