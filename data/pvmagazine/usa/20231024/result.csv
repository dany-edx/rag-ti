To qualify for the IRA’s full 30% base tax credit, projects with a grid connection exceeding one megawatt must pay all employees the prevailing wage.
Although prevailing wage rates aren’t equivalent to union wages in most markets, they serve to narrow the wage gap between standard labor rates and union benchmarks.
The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA), and the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) have signed a national tri-trade solar agreement. The agreement specifies the roles of each union in utility-scale solar projects across the United States, California excluded.
The IBEW spokesman told pv magazine USA that details about individual tasks each group performs is available via local union contacts. The IUOE will focus on foundational work such as driving piles and ground screws, while LUINA will handle the deployment of racking solutions. The IBEW will handle the final stages of the projects, which includes installing the solar panels as well as completing electrical balance of system work, such as wiring and inverters.
The IBEW spokesperson added that the unions have also ironed out language regarding staffing. If one group lacks the necessary labor force, the other unions will provide the required team members to complete the project.
The unions told pv magazine USA, that when it comes to the pricing of installation services, “We believe that in most cases, not just under the right circumstances, our wage mix under this agreement will beat the pricing of the nonunion sectors.”
Beyond the solar industry, the IRA has extended its benefits to other unionized sectors. The Vineyard Wind project, under construction off the Massachusetts coast, forged a labor agreement with the Southeastern Massachusetts Building Trades Council, committing to employ 500 union members.
Recently, Vineyard Wind faced criticism from the International Longshoremen’s Association Local 1413 (ILA) for failing to uphold its promise to hire both Black and local workers. New employment contracts were signed a week after the allegations.
Separate from the IRA’s tax benefits, auto workers successfully negotiated a union contract for a GM-owned battery plant. While the IRA doesn’t directly fund car battery facilities, it does subsidize the vehicles in which these batteries are installed.

Located in the Mojave Desert community of Newberry Springs, Calif., the clean energy facility is located adjacent to the decommissioned Coolwater gas-fired power plant.
“This is exactly the sort of innovation and big thinking that California needs, repurposing old fossil fuel infrastructure to build one of the biggest solar and battery projects in the country,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “With projects like this, we’ll achieve a 100% clean electric grid and drastically cut pollution to combat climate change – all while creating good-paying jobs.”
The solar installation uses JA Solar modules on Nextracker’s Horizon trackers.  In August, Clearway announced a volume commitment agreement of 2 GW of solar trackers from Nextracker, to be delivered over the next three years. The U.S.-made trackers are expected to supply a portion of Clearway’s solar development pipeline across 17 states.
The Daggett facility is being completed in three stages. The battery energy storage system (BESS) in the first two phases are 280 MW and 4 hours duration, which brings them to 1120 MWh. All three BESS phases of Daggett are 394 MW in total, which brings the total to 1576 MWh. The final 113.5 MW battery storage portion, which is separately contracted with an investment-grade rated utility offtaker, is slated to reach commercial operations in 2025. The lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) batteries are being supplied by Wärtsilä. Blattner supplied EPC services, while Clearway will provide ongoing operations and maintenance (O&M).
Clearway partnered with I.B.E.W. Local 477, creating over 500 union jobs during construction. The project will sustain over a dozen onsite full-time jobs and will continue to support local institutions such as the Silver Valley High School and Alternative Education Center, the Silver Valley Fire Alliance, and the local Chambers of Commerce.
Daggett Solar + Storage is expected to generate enough electricity to power more than 181,000 homes and will create up to $18.5 million in local tax revenue and $5 million in spending annually during operations.
The solar and storage assets are contracted with six load serving entities, including Clean Power Alliance, Constellation, East Bay Community Energy soon to be rebranded as Ava Community Energy, MCE, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), and Southern California Public Power Authority (SCPPA).
“The Daggett 2 Project will provide SCPPA with its first bundled renewable energy and energy storage project to reach commercial operation by supplying 65MWac of solar capacity and a 33MWac/132MWh battery energy storage system to our growing renewable and energy storage resource mix,” commented Michael Webster, executive Director of SCPPA.
San Francisco-based Clearway Energy Group owns and operate more than 8 GW of renewable and conventional energy assets in the U.S. The company estimates that its 5.6 GW of wind, solar and energy storage assets offset the equivalent of more than 10.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions.

Japan’s Panasonic has unveiled the Interios 1.5 Ton Central Heat Pump, a central heat pump system for residential space heating and cooling.
The new product comes in two versions: the Interios Low-Carbon, Hybrid Heating System with an outdoor heat pump unit and an indoor cased A-Coil, and the Interios All-Electric Central Heat Pump System, which is an all-electric system featuring an outdoor heat pump unit and an all-electric air handler.
“Interios is a game-changer in the heating pump revolution, with technology that allows homebuilders and renovators alike to deliver high performance projects easily and affordably,” the company said in a statement, claiming that the novel heat pump offers up to 300% greater efficiency and potentially 30% energy savings than conventional gas and propane heating systems.
The indoor unit measures 534 mm x 445 mm x 1143 mm, weighing 48 kg, with a cooling and heating capacity of 18,000 BTU and R410A refrigerant. At -15 C, the heat pump offers 11,000 BTU of capacity. It also features a Computational Constant Airflow function that automatically detects static pressure issues due to blocked coils, dirty filters, and duct kinks through an advanced algorithm.
“The electronically commutated motor (ECM reacts to these conditions, adjusting the output power and fan speeds to ensure optimized airflow,” the company said. “The heat pump unit is able to precisely receive and process signals from the communicating air handler to manage the air temperature and airflow inside a home and maintain them at the most comfortable level.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/24/california-proposes-blatant-seizure-of-property-in-solar-ruling/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 24, 2023",California proposes “blatant seizure of property” in solar ruling,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is soon to vote on a proposed decision that is expected to be harmful to the value of rooftop solar for renters in multifamily housing, farms, and schools.
The decision would disallow residents of multi-meter properties to consume their own rooftop solar production, even if they own the solar array. The policy forces customers to first sell their solar production to the utility, and then buy it back at higher rates.
“The CPUC is proposing a blatant seizure of property,” said the Solar Rights Alliance.
California’s existing Virtual Net Metering and Net Energy Metering Aggregation programs allow properties with multiple meters to install a single solar array for the entire property, sharing one system’s electricity and associated net metering credits with all customers and meters on the property. The proposed decision states that these customers should be limited in how much of their own solar production they can use, even if it is stored in their own battery.
“It would force customers in multi-meter properties—such as renters, small farmers, schools, and colleges—to sell all of their generation to the utility at low rates and buy it back at full retail rates,” said the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA).
“Under this scheme, [multi-meter customers] would lose all of the savings that single-family homeowners get,” said Solar Rights Alliance.
The decision to not let multi-meter properties consume electricity from a system they own and operate comes with a clear motive: profit protection. If a rooftop solar owner is using their own electricity, they aren’t buying it from the utility.
The proposed decision is gaining public infamy similar to the NEM 3.0 decision that has wreaked havoc on single-family rooftop solar in California. Despite round after round of anti-NEM 3.0 public comments and rallies that drew in thousands of California citizens, CPUC pushed the decision forward. Now, residential solar is experiencing a massive market contraction nationwide as a result.
The NEM 3.0 decision was backed by the three major investor-owned utilities in California based on a rationale that renters were being left behind by lucrative single-family home installations. Now a year later, CPUC and the three large utilities are coming after renters’ rights.
While the NEM 3.0 outcome was undesirable for California citizens, the many months of protest did bear some positive results. CPUC attempted to pass a similar invasion of personal property in NEM 3.0, disallowing customers from directly using their rooftop solar electricity generation and instead forcing them to cycle it through the utility’s meter first. Protest and public comment forced CPUC to throw out the decision, and instead implement an 80% cut in net metering payment rates.
“However, if the CPUC takes away the fundamental solar right for renters, there’s no doubt they will try again for homeowners at some point,” said Solar Rights Alliance.
Solar Rights Alliance is sounding the alarm for renters, farmers, and affordable housing advocates to voice their opinion on the proposed decision, which was recently pushed forward to November 2.
The organization has details on how to submit public comments and speak with legislators here.

The announced projects include three offshore wind and 22 land-based renewable energy projects including hydropower and solar energy. The combined projects are expected to deliver enough clean energy to power 2.6 million New York homes, meeting approximately 12% of the state’s electricity needs. In addition to offshore wind projects, the land-based project include 14 new solar facilities, six wind repowering projects, one new wind project, and one return-to-service hydroelectric project.
The largest of the solar projects is actually not located in New York, but the electricity produced will feed the New York grid. The 401.6 MW Mineral Basin Solar facility will be built by Swift Current Energy in the Townships of Girard and Goshen, Penn.
The next largest solar facility will be the 200 MW Hemlock Ridge Solar project to be built by AES in towns of Barre and Shelby, Orleans County.
Other solar projects, by region, include:
Central New York
Finger Lakes
Mohawk Valley
North Country
Southern Tier
Western New York
The historic announcement moves New York further toward its goal for 70% of the state’s electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030, on the path to a zero-emission grid as required by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Following these awards, New York will now have enough operating, contracted, and under development renewable energy projects to supply 79% of the state’s 2030 electricity needs with renewable energy.
In the announcement the Governor emphasized that these projects will bring high-quality jobs to the state, plus nearly $300 million in commitments to Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises (MWBEs) and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses (SDVOBs).
Clean energy generated by all the announced facilities is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 9.4 million metric tons annually, or the equivalent of taking more than 2 million cars off the road every year. Public health benefits will result from reduced exposure to harmful pollutants. The announcement also includes over $3.5 billion in commitments to disadvantaged communities made by developers.
