In 2023, that growth continued, though more modestly than some years past. Wood Mackenzie reported a 24% growth in installations through the first three quarters of 2023. Supply chain constraints of 2022 eased, and California had a big surge in installations from customers looking to secure legacy NEM 2.0 rates. Below are four rooftop solar trends that pv magazine USA reported this year.
High interest rates
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates to highs not seen in many years in an attempt to stamp down sharply rising inflation. This was a particular challenge to rooftop solar, as many companies rely on loans to provide solar equipment to their customers.
High interest rates put pressure on solar financiers to either raise interest rates on loans or assess upfront dealer fees. In both cases, these changes squeezed the value offered to customers, leading to a tough year for solar company stock valuations and a slowdown in installations.
High utility rates
Though financing a solar project has gotten more expensive, so too have utility rates, placing another factor in the “why you should go solar” bucket. In California, electricity rates have exploded over the past three years, far outpacing inflation. Another 13% utility rate hike is pegged for California in 2024.
This has led to a shift in thinking about the benefit of solar plus storage. While customers often focus on payback periods or return on investment (ROI), this can be exceedingly difficult to calculate under shifting assumptions of utility electric rates.
Instead, solar installers are focusing the discussion on solar plus batteries being a hedge against unpredictable electricity rates, which have continued to rise sharply nationwide. While solar and storage shoppers typically use a rule of thumb of about 3% to 4% annual rate increases from the utility company to estimate long-term savings, double-digit rate hikes are common now. Where will your electric rate be in 25 years?
Policy blunders
There have been numerous policy changes across the U.S., many of which have cut the value of net metering, or the process by which solar customers export excess solar generation to the grid in exchange for credits.
Net metering has been critical in launching U.S. rooftop solar, and while net metered solar rates need to account for the utility’s cost to operate transmission lines, solar advocates argue that cuts to net metered rates went down far too much, far too fast.
This prime example of this is in California, where the sudden slash of about 80% of net metering value led to an 80% drop in installations in the following months. The California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) said over 17,000 jobs have been lost as a result.
Virtual power plants
Rooftop solar is evolving. In many markets across the U.S., with net metering being actively being phased out, standalone solar arrays cannot capture the same value as they had in the past.
Home battery energy storage systems are increasingly being attached with rooftop solar to ensure homeowners can store and consume their locally produced clean energy, avoiding peak demand charges that occur in the afternoon.
However, solar-plus-battery systems can do more than just store and self-consume power in a day-to-night cycle. These distributed energy resources can work in concert, along with HVAC systems and home appliances, to smooth out demand across the grid, creating more stability in electricity markets, and eliminating the supply and demand imbalance phenomenon known as the “duck curve.”
Programs that coordinate these distributed resources are often referred to as virtual power plants (VPP). By participating in a VPP, rooftop solar and battery customers can leverage their resources and get paid by a VPP administrator.
In California, customers are paid up to $100 to $250 annually for enrolling their batteries in PG&E demand response programs. In Long Island, New York, PSEG customers are paid up to $6,250 upfront for enabling their battery to be leveraged by the utility during ten peak demand events throughout the year.
Looking ahead
In 2024, some of the heavy headwinds like high interest rates are expected to partially subside. Manufacturers and distributors will attempt to clear out excess channel inventories created by the dip in demand.
“I feel that 2024 will be a year of recovery,” said Raghu Belur, co-founder and chief of products at Enphase Energy in an interview with pv magazine USA. “I don’t see the market getting worse, but I don’t see it getting dramatically better. We won’t be back to the 2022-type growth. That will probably take an extra year. But 2024 you see things starting to turn around and slowly recover.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/22/insurer-75-of-california-solar-companies-are-high-risk-more-bankruptcy-on-the-way/,"BANKRUPTCY,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 22, 2023","Insurer: 75% of California rooftop solar companies are high risk, more bankruptcy on the way","A year ago, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved NEM 3.0, a rulemaking decision implemented in April 2023 that slashed compensation for exported rooftop solar generation by roughly 80%.
Now, several months after implementation, the effects of NEM 3.0 have become clear. Utility interconnection queues show an 80% drop in installation applications. The California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) reported that nearly 17,000 rooftop solar jobs, about 22% of the workforce, were lost this year as a result.
Solar Insure, which backs many installation companies in the state, told pv magazine USA that its data shows 75% of solar installers are now in the “high risk” category following CPUC’s decision to implement NEM 3.0.
“We have seen a wave of recent solar installer bankruptcies and believe another wave will come in Q1 2024,” said Ara Agopian, chief executive officer, Solar Insure.
Despite public protest and industry warnings of devastating effects, the CPUC ruled in favor of its private investor-owned utilities. These utilities pushed forward the assumptions of NEM 3.0 based on a call for equity and fairness, saying that renters were being left behind by rooftop solar. Not long after pushing the policy through, CPUC revealed the equity concerns were merely talk, and it moved through further rulemaking decisions that made it harder for renters reap the benefits of rooftop solar.
Thanks to the help of Governor Gavin Newsom’s appointed CPUC board, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), San Diego Gas and Electric’s parent conglomerate Sempra, and Southern California Edison (SCE), achieved the market conditions they desired. The three companies have a market cap of roughly $120 billion, and they have successfully fixed the market to punish small rooftop solar installers and support utility-scale development instead.
In a decision this week, the Court of Appeal of the First Appellate District reaffirmed CPUC’s decision to implement NEM 3.0, despite the bankruptcy and job loss data. CALSSA said this came as no surprise, as the 2013 legislation requiring a reevaluation of net metering and the CPUC rulemaking process itself has been “stacked against solar since the beginning.”
The devastating job losses, bankruptcies, and unabashed regulatory moat building around the profits of a hundred-billion-plus corporate beast calls into question the legislative foundations of Gavin Newsom’s appointed CPUC board. 
California’s electricity prices have exploded over the last three years, far outpacing inflation. Without rooftop solar as a thorn in its side, the state’s utilities can continue to reap profits in a de facto monopoly.
The market conditions have led to a rise in “grid defection,” where customers cut the cord and rely on their own solar assets to power their home. As solar equipment costs inherently go down over time, grid defection could represent an existential threat to private utilities. Current legislation makes it very difficult to defect from the grid, and CPUC’s pro-utility attitude could likely place this at risk for being legislated out in the future, further placing Californians at the mercy of rising utility prices.

The U.S.-based industrial conglomerate Johnson Controls introduced a water-to-water compound centrifugal heat pump intended for use in commercial buildings.
The York Cyk heat pump is designed for high-head conditions and can reportedly deliver high-temperature hot water as high as 170.6 F (77 C).
“The York Cyk can reduce water and operational costs by as much as 50% when compared to traditional boiler and chiller applications,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The new product is currently available in a small version with a 400-ton cooling capacity. It offers 1,406 kW if output for cooling and 2,051 kW for heating.
The company said the system has a combined coefficient of performance of 4.9. It may use either the R-1234ze or the R-515b refrigerants, which Johnson Controls said have ultra-low global warming potential (GWP).
The heat pump also features two electric motor-driven centrifugal compressors arranged in series and double bundle condenser technology that can cope with unbalanced load conditions, according to the company.
“The innovative design is compatible with existing high-temperature hot water heating systems, eliminating the need to replace air handlers and terminal heating devices, which is often required to accommodate the lower water temperatures associated with other heat pump products,” said the company.
Johnson Controls plans to launch a second version of the heat pump with a 2,000-ton cooling capacity and an output of 7,033 kW at an unspecified later stage.
“The York Cyk heat pump is ideal for medium to large commercial buildings, university campuses, hospitals, industrial processes and district energy applications and can be used in new building or retrofit applications,” it said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/22/clean-hydrogen-production-credit-rules-announced/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",Clean hydrogen production credit rules announced,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released proposed regulations on the Clean Hydrogen Production Credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
“Hydrogen has the potential to clean up America’s manufacturing industry, power the transportation sector and shore up our energy security all while delivering good-paying jobs and new economic opportunity to communities in every pocket of America, “ said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm.
Conventional hydrogen production typically results in significant climate pollution, which is why the Clean Hydrogen Production Credit is focused making hydrogen production with minimal pollution more economically competitive. The proposed regulations have safeguards to prevent the credit from subsidizing hydrogen production with higher lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than allowed by the statute.
The Treasury Department’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was developed after consultations with experts across the federal government, particularly the Department of Energy (DOE), which oversees Argonne National Lab’s administration of the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which administers the Clean Air Act.
The GREET model is tool that examines the life-cycle impacts of vehicle technologies, fuels, products, and energy systems, providing  a transparent platform through which energy and environmental effects of vehicle technologies and energy and product systems can be evaluated. For any given energy and vehicle system, the DOE reports that GREET can calculate total energy consumption (non-renewable and renewable), emissions of air pollutants, emissions of greenhouse gases, and water consumption.
The proposed regulations provide guidance based on the statute’s references to the Clean Air Act and the GREET model.
Four credit tiers
The IRA proposal establishes a Clean Hydrogen Production Credit with four technology-neutral credit tiers based on the emissions rate of a hydrogen production process. By meeting prevailing wage and registered apprenticeship requirements, the amount of the credit ranges from $.60 per kilogram (kg) of hydrogen produced to $3 per kg of hydrogen, depending on the lifecycle emissions of the hydrogen production.
Credit eligibility is to be determined under the Clean Air Act’s definition of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, including significant indirect emissions, through the point of production. The statute also requires that lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions be determined under the most recent GREET model. The credit is available for 10 years starting on the date that a hydrogen production facility is placed into service for projects that begin construction before 2033, meaning it will remain available for some facilities into the 2040s.
The NPRM is technology-neutral and describes how taxpayers must use the 45VH2-GREET model developed by Argonne National Laboratory to determine lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. The statute also requires that to claim the credit, a taxpayer must have production and sale, or use of clean hydrogen verified by a qualified, unrelated third party. For taxpayers unable to use the 45VH2-GREET model because their hydrogen production technology and/or feedstock is not included, those taxpayers may petition the Secretary of the Treasury for a provisional emissions rate analogous to the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate calculated using 45VH2-GREET.
Energy attribute certificates
The Treasury Department’s proposed rules describe how taxpayers may use energy attribute certificates (EACs), which demonstrate the purchase of clean power, to assess and document qualification for a particular credit tier. The proposed rules explain the three criteria that must be reflected in EACs being purchased by hydrogen producers claiming the tax credit:
Hydrogen produced with renewable natural gas
The proposed rules detail eligibility requirements for hydrogen production from landfill gas in certain circumstances. Treasury and IRS anticipate finalizing rules in which additional hydrogen production pathways using renewable natural gas (RNG) and fugitive methane, such as coal mine or coal bed methane, qualify and are seeking public comment on conditions for qualification while adhering to the standards in the statute.
Many in the industry have long been awaiting release of the 45V guidance, including the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). Ray Long, President and CEO of ACORE said his group is concerned that the proposed rule isn’t flexible enough and may not have the effect of jump-starting a hydrogen industry at scale.
“As our analysis with E3 [energy and environmental economics] demonstrated, an annual match accounting approach could help unleash America’s nascent clean hydrogen industry and accelerate our energy transition,” said Long. “ACORE will continue to work with the Administration throughout this comment period, and we remain hopeful the final rule ultimately released has the needed flexibility to support the scale and role that hydrogen can play in achieving our decarbonization goals.”
The NPRM also takes comment on important issues where Treasury anticipates providing further clarity and certainty in the final rules.  The NPRM will be open for public comment for 60 days once it is published in the Federal Register, and Treasury and the IRS will carefully consider comments before issuing final rules.

In many markets across the U.S., net metering is actively being phased out, meaning that standalone solar arrays aren’t able to capture meaningful value for sending their excess electricity production to the grid in exchange for credits on their bill.

“Home solar and batteries can play an essential role in maintaining grid operations and keeping electricity costs down for everyone,” said Aaron Nitzkin, executive vice president of solar at Citadel Roofing and Solar.
Take Enphase, for example, which just gained approval to enroll its home battery, the IQ Battery 5P, into VPP programs in three major markets. California PG&E customers, Long Island PSEG customers, and many other markets are all able to earn extra revenues from their clean energy assets. Here’s how they work:
California’s Pacific Gas & Electric utility runs an Emergency Load Reduction Program. Customers who enroll their batteries will earn $2 per kWh from PG&E for electricity stored in their batteries to reduce demand on the grid during peak load periods. The program’s demand response events are scheduled to occur during hot summer days between May and October, and last from one to five hours between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. Between 20 and 60 event hours will be scheduled during each “season.”
Homeowners can expect to earn between $100 to $250 per year, said PG&E. That equates to between $2,500 and $6,250 over a 25-year life of a rooftop solar array.
Long Island, New York’s PSEG utility offers a Battery Storage Rewards program. The program pays an upfront incentive from installers of at least $250 per kWh of usable battery capacity, with a cap of $6,250 per household. For example, homeowners with two IQ Battery 5Ps offering 10 kWh of usable capacity will receive an upfront discount of $2,500 from their Enphase installer as part of the program. In return for the upfront incentive, customers agree to let PSEG Long Island use the electricity in their batteries to reduce demand during peak electricity use periods about 10 times per year. Power sharing would occur automatically under the program.
“Grid services programs unlock more value for homeowners with batteries, which expand access to this critical technology,” said Michael Catizone, president and co-founder at Long Island Power Solutions, a leading solar installation company in New York. “As electrification increases and demand on the grid grows, we’re excited to expand deployments…”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/22/solcasts-solstice-forecast-long-term-trends-and-forecast/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",Solcast’s Solstice Forecast – Long term trends and forecast,"From pv magazine global
There are no holidays for solar production. As many cultures around the world prepare for a holiday season, the Solcast team has run a long-term analysis on historical average irradiance on Christmas day, and a look ahead at the forecasts for Europe and the US, using data from the Solcast API.
Christmas Day is just a few days after the Solstice, when the day is at its longest in the southern hemisphere and shortest in the northern hemisphere. This is the driving factor in the long-term average irradiance trends, where you can see much lower levels of total irradiance in the northern hemisphere.

 
Whilst the amount of irradiance available is based on the length of the day, long-term cloud patterns are also present in the data, which you can see on the western coasts of South America, Africa and Australia. Sub-tropical latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere see more easterly winds as the sub-tropical ridge pushes further south, keeping moisture offshore on the west coast and bringing more moisture and cloud to the east coasts.This year, much of the eastern US will receive below-average irradiance over Christmas, as an eastward-tracking low-pressure system brings rain and snow across the continent. However, the system likely won’t make it to the northeastern USA during the daytime,
leaving New England to see above-average irradiance. A high-pressure system following the rain and snow will bring sun to the Midwest and West Coast of the US, delivering average to above-average irradiance for the day.


Europe will see more variation than the US compared to long-term averages. Low-pressure systems in the North Sea will push westerly winds and Atlantic moisture across the British Isles, northern France and Germany. Further south, light winds and a high-pressure system
will keep skies clearer and sunnier than usual. This will feel like a typical December day, as the Mediterranean coast has relatively less cloudy winters than further north.

Particularly noticeable in the long-term average is the difference between Spain and Southern France, as the Pyrenees mountain range shields the Iberian peninsula from moist and cold northerly winds.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.
