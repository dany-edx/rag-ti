https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/16/the-largest-climate-and-energy-package-in-u-s-history-becomes-law/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 16, 2022",The largest climate and energy package in U.S. history becomes law,"President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 into law, marking the largest climate and energy spending package in U.S. history. Inside the massive energy, climate, and tax bill is $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is dedicated to supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience.
The IRA mandates a nationwide reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030. The policy package is also aimed at creating energy savings for Americans. The Biden Administration said 7.5 million more families will be able install solar on their roofs with a 30% tax credit, saving families approximately $9,000 over the life of the system or at least $300 per year. Families that take advantage of clean energy, efficiency, and electric vehicle tax credits will save more than $1000 a year, said the administration.
The spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes on the wealthiest Americans and corporations. The administration said 55 of the largest corporations paid $0 in taxes in 2020, and the top 1% of earners are estimated to avoid $160 million in taxes each year. By closing tax loopholes and placing a 15% minimum tax on the largest, most profitable corporations, the IRA is expected to save the U.S. over $124 billion over the next 10 years.

Solar energy is set to play a central role in the decarbonization and onshoring of U.S. energy. By 2030, it is estimated the IRA will lead to the installation of 950 million solar panels, 120,000 wind turbines, and 2,300 grid-scale battery plants.
“Americans can now rest assured that our leaders have acted to lower costs, strengthen American energy independence, and create hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs, all while combatting the damaging impacts of climate change. With the President’s signature, the solar industry stands ready to invest in our domestic manufacturing capacity, grow the solar workforce, and rapidly scale our clean energy deployment efforts. I look forward to continued collaboration with our leaders to ensure a brighter, more sustainable future,” said George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy, a leading utility-scale solar developer.
A key to this buildout is the ten-year extension of the Investment Tax Credit at 30% for commercial and residential projects, including those installed in 2022. For larger solar projects, above 1 MW, the tax credit is default at 6%. To be eligible for the additional 24%, laborers and mechanics installing the solar power projects must be paid prevailing wages. There are 10% adders for having a specified amount of domestic content in a project, another 10% for siting projects in specified locations, and additional credits for clean energy production.
“What an historic moment for our country! Sunrun applauds everyone in Congress and the Biden Administration who helped accomplish this major step forward for humanity. The Inflation Reduction Act will combat inflation, lower energy prices and help our country meet its climate goals. It will boost U.S. manufacturing, create millions of good-paying jobs, expand access and equity for those who need it most, and improve grid stability and resilience,” said Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun.
Domestic manufacturing provisions are central in this law. Production tax credits, roughly $30 billion, will be assigned to U.S. manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing. And, $10 billion in investment tax credits will be distributed for facilities that make EVs, wind turbines and solar panels.
The Defense Production Act holds $500 million for heat pumps and critical minerals processing, and $2 billion in grants will be used to improve existing auto manufacturing facilities to create clean vehicles like EVs and hybrids. Along with these funds, up to $20 billion will be available in clean vehicle manufacturing credits. About $2 billion will be given to national labs to accelerate breakthrough energy research.
“The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act by the U.S. House of Representatives is a victory for America. First, it represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to achieve energy security and to ensure that the fight against climate change is powered by solar technology that represents American values and principles and is produced here, at home. Second, it’s an opportunity to ensure that the benefit of this groundbreaking legislation is shared, creating jobs and economic value where needed most. And finally, it will facilitate the cycles of innovation necessary to ensure our country’s leadership in clean energy technology, ensuring that the next generation of solar technologies is developed and made by America,” said Mark Widmar, CEO of First Solar.
As a result of the IRA, researchers from Princeton University, Dartmouth College, Evolved Energy Research and Climate Impact Consulting noted in the Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT) that solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said the researchers.
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The Act would lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said the report.
Annual U.S. energy expenditures are expected to fall by at least 4% in 2030 under the act, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses and the industry.

APS serves 1.3 million homes and businesses across the state.
The agreement involves Generac’s Concerto distributed energy management system to aggregate and provide capacity. Additionally, Generac will provide advanced grid services, including voltage management, real power orchestration, fleet energy control, and targeted responses.
The partnership comes as a result of APS’s Distributed Demand-Side Resources Aggregation Tariff, which encourages customers to install smart technologies like solar and energy storage and energy-saving products.
Demand management and response is particularly important in Arizona, where extreme heat leads to air conditioning usage, thereby leading to high peak demand. Distributed battery energy storage is hailed for its ability to more efficiently distribute power, leading to a reduced need for reserve generation and transmission resources.
Generac will dispatch its scalable PWRcell batteries, which range from 3 battery modules for up to 9 kWh of capacity and 4.5 kW output, to a 6-module configuration providing up to 18 kWh of capacity and 9 kW output.
Under the partnership, Generac will aggregate residential energy from PWRcell batteries over a five-year term starting in January 2023. The aggregated energy will support both system-wide capacity via demand response events, as well as locational capacity on target system feeders. The network of batteries may also be able to provide additional services to the grid when otherwise available.
“APS is excited to work with companies like Generac Grid Services to connect residential customers with smart home batteries capable of dispatching dependable power and strengthening the APS grid,” said Kerri Carnes, manager of customer technology at APS. “…this is just one more way we are partnering with our customers to maintain service reliability and to maximize the clean energy benefits of solar-plus-storage systems in our service territory.”
“Along with delivering a DERMS software solution, Generac Grid Services is proud to have been selected to provide customer acquisition, program management and measurement and verification services,” said Aaron Jagdfeld, president and chief executive officer of Generac. “By providing an end-to-end solution, we will support distributed demand-side resources for its life cycle, assisting APS at times when energy use is at its highest.”
Generac will use its dealer network to identify and recruit customers to participate in the battery aggregation program. Per the program parameters, customers will retain access to backup power in the event of an outage, and Generac said participation will not reduce battery resiliency. Customers are incentivized for their participation in the program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/16/metal-roofing-the-perfect-platform-for-solar-pv/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PRODUCTS,RACKING,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 16, 2022",Metal roofing: The perfect platform for solar PV,"Within the past four decades, well over 2 billion square feet of metal roofing has been installed in the United States each year. That number continues to grow, and it’s more than any other roof type except asphalt shingle.
The roots and technology of metal as a cladding material date back more than 3,000 years. It has always been coveted as a premium roofing option but, until more recent history, has been handicapped by higher initial costs than the alternatives. Beginning in the mid-1800s and continuing to the present day, production technologies and the use of aluminum and coated steel sheeting began to narrow the premium price chasm. Now it competes with other premium roof materials but lasts two to four times as long.
Today’s trends point toward evaluating the long-term costs of owning a roof, as landfills are overburdened with former building components discarded due to shortsighted budget-conscious building objectives. The life-cycle costs and environmental appeal of metal truly offer many advantages. As a result, metal is becoming the roofing material of choice for both commercial and residential applications.
Service life
Metal roofing is known for its durability, sustainability and versatility and is increasing in popularity in the solar marketplace.  The metal roof is the ideal host for mounting photovoltaics (PV) as it is the only roof type with a service life that actually exceeds the service life of a solar PV system.
In the commercial/industrial market sector, the field/lab study published by the Metal Construction Association indicates that the service life of (standing seam) coated steel is in the range of 70 years. Most alternative roofing systems will expire long before the life of the PV system. This leads to costly disassembly of the PV array, re-roofing and re-assembly.
The service life of solar PV is between 28 and 37 years with an average at 32.5 years, according to a Berkeley study.  Aside from metal, there are no other roof types that measure up to that without requiring replacement. High-end slate or tile may be the only exception, but it comes with a high price tag and is also much heavier (5 to 8 psf vs. 1.5). Mounting solar to tile or slate is a bit complex and very tricky to do without breakage so the cost is also much higher than mounting to metal.
Ease and cost of installation- going “rail-less”
It is easier and less expensive to mount solar to a metal roof than any other roof type.

The uniqueness of metal roofing is that the structural ribs or seams can be used as inherent (and cost-free) “rails” for mounting solar PV via reliable mechanical attachments, so the need for a traditional rail system is eliminated.
Direct attachment of solar modules to a metal roof can be accomplished with fewer components and lightweight materials, resulting in better load distribution and zero penetration, which preserves both the integrity of the roof and the roof manufacturer’s warranty.
Because there are no rails, the material required for a mounting system is reduced by weight (up to 85%) and savings on hard goods (up to 35%).
The key to labor savings (30 to 50%) is the simplicity of rail-less attachment: requiring 65-75% fewer components, roof clamps are aligned and installed as modules are installed “on-the-fly.”
Finally, shipping long lengths of rail to project sites and transporting them up to a rooftop is costly and often a logistical nightmare.  With rail-less attachments, shipping costs for the mounting system can be 60% lower than railed mounting systems, with fewer logistical hassles transporting the product to distribution, then the site, and then within the site and onto the roof.  A traditional rail system of 750 kW would normally require a semi-truck to transport; a rail-less attachment solution could fit in a short-bed pickup truck.
Whether railed or rail-less, the simplicity and cost savings of mounting to a metal roof are significant, and the future need of roof replacement is avoided.
Eco-friendly sustainability
Metal roofing is the most sustainable roof type (at an 85% recycle rate, steel is one of the most recycled construction materials available). By installing solar on metal roofs with lower material, labor and shipping costs, the rail-less attachment solution is proving to be a “green” innovation in both the solar and roofing industries.
Recyclable metal roofs have a demonstrated service life of several times that of any other roof type and are never destined for a landfill. Therefore, solar metal roof attachments enable installation on most aged roofs without a roof replacement.  Production of rail-less systems saves an estimated 90% of the energy used to produce rail mountings and 85% of carbon emissions in transportation.
Lifetime ROI
Once the decision is made to install solar, often a new roof is required.  Metal roofing has become a driver for roof type selection in many cases because not only is a metal/solar roof system less expensive upfront than other roof system combinations, but it also leads to improvements in the lifetime return on investment (ROI) of the system. Therefore, the PV array and the roof should be regarded as a single asset.
When computing ROI within the solar pro forma, inverter replacement is usually factored in at about year 15 – but what about the cost of roof replacement?  The solar array has to be totally dismantled and then re-installed on the replacement roof.  Often, even the initial cost of the solar + metal roof is less than solar + other roof type alternatives.  Factor in roof replacement and the cost advantages become grossly magnified.
A number of exorbitant expenses associated with completing a PV system re-roof for a traditional (non-metal) roof could include: removing the solar modules; removing the mounting and racking system; de-commissioning the system during the reroof; re-roofing; re-installing the PV system; re-commissioning the system; the potential for damaged components during this process; possibly needing new wiring and loss of power production during downtime.
With metal, you can avoid roof replacement due to its long service life. The roof will still be going strong long after the service life of the solar array has expired.
The rise of metal roofing & solar
With the cost of solar decreasing significantly over the last decade, in addition to federal and local incentives as well as public policy mandates driving the popularity of solar, the breakeven and ROI improves every year – evident even more with solar on metal roofs because of its lower installation costs, so it makes even greater financial sense.
Metal is the most solar-friendly roof available and the PV contractor should know about it.
Metal roofing is attractive, durable, non-flammable and requires almost no maintenance. The “buy-it-cheap and fix-it-later” mentality has steadily diminished over the last few decades and more building owners are choosing metal than ever before.
The growing demand for more durable and environmentally-friendly construction materials, as well as methods that reduce maintenance and have longer service lives, is on the rise―evident by statistics clearly indicating that metal has a much larger share of replacement roofing than it does in new roofing within the residential market.
Main takeaway
Solar contractors should know about roofing alternatives and their service lives to bring added value to their customers. The long-term costs of both the roof and solar PV should be evaluated as a single system.  Advising the mounting of a solar array with a 30-year plus life on a TPO or asphalt shingle roof with a 15-year life is a bit like mounting a Ferrari engine on a Mini-Cooper chassis.  Who would do that?
