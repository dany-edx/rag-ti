https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/04/solar-powered-camper-from-airstream-is-a-two-wheeled-electric-car/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",Solar-powered camper from Airstream is a two-wheeled electric car,"Airstream, builders of iconic travel trailers known for their rounded shape and aluminum exterior, announced the release of eStream, a camper built for the electric vehicle revolution.
The eStream takes Airstream’s famous design features and adds integrated solar PV in the roof, as well as an electric motor that can be used to drive and park the trailer. The electric motors within can also be used while towing the trailer, taking load off the towing vehicle. It’s estimated that the F-150 Lightning truck may reduce its range to less than 100 miles of range when towing at its maximum capacity, so the eStream helps to keep drivers going longer distances.
The roof has 900W of solar built-in, which Airstream said is about one-fifth the average power draw of an American home. In addition to solar, the system has a fast plug-in charging port and an 80kW battery. Airstream said the battery can reach full charge in about 30-45 minutes at a fast-charging station.
While you can’t drive the eStream down the road on its own, it can be parked autonomously using a tablet or other web-connected device. Its range of motion makes it easier to snug the trailer into a tight spot as opposed to working it in with a tow truck, said Airstream.
The on-road trailer motors use a unique tow hitch with built-in sensors to continually measure the forces between the trailer and the vehicle, so that the trailer does not push or pull on the tow vehicle. Like an electric car, the trailer uses regenerative braking to recharge its batteries.
 
The company said the eStream can be taken completely off-grid for a week or two, running all systems including A/C and heat. When foregoing deeper power draws like heating and cooling, the trailer can remain powered off-grid for significantly longer.
Fast Company reports that it may still be a couple years before this design is on the market. As more EVs take to the road, the eStream may be more representative of the trailers and campers of the near future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/04/biden-administration-extends-section-201-tariffs-on-imported-cspv-panels-and-cells/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",Biden administration extends Section 201 tariffs on imported CSPV panels and cells,"Today the Biden administration announced that it will extend the Section 201 tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar panels and solar cells above an annual 5GW tariff rate quota, thus upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and doubling the tariff rate quota for cells.
The proclamation is seen as a “balanced solution” by many in the solar industry. “While we are disappointed with the decision to extend Section 201 tariffs on imported solar cells and panels, we are grateful to the Biden administration for clearly considering the range of issues affected by this decision,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). She added that, “Administration officials arrived at a balanced solution in upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and increasing the tariff rate quota for cells.”
The saga surrounding the solar tariffs began after a Section 201 trade petition was filed by Suniva and SolarWorld that sought relief against what the companies said was unfair competition from overseas imports.  In 2018 President Donald J. Trump imposed duties on solar panels and solar cells for a period of four years. In those ensuing years many countries including the European Union, China, South Korea, and Taiwan filed complaints with the World Trade Organization in opposition to the graduated tariffs.
One of the outcomes expected by those supporting the ruling was an increase in solar manufacturing in the US, but that did not come to pass. It also had a negative affect on US solar installations, with the number of installed gigawatts missing projections for the first time in years, said Tony Clifford in pv magazine in 2019. Clifford was then chief development officer at Standard Solar and a board member of SEIA.
Today’s ruling extends the exclusion for bifacial solar panels, something that SEIA has been fighting for for three years.
“Today’s decision recognizes the importance of this innovative technology in helping to improve power output and lower costs in the utility-scale segment. It is a massive step forward in producing clean energy in America and in tackling climate change,” Hopper said.
Not everyone in the solar industry is seeing the proclamation as offering a good balance. First Solar’s chief executive, Mark Widmar, said that the extension to the Section 201 safeguard excluding bifacial panels is no safeguard at all.
“This exclusion un-levels the playing field by providing unlawfully subsidized bifacial panels an instant, artificial advantage over other panel types, an advantage that is based not on real-world performance or true competitiveness, but merely on distinguishing where the cells happen to be located on the panel. With bifacial being the dominant Chinese solar product today, this decision effectively allows China to outflank American efforts to grow self-reliant solar supply chains,” Widmar said.
Next steps
In order to incentivize domestic solar manufacturing, the next step is the passage of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. “Failing that, today’s decision places at risk billions of dollars in existing investment, thousands of jobs, our country’s energy security and a climate-critical transition to net-zero emissions. It also places at risk the over 10 gigawatts of new American manufacturing capacity announced since May 2021, as well as the thousands of new jobs here at home that were set to be created both directly, on the manufacturing floor, and indirectly across domestic supply chains,” Widmar said.
In writing about the extension of the solar tariffs and need for the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, Brian Lynch, director of solar + storage at LG wrote in an op-ed in pv magazine that “the actions we take today–as an entire industry–will affect our ability to continue to grow as we meet the imperative of installing solar to help protect our environment and grow our economy”.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/04/nova-scotia-government-moves-to-stop-net-metering-fixed-charge/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",Nova Scotia government moves to stop net-metering fixed charge,"A story that is becoming all too familiar is that of the local utility seeking to charge solar customers what amounts to a solar tax for their energy production. In a welcome ruling, the Nova Scotia government announced that it will protect solar homeowners and small businesses in the solar industry by stopping the proposed grid access charge.
The Province of Nova Scotia has committed to generating 80% of its electricity needs from renewable energy by 2030. But contrary to that commitment, Nova Scotia Power sought to charge solar customers about $8/kW of solar capacity beginning this month. If put into effect, that charge would amount to about $960 a year for a typical 10kW net-metered installation, essentially doubling the payback period for solar customers who currently take in about $1,800 in annual savings.
Premier Tim Houston sent a letter notifying the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board (NSUARB) of the government’s plans today, February 2.
“We agree that it is time for changes to the enhanced net-metering program but the changes we seek will support the greening of the grid, not discourage it,” said Premier Houston. “Our government will bring forward the necessary legislative and regulatory framework that will protect ratepayers and the solar industry in Nova Scotia and help achieve our environment and climate change reduction goals.
The charge proposed by Nova Scotia Power is not yet in place, and the Province will ensure that the charge will not take effect. The Province’s framework will be brought into force before the conclusion of the general rate application proceeding at the NSUARB.
“We have come too far in our fight against climate change and expanding access to renewable energy to risk that progress,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “The changes we will bring forward will stop the proposed system access charge in its tracks today and provide certainty for our solar industry and rate-paying families investing in solar.”
The government is also bringing in further measures to grow the solar industry in Nova Scotia, with enhancements to the commercial and community solar programs. These enhancements will make solar power more accessible to everyone, including renters, small businesses, and marginalized communities. These changes will also allow for larger solar projects for communities, farms and businesses.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/04/california-nem-3-0-delayed-indefinitely/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",California NEM 3.0 delayed indefinitely,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decided to delay the much-maligned Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 proposal indefinitely.
As proposed, it would have slashed the payments made by utility companies to rooftop solar owners for exporting their excess PV production back to the grid. EQ Analysts said the proposal would lead to a 57-71% overall reduction in solar savings across the state.
A provision that was particularly under fire was the grid access charge, an $8/kW solar capacity charge per month, which experts called a “tax on the sun.” The charge would apply to all solar customers, regardless of whether they have grid-supporting technology like battery energy storage. A typical 7kW system owner would pay an additional $56 a month under the proposal.
Pointing to the absurdity of the fixed monthly charge in a ROTH Capital webinar, seasoned grid expert Dr. Ahmad Faruqui said, “Why should someone buying carrots at the grocery store have to pay more because they also grow carrots at home?”

SolarReviews, a residential solar informational site, interviewed about 4,000 active solar shoppers in the state, and showed them what their solar savings potential looked like under the assumptions of NEM 3.0. The results were nothing short of damning for California rooftop solar, as 95% responded they would no longer purchase under the cost assumptions. In many cases payback periods were increased to as much as 20 years, a wait many viewed as unreasonable and too risky.
Working Californians, environmentalists, and clean energy advocates quickly learned of the proposal, and with the help of organization by the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA), thousands took to the streets to protest. Over a thousand workers in front of the CPUC and nearly 2000 in Los Angeles demonstrated, calling upon the Commission and Governor Newsom to throw out the proposal and save the state’s distributed solar future.
Now, it appears that the voices of all who opposed the measure have been heard, as the decision is postponed indefinitely.
The CPUC was scheduled to meet and vote on January 27th. Then, it was reported that Governor Newsom said there was still “work to be done” on the proposal, and it was discovered that the proposed decision was not on the docket for the 27th, nor the February 10th meeting. Now, it appears that the voices of all who opposed the measure have been heard, as the decision is postponed indefinitely. Reuters reported CPUC president Alice Reynolds requested more times to consider changes.
“We are glad to hear that the commission is working to get this proposal right,” said Environment California’s state director Laura Deehan. “I’ve walked alongside thousands of concerned citizens who want our state to catch more solar energy from our rooftops. Governor Newsom heard us, and made clear that changes had to be made to the proposal. Now, the commission needs to make sure that California continues its solar leadership.”
PG&E to recoup wildfire costs from ratepayers 
In what may be a related move, a new Californian state agency established by the Newsom administration called the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety announced it granted PG&E a special provision to recoup wildfire costs from electric ratepayers by raising rates.

These are some of the same wildfires PG&E were found liable for. In 2017 alone, downed transmission wires from aging infrastructure set fire to a drying state, causes massive wildfires, leaving many Californians without homes, and sticking PG&E with a $7.5 billion bill. The liabilities eventually caused the utility to declare bankruptcy. Now, it appears the ratepayers will be footing the bill.
The steep provisions in NEM 3.0 led many experts to wonder if the proposal was an effort to bail out California utilities who had been so crushed by the cost of wildfires. Now, the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety will instead grant power to PG&E to, “seek the recovery of the utility to seek recovery of catastrophic wildfire costs from its ratepayers, or from the California Wildfire Fund. . . . It is Energy Safety’s assessment that PG&E has additional work to complete, but is taking steps to improve its operations and culture. This has been documented through the safety certification process.” 
The Energy Safety Office’s decision acknowledges PG&E hasn’t eliminated the potential for future wildfire problems. It says, “Issuance of the safety certification does not constitute an affirmation by Energy Safety that PG&E has taken all possible steps to prevent its equipment from causing wildfires. Nor does it shield PG&E from liability or litigation.”
The Environmental Working Group of California said the best solution to prevent future wildfires caused by PG&E and other large utilities is to reform the current model of centralized electricity distribution that centralized power model that sends energy hundreds of miles through often unmaintained and dilapidated power lines over dry, drought-ridden central and Northern California landscape covered in brush and trees that fuel these fires.
In his new book Freeing Energy, venture capitalist Bill Nussey outlines this debate of the traditional structure of centralized power versus the new, distributed, flexible grid many are envisioning.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/04/maxeon-40-year-solar-panel-warranty-available-in-select-markets/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",Maxeon 40-year solar panel warranty available in select markets,"Maxeon Solar Technologies announced the launch of a 40-year warranty on its SunPower Maxeon Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) product line. The company states that its warranty covers product quality, power performance, and services in select markets for 40 years, through environmental stresses, wide-ranging temperatures, and more.
The markets covered include main distributed generation markets: Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Australia, Japan, and Mexico. All the other markets maintain a 25-year warranty for IBC panels.
Maxeon recently announced a commercial partnership with Omnidian to address the US commercial and industrial segment. Despite the fact that Maxeon recently announced availability of the IBC panel in the US, it is not currently offering the 40-year warranty to the US C&I customers. Instead they will have a combined 25-year warranty.
The new 40-year warranty covers the SunPower Maxeon product line, including new products like Maxeon 6, which is scheduled to launch in Q2 2022. It does not cover the new Maxeon Air modules.
Paired with a 25-year power warranty, the new 40/40 warranty from Maxeon includes 40-year coverage for defects related to workmanship and materials, power output protection, and the servicing needed to repair or replace defective panels in the markets listed above.
The new SunPower Maxeon 40-year warranty is based on external field studies from hundreds of megawatts and more than 33 million IBC panels deployed worldwide, comprehensive accelerated life testing by Maxeon and third parties, and a physics-based model, PVLife, which Maxeon uses to determine the expected performance impact over time from major degradation and failure modes. Maxeon states that continued operation beyond this period is certainly feasible.
“We have spent more than 35 years refining the patented cell and panel design of our IBC technology and that has provided the confidence that our panels will last for more than 40 years in the field. This exciting step is part of our promise to customers that SunPower Maxeon panels will be the best value, longest lasting and most sustainable choice in the industry. This is what we call Solar for Life,” said Jeff Waters, CEO of Maxeon Solar Technologies.
The core technology of Maxeon’s patented cell and panel design of Maxeon’s IBC technology includes fundamental design differences that eliminate typical solar module failure modes, such as hotspots and cell interconnection failures. According to Maxeon, these panels have a minimum warranted output of 98% during their first year of operation, followed by a maximum annual degradation of 0.25% for the next 39 years. The result is an 88.3% warranted power level at the end of 40 years.
In November of last year, pv magazine spoke with Mark Babcock, chief revenue office of Maxon, who indicated that Maxeon was considering manufacturing in the US, but he said that in order for that to happen a few federal policy changes would be needed. He said a 3GW cell manufacturing facility in the US is waiting on an Energy Polict Act of 2005-established Title XVII loan from the US Department of Energy; it also may depend on the success of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. Such adoption would make US expansion a more attractive prospect to Maxeon, likely drawing in other industry players, as well, according to Babcock.

Under a unique supply agreement, the electricity generated by the Kern Solar and Battery Storage Project will be delivered to SJCE between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. every day, in order to support grid reliability, reduce reliance on power plants that produce harmful emissions, and improve air quality by providing renewable energy during hours of peak demand, when mitting resources would otherwise be required.
This fixed delivery model was established in the 12-year power purchase agreement the companies came to terms on in April 2020. Since that time, Terra-Gen has built more than 115 MW of new solar energy and new battery storage to fulfill the agreement.
In addition, SJCE and TerraGen have contracted for a 15-year PPA set to supply another 100 MW of new solar to the CCA. This project is expected to reach commercial operation by the end of 2022 and will also be built in Kern County with union labor.
GreenSource, SJCE’s standard service option, is currently sourced at 60% from renewable energy, up from 45% in 2019, and the CCA is working to help achieve the city’s goal of running on 100% renewable energy by 2030.
“SJCE is proud to put new renewable energy onto the California grid through this innovative project and to achieve this milestone less than three years since becoming the local electric generation service provider,” said Director of San José’s Community Energy Department, Lori Mitchell.
