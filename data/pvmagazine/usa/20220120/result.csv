The PSC chose not to raise the base net metering rate to full retail electricity rates, as some advocates had asked for, keeping the rate at 2.5 cents/kWh over the deemed ‘avoided cost’ of solar. In this sense, avoided cost refers to the difference between the cost of solar generated by a rooftop and the cost of the utility procuring that energy from a different generation facility.
The commission did, however, create a 2 cents/kWh adder for customers who are at or below 250% of the federal poverty line for any solar they choose to export, and this adder comes with no customer nor capacity limit.
According to the ruling, the PSC believes that the adder “will meaningfully enhance both access to and the adoption of distributed generation by the currently underrepresented low-income segment of customers.”
Low- and middle-income customers are typically dissuaded from installing solar due to the high upfront costs, rather than by low export rates that increase payback times, however, this is a factor that the commission addressed later in the ruling.
The new net metering rules also include a requirement that each of the state’s investor-owned utilities offer a one-time $3,000.00 upfront cash rebate to any retail residential customer purchasing a renewable distributed energy project sized between 3 kW and 6 kW that is used, at least in part, for self-supply.
The PSC hopes that increasing access to solar across the board will attract more of the state’s residents to solar, a proposition that has not been particularly attractive to them historically. Of the 319 MW of solar that Mississippi has installed to date, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, an absolutely miniscule amount has been from residential and commercial rooftop installations, so little that the two hardly appear on the state’s annual installed capacity graphs.
Still holding reservations regarding the base net metering rate, SEIA’s Southeast Regional Director, Will Giese, commended the ruling in an official statement, saying,
“While we are disappointed that the Public Service Commission did not offer the full retail rate for net metering, the order will move Mississippi’s solar policy forward, and SEIA will continue to advocate for straightforward and smart policies that grow the solar industry. As we’ve seen in Arkansas, easy-to-understand net metering programs can encourage rooftop solar adoption and provide benefits to all ratepayers.”
Giese also expects that the low-income net metering adder will help even more Mississippians experience the cost-saving benefits of solar energy.
Even though the scope of the decision only applied to net-metered systems, the PSC clarified that it plans to establish a separate rulemaking proceeding to consider rules and standards applicable to community solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/20/bipartisan-group-of-eight-us-senators-urge-president-biden-not-to-extend-solar-tariffs/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 20, 2022",Bipartisan group of eight US Senators urge President Biden not to extend solar tariffs,"U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) led a bipartisan group of Senators in a letter to President Joe Biden urging him not to extend the current Section 201 tariffs on imported solar panels and cells, which are set to expire on February 6.
The tariffs, which were first imposed by the Trump Administration, have caused increases in solar module prices and has been attributed by the Solar Energy Industries Association to the loss of more than 62,000 clean energy jobs and 10.5 GW of solar that did not get deployed.
The s201 tariff is imposed on all solar modules imported into the U.S. that don’t meet exemption status as published in the Federal Register. The current s201 tariff is 18% and, if the tariff is not extended, would drop to 0% in February 2022.
The bipartisan letter was signed by a group of eight U.S. Senators, including Rosen, and Senators Jerry Moran (R-KS), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Michael Bennet (D-CO). The Senators wrote:
“As you know, in February 2018, the Trump Administration imposed Section 201 tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar panels and solar cell imports above an annual 2.5-gigawatt tariff rate quota,” wrote the Senators. “We believe that extending the tariffs will do nothing but add unnecessary costs to U.S. consumers, hurt American solar jobs, and artificially stymie the deployment of otherwise viable solar projects in the United States. We write to request that you allow the Section 201 tariffs currently imposed on imported solar panels and cells to lapse.”
The letter noted the Senators’ support for efforts to promote domestic manufacturing, which was one of the original intents of the tariffs. But, as the Senators pointed out, current domestic production only meets 15% of the US solar demand. Ramping up US-based manufacturing to meet domestic demand will take time. “We will need to utilize global supply chains, free of forced labor, to meet our clean energy and job creation goals while we expand our domestic solar production capacity. In the meantime, continued tariffs will hurt the nearly 90% of workers in the domestic solar industry who work in non-manufacturing jobs, from installation and maintenance to operations, distribution, and development,” the letter stated.
In addition, the Senators requested that if the tariffs are extended, that the exclusion for bifacial solar modules be preserved.
On Friday January 14,  the US Department of Justice appealed the US Court of International Trade’s Section 201 ruling that struck down the Trump administration’s effort to raise solar tariffs.

CIT is a division of First Citizens Bank.
The portfolio, named NY3, contains six projects in central New York that have a total capacity of 34 MW. The electricity generated by the community solar projects is fully contracted for sale to the region’s businesses and residents.
New York State is a hotbed for community solar development in the US, especially for a Northeastern state that has land-use limitations. The Solar Energy Industries Association ranks the state 11th nationally in solar deployment, and reports about 3.1 GW installed and $7.2 billion invested to date.

The state’s successful community solar market comes in part from supportive policies like the NY Sun program. SEIA led efforts to expand and boost incentive values for community solar projects above initially proposed values. New York is projected to develop nearly 4.4 GW of solar over the next five years, said SEIA.
Earlier this year, CIT worked with Amp on its NY2 portfolio, 40 MW over five projects. On the most recent transaction, executive vice president and head of USA for Amp said, “We were pleased to again leverage CIT’s Industry Knowledge and experience to finance this project.”
Amp was founded in 2009, and is headquartered in nearby Toronto, Canada. To date, the company has developed or purchased more than 6 GW of renewable energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/20/microgrid-project-will-move-prince-edward-island-one-step-closer-to-net-zero-goal/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 20, 2022",Microgrid project will move Prince Edward Island one step closer to net zero goal,"A 10 MW microgrid is under development at Slemon Park on Prince Edward Island, Canada. Ameresco announced today that it is the developer of the project, in collaboration with Prince Edward Island (PEI) Energy Corporation.
The Slemon Park Microgrid is expected to increase renewable energy use on PEI by 3.5%, moving the island one step closer to its goal of net zero by 2030.
According to PEI Energy Corporation, “The objective of the project is to deploy green electricity generation technologies, modular energy production, storage solutions, and smart microgrid management.” These grid services will be delivered with a large grid-connected battery array for flexible energy storage. The battery is planned to provide clean energy and peak load management for residential, industrial and commercial use.
Slemon Park was previously the Canadian Forces Base, which closed in 1989, and is now an industrial, commercial, and residential complex. The microgrid, planned to cover 40 hectares, is designed to help manage peak load demands within Slemon Park and is projected to offset approximately 4500 tonnes CO2e/year over its useful life.
“The Slemon Park Microgrid project will further our goal of achieving Net Zero energy by 2030 on Prince Edward Island. With the addition of a new, clean renewable energy grid, we’ll be able to better reduce our baseline greenhouse gas emissions and create a more resilient future,” said Steven Myers, Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Action.
Construction began in December 2021 with a target energize date scheduled for Fall 2022. Federal funding for this project is provided by Natural Resources Canada’s Smart Grid Program, part of the Government of Canada’s Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program: Green Infrastructure stream.

The user-friendly platform takes site-specific inputs and informs decision-makers on how to meet resilience or energy performance goals while maximizing energy cost savings.
The tool comes with newly expanded capabilities to track the potential change in carbon emissions on a more granular level. The tool already had the ability to display “year one” carbon emissions on an hourly level, but now adds the ability to examine the total life cycle emissions abated by the project. It factors in future changes in grid emissions intensity to better represent how the project will integrate with the wider energy ecosystem.
REopt now also offers a look into the health-related emissions abated from avoiding grid-purchased energy and on-site fuel burn. This is a key consideration in projects with a focus on energy justice, a practice dedicated to fighting disproportionate negative impacts energy infrastructure has on the well-being of lower-income communities.
Total potential cost savings as they relate to social, climate, and public health costs, broken down by the project’s emissions impacts on CO2, NOx, SO2, and PM2.5 are modeled by the tool. Commenting on the team’s findings using the tool, REopt team member and NREL engineer Amanda Farthing said, “…health-related emissions costs aren’t as frequently discussed as a social cost of carbon. It surprised me that those costs ended up being so substantial.”
Additionally, least-cost pathways to achieve a desired renewable energy or emissions reduction target can be provided by REopt, which will quantify the associated investment and savings.
The REopt tool currently leverages the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Avoided Emissions and Regeneration Tool, for hourly grid emissions profiles. NREL said it hopes to integrate this software with its own Cambium data sets, which project emission rate estimates through 2050 for the contiguous United States.
A version of the tool, REopt Lite, can be accessed for free through NREL.

According to Ben Catt, CEO of Pine Gate Renewables the loan will be used to expand the company’s solar portfolio through both originated and acquired projects, as well as allow the company to move towards some of its long-term growth goals.
“Our facility for Pine Gate Renewables underscores Fundamental’s commitment to working with industry leaders and high-quality developers that are spearheading the energy transition to renewable energy and a lower carbon economy,” said Bob Hopper, senior advisor at Fundamental Renewables.
Pine Gate currently operates 85 solar projects in five states across the U.S., accounting for more than 1 GW of energy, with another 19 GW in active development. The company currently has more than 700 MW under construction.
One of Pine Gate’s assets under development, first announced in November, is a 0.125 MW/0.5 MWh battery energy storage system, being built to provide demand charge reduction, backup power to critical loads, and supply additional grid services to the city of Logan, Utah.
The project is the first standalone storage system to be developed in Utah and is planned to be operational before the end of 2022. The battery system will be comprised of the Eos Znyth Gen 2.3 battery and Nikola Power’s Intellect Plus Energy Management System.
Pine Gate currently has more 12 GWh of storage in development as stand-alone or co-located with solar projects across the country.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/20/how-artificial-intelligence-can-be-used-to-identify-solar-panel-defects/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"JANUARY 20, 2022",How artificial intelligence can be used to identify solar panel defects,"One of the biggest challenges for non-AI experts is the terminology. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and computer vision (CV) are frequently discussed, but people outside of data science fields often do not know what they mean. Fortunately, it is not that complex: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision all generally refer to the same thing, just with more specificity.
For example, if you are running a computer vision algorithm to identify solar panel defects, you are engaging in AI, ML, and CV. In contrast, if you are translating words from English to Spanish using an algorithm, that is more likely to be AI or ML, not CV.
Most AI inspection projects in the solar panel industry are typically computer vision (CV) initiatives. This means that an algorithm uses images to identify solar panel defects.
The use of AI and CV in solar panel inspection is relatively novel. Traditionally, solar farm operators would use a team of workers to manually inspect solar panels for defects. This process is slow, expensive, and not very accurate. Every solar farm operator knows that maintenance visits are extremely expensive, and are simply not feasible to perform daily for an entire solar deployment.
To speed up the inspection process and improve accuracy, solar farm operators are turning to AI-powered inspection. This involves the use of algorithms that can automatically detect solar panel defects from images.
This process is much faster and more accurate than manual inspection. Additionally, solar farm operators can use AI-powered inspection to identify defective panels before they are installed on the solar farm, and after they are already operational.
There are a few different ways that solar farms can deploy AI-powered inspection. The most common way is through the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone. UAVs provide a non-contact way for solar farm operators to perform quality control of their solar panels using aerial imagery.
Images collected by a UAV over a solar farm can be processed by an algorithm either in the cloud or on-device. The results of the AI algorithm will tell the quality controller which PV panels have visible signs of defective equipment.
By using automatic defect classification AI, quality controllers can reduce costs by surveying their entire facility in a few hours rather than hiring someone for days to conduct maintenance. Moreover, automatic identification of defective panels can speed up inspection time with location-based tagging, thus improving efficiency.
The most common algorithm type used in solar panel inspection is a deep learning algorithm. Deep learning algorithms are a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a neural network to learn how to solve a task. Neural networks are composed of interconnected layers that can learn how to recognize solar panel defects from images.
These deep learning networks require training data, which are large datasets of labeled images. In many cases, the solar farm operator can provide these labeled images to the deep learning algorithm. Alternatively, an AI vendor can provide these labeled images off the shelf.
For the in-house approach, this is done by creating a training dataset that consists of images containing solar panel defects, and also images without solar panel defects. The solar farm operator will label each image as either defective or non-defective so that the neural network learns how to identify both types of panels.
Once the deep learning algorithm has been trained, it can be used to inspect solar panels in images collected from a solar farm. The neural network will identify any solar panel defects in the image and provide a classification (defective or non-defective).
While AI-powered inspection offers several advantages for solar panel inspection, there are some challenges that need to be overcome.
The first is the availability of training data. In order for a deep learning algorithm to learn how to detect solar panel defects, it needs a large dataset of labeled images. This means that the solar farm operator needs to provide a set of solar panel images that contain solar panel defects and a set of solar panel images without defects.
The second challenge is the lack of standardization in solar panels. Solar farms can install hundreds or even thousands of different types and models of solar panels – each with its own unique characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc. Since solar panel characteristics can vary between solar farms, this could affect how well a single deep learning algorithm works across multiple solar facilities.
The final challenge is in the model accuracy of inspection results. Algorithms trained to detect solar panel defects will not be 100% accurate. This means that a small number of solar panels may be incorrectly classified as defective. However, by using multiple deep learning models (trained on different datasets), the chances of incorrect classification can be minimized.
Overall, AI is a very powerful tool for solar farm operators and should be incorporated into their maintenance routine. While there are some challenges, solar panel inspection using AI will increase efficiency and reduce costs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/20/more-solar-per-acre-50-more-panels-and-30-more-electricity-over-the-past-decade/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 20, 2022",More solar per acre: 50% more panels and 30% more electricity over the past decade,"Researchers in the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) have found that utility-scale solar power facilities have increased their panel density by 43-52%, which boosted electricity generation per acre by 25-33%, even as more facilities are coming online in northern locations that receive less sunlight.

In the paper, Land Requirements for Utility-Scale PV: An Empirical Update on Power and Energy Density, the team notes that it has been ten years since the last official update to the national benchmark for solar plant power and energy density. The group reviewed all solar plants greater than 5 MWac, from 2011 through and including 2019 installations.
They found that the median power density (MWdc/acre) increased by 52% for fixed tilt facilities, and increased by 43% for single axis trackers. As a result, LBNL suggested new national benchmarks for density:
Concurrently, the electricity generation of these facilities — measured in MWh/year/acre — has increased by 33% for fixed tilt and 25% for tracking. LBNL suggests updating the national benchmarks for electricity generation, as well:

The sample found that 736 plants, totaling 27,001 MWac/35,482 MWdc, came online from 2007 through 2019 – roughly 92% of all utility scale facilities to come online during that period. Due to limited data from 2007 through and including 2010, their analysis only covers 2011-2019.
The researchers used ArcGIS to draw polygons around satellite imagery of each plant. The software then calculated the area within the shapes. This data was cross referenced with other facility metadata to arrive at the power (MW/acre) and energy (MWh/acre) density.
The analysis found that increases in a site’s solar panel density are highly correlated with solar panel efficiency. In Figure 3 near the top of the article, Utility Scale PV Power Density, we see the dashed lines – representing efficiency — moving in tandem with site density, both figures increasing.
One reason that tracking facilities haven’t benefited as much from increasing solar panel densities, is that tracking systems were the first to use the highest efficiency panels — and thus further gains in efficiency over this period have been smaller.
However, looking at electricity generation per acre in Figure 4, the picture is a bit more complex. Generation is still increasing; however, we can see dashed lines representing ‘site quality’ have actually remained flat or decreased since 2015.
Site quality is defined by the long term average global horizontal irradiance (GHI) (kWh/m2/day) – that’s the amount of sunlight that hits the ground. Since the start of this research, minus a bump in 2019, both fixed tilt and tracking solar power projects have seen their available sunlight decrease. And the construction of fixed tilt racking systems has moved way north.
It was determined that the ground cover ratios — the amount of land that would be covered if the modules were laid flat — typically range from 40 to 50% for fixed-tilt plants, versus 25-40% for tracking plants. But this value varied greatly by site, as it is based upon terrain, tilt, and other land features.

Experiments in panel layout, such as Erthos (above), might aggressively increase the volume per acre by laying the panels flat on the ground. A facility like this could potentially have a ground coverage ratio greater than 85%, leaving only the land between the fence and the solar uncovered.
However, until there is greater performance data, we don’t know if the power generation density will increase over the long term.
Currently, even with all land use and panel and generation density data, single axis trackers are the de facto standard for utility-scale solar power projects with the lower levelized costs of electricity. It speaks to the reality that there’s plenty of land available, and that hardware that is slightly more expensive, but highly more productive, still controls the market.
This was amended on March 8, 2022, to add decimal point before figures in suggested national benchmarks for density.
