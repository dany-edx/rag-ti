This year, through nine months, over $28.9 billion in venture capital, public market, and debt financing was invested in the solar industry worldwide.
Mercom Capital Group reported that this level of funding represents a 55% growth over the first nine months of 2022, which totaled $18.7 billion. The number of deals decreased 5%, according to the report, but the 124 deals inked thus far in 2023 represented a significant leap in capital injection over last year.
“Despite inflationary challenges, financing in the solar industry has remained robust through the first three quarters of 2023 thanks to a strong global push toward decarbonization and substantial incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act,” remarked Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer, Mercom Capital Group. “M&A activity, on the other hand, has faced adverse effects, especially in the realm of project acquisitions, due to increased due diligence, higher costs, delays, and a tight labor market.”
Through nine months of 2023, venture capital (VC) funding activity rose 4% year-over-year, with $5.7 billion across 51 deals, said the Mercom report. Solar downstream companies led activity in this area, closing 28 deals worth $2.8 billion over the period.
The largest VC deals included $471 million raised by 1KOMMA5°, $428 million raised by Enfinity Global, $375 million raised by Silicon Ranch, $360 million raised by CleanMax, and $350 million raised by Juniper Green Energy.
Public market financing over the report period reached $7.2 billion across 19 deals, a 47% leap year-over-year.
Debt financing had the most robust growth, totaling $16 billion over 54 deals, an impressive 93% growth over 2022 first-nine-month totals.
Securitization deals totaled $3.2 billion over the first nine months of 2023, increasing 39% year-over-year.
Over the report period 75 solar merger and acquisition transactions occurred, representing a pullback from the 90 deals struck over that period in 2022. The largest transaction was Brookfield Renewable’s acquisition of Duke Energy’s unregulated utility-scale renewables business, which was valued at $2.8 billion.
Over 31.6 GW of projects were acquired through the first three quarters this year, a significant increase over the 52.1 GW acquired through three quarters in 2022.
“Project Developers and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) were the most active acquirers of solar projects in Q3 2023, picking up 2 GW, followed by insurance companies, pension funds, energy trading companies, industrial conglomerates, and IT firms with a total of 1.6 GW. Investment firms acquired 959 MW; electric utilities acquired 877 MW; and oil and gas companies acquired 759 MW of projects,” said the Mercom Capital report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/16/redwood-materials-debuts-a-digital-pricing-tool-to-streamline-electric-vehicle-battery-recycling/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"OCTOBER 16, 2023",Redwood Materials debuts a digital pricing tool to streamline electric vehicle battery recycling,"Redwood Materials, a battery recycler based in Nevada, announced the launch of an online portal that allows car dismantlers to value and sell electric vehicle (EV) battery packs back to Redwood for refurbishing. The company aims to help establish a domestic battery supply chain by providing manufacturers with an arsenal of anode and cathode materials to reuse for lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride battery products.
To use the digital pricing tool, users sign in or create a free account on the organization’s platform. They receive an instant offer after filling out specific car or EV battery details. Once car dismantlers accept the sale, Redwood manages the transportation process according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Hazardous Materials Regulations. This decreases health and safety risks associated with carbon emissions or fires as the EV battery packs move from car dismantler yards to Redwood.
Once the EV battery packs reach Redwood’s facility, they are categorized and stored based on material before undergoing hydrometallurgical metal refining. Once metals, including cobalt, lithium and nickel, are extracted and purified, they are manufactured into anode and cathode battery components.
Redwood states it recovers 95% of crucial battery elements. Furthermore, the organization says  that by 2025, it will produce enough anode and cathode to power 100 GW/h of EV driving, the equivalent of one million EVs each year. Finally, Redwood is working toward creating enough anode and cathode to power 500GW/h of EV driving, that is, five million EVs annually by 2030.
Redwood suggests its new tool helps to improve the automotive recycling industry by giving domestic car dismantlers an instant offer for their EV battery packs online while Redwood handles the transportation process. Redwood suggests that their portal leverages advanced tracking and management software to ensure each battery is accounted for throughout transportation. The tool also reportedly verifies valuation.
While the Department of Energy (DOE) has yet to legislate a federal battery recycling framework, grant programs incentivize manufacturers and retailers to develop circular practices that promote the repurposing of critical EV battery materials. Redwood received $2 billion from the DOE earlier this year, which the company used to construct the expansion of a gigafactory in McCarran, Nevada. That’s in addition to a $1 billion Series D funding round from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Capricorn’s Technology Impact Fund and funds and accounts advised by T Rowe Price Associates, Inc. The money will support Redwood in expanding a domestic EV battery supply chain from refurbished materials.
Redwood suggests their tool is essential to ensuring domestic dismantlers can accurately value and recycle the batteries in their yards, especially as the first wave of end-of-life EV batteries grows. The battery pack recycler estimates that 250,000 EVs will reach end-of-life next year.
This pricing tool follows Redwood’s EV recycling program that launched at the start of 2022. While Redwood has partnered with car manufacturers including Ford, Volkswagen America and Toyota (in addition to various dismantlers), it says it will repurpose all lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride  batteries discarded in California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/16/suniva-announces-ira-driven-manufacturing-undermining-the-value-of-solar-tariffs/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 16, 2023","Suniva announces IRA-driven manufacturing, undermining the value of solar tariffs","We now have verification that solar module tariffs are morally, ethically, spiritually, physically, positively, absolutely, undeniably and reliably dead! Suniva has announced plans to restart its solar cell manufacturing. This announcement comes after years of the company’s lobbying to restrict global solar panel imports into the U.S.
Remarkably, Suniva did not resume production even after succeeding in securing tariffs in February 2018. Nor did they make any moves during the record-breaking years of 2020 and 2021 for solar deployment. But in 2023, the company finally broke its silence.
Cristiano Amoruso, Suniva’s CEO and Board member, stated in a press release:
The Inflation Reduction Act and its Domestic Content provisions, as issued, provide a strong foundation for continued solar cell technology development and manufacturing in the United States.
Suniva plans to reactivate and expand its Norcross, Georgia facility. The company aims to kick off production by spring 2024 with a 1 GW capacity, eventually scaling up to 2.5 GW annually. Earlier this year, Suniva secured $110 million in financing from Orion Infrastructure Capital, which also partnered with Heliene for a $170 million manufacturing expansion.
The case for carrots over sticks
Though the IRA appears to have fueled the current U.S. solar manufacturing boom, it’s not the only factor. Existing tariffs, and import restrictions, have inflated prices in the domestic solar module market. However, historical data provides valuable context.
Despite past tariffs, the U.S. solar market expanded. The tariffs first imposed in 2012 and 2014 by the Obama administration aimed to counter economic espionage by Chinese military hackers against SolarWorld, the theft of monoPERC technology, and the dumping of solar cells.
According to data from Clean Energy Associates, U.S. solar manufacturing continued to decline after tariffs were introduced, but saw a modest uptick later. Peaking in 2019, 19.8% of all U.S. solar installations utilized domestically produced modules, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America.

In that year, the U.S. deployed 13.3 GW of solar panels, with about 2.6 GW sourced from domestic manufacturers that had approximately 8 GW of available capacity. However, in the following two years, as the U.S. market rebounded and set annual records, the share of modules manufactured domestically started to decline relative to the total number of modules installed.
When another tariff petition surfaced in 2021, this time from an ‘anonymous’ company, no new manufacturers announced plans.
However, following the enactment of the IRA, capacity projections have skyrocketed, leading some analysts to speculate that the U.S. could become a solar panel exporter. According to the Solar Energy Industries of America, U.S. manufacturing capacity has soared from 8.4 GW in 2022 to over 110 GW, marking an impressive 1200% growth in about a year.

In just 14 months since the IRA was signed, the U.S. shifted from meeting less than 20% of its module demand domestically to potentially satisfying several hundred percent of future demand through domestic module manufacturers.
The manufacturing surge isn’t limited to the U.S.; India is also experiencing a boom. By first instituting import duties on solar panels and cells, especially those from neighboring China, and then by offering state-provided production incentives, India projects 100 GW of solar manufacturing capacity by 2026.
It’s worth noting that import duties alone weren’t the fuel for India’s manufacturing growth. The true catalyst came in the form of state-provided solar production incentives. With these incentives, the country now estimates that 100 GW of solar manufacturing capacity could be operational by 2026.
As Europe confronts its own dilemmas about becoming a solar module manufacturer, research indicates that solar panel import tariffs, possibly coupled with economic recession and technological limitations of the time, led to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in Germany.
In the U.S., another looming tariff case merits attention: the anticircumvention case set to extend the 2012 and 2014 solar cell tariffs to Southeast Asian countries, which have become manufacturing hubs for Chinese companies.
Several questions arise for the United States: Is the Inflation Reduction Act sufficient? Should existing tariffs remain in place to set a price floor? Should the U.S. continue restricting polysilicon imports from geopolitically complex regions?
While all of these questions call for thorough analysis and legislative action, the issue of the effectiveness of tariffs in stimulating manufacturing capacity appears to have a definitive answer.

And they’re not only merely dead, they’re really most sincerely dead.

Bslbatt, a Chinese storage system manufacturer, has released MacthBox HVS, a residential battery that can operate at an elevated voltage level ranging from 204.8 V to 716.8 V.
“It integrates seamlessly with multiple inverter brands such as Solis, Hypontech, Solplanet, and Deye, enabling homeowners to maximize clean energy and reduce their carbon footprint,” the company said.
The batteries feature individual battery modules with voltage s of 102.4 V. They can be stacked in series with two to seven battery modules.
“MacthBox’s modular design simplifies installation and allows for scalability. A single battery module is 5.32 kWh and weighs 50 kg. Homeowners can start with a basic setup and then expand as energy needs grow,” Bslbatt said.
The manufacturer offers six versions of the new product, with storage capacities ranging from 10.64 kW to 37.27 kWh. The smallest unit measures 665 mm x 330 mm x 425 mm and weighs 112 kg, while the largest unit measures 665 mm x 330 mm x 1,175 mm and weighs 372 kg.
The batteries use LiFePO4 as the cathode material and have an operational temperature range from -10 C to 65 C. They are backed by a 10-year warranty and claim a lifespan of over 6,000 cycles, featuring an IP65 protection rating, with an expected operating life of up to 15 years, according to the manufacturer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/16/solar-advocates-appeal-north-carolina-net-metering-cuts/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,NORTH CAROLINA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 16, 2023",Solar advocates appeal North Carolina net metering cuts,"A coalition of solar advocates have filed with the North Carolina Court of Appeals, contending that state laws were violated when state utility regulators approved Duke Energy’s rate plan to make cuts to compensation for exporting rooftop solar generation.
The approval of electric utility Duke Energy’s plan is the latest in a nation-wide push by utilities to quash net energy metering (NEM), the billing process in which homeowners are compensated for delivering local, clean electricity to the grid.
The coalition argued that state regulators violated House Bill 589, passed in 2017, which mandates the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) to perform a cost-benefit analysis of solar net metering.
Under Duke’s plan, which was enacted on October 1, net metering credit rates are cut from a value ranging from $0.05 per kWh to $0.20 per kWh to a low rate of only $0.03 per kWh. This damages the value of rooftop solar for North Carolina residents, making it harder for them to invest in emissions-free electricity generation, despite state goals to boost clean energy access.
The rate case also enforces minimum bills on solar customers of $22 to $28 per month, even if 100% of their electricity demand is met by their own solar array’s production.
North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, and the bill’s author, former Republican House member John Szoka, publicly agreed that independent analysis conducted by NCUC is not only legally mandated, but also essential to a comprehensive assessment of the ratemaking change.
Despite this, Duke Energy opposed requests for a commission-led study, and instead regulators were left with exclusively using internal Duke Energy data and calculations to assess net metering. Environmental and public interest groups have argued the internal Duke calculations largely ignored any benefit of net metering or rooftop solar access.
This problem of utility data transparency and internal data plagued California during its Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 rulemaking. NEM 3.0 led to an 80% cut to net metering rates, and California has since suffered a sharp 40% to 80% contraction of its residential solar industry. The full effect of this change has not been assessed yet as installers are still serving a huge backlog of new customers who rushed to meet the demand for the more lucrative legacy NEM 2.0 rates.
Bernadette del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) said many small-business solar installers in California are now weighing closing up shop permanently. Larger national players in U.S. residential solar like Enphase, Sunrun, SolarEdge, and others have seen their stocks pull back 60% or more since the onset of California’s devastating NEM 3.0. California’s crumbling residential solar market serves a warning to other states nationwide.
Advocates for rooftop solar have plainly demurred rate cases like California’s and Duke Energy North Carolina’s, suggesting that the changes are a clear example of utility profit-protection instead of changes meant to serve North Carolina ratepayers.
“Duke Energy leaders are clearly determined to destroy the competition posed by customer-owned, local solar. They’re harming solar companies and the ability for North Carolina to help slow the climate crisis,” said Jim Warren, director, NC Warn. “It’s pitiful that state regulators are going along with it by allowing Duke Energy to violate the law.”
The coalition appealing for the enforcement of a transparent cost-benefit study includes NC Warn, Environmental Working Group, Sunrise Durham, 350 Triangle, 350 Charlotte, the N.C. Climate Solutions Coalition, the N.C. Alliance to Protect Our People and the Places We Live.

Anomalous high pressure has delivered clear skies and high irradiance across both Mexico and eastern Canada whilst cloud associated with rain and storms depressed irradiance on the west coast of the U.S. and Canada. Areas across Mexico and southern Texas saw reduced cloud, leading to 120-130% of average September Irradiance, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API.
Storms and a ‘Bomb” cyclone caused by persistent low pressure over British Columbia delivered cloudier conditions, leading to irradiance as low as 70% of long term averages.

Persistent high pressure reduces large cloud formation and redirects low-pressure cloud fronts, leading to periods of clear skies. In September large high pressure systems remained for longer than normal over both eastern Canada and southwestern US and Mexico.
For solar producers, these large and persistent systems have been especially beneficial with Quebec, Ontario and southern Mexico all seeing areas with 140% of the long term September GHI average.
Months like these bode well for the future of large solar installations in the south, with ERCOT having produced 3,301 GWh of Solar in the month. Mexico is also looking to take advantage of their high solar potential, through large solar projects like the planned 1 GW Puerto Peñasco solar plant.

Conversely, low pressure over western Canada and Alaska pulled in cloud from the Northern Pacific, leading to a significant increase in rainfall. This plus a ‘bomb’ cyclone in late September led to reduced irradiance across all of the Pacific Coast, most noticeable in British Columbia, where some locations saw just 70% of average September Irradiance.
Rainfall across the month was 7 mm/day above the September average, and temperatures were 5 C below average. Interestingly, this pattern of high pressure keeping skies clear and creating unseasonably sunny September conditions was also seen across parts of Europe, which also saw similarly high irradiance levels.
Mexico and the southwestern US can expect these conditions to reverse through winter, as El Nino winters tend to see Mexico and the South West under-perform against non-El Nino winter averages.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/16/corporate-investment-in-climate-tech-is-about-more-than-dollars/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"OCTOBER 16, 2023",Corporate investment in climate tech is about more than dollars ,"According to the United Nations, avoiding the worst impacts of climate change could cost $4.3 trillion a year by 2030. A large percentage of this funding will come from public sources; however, private capital also has an important part to play in financing the energy transition.
Venture capital, and specifically corporate venture capital, has already contributed significantly to financing climate technology companies. In 2022, venture contributed $40 billioon in funding to climate technology startups, with a large percentage of that funding coming from corporate venture arms, according to the research group Bloomberg NEF. While data from Pitchbook and GCV show venture firm investment in climate tech dropped 25% from 2021-2022 as the overall venture space constricted, corporate venture arm investment only dropped 2%.
Incentives
While the verdict is still out for 2023, with the first half of the year showing a slow start compared to 2022, the opportunity for and value of corporate venture investment in climate technology is clear. According to data from Dealroom.co, energy has been the most invested in and fastest growing segment in climate technology in 2023, according to a recent report by law firm Norton Rose.
So, who better to invest in energy startups than the existing energy giants who have the technical know-how, infrastructure, and vested long-term commercial interest? According to McKinsey, energy companies should look for investments that help them break into new markets, new segments of the value chain, or help to future-proof existing assets so that the risk-profile and shareholders’ tolerance for returns do not have to be the same as their core businesses. McKinsey suggests that “the upside for some leading firms starts to materialize when more than 40 percent of total portfolios are low carbon, while leading oil and gas majors typically allocate less than 25 percent of their new investments into new energies.”
If oil and gas companies were to bump investments in low carbon solutions by 15 percentage points, this would substantially contribute to the $1.1 trillion already being invested globally in low carbon technologies.
Multipronged support
Capital is not the only metric we should use to measure energy companies’ investment in climate technology. According to Climate Tech VC, venture capital investment in climate technology startups was down 40% in H1 2023, compared to the previous year. Some investors suggest this may be a result of the investment mix changing. As more capital-intensive markets like EVs mature, investments in climate technology may not always take the form of a lump sum. Where some companies require dollars to scale, others require access to existing infrastructure, partnerships, and commercial platforms. This is exactly why we shouldn’t measure the oil and gas sector’s contribution to climate technology in equity dollars alone.
Proven diversified investments
One notable example is Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge’s $1bn infrastructure development agreement with biogas producer Divert, Inc. Given Enbridge’s expertise in infrastructure and future potential to transport renewable natural gas (RNG) produced by Divert through its existing pipeline networks, this logical partnership provides Divert with far more than dollars – it provides an immediate and established midstream partner once they reach sufficient scale.
Another example is Shell’s venture arm investment in early-stage direct air capture (DAC) companies – joining Equinor and Repsol in financing RepAir’s $10M series A last year, and investing in a “multiyear strategic and investment partnership” worth over $80M with DAC startup Avnos this year. Shell has the potential to be a huge consumer of Avnos’s DAC technology as a carbon removal solution. Additionally, Avnos’s technology can be used to create synthetic fuels – making Shell a strategic partner for distribution. In both scenarios, Shell’s contribution is clearly far more than equity dollars – it involves a strategic global platform to scale (and potentially, a future acquirer).
This is not to say that energy companies do not have a role to play in equity investment in climate technology companies. However, clearly, dollars are not the only fuel energy companies can provide to propel the growth of climate technology.

The agreement is the result of a 20-month “Solar Uncommon Dialogue” convened by Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and The Nature Conservancy (TNC).
“As the solar and storage industry grows, it’s critical that we prioritize local engagement,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
As solar development ramps up in the U.S. in keeping with the nation’s goal of achieving clean electricity by 2035 and reaching net zero by 2050, coupled with support from the Inflation Reduction Act, the issue of land use has become paramount. A recent TNC report, Power of Place: Clean Energy Solutions that Protect People and Nature estimates that between 3.1 TW and 3.5 TW of wind and solar generation capacity is needed for the U.S. to reach its goal of net zero by 2050.
Understanding that a build-out of this size could require over 200,000 square miles of land, TNC researchers developed a 70% impact reduction scenario where only 135,000 square miles would be needed. This scenario calls for agrivoltaic installations on 4,000 square miles of agricultural land, producing both electricity and crops on the same land.
“We’re committed to accelerating the renewable energy buildout and have to go smart to go fast,” said TNC CEO Jen Morris. “Bringing environmental groups to the table ensures that we strike the right balance, delivering clean energy solutions while safeguarding our precious natural resources and communities.”
The agreement reached through the Solar Uncommon Dialogue calls for large solar projects to be transparent, equitable and efficient. Tradeoffs are understood to be part of the process.
Signatories to the Solar Uncommon Dialogue agreement have committed to improving large-scale solar development based on the “3Cs”: climate, conservation, and community.
Six working groups will address community engagement, siting-related risk assessment and decision-making, energy and agricultural technologies, tribal relations, and policy solutions. The groups will focus on advancing the 3Cs via improved public participation practices, solar siting mechanisms, regulation, financial incentives, information tools, and other means. The goal is to create best practices that solar companies, local governments, and other stakeholders can use to effectively site solar projects.
“Major U.S. solar projects are critical to fighting climate change but are increasingly opposed across the nation due to significant community and land conservation concerns,” said Stanford energy scholar Dan Reicher, who launched and leads the solar Uncommon Dialogue. “It’s exciting how motivated the parties are to avoid these conflicts and develop high-impact solutions — a triple play for climate, conservation, and community” added Reicher, who was U.S. Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/16/doe-announces-7-billion-to-kick-off-seven-regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"OCTOBER 16, 2023",DOE announces $7 billion to kick off seven regional clean hydrogen hubs ,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has announced $7 billion to kick off seven regional clean hydrogen hubs in the U.S., with the broader aim of supporting the commercial-scale deployment of clean hydrogen in the country. 
The seven hubs are funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021, and will, according to the DOE “kickstart a national network of clean hydrogen producers, consumers, and connective infrastructure while supporting the production, storage, delivery, and end-use of clean hydrogen.” They are collectively expected to produce three million metric tons of hydrogen each year, and reduce around 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. 
Projects that were selected for negotiation include the Appalachian Hydrogen Hub, California Hydrogen Hub, Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub, Heartland Hydrogen Hub, Mid-Atlantic Hydrogen Hub, Midwest Hydrogen Hub and the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub. However, these selections don’t represent a commitment of funding from the DOE; the agency will now go through a negotiations process with the applicants. The H2Hubs program is managed by the DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.  
“Unlocking the full potential of hydrogen—a versatile fuel that can be made from almost any energy resource in virtually every part of the country—is crucial to achieving President Biden’s goal of American industry powered by American clean energy, ensuring less volatility and more affordable energy options for American families and businesses,” said Jennifer Granholm, U.S. Secretary of Energy.   
Clean hydrogen has emerged as an important priority for the Biden-Harris Administration, in part due to its potential in industries that would otherwise be hard to decarbonize, including heavy-duty transportation. The administration is looking at domestically producing 10 million metric tonnes (MMT) of clean hydrogen annually by 2030, ramping up to 20 MMT annually by 2040 and 50 MMT annually by 2050. 
The DOE’s announcement is a critical first step in decarbonizing existing carbon-intensive hydrogen applications such as ammonia production for fertilizers and petrochemicals refining and in decarbonizing new applications of hydrogen in hard-to-abate sectors, including heavy-duty trucking, shipping, and aviation, said Anna Menke, senior hydrogen hubs manager at the Clean Air Task Force. 
It is also a “major step forward for the hydrogen economy here in the United States,” said Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association.
“Engagement by state and local leaders in communities across the country, matched with significant private investment, will develop the hydrogen economy so consumers, businesses and communities can decarbonize many of the most difficult heavy-using energy sectors like heavy-duty and long-haul transportation, cement, aluminum and steel, all-the-while providing important, good-paying clean energy jobs,” Wolak added. 
However, some stakeholders remain skeptical. 
“Throwing billions at hydrogen hubs deepens our dependence on fossil fuels and worsens the climate emergency,” said Maggie Coulter, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. 
“President Biden should be urgently investing in proven and increasingly affordable solar and wind energy. It’s wasteful and misguided to fund false solutions like hydrogen that only further burden frontline communities,” Coulter added.
