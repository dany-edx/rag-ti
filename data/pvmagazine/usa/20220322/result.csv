The myriad of health and climate-related harms caused by coal do not need to persist any longer, according to the researchers.
The research team found that just a third of the wind and solar projects proposed to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) by June 2020 could replace almost all of the state’s coal generation. Since June 2020, dozens of those projects have been built, and the queue of proposed solar projects has doubled.
“It’s almost always windy or sunny somewhere in Texas,” said Daniel Cohan, an environmental engineer at Rice University’s George R. Brown School of Engineering.
Cohan performed an analysis of peaks in production from West and South Texas renewable resources and suggested that the state’s power production can be made more reliable by adjusting where and when those resources are deployed. As a least-cost path, the model showed that 72 of the 108 wind projects, and 42 of the 262 solar projects proposed in queues could replace most coal in ERCOT. This would leave about 10% of coal output uncovered at certain seasons, and generating a surplus of energy at times of peak solar and wind harvest. Previous work by Rice researchers has shown that wind and solar power are generated at complementary times, with west Texas winds blowing most strongly at night, south Texas sea breezes peaking on summer afternoons, and solar power peaking midday.
“Even with complementary siting, there will still be hours when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing,” Cohan said. “Historically, the main challenge has been summer afternoons when air conditioners are running full blast, and the occasional deep freeze. Solar and coastal winds perform well during summer peaks, but can have lulls on some evenings when we’ll need something else to kick in.”
Generation mix shift
The state of Texas has no clean power mandate, and as a deregulated territory, market forces determine the competition between energy sources. ERCOT is largely independent of other US and Mexico power grids, said the report, with little opportunity for wholesale trade with other system operators. Due to this, any retiring of fossil fuel capacity must be met directly with new clean energy generation.
In 2019, the generation mix for ERCOT was 47% natural gas, 20% coal, 20% wind, 11% nuclear, and 2% solar and other. Coal consumption reached its peak for ERCOT in 2011 at about 110,000 tons of coal burned in the year. That number has come down considerably to about 61,000 tons in 2021. ERCOT processed 14GW of utility-scale solar interconnection requests last year, so the generation mix profile is set to fundamentally change.
Bottlenecks
The challenge in Texas as many other parts of the US are transmission lines: An expansion is needed to connect the sunniest and windiest parts of the state to the cities.
“In Texas, that’s the biggest bottleneck slowing the growth of wind and solar,” Cohan said. “The bipartisan infrastructure bill that passed last year is a good start, but doesn’t have nearly enough funding for transmission. Also, by not connecting to other grids, Texas has missed out on opportunities to sell surplus wind and solar power to other states.”
A large capacity of coal plans were retired in Texas in 2018, and many ran on limited capacity during the February winter storms that cut power to much of the state earlier that year. Cohan said that natural gas peaker plants will still be needed for the time being to address extreme weather events. However, a report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation found that issues with the natural gas supply caused 87% of the outages during the February storm, as wells and pipelines froze, and uninsulated gas plants failed to function.
As for coal, Cohan believes the end of days are here. “I think none of the power companies want to run coal plants long-term,” Cohan said. “They’re dirtier and costlier to operate than building wind and solar projects from scratch, and most utilities companies now have plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, if not before.”

Under the initiative, these 14 communities will first receive technical support to better assess their energy challenges, evaluate solutions, and find partners to support the community in meeting its energy goals, which can include equity assessments, and workforce, economic, and spatial analysis.
Once baseline needs and challenges have been identified for each of the communities, the partnership will shift into the second phase, which will entail energy storage project development and deployment, where up to five communities within this group will be selected to begin installing and commissioning their projects. Support provided by the lab in this phase can include equipment sizing, identifying utility connections, identifying safety concerns, installation support, measurement, and validation to ensure project performance meets the original goals.
The selected participants for the first phase of the initiative are:
The announcement of participating communities is the second major announcement that DOE has made this week regarding energy storage. Just yesterday, DOE, in collaboration with the US Department of Labor and the AFL-CIO, announced that it is investing $5 million to launch a strategy for lithium-battery manufacturing.
The purpose of the investment is to establish a secure end-to-end battery materials and technology supply chain, and reduce American dependence on foreign-made battery products.
Both announcements follow DOE’s recent release of two Notices of Intent authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to provide $3 billion to support projects that bolster domestic battery manufacturing and recycling. The funding, which will be made available in the coming months, will support battery-materials refining, which will bolster domestic refining capacity of minerals such as lithium, as well as production plants, battery cell and pack manufacturing facilities, and recycling facilities.

Each week, the program gains approximately 500 new customers, who voluntarily sign up to pay a premium to have their electricity demand tied to a new renewable energy generation site.
The popularity of the program has caused a boom in solar PV and wind energy for the state. The MIGreenPower program has doubled in enrollment for each of the past three years. To date, customers have already enrolled in 1.8 million MWh, and DTE increased its renewable energy generation by 40% in 2021.
DTE reached 15% renewable energy operations in 2021, which it said represents taking 293,000 passenger cars off the road. By this calculation, the utility’s current operations have the carbon impact of over 1.6 million passenger cars, so the MIGreenPower program’s success thus far is a welcome sign to those who are invested in fighting climate change-causing carbon emissions.
“Our customers are demanding a Grid of the Future, a modern new grid delivering clean and reliable energy, and we’re delivering it.” Jerry Norcia, president and CEO, DTE Energy.
Several projects are underway to meet the demand. Ranging from about 20MW, like the landfill-capping site in Washtenaw County, to 100MW or larger projects in rural areas in the state. MIGreenPower serves both residential and commercial customers and has numerous industrial energy purchasers. DTE said it plans to double its renewable energy generation by 2025, investing $3 billion in renewable infrastructure in the process.
The company issued a request for proposals (RFP) in February, calling for 500MW of solar PV or wind energy projects. The projects must be ready to achieve commercial operations by 2023, to be interconnected with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid. Bids are due April 29, 2022, and the company said it anticipates executing contracts this summer.
The Michigan Public Service Council (MPSC) said in an annual report that by the end of 2022, the state is expected to have 3,554 MW of operational renewable energy in response to the renewable energy standard. The MPSC said it expects the following renewable projects to come online this year:
These projects would result in 725MW of new utility-scale generation.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) ranks Michigan 26th in solar deployment, with 599.4MW reported through Q3 2021. An estimated over 400MW was deployed in the state in 2021 alone, an indication that it may be yet another market set to expand rapidly. The state holds about 185 solar companies, including 65 manufacturers, 68 installer/developers, and 52 others, employing a combined total of 3,379 people.

Ampyr Energy USA has a goal of building a 5GW utility-scale solar PV platform across multiple US markets.
The two partners formed Ampyr Solar Europe (ASE) two years ago with the goal of rolling out 5GW of large-scale solar projects, with aims to establish itself as one of the largest utility-scale solar platforms in Europe. Ampyr Energy has operations and assets in Europe, India, Australia, and specializes in renewable power, battery storage and other network and non-network solutions to customers. Hartree Partners is a global energy and commodities trading company, specialized in finding investment solutions, consulting, and generating sustainable and commercially viable strategies for energy renewal and regeneration. The company has a portfolio that includes midstream natural gas, oil assets, power generation, renewables, and environmental products.
The new venture, Ampyr Energy USA, headquartered in New York, combines AGP’s experience in developing large-scale renewable power projects globally, and Hartree’s expertise in power trading analytics and zero-carbon solutions and now has its eye on bringing that experience to what they perceive as a burgeoning market in the US.
“With the Federal and State goals for accelerating the energy transition, the US will be one of the fastest growing solar markets in the world and a core strategic priority in realizing AMPYR’s ambition of becoming one of the largest independent renewables developer and operator globally.” Saurabh Beniwal, Partner at AGP and Board Chair for Ampyr USA.
Ampyr Solar Energy currently has numerous projects in the pipeline in Europe. For example, ASE partnered with Hartree and Naga Solar to develop 4GW of PPA-linked ground-mounted solar projects across the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. Leveraging Hartree’s expertise, the joint venture is expected offer different types of PPAs with the standard term being 10-12 years and smaller projects as short as five years. ASE is also building a 9MW solar-plus-storage project at the Edinburgh Airport with local construction partner Absolute Solar & Wind. The project will include 5MW of battery storage and 40 EV charging points, and the airport will purchase the power through a long-term power purchase agreement with ASE.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/22/helping-us-utilities-target-grid-resilience-with-digitalization/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 22, 2022",Helping US utilities target grid resilience with digitalization,"The US has committed to ambitious targets: reduce net greenhouse gas emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and reach 100% clean electricity by 2035. These goals involve an integrated strategy of investment, innovation, and new technology deployment not just for transmission but also for distribution networks.
To accomplish this, the current US administration allocated approximately US$500 billion to fund the development of new infrastructure over the next five years, through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in the framework of the Build Back Better Act.
Power distribution networks are often the less visible side of the electricity system, but they are on track to undergo a major digitalization and modernization into smarter grids. Distribution grid infrastructure investments can enhance resilience, improve reliability, better integrate renewable generation sources, lower electricity costs, and unlock the best clean energy resources by connecting them to demand centers.
Grid resilience has been associated in the last few years with the transformation of infrastructure to withstand more severe and frequent climate events that increasingly affect the US due to changes in climate patterns. The electrical system in many parts of the US has been impacted by hurricanes, wildfires, thunderstorms, and other extreme weather events, leading to outages.
But resilience today means more than adapting power infrastructures to climate change. In many parts of the country, utilities are no longer the dominant producers of electricity, and generation from distributed energy resources (DERs) has increased exponentially also thanks to the 2035 goal to eliminate carbon emissions set by the Biden administration.
The adoption of DERs such as rooftop solar, customer-sited energy storage, and electric vehicles, is growing rapidly. This growth is supported by a change in electricity customer needs and expectations and their interest in reducing energy bills. However, effective integration of DERs requires visibility to and controllability by the distribution grid operator at a local level and that’s why modernizing the grid’s core components is vital.
Moreover, a report from the American Society of Civil Engineers states that 70% of transmission and distribution lines in the US are old, already in the second half of their expected 50-year lifespan.
According to US federal data, the number of large, sustained outages have increased in frequency over the past two decades. For comparison, there were less than two dozen major disruptions in 2000, whereas 2020 saw the number surpass 180.
Severe weather, coupled with an aging and overstressed electrical infrastructure, is having a dramatic impact on the population and is increasing the need to deploy technologies that can mitigate future power outages, save lives, and protect property.
Having resilient and reliable power is critical for vital services such as healthcare, transportation, and financial systems. When smart technologies are in place, power outages can be avoided and lives, homes, and businesses are protected.
Gridspertise, a new company born out of Enel, the world’s largest privately-owned operator of power distribution grids with more than 20 years of expertise in the field, is ready to contribute significantly to this plan.
The NewCo offers innovative, flexible, sustainable, and integrated solutions and services, in three main areas of transformation:
With the aim of being a trusted partner for utilities worldwide and supporting the digital transformation of networks into sustainable and reliable smart grids, Gridspertise offers solutions that address these needs through cloud and edge platform technologies, providing benefits for the entire North American electric ecosystem:
In the past months, Gridspertise announced the signing of 13 agreements for more than 670,000 smart meters and over 150,000 field devices and accessories across four European countries.
Gridspertise also presented the QEd, a revolutionary all-in-one solution that virtualizes key grid functionalities through customizable applications. Thanks to a multi-purpose edge platform, the required components in the secondary substation as well as the number of field interventions can be reduced.
The QEd leverages Qualcomm Technologies’ industrial-grade IoT solutions featuring the latest 5G, compute, security, and AI capabilities.
The two companies also announced a new strategic collaboration to explore opportunities for the joint development of new solutions to digitally transform electric utilities, taking into account the US market needs.
Gridspertise will participate in Distributech International in Dallas from May 23-25 as a sponsor, opening the event with an introductory speech at the Breakfast Roundtable and showcasing its expertise in grid edge digital solutions for grid resilience at its booth. This represents a great opportunity to get in contact with US utilities and establish new partnerships to accelerate the electric future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/22/nextracker-unveils-terrain-forming-xtr-tracker/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 22, 2022",Nextracker unveils all-terrain tracker,"While the significant cost reductions seen across the solar industry in the last decade-plus have allowed the resource to expand exponentially in a relatively short period of time, this same growth has led to an issue that is only set to grow as each new project is built: flat, even land, the kind most optimal for development, won’t be available forever.
When developers need flat land that they just don’t have, they have historically turned to land grading, the effective and established process of excavating the dirt around a project site and moving it to create an area of even, level terrain.
This issue has only been exacerbated by the high adoption rates of single-axis trackers, which can promise solar project yield gains up to 35% more than conventional systems, when paired with other breakthrough technologies, like bifacial panels. These trackers, however, require the rows of panels mounted upon them to be at the exact same height and angle, requiring significant earthwork and longer foundation pile lengths, all of which add to project costs.
Developers faced with an uneven project terrain profile can encounter land grading cost estimates of more than 5% of total project budget, and that’s before the considerations of wind-blown dust, rainwater erosion, and any other relevant environmental variables are taken into account, which can all further drive up costs.
Hearing the concerns of site terrain and project land grading come up time and time again in conversations with customers, Nextracker decided to tackle the issues of sloping and undulating terrain head-on. The company has created the NX Horizon-XTR, a terrain-following, single-axis tracker built specifically for projects located on sites with sloped, uneven, and challenging terrain.

“It’s often the case where we have customers that identify needs,” Nextracker CEO and Founder, Dan Shugar, told pv magazine in an exclusive interview. “So we had a customer about three and a half years ago, Swinerton (now SOLV), and they said, ‘Hey, your tracker is much more adaptive to terrain than you’re allowing in the specification, and we think there can be a lot of value there.'”
From that initial observation, the Nextracker team went to the lab to turn an ancillary strength into the main selling point for what the company hopes will be a market-shaping product. The breakthrough was initially enabled by Nextracker’s self-contained tracker motor, which allows each tracker row in an installation to operate independently from all of the other rows, referred to as adaptive tracking.
“[Adaptive tracking] allowed a whole range of benefits: we could self power the tracker with a little solar panel, instead of hooking up to the grid, and each row could be independent, meaning you could drive through the system for vegetation management, cleaning, maintenance on solar panels, or during construction,” shared Shugar “So if you’re on an if you’re on a hilly site, in the morning and sun’s on the east side, all of your trackers can all be at the ideal angle.”
Before adaptive tracking, tracker controls were largely on the project-level, meaning that if the angle for one row was adjusted, the angles of all modules across the project were adjusted.

When tracker controls are made more modular in nature, it allows for inter-row tweaks in layout and design, since the modules in that row can now be programmed to track at different angles over a different time period than even the other, adjacent rows.
To test the capabilities and new design requirements of the XTR, Nextracker reached out to SOLV, as well as a handful of other longtime partners, to pilot test the new product and provide notes to improve it.
“We did multiple pilot projects, we did a tremendous amount of engineering and reliability studies and monitoring,” Shugar explained. “And we launched this product called XTR: Extreme Terrain following. Essentially, what it allows you to do is to radically reduce the amount of earthwork you know, bulldozers, civil engineering, civil activity that happens on most sites, which radically reduces cost.”
“Once the engineering was validated and the tests were done, we supplied [XTR to] several dozen projects that are either completed or are under construction. We gave a few years of exclusivity on this, and then we’ve rolled it out to the rest of the industry, and we’ve had a tremendous amount of uptake.”
The result is a complete overhaul of traditional tracker design. Historically, all trackers in a row have been set to a standard plane, with the piers supporting the tracker and module units being installed at different lengths and depths to achieve that plane while maintaining structural and operational stability.
With XTR, the level plane philosophy has been discarded, and the design allows tracker rows to contour exactly to each row’s differing ground slope undulations.
The new usage cases unlocked by trackers that do not require a certain low-level land gradient are yet to be fully realized, but full of potential.
A 2021 study by Dr. Matthias Fripp, associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, found that unlocking slopes of up to 20% gradient would make achieving the island’s renewable energy goals (100% by 2045) with solar the lowest-cost solution, while also keeping intact the majority of the island’s valuable agricultural land, a common point of contention between solar developers and the communities that house their projects.
Since those initial partner pilots, XTR has been constructed on over 3GW of cumulative projects, with more projects under construction or in late-stage development around the world. Existing installations utilizing the technology include SOLV’s Tygate 1 and 2 projects in Texas, which are 343MW and 258MW, respectively; SOLV’s Prospero 1 and 2 projects in Texas, which are 379MW and 326MW, respectively; and SOLV’s 68MW Broad River project, located in North Carolina.
By conforming to the existing ups and downs of north-south ground slope undulations, XTR sites have seen 30-90% less “cut and fill” earthmoving work, considerably reducing operating expenses and capital expenditures.
Less groundwork also means less disruption of the natural site where a project is located, a critical aspect for those, like Shugar, who believe that a solar installation should exist as harmoniously as possible with its surrounding environment.
“It accelerates the project, reduces risk, and saves in the operations and maintenance phase, because there’s less receding and vegetation management issues,” Shugar said. “Speaking, as an environmentalist, the topsoil is very fragile. A lot of the value of the topsoil is just in the upper strata of a few inches, you really don’t want to disturb that. And this technology allows that.”
