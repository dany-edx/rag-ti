The report said that green banks leveraged $1.69 billion of total investment by using $442 million of green bank funds. This brings cumulative green bank investment to $7 billion using $1.9 billion in green bank funds.
In 2020, the American Green Bank Consortium added five new green banks as members and said that government officials, local leaders, and market actors across 22 states were actively exploring or taking steps to develop green banks.
The report also stressed the value of federal green bank proposals proposed by Sens. Markey (D-Mass.) and Van Hollen (D-Md.) in the National Climate Bank Act (S. 283), and by Rep. Dingell (D-Mich.) in the Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator Act (H.R. 806).
Both bills would provide an initial capitalization of $100 billion to leverage the green bank model to deploy clean energy infrastructure. The Coalition for Green Capital has identified more than 100 different types of jobs that accelerator investment would support.
One of the newest green banks is the Philadelphia Green Capital Corp., which will be an affiliate of the Philadelphia Energy Authority. The authority runs solar, energy efficiency, and workforce development programs and has spurred $167 million of clean energy investments to date. Green Capital will scale and amplify this work by using green bank tools to unlock capital for clean energy projects.
With an official public launch planned for this summer, Green Capital plans to offer four products: predevelopment loans and term loans for non-profits and multifamily buildings, a revolving solar renewable energy certificate fund, and loans for low-income homeowners installing solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/11/dominion-buys-solar-developer-birdseye-renewable/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,VIRGINIA",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 11, 2021",Dominion buys solar developer Birdseye Renewable,"Dominion Energy entered into a definitive agreement to buy utility-scale solar developer Birdseye Renewable Energy.
Birdseye has developed 1 GW of operating and contracted assets and has an active solar and storage development pipeline. For Dominion, Birdseye will support the development of regulated and long-term contracted solar and storage projects.
A critical point of the sale, and something that both companies highlighted, is Birdseye’s emphasis on collaboration with the local communities where they work. This is especially critical for Dominion, as much of the company’s service area is in Virginia, a state that has seen many battles over solar projects.
The 2019 saga of sPower’s proposed 500 MW solar project in Spotsylvania county, Virginia, was perhaps the most visible instance of a Virginia community at odds with a large-scale solar installation. However, earlier this month, the Culpeper County Board of Supervisors, following a public comment period rejected Strata Solar’s proposed 150 MW Maroon Solar Facility.
This acquisition by Dominion could well have been facilitated in order to ensure, or at least improve, community support for the utility’s future solar endeavors.
Onpeak Capital served as the exclusive financial advisor to Birdseye during the course of the transaction.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/11/sunrise-brief-gaf-energy-will-shift-solar-roof-production-from-asia-to-silicon-valley/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 11, 2021",Sunrise brief: GAF Energy will shift solar roof production from Asia to Silicon Valley,"GAF Energy said it plans to move its manufacturing out of Asia to a new facility in California as it develops technology to integrate solar panels with roof shingles.
Components for GAF Energy’s building-integrated solar products are produced in South Korea, but manufacturing will be moved to a renovated 112,000-squre-foot San Jose, California, factory later this year.
The facility will employ about 400 people in manufacturing, engineering, and research and development, and be capable of producing about 50 MW of solar panels a year.
GAF Energy reportedly expects to benefit from reduced risks associated with offshore production, including tariffs on Asian-made solar goods and rising transportation costs.
GAF Energy launched in 2019 and is a unit of Standard Industries, a privately held global industrial company. GAF has installed its product on more than 2,000 U.S. rooftops.
Pivot Energy and Standard Solar are developing three new community solar projects in Colorado with a total capacity of 4 MW.
One megawatt of the portfolio is dedicated to serving low-income subscribers. The remaining 3 MW have been subscribed to by local municipalities and organizations. Pivot Energy developed and built the solar gardens and will provide customer management services. Standard Solar will finance, own, and maintain the systems.
Two solar gardens, located in Garfield County in west central Colorado, will come online in June 2021. The third project, located just west of Denver in Jefferson County, will be energized later this summer.
A $50 million hurricane-resistant battery energy storage system is coming to the Caribbean island of Dominica through an investment by the UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund. The project includes a 5 MW/2.5 MWh battery energy storage system.
The system is intended to stabilize the electricity grid and deliver reserve power and frequency control to the extreme weather-prone nation.
Dominica is building a 7 MW geothermal plant to help drive the country’s energy mix to 51% renewables. One government program enables foreign investors to obtain Dominica’s citizenship in exchange for a $100,000 investment to the Economic Diversification Fund, or $200,000 into pre-approved luxury real estate that supports Dominica’s ecotourism.
Dominica uses the investments for energy security, infrastructure, and housing as it aims to be one of the world’s first climate-resilient nations, as pledged by the government after Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017.
The UAE-CREF initiative is financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, the UAE’s national entity for international development aid. The fund is a partnership between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and Masdar, which is leading project design and implementation. In March 2019, the first three renewable energy projects were inaugurated.
Carbon Neutral Energy is opening a U.S. office in Texas, two months after launching in the UK. The company is pursuing market opportunities for mobile energy storage systems, which it said could help prevent emergencies like the loss of power in Texas earlier this year.
CNE uses mobile, modular energy storage systems with battery storage from 1 MW to 5 MW to address inadequacy in power infrastructure. The company also has launched a £300m ($424.5 million) fundraising effort.
