The funds will support the training of 1,500 solar professionals.
The program will build upon Dimension’s existing work partnering with local non-profits, high schools, community colleges, and adult education centers to deliver in-classroom solar installation instruction, hands-on basic solar construction skills, and OSHA safety certification.
A report from the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) said about two-thirds of U.S. solar jobs are at installation and project development firms. The industry reached 263,883 solar workers in 2022, 33,400 of which are manufacturing jobs.
IREC said that 44% of solar industry employers reported in a survey that it was “very difficult” to find qualified applicants for solar in 2022. Workforce development programs are one pathway to ensuring a steady supply of skilled labor.
“As a community solar developer, ‘community’ is core to who we are,” said Bryan Bentrott, vice president, origination, Dimension. “We believe in making clean energy more accessible to everyone, and are committed to workforce development that helps localize the economic benefits of our projects.”
Dimension installs its projects via a community solar model, which typically allows customers to subscribe to a portion of a solar facility’s generation in exchange for credits on their utility bill. The Department of Energy said customers can typically expect to see 10% to 20% savings on their bill from enrolling in community solar.
“By empowering residents to participate directly in community solar, here in New Jersey, and more broadly at all of our sites across the country, Dimension is creating opportunities for upward employment mobility in the communities we serve,” said Bentrott.
To meet workforce and apprenticeship requirements set out by the Investment Tax Credit, developers must ensure that 15% of the labor performed in a project is by qualified apprentices. If the labor threshold is met, the base 6% Investment Tax Credit for renewable energy projects is raised to 30%.
IREC said the solar industry expects total U.S. installations will multiply fivefold in the next 10 years, from 141 GW in 2022 to over 700 GW in 2033. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) predicts the total number of solar jobs could more than double, reaching 538,000 by 2032.
Dimension recently celebrated the installation of 14 MW of community solar installations in New Jersey. The projects will supply local clean energy to more than 2,500 households in Public Service Energy and Gas (PSEG) territory, including more than 1,300 low- and moderate-income subscribers. Dimension expects the facilities to generate more than $550,000 in annual energy savings for subscribers, leading to an average savings of $220 per year.
Dimension is a developer, owner, and operator of over 250 MW of solar, investing over $400 million in its solar assets. The company stated plans to invest an additional $2.5 billion over the next five years, with 2.2 GW of assets in development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/13/could-blue-hydrogen-offer-a-pragmatic-transition-to-green-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"DECEMBER 13, 2023",Could blue hydrogen offer a ‘pragmatic transition’ to green hydrogen?,"Blue hydrogen – a form of the resource produced from fossil fuels, where the carbon dioxide is then captured and stored – could provide a “pragmatic transition” to green hydrogen, and offers an unsubsidized levelized cost that is two to three times lower than that of green hydrogen, but with elevated emissions intensities, according to a new report from Enverus Intelligence Research.
Most hydrogen today is made using fossil fuels, the bulk of which use steam methane reformers, Alex Nevokshonoff, senior associate at Enverus Intelligence Research, told pv magazine USA. This process essentially reacts steam with methane to produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The hydrogen is termed “blue hydrogen” if the carbon dioxide molecules are then captured and stored, Nevokshonoff said. 
“Although more carbon intensive than green hydrogen production, blue hydrogen projects provide a practical and economical pathway to clean hydrogen adoption,” Nevokshonoff said.
Clean hydrogen could play an important role in decarbonizing the U.S. energy system, as well industrial, chemical and heavy transportation sectors. Hydrogen can also be created by using excess renewable energy, like solar, to run electrolyzers. In August, the Biden-Harris Administration created an inter-agency hydrogen task force to create a “whole of government” approach to deploying the resource. But ramping up the clean hydrogen economy will also depend in part on reducing the levelized cost of solar energy, some experts say. 
Blue hydrogen technologies can currently tap into multiple incentives in the U.S. The 45V production tax credit offers $0.60/kg and $3/kg for hydrogen produced with a carbon intensity lower then 4.0 kgCO2e/kgH2, Nevokshonoff said, while the 48 investment tax credit offers between 6% and 30% of the capital spend for hydrogen projects that produce hydrogen with a carbon intensity lower than 4.0 kgCO2e/kgH2. There’s also the 45Q carbon capture, utilization and storage tax credit, that offers carbon dioxide emitters $85 for every tonne of CO2 that is captured and sequestered.
However, ramping up the production of blue hydrogen in the U.S. will face some challenges, including managing opposing public sentiment toward carbon capture technologies and using fossil fuels to produce hydrogen, as well as determining appropriate use cases for hydrogen where other alternatives, like electrification, are not more appropriate, he said. 
“Securing long-term offtake contracts, which are essential to reaching final investment decision on projects,” will also be a challenge, Nevokshonoff said, as will ensuring the appropriate infrastructure to transport carbon dioxide and hydrogen. 
But some stakeholders remain skeptical of blue hydrogen. In September, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis issued a report that concluded the U.S. government could be significantly understating the global warming impact of producing hydrogen from fossil fuels. The authors took a closer look at the carbon intensity of blue hydrogen – defined as being produced from natural gas or coal, both of which contain methane – and studied its potential methane emission rates, leakage, as well as the effectiveness of carbon capture technologies. It eventually determined that producing hydrogen from natural gas is not a low-carbon solution.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/13/enphase-launches-three-phase-inverter/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 13, 2023",Enphase launches three-phase inverter,"Microinverter manufacturer Enphase has officially launched its dedicated 208V three-phase offering. The company says a focused support team, evolving hardware, financial solutions, and design tools are being made available for small business solar projects. The manufacturer says system sized blocks of 200 kW will most efficiently maximize their hardware on a cost-per-watt basis.
Previously, 240V single-phase residential Enphase inverters could be configured into 208V three-phase commercial systems. However, this required meticulous system design and additional “Q Cables”. The new 208V system offers more flexibility in string design and simplifies installation with a new four-wire 208V Q Cable.

Eric Bergman, Commercial and Industrial Sales Director at Enphase, touted the advantages of the new system to pv magazine USA. Bergman explained that installers used to have to “physically land the output of the micros evenly across the three phases of the site.”
Installations also used to require a network protection relay, necessitating an external enclosure. The new IQ8 C&I microinverter comes with the 4-wire QD Cable, which integrates phase balancing, V/F ride-through, and loss of phase detection – functions previously managed externally by the Network Protection Relay.
Enphase anticipates that all hardware and associated equipment will be classified as domestic content, potentially qualifying for the 10% Inflation Reduction Act tax credit adder. However, the definitive guidance from the Internal Revenue Service is still pending.
U.S. production of the commercial inverter is set to begin in the first quarter of 2024. Enphase is initially focusing on the core functionalities of the 208V equipment, with plans to introduce additional features like grid-tied load support, energy storage integration, and 480V three-phase support in the future.
Bergman highlighted another benefit: a large, skilled workforce is already trained to sell and install these systems:
Right now, the nation is seeing a bit of a slowdown in residential solar sales. At the same time, commercial solar contractors are having a challenging time finding installation crews. The 208V gear gives both groups multiple opportunities. Residential installers who’ve been installing Enphase their whole careers can be tapped by commercial groups to help them deploy these systems, or sell to small businesses on their own.

Enphase has also developed new software tools. The first, Fleet View, allows commercial installers to monitor and manage all Enphase installations at a module level. There is also a kiosk feature, which provides a public-facing website for remote monitoring of solar power systems. Additionally, Enphase’s SolarGraf, solar design software acquired in 2021, has been optimized for their products.

Another innovative software feature from Enphase is a new financing option. This option becomes available once a design is completed in SolarGraf. Users can then apply for a lease directly through Bank of Montreal, integrated with the SolarGraf platform. The bank offers two seven-year lease products: one that enables the bank to claim the tax credits, while the other option leaves the tax credits with the business owner. For projects valued at less than $150,000 the application process is swift, with responses typically provided within 24 hours. For larger projects, the approval process may take up to two or three days.

Bergman views the bank’s involvement as a testament to Enphase’s reputation. He believes the bank sees Enphase as an “investment grade inverter, if you will.”
Enphase has already deployed fifteen 208V sites in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada during their beta program. Bergman, an expert with extensive experience in commercial inverters, reported impressive efficiency in the installations, said “If we look at our entire beta testing installation portfolio for our C&I products, each site took on average approximately 30 minutes to commission and 100% of the sites required only one truck roll to complete.”
This article was amended to state that previously, 240V (not 120V) single-phase residential Enphase inverters could be configured into 208V three-phase commercial systems.

Manufactured in Oxford, Michigan and now being commercialized across the globe, the Gen20 is a portable cabinet equipped with solar, water filtration, and a hot water heater.
The off-grid system can produce 200 gallons per hour of potable water with no need for an external energy source, said Power Panel.
The device has been shipped to crisis zones, like in September 2017, when a Gen20 was sent to Dos Bocas, a mountain community that was severely impacted by the category 5 hurricane Maria. The device helped three families share electricity as they repaired from the damage. A further two Gen20 cabinets were sent to Ukraine in February 2022 to support front line responders and humanitarian efforts.
The device is comprised of four solar modules adding 540 W of peak power. Each module is an HJT N-type module with 28 cells in series per module. The device also contains 2.4 kWh of energy storage via two 12 V lead-acid batteries.
Water can be both filtered and heated by the energy produced by the off-grid device. It contains a 5-micron sediment filter and three 25-foot hoses.
The PV-thermal panels also have a peak thermal generation peak of 2.5 kW and a 52-gallon thermal energy storage tank. An optional water desalination tank can be added to the device.
The device also allows for charging electrical devices, including eight USB type 2 ports and a switch controlled 20 A aux cable.
The dry weight of the portable unit is 450 pounds, but it can be lowered to 242 pounds. for moving by removing the modules. With its 50 gallon tank full, the unit weights 891 pounds. Power Panel said the full unit can be installed from box to operations in under 2 hours.
The product, made in the USA, is expected to qualify for the 10% domestic content tax credit bonus laid out by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Power Panel originates from a long line of innovative American businesses run by its president Rob Kornahrens. Kornahrens opened a roofing business 40 years ago, followed by an air conditioning division in 1994, a solar installation business Advanced Green Technologies in 2005, and Power Panel in 2015. Advanced Green Technologies is among the largest rooftop solar installers in Florida.

Terravis Energy, a subsidiary of Canadian technology company Worksport Ltd., has presented a prototype of a residential air source heat pump intended for use in heating and cooling applications.
“Our heat pump utilizes the phase change of a proprietary fluid to transfer heat,” the company’s CEO, Lorenzo Rossi, told pv magazine. “The prototype is currently undergoing testing in Worksport’s climate chamber in Toronto.”
The company conducted tests at its facility in Ontario to monitor the system performance across a range of 12 temperature points from -10 C to -35 C. It also tested refrigerant pressure zones, airflow, and the energy consumption of all heat pump components. Furthermore, it said conventional heat pumps on the market are not efficient at providing sufficient comfort levels at temperatures under -20 C.
“Our heat pump’s goal is to provide heat to homes in as low as -35 C, which we believe will make us the most effective heat pump technology in the market,” Rossi added.
The heat pump showed a coefficient of performance (COP) of around 1.8 and a seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) of approximately 3.0. “It’s essential to note that these values are influenced by our local climate conditions and might differ in other regions”, Rossi explained.
The prototype is currently using R32 refrigerant, which has a global warming potential (GWP) of 675, which the company said aligns with the new mandate for 2024 requiring refrigerants to have a GWP of 750 or less in Canada.
The company also said the heat pump system doesn’t utilize expensive electric resistance heating.
“The price of the Terravis Energy heat pump is expected to align with current market offerings, though it might be slightly higher, in the range of $1,000 to $2,000,” Rossi stressed. “This increase can be attributed to the advanced technology and AI software embedded in the motherboard, as well as the inclusion of new hardware components, which contribute to its advanced features and capabilities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/13/fostering-a-mindset-of-innovation-and-inclusivity-for-the-renewable-energy-future/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 13, 2023",Fostering a mindset of innovation and inclusivity for the renewable energy future,"According to the latest World Energy Outlook 2023 from the International Energy Agency (IEA), clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, electric cars, and heat pumps are reshaping how we power our world. By 2030, the IEA foresees almost ten times more electric cars on the roads, solar generating more electricity than the entire current US power system, and renewables nearing a 50% share of the global electricity mix.
While developed countries like the EU, the U.S., and Canada are leading the way in decarbonization and electrification efforts, the challenge lies in extending these benefits to developing nations around the globe. The IEA’s projections highlight the urgency of addressing worldwide energy challenges, exploring progressive battery chemistries, and emphasizing the need for international cooperation to accelerate a clean energy future.
The unequal distribution of clean air and water worldwide highlights the need for equitable access to carbon-neutral energy. Although we have seen commendable progress, such as the share of the global population without reliable electricity access dropping by more than half between 2000 and 2023, challenges persist as 746 million individuals still lacked access to electricity in 2023. Across the globe, communities grapple with an uneven distribution of environmental resources, exacerbating health risks and perpetuating a cycle of inequality. Regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia heavily depend on diesel and coal, contributing to disproportionate environmental and wellness impacts on vulnerable populations.
Pollution-related challenges continue to affect those with fewer resources, amplifying existing social disparities. Delving into the root causes of pollution unveils deeper systemic issues, including unequal supply distribution and inadequate infrastructure. Ensuring equitable access means guaranteeing that the benefits of the energy transition are not exclusive to privileged countries but are extended to every individual and community, allowing them to benefit from cleaner energy sources.
Beyond lithium-ion
Lithium-ion batteries, currently the dominant player in energy storage, have multiple limitations. The production of lithium-ion batteries greatly impacts the environment because extracting materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel can cause significant deforestation and water pollution. The resources for these batteries are often found in vulnerable, developing countries, further highlighting the risks of exploitation. The mining process also raises ethical concerns because it has been linked to child labor and human rights violations, demonstrating that there are problems with the entire supply chain.
Lithium-ion batteries are expensive because making them involves complex processes, and the materials are costly to extract and refine. The increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy storage adds to their relatively high market price. The intricate manufacturing methods and stringent safety standards further contribute to their overall cost, making lithium-ion batteries less affordable, especially with the rising interest in EVs and renewable energy solutions in richer nations.
The increasing demand for EVs is causing concern, especially among communities facing socio-economic challenges, due to the limited global supply of critical materials required to produce lithium-ion batteries. S&P Global Mobility projects that EV sales will reach around 40–50% of total passenger car sales by 2030 in the United States. The growing popularity raises issues about the long-term sustainability of lithium-ion technology. It highlights the need to explore alternative battery chemistries that use more sustainable and readily available materials.
Beyond resource scarcity, there are also end-of-life challenges. Despite the evolving recycling methods for lithium-ion batteries, recovering materials still requires significant energy. This further accentuates challenges about the technology’s overall environmental footprint. Considering the drawbacks of lithium-ion batteries, it is crucial to invest in and explore alternative battery chemistries that address issues related to the environment, ethics, and resources. If we are to sufficiently foster an inclusive clean energy future, the well-being of vulnerable populations and landscapes must be prioritized as decisions on new technologies are made.
Innovative approaches to energy storage
Exploring alternative battery chemistries is critical to addressing the restraints brought on by current technologies. The environmental impact and supply challenges associated with lithium-ion batteries emphasize a need for innovative approaches to energy storage. Research must focus on discovering new battery technologies and chemistries that offer greater sustainability and cost-effectiveness while reducing environmental impact.
Researchers and innovators aim to uncover materials and processes that present unique advantages regarding resource efficiency, longevity, affordability, and ethical considerations by investigating beyond traditional lithium-ion. Innovation is at the heart of this exploration as it is the driving force behind sustainable energy solutions. Start-ups are already advancing battery technology and demonstrating creative thinking and problem-solving skills to shape a cleaner, more equitable, and more resilient energy future.

German inverter maker SMA Solar Technology AG plans to build an inverter factory at an unspecified location in the United States.
The company said the new manufacturing facility will use production equipment that was originally intended for its production site in Thalheim, Germany.
The factory will likely be operational in 2025 and will have an annual capacity of 3.5 GW.
Discussions are currently underway “with several federal states and potential partners to find the most strategically advantageous production location and the right approach,” the company said, noting that up to 200 new jobs will be created in the first three years.
“The U.S. is a key market for SMA, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers an extraordinary opportunity for long-term growth,” said CEO Jürgen Reinert. “With this step, we will significantly strengthen our market share in the USA and set the course for SMA’s future growth.”
SMA is also pushing ahead with capacity expansion in Germany, where it plans to reach 40 GW. It said it wants to produce solutions for large PV projects and storage systems from 2025 at its Niestetal site, for use in global markets.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/13/the-rise-of-the-battery-belt/,"SPONSORED POST,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 13, 2023",The Rise of the Battery Belt,"Predictions of an American manufacturing renaissance in the Midwest ─ once commonly referred to as the “Factory Belt” ─ haven’t materialized. Instead, global manufacturers are overwhelmingly migrating to the South, shifting the US economic center of gravity and creating new green jobs ─ and lots of them. This “Battery Belt” is a geographic cluster of manufacturers that is rapidly establishing a new, ever-expanding domestic cleantech supply chain.
The Battery Belt didn’t come about by chance ─ it’s a direct attempt by manufacturers to resolve supply chain vulnerabilities that were exposed in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the cost of supply chain disruption has continued to climb, manufacturers have taken action to reduce risk by opening facilities closer to the end markets they serve.
The vast majority of battery capital is currently flowing into just a handful of states, including Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky, which begs the question: Why these states?
For the most part, it comes down to logistics and where manufacturers can find the best value for their dollar. States in the Battery Belt offer the right interplay of factors for advanced manufacturing, including large, available tracts of land near critical infrastructure like highways, which simplify the transportation of raw and finished goods.
These states also offer high-quality, skilled labor pools at competitive costs. Additionally, the regions are seen as up-and-coming research and development hubs that are conducive to business investment. Manufacturers tend to cluster near existing facilities to take advantage of specialized infrastructure and increased supply chain efficiency, meaning that the Battery Belt is likely to keep expanding, along with the demand for batteries.
The Battery Belt is a critical part of US industrial growth and offers a range of positive spillover effects for battery-dependent industries, most notably electric vehicles (EV) and battery energy storage. This growing network of battery providers reduces the number of imports needed from countries like China, while minimizing supply bottlenecks and delays, ensuring a consistent, profitable, and resilient supply chain.
