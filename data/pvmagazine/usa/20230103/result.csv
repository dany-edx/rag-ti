https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/03/michigan-utility-doubles-distributed-generation-cap/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MICHIGAN",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 3, 2023",Michigan utility doubles distributed generation cap,"Consumers Energy, an investor-owned utility serving over 6 million customers in Michigan, filed a settlement agreement with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) in its 2022 rate case. The utility now awaits MPSC’s approval on the settlement agreement.
Under the settlement, which was arrived at in late December, Consumers agreed to raise its cap on distributed generation in its service territory from 2% to 4% of total generation.
The cap was one of the most restrictive distributed energy ratemaking rules in the nation and had come under fire from solar advocates and environmentalists since it was placed in 2008. Members of Vote Solar, the Ecology Center, and the Environmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC) worked in tandem to advocate for this outcome.
“Raising the cap on distributed resource generation has been a long time coming, and we’re thrilled to have this increase included in the agreement,” said Will Kenworthy, Midwest regulatory director at Vote Solar.
Though the cap has been raised, a 4% limit still places a low ceiling for a rooftop solar, which is in increasingly higher demand and offers many ratepayers significant bill savings.
“Legislation to permanently eliminate the cap and accelerate solar growth for all Michiganders is still the ideal outcome, and our sights remain set on making it a reality,” said Kenworthy.
Also in the Consumers Energy settlement was the agreement to increase the value of credit for exporting excess distributed energy back to the grid, often referred to as net metering. The new includes transmission costs in the outflow credit, offering what Vote Solar called a fairer compensation rate for solar energy that homeowners produce but do not self-consume.
The settlement also added a community solar pilot proposal that will be implemented when Consumers Energy files its Voluntary Green Pricing proposal before October 2023. Vote Solar said while all Michigan utilities are required to offer Voluntary Green Pricing programs to their customers, eligibility is largely limited by the utility’s offerings. This often leaves renters, low-income households, and those in non-traditional housing locked out of participation.
“Community solar can unlock the economic and environmental benefits of solar power for those who might otherwise face barriers to clean energy access,” said Charles Griffith, climate and energy program Director, the Ecology Center. “It has a vital role to play in closing disparities in clean energy adoption.”
Consumers also pledged to incorporate equity into its distribution grid planning. It promised to conduct an analysis of energy reliability in underserved communities and to improve its stakeholder outreach processes, providing ratepayers with opportunities to engage on issues that impact them.
The analysis Consumers pledged to conduct will shed light on current inequitable service and hosting capability,” said Daniel Abrams, attorney, ELPC, “The next step is fixing these issues with an increased focus on investment in these communities.”
Finally, the settlement introduced electric vehicle rulemaking improvements and expanded programs. The utility will expand its residential PowerMIDrive pilot to a permanent program and will increase rebate amounts. The program will add more options to facilitate charging for low-income customers and residents at multi-family housing.
“With more and more EVs coming on the market, we need to ensure that charging opportunities are available to everyone that wants to drive electric,” said Griffith.  “This will ensure that we expand access to the benefits of EVs–such as lower fueling costs and cleaner air–for all communities.”
Vote Solar and its affiliates celebrated the win and look forward to an approval from the MPSC. “This voluntary increase is a big step forward and an indication of more progress to come,” said Kenworthy.

In 2022, Luminia (formerly SD Renewables), offered financing solutions that catered to commercial property owners across 36 states with diverse needs. Its solutions range from multi-family and industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) portfolios to private education institutions and agricultural projects.
The company enables property owners to gain access to a range of sustainability and asset value improvements, such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and water conservation improvements. The projects it supports vary in size and scope to meet individual state and municipal requirements with an average project size of 9.5 MW. The five key markets for the company are Massachusetts, New York, Maine, New Hampshire and New Jersey. In Maine, during 2022 Luminia closed a 15 MW of community solar project with NH Solar Garden, providing access to intermediate and long-term financing.
Luminia continues to expand its suite of financial offerings catered to large commercial portfolio owners. “Our team brings decades of experience as owners and lessors of tenant-occupied commercial real estate. Our REIT-friendly financing structures allow landlords to efficiently share the benefits of solar with their tenants, enabling both landlords and tenants to profitably accelerate solar adoption and meet their ESG objectives,” said Jim Kelly, co-founder of Luminia. “In addition, our strategic focus on community solar provides yet another option for our portfolio clients to monetize their rooftops.”
“By eliminating the financing barriers that once hindered commercial solar progress, we are experiencing explosive demand from our top rated solar partners, especially in the burgeoning community solar space,” said David Field, chief executive officer and co-founder of Luminia.
Luminia’s solution was recently launched on Energy Toolbase’s  ETB Developer platform, which helps developers to access power purchase agreement quotes and additional financing options that are intended to match their customers’ needs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/03/north-carolina-carbon-plan-favors-gas-over-solar-plus-storage/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NORTH CAROLINA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 3, 2023",North Carolina carbon plan favors gas over solar-plus-storage,"With North Carolina generating 9% of its electricity from solar, utility Duke Energy and other key parties in the state’s carbon plan proceeding called for deploying at least 3 GW of solar in the state this decade.
Beyond that agreed-upon amount of solar, Duke Energy proposed new natural gas power facilities.
The sustainable energy trade group NCSEA and clean energy group SACE favored an alternative plan that would meet the state’s near-term electricity needs with more solar and storage, plus energy efficiency and demand response, without new fossil generation. Technology firms Apple, Google and Meta also proposed more solar and storage than Duke Energy. Those two plans are shown with green and yellow lines in the SACE graphic below, compared with Duke’s plan shown in dark blue.

Shortly after the deadline for consideration in the 2022 carbon plan, a joint study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Duke Energy was released, showing how North Carolina’s electricity needs could be met by carbon-free resources.
In issuing North Carolina’s first carbon plan order, state regulators said it was “reasonable” for the investor-owned utility to plan new gas units totaling up to 2 GW by 2029.
The carbon plan shows added amounts of solar, storage and gas capacity through 2030 that track “very closely” to the amounts in Duke’s proposal, said SACE Research Director Maggie Shober. As for wind power, regulators made no recommendation, instead calling for further study. Regulators did not make any statement about resources beyond 2030.
Regulators “appear to favor the possibility of new gas if Duke takes the next steps to propose it,” Shober said.
The next carbon plan process will start this September and will be influenced by the Inflation Reduction Act, Shober said. That act provides incentives for solar, wind and storage, and the carbon plan order, she said, directs Duke to “pursue every opportunity that may arise through tax incentives or federal funding to benefit its customers.”
Interconnection
The carbon plan order also directs Duke Energy to construct 14 transmission upgrade projects to facilitate interconnection of solar in an area across parts of North and South Carolina known as a “red zone,” where the needed transmission upgrades are too expensive for any single generation project, Shober said.
The order adds that Duke shall update and improve its local transmission planning process, including by increasing transparency and coordination.
Coal units
The North Carolina law requiring regulators to issue a carbon plan every two years aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from Duke Energy’s electric generating units. Much of the carbon reductions will come as Duke retires coal units. The carbon plan order approved Duke’s proposed schedule for retiring coal units.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/03/new-electrolyzer-to-split-saltwater-into-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,CHINA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 3, 2023",New electrolyzer to split saltwater into hydrogen,"From pv magazine global
Researchers from Shenzhen University and Nanjing Tech University in China have developed a seawater electrolysis system (SES) for the direct electrolysis of seawater, without side reactions or corrosion.
The new method works via self-driven water migration to sidestep the need for a separate desalination process. The energy consumption is purportedly comparable to that of industrial alkaline electrolysis with pure water.
To develop the lab-scale electrolyzer, the scientists separated the two electrode layers with a diaphragm layer and then submerged them in a concentrated hydroxide (OH−) solution – the SDE. They placed a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane between the seawater and the SDE. They claim this design allows the biased diffusion of water vapor, but fully prevents the penetration of liquid seawater and impurity ions such as magnesium, chloride and sulfate.
“During operation, the difference in water vapor pressure between the seawater and the SDE across the membrane provides a driving force for spontaneous seawater gasification (evaporation) at the seawater side and the diffusion of water vapor through the short gas path inside the membrane to the SDE side, where it is re-liquified by absorption by the SDE,” the scientist explained.
The consumption of water in the SDE during electrolysis maintains the pressure difference across the membrane, ensuring the continuous entry of freshwater, without extra energy consumption.
“When the water migration rate equals the electrolysis rate, a new thermodynamic equilibrium is established between the seawater and the SDE, and continuous and stable water migration through a ‘liquid-gas-liquid’ mechanism is realized to provide fresh water for electrolysis,” the researchers said.
The lab-scale electrolyzer steadily produced hydrogen from seawater for more than 72 hours, with average voltages of approximately 1.95 V and 2.3 V at current densities of 250 mA cm−2 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively. After 72 hours, the concentrations of chloride, sulfate, and magnesium impurities were only 0.008%, 0.052%, and 0.089% of the original.
“Calculations show that the electricity expense of [hydrogen] production is approximately 4.6 kWh Nm-3H2 and 5.3 kWh Nm-3H2 at current densities of 250 mA cm−2 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively, which is comparable to that of industrial alkaline electrolysis with pure water,” the scientists claimed.
To prove the concept, they fabricated a scaled-up SES measuring 82 cm x 62 cm x 70.5 cm. It reportedly exhibited stable performance for more than 3,200 hours and energy consumption of approximately 5.0 kWh Nm-3H2, with no detectable increase in impurity ions.
The scientists said their method can be further developed by using other electrolytes able to absorb water vapor and conduct ions, or high-performance electrocatalysts able to operate in the SDE environment. They added that the strategy could be applied to other non-volatile liquids like highly concentrated acid, alkali and salt solutions for use in industrial wastewater treatment.
In addition, it could be used to produce hydrogen while recovering useful resources such as lithium from water. Further research is also needed for the electrolyzer’s compatibility with renewable energy sources to match that of conventional electrolyzers.
The scientists shared their findings in “A membrane-based seawater electrolyser for hydrogen generation,” which was recently published in Nature.
