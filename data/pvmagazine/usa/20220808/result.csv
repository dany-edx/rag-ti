https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/08/ampt-lawsuit-asks-that-solaredge-remove-inverters-and-controllers-from-market/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,LEGAL,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 8, 2022",Ampt lawsuit asks that SolarEdge remove inverters and controllers from market,"Ampt, a power electronic specialist based in Fort Collins, Colorado, has filed a lawsuit against SolarEdge for allegedly violating a series of their patents.  According to Ampt, the violations at the heart of the issue are “power optimizers that contain high-efficiency power converters that both allow maximum power-point output, and use operational boundary conditions that continue producing power during conditions that might otherwise require the optimizer to be bypassed.”
The filing asks that the whole of SolarEdge’s inverter and optimizer lineup be removed from the marketplace for violation of these patents. Ampt contends that other manufacturers could replace SolarEdge’s hardware if needed. 

Ampt filed with two separate courts – the Count of International Trade (ITC), whose online filing can be found here, and the US District Court of Delaware whole filing can be found here.
In the ITC Complaint filing, two patents were specifically highlighted – U.S. Patents Nos. 9,673,630 (‘630) and 11,289,917 (‘917).
The ’630 patent was issued in 2017, while the ’917 patent was recently awarded on March 29, 2022. Both patents claim priority to a provisional patent application filed in 2007. Ampt notes they were founded in Colorado in 2007.
The filing includes a circuit (below) that contains both a buck and boost converter. Ampt states that this “power optimizer circuit of (their) invention…describes a dual-mode configuration that provides high efficiency for their specific use-case.”

Buck converters step voltages down, while boost converters step voltages up. Solar optimizers regulate the voltages and amperages of individual solar panels in combination with their inverter, among a string of solar panels arranged in a series circuit.
The longer form filing with the ITC court includes an image of the circuitry inside of a SolarEdge optimizer, pointing out the location of the buck-boost converter.

The filing also highlighted operational boundaries and how they interact with over current and voltage, while attempting to optimize for the maximum power point (MPPT).
To this author’s very limited electrical knowledge, all inverter manufacturers use these two techniques to manage solar power. Solar charge controllers in off-grid systems specifically focus on these designs in order to keep voltages consistent when charging batteries from variable output solar panels.

A statement that Ampt could replace SolarEdge hardware was amended to say that other manufacturers could replace SolarEdge hardware, if needed. A further amendment was made on 8/25/2022 with the following:
It is not possible for pv magazine to check the correctness of patent claims and the arguments of the companies. For fairness, we gave SolarEdge the opportunity to respond, and they provided the following:
“SolarEdge and AMPT have been litigating a dispute involving a patent family filed by SolarEdge and a patent family filed by AMPT before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for many years. Recently, the USPTO awarded priority of invention to SolarEdge, cancelled the claims of AMPT’s patents, and awarded the patent claims in these AMPT patents to SolarEdge. It appears that having lost before the USPTO, AMPT is now shopping around its claims to other courts. SolarEdge anticipates a vigorous defense of these new cases.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/08/solar-tracker-designed-for-solar-installations-of-under-20-mw/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 8, 2022",Solar tracker designed for solar installations of under 20 MW,"Texas-based FTC Solar’s DG Solutions Business Unit and AUI Partners announced a new solar tracking solution for solar sites of under 20 MW, which they report can be delivered as quickly as eight weeks.
“Despite the growth in DG as a result of federal and state-wide pushes for increased solar projects, there is still a shortage of comprehensive solutions that give customers what they need in a timely manner,” said Mario Carbone, Partner at AUI Partners. “By combining FTC’s resilient and versatile Voyager tracker and optimization software with our lead generation, design, delivery, and installation services, we are able to offer customers an innovative design-through-installation service that ultimately benefits developers by reducing the number of project partners they need to commission.”
FTC Solar and AUI Partners are targeting US-based commercial and industrial, community solar programs, projects for independent power producers, and smaller one-off projects for sectors such as agriculture. The companies are using proprietary automation technology to provide a fast turnaround time on project quotes.
The tracker is FTC’s Voyager+ 2P solar tracker, and AUI is providing site design and construction. The Voyager+ 2P was introduced in September of 2021 and is designed for modules of 550 watts and higher and uses nearly 50% fewer foundation piles than comparable alternative systems, according to the company. It also enables a roughly 2% higher energy density than its 1P competitors. In developing the tracker, FTC Solar collaborated with RWDI and Engineered Power Solutions on data analysis and wind tunnel testing to independently validate the product’s structural stability. Through this testing and design modification, FTC said it created a tracker that can withstand winds equivalent to a category 3 hurricane, but also operates well in low wind speeds, an environment that has long been a hurdle for trackers. To optimize the Voyager+ tracker, FTC offers a variety of software solutions, including its SunPath platform, which will also be available for distributed generation projects.
“By ensuring materials are readily available for these projects, DG Solutions will deliver faster than many other providers in the market, which can require more than six months,” said Sean Hunkler, CEO of FTC Solar. “We see tremendous growth potential for this market over the next few years. However, for it to grow successfully, resilient turnkey solutions are imperative, and working with the team at AUI Partners will help us complete these projects quickly, which is a win for both the customer and the planet.”

The Synapse Energy Economics team found that a least-cost resource plan would add 6 GW of battery storage and no new gas capacity through 2030. The North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association and three clean energy groups sponsored the plan.
The Duke Energy team proposed a more costly plan, adding 3 GW of gas capacity and just 2 MW of storage through 2030, in its only scenario that, according to the Synapse report, would meet a 2021 North Carolina law without assuming additional Appalachian gas transportation capacity. The state law targets a 70% reduction in power sector emissions by 2030, and power sector carbon neutrality by 2050.
Synapse calculated that its base plan would save the state’s utility customers $700 million through 2030, compared to the Duke Energy plan, while an alternative Synapse scenario with imported wind power and less storage capacity would save customers $2.4 billion through 2030.
“The modeling demonstrates that cleaner, proven technologies are hands-down the best option for ratepayers,” said Peter Ledford, director of policy and general counsel for the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association.
Regarding the three-fold difference in battery storage through 2030—6 GW for Synapse’s base plan versus 2 GW for Duke—Synapse reports that Duke manually replaced some of the battery storage selected by the optimization model with gas-fired combustion turbines. Such manual adjustments “deviate from resource planning best practices and add additional costs to ratepayers,” Synapse said in its report.
“Utility plans to invest in new gas power plants are risky, opening up customers to higher bills driven by volatile fuel prices and stranded assets,” added Maggie Shober, research director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which co-sponsored the study.
Synapse and Duke both modeled maximum annual solar deployment ramping up to 1.8 GW per year in the mid-to-late 2020s. Consequently, both modeled the same amount of additional solar by 2030.
Duke and Synapse have presented their plans to the North Carolina Utilities Commission, which is required by state law to develop a carbon plan by year-end that achieves the state’s carbon goals for 2030 and 2050.
Far more solar, storage
By 2050, the Synapse base plan would add 21 GW more solar and 22 GW more storage than the Duke Energy plan, saving customers $18 billion through 2050 on a net present value basis, Synapse calculated. With imported wind power, savings would be greater. Synapse removed “unnecessary constraints” on solar and storage that Duke placed on those resources in its modeling, explained Tyler Fitch, senior associate with Synapse.
Solar, battery and wind power additions through 2030 and 2050 under the two plans are shown in the table.

The Duke plan would instead add 10 GW of nuclear by 2050, versus 2 GW for Synapse, and would add 11 GW of hydrogen generation by 2050 as it retired carbon-emitting gas units, versus 5 GW of hydrogen for Synapse. Synapse would add these technologies later than Duke, starting in 2041 for nuclear versus 2031 for Duke, and starting in 2046 for hydrogen versus 2036 for Duke.
The Synapse modeling team took a “more conservative approach” to the availability of small modular nuclear reactors, given that the technology is not currently commercially available, said Dave Rogers, a deputy regional campaign director for the Sierra Club, which co-sponsored the Synapse study.
Synapse used “realistic cost and deployment timelines” for widespread zero-carbon hydrogen generating availability, said Fitch.
Shared foundation
Both the Synapse and Duke analyses used the EnCompass resource planning model, as well as Duke’s modeling database “as a shared foundation,” Synapse reported. Synapse then revised certain model inputs, as described in the appendices to its report. Both modeling teams met demand year-round, with an adequate margin of reserve capacity.
Both Synapse scenarios would involve increased energy efficiency investments. Neither of Synapse’s plans specified new gas-fired generation, and both would economically retire coal units sooner than Duke’s plan. Duke manually set coal plant retirements, the Synapse report said.
Also co-sponsoring the Synapse analysis was the Natural Resources Defense Council.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/08/us-senate-passes-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022-an-industry-reacts/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 8, 2022",US Senate passes Inflation Reduction Act of 2022: An industry reacts,"The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 passed in the Senate yesterday in 50-50 split with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, called the bill a “defining legislative feat of the 21st century” and “the boldest climate package in US history” on the Senate floor before the final vote.
The bill aims at lower energy costs for Americans, energy security, decarbonization of all sectors of the economy, environmental justice, and resilience in rural communities. Lowered consumer energy costs will be targeted through direct incentives for energy efficient and electric appliances, clean vehicles, rooftop solar, and more. It contains $9 billion in consumer home energy rebate programs, focused on low-income households, to electrify appliances and make energy efficient retrofits. It also ends the uncertainty around investment tax credits as it extends the ITC for 10 years at 30%.
Expecting passage of the bill in the Senate, solar industry leaders were quick to share their reactions.
SEIA
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said the following on the Senate’s passage of this historic legislation:

“Today is a monumental day for America’s clean energy progress and global climate leadership. With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in the Senate, solar and storage companies are one step closer to having the business certainty they need to make the long-term investments that decarbonize the electric grid and create millions of new career opportunities in cities and towns across the country.
“This legislation is the most transformational investment America has ever made in our climate future, and we are thankful to our members, the clean energy community and every one of our solar champions in Congress for their work to get us to this historic moment. The solar industry has set a goal to account for 30% of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030, and this legislation will be a catalyst for reaching that target. Now the work can begin to build out America’s clean energy economy with historic deployment, domestic manufacturing, investments in low-income communities, energy storage, smoother interconnection, and so much more.
“The United States is poised to lead the world’s clean energy transformation while lowering costs for families. We look forward to seeing President Biden sign this bill and kick off this new era of American leadership.”
Nextracker
Dan Shugar, Nextracker CEO and founder, said, “Nextracker strongly supports the Inflation Reduction Act, which will immediately increase hiring at our US factories. Together with our colleagues in the clean energy industry, this action will add over 500,000 jobs.
Accelerating solar’s use in the grid will lower bills for electricity customers while reducing emissions 40%. Energy independence and decoupling from overseas inflation factors has never been more important. We urge the House to quickly pass this landmark legislation for President Biden’s signature.”
Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance
Michael Parr, executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance said, “The Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance applauds the Senate Passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These energy provisions are good news for the US economy. They will put the US in a strong competitive stance in solar manufacturing and pave the way for investments across the American solar supply chain, accelerating the growth already under way in US solar manufacturing. This will mean more good manufacturing jobs, strengthened US energy independence and reduced carbon emissions.” He added, “We encourage the House to pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 without delay and get it to President Biden’s desk.”
SOLV Energy
George Hershman, the CEO of SOLV Energy, a leading utility-scale solar installer, made the following statement:
“I am thrilled that the Senate has taken decisive action to strengthen American energy independence and help families combat rising costs. With the passage of this once-in-a-generation legislation, the Senate has sent a strong message to the world that America is serious about investing in clean energy, spurring innovation, and bringing new opportunities and jobs to communities across this country. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 takes serious action to grow the clean energy economy, puts more money in the pockets of American families and gets us one step closer to tackling the damaging impacts of climate change. I am urging the House of Representatives to take swift action and send this bill to the President’s desk for signature as soon as possible.”
WATT Coalition
Ted Bloch-Rubin, chair of the WATT Coalition said “We are thrilled the Senate has passed the Investment Reduction Act and that once again Congress has specifically identified Grid-Enhancing Technologies as an important solution set for clean energy integration.  GETs can double capacity for renewable energy on the existing grid – with the support for wind and solar deployment in this bill, we’ll need all the delivery capacity we can get. The WATT Coalition hopes that the House passes the bill, and the President signs it into law very soon.”
“The Investment Reduction Act is a powerful market signal to develop more renewable energy across America, and we cannot allow the grid to be an obstacle to the energy transition,” said  “The WATT Coalition urges governors and public utility commissioners to push utilities to make long-overdue investments in grid optimization and flexibility. Funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act can ensure that local ratepayers see less upfront costs, while upgrades pay for themselves with systemwide benefits. Wind and solar projects are ready to break ground – state leaders can make sure that the grid is ready for them to plug in,” said Rob Gramlich, executive director of the WATT Coalition. 
Qcells
Qcells North America senior director of market iIntelligence, public affairs and marketing Scott Moskowitz issued the following statement: 
“With Senate passage of the Inflation Reduction Act today, we’re a major step closer to turning the climate crisis into a once-in-a-generation opportunity. This bill will result in billions of dollars in clean energy investment, it will make our supply chains more resilient, our energy more affordable, and it will dramatically lower carbon emissions.  In particular, we want to thank Senators Ossoff and Warnock for their championing of the landmark Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act which was included in the Inflation Reduction Act and will make an extraordinary contribution to growing the domestic solar manufacturing sector.  We urge the House to pass this legislation and send it to the president’s desk for his signature. Once this bill becomes law, we look forward to expanding our factories and hiring thousands of US manufacturing workers.”
The bill next goes to the House where it is expected to pass, possibly by the end of this week.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/08/seia-and-environmental-groups-comment-on-proposed-changes-to-community-reinvestment-act/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 8, 2022",SEIA and environmental groups comment on proposed changes to Community Reinvestment Act,"The Community Reinvestment Act, which passed in 1977, was designed to stimulate investment in underserved communities. In May of this year, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. proposed sweeping changes, which include shoring up underserved communities against climate disasters.
Several environmental groups and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) submitted comments in reaction to proposed changes. The comment period closes today at midnight.
SEIA urged the banking regulators to expand use of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to focus on targeting changes that could inject new funding for solar and storage projects of all sizes, which would help increase credit access, lower emissions and create more jobs and business opportunities in communities that are disproportionately affected by climate change.
“After decades of environmental racism, we now have the opportunity to lead with equity and use community investment banks to finance new solar and storage projects in communities that need them most,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA. “If we expand the Community Reinvestment Act to include clean energy access, we can funnel quality jobs, cleaner air, and new business opportunities to underserved neighborhoods across the country. As we look to ramp up clean energy deployment in the Solar+ Decade, we must double down on equity and one of the best ways to do this is to target and support programs that are already reaching frontline communities.”
The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) also submitted comments, recommending renewable energy investment be included as a qualifying activity under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).
ACORE stated that it is in support of the proposed revised definitions for “Community Development Activities” that are responsive especially to the needs of those of low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities and individuals, small businesses, and small farms. ACORE pressed, however, for the rule to further acknowledge how investments in renewable energy facilities benefit and serve LMI communities and individuals. According to ACORE, its comments propose changes to include renewable energy investment (in both utility-scale and distributed generation projects) under the proposal’s defined “Revitalization and Stabilization Activities;” and also recommend an expanded definition of “Public Welfare Investment” to include all investments in renewable energy tax credits.
“Clarifying that the CRA includes renewable energy investment will help create a more equitable energy system by sending a strong signal to America’s banking institutions to invest in renewable projects located in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities,” said Gregory Wetstone, ACORE president and CEO. “In addition to the clear climate and health benefits, renewable energy provides significant tax revenue for communities, creates good-paying local jobs, reduces exposure to power outages, and lowers the cost of household electricity bills.”
ACORE also recommends an expanded definition of “Public Welfare Investment” to include all investments in renewable energy tax credits. To download a copy of ACORE’s submitted comments, click here.
The Sierra Club joined other organizations in a letter calling to proposed changes to pay greater attention to climate change-related risks facilitated by bank financing of fossil fuel-related activities.
“Climate change is a risk multiplier that exacerbates racial and economic inequality, and it is progressing at an alarming rate. The agencies must update CRA regulations with this reality in mind so that the banking system meets the changing credit needs of all communities,” the groups wrote in the letter, which was led by Americans for Financial Reform, the Greenlining Institute, and Public Citizen.

A timeline for final review has not been released by the regulators.
