After meeting with local solar developer Resonant Energy, the student-led group called the Planet Protectors ran a petition drive and presented the project details to the head of the school. The presentation was well-received, as the benefits of going solar are multitudinous, and the Winsor Board of trustees gave the project the green light.
“It was incredible to see the drive and initiative that spurred our students to take bold action,” said Head of School Sarah Pelmas. “They understand the risk of inaction, at a time when climate change has become an evolving threat to all of us. The upside to this investment is that it benefits Winsor and also our neighbors in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area.”
The array is a 331 panel, 149 kWdc system expected to produce 175,000 kWh per year. Resonant Energy is expected to perform the racking, roof installation, and electrical work through this month.
The carbon offset provided by the system is estimated to be the equivalent of protecting 152 acres of forest per year. Forests are an important carbon sink, absorbing atmospheric CO2 into the structure of the tree, and respiring oxygen. Decarbonizing the energy system of the school was the main objective of the Planet Protectors, who understand the threats that human driven climate change poses to life across the globe.
An additional benefit that made it easier for the club to pitch was the significant cost savings the project will provide to the school. Bill savings are estimated to be in excess of $28,000 per year over the 25 year span of the project. The Massachusetts SMART program incentive boosted savings further, kicking in an additional $14,000 in revenue to the school per year for a 20-year period. In total, Winsor is expected to benefit from over $1 million in savings and revenues from the one solar array.

The Planet Protectors mission didn’t end with their own school’s array, however, as they want to share this model for student renewable energy activism with other students across Massachusetts. Students for Solar is a campaign developed to guide schools through the solar procurement process, outlining the many benefits therein.

“What started out as an ambitious club project two years ago has become a real, concrete step toward fighting climate change,” said Winsor Class V student and Planet Protector club member Nika Bigelow ’25. “I’m sure I can speak for the whole club when I say that the elation I feel over the installment of solar panels on the roof of the Lubin-O’Donnell Center is unparalleled. It has been such a fun and rewarding process, and I am so thankful to have played a role in bringing about positive change.”

The milestone is significant in itself, but also serves to illustrate the company’s rapid acceleration, as it passed the $6 billion mark in December 2021 and the $5 billion mark in March 2021.
The $2 billion dollar growth timeline works out to be almost exactly 12 months in total, with Mosaic sharing that the $7 billion milestone was passed in mid-March, finishing off a month that saw the company achieve its highest monthly loan volume to date. Mosaic also recently completed a $382.7 million securitization. Since 2017, the company issued 12 solar loan securitizations, totaling more than $3.2 billion of offered securities. The company also prides itself on the low cost of funds on bonds.
“There’s a growing importance of clean renewable energy as an economic engine, a climate imperative, and a matter of national security,” said Billy Parish, founder and CEO of Mosaic. “The urgency to deliver affordable financing options for our partners and homeowners is growing, and Mosaic is uniquely positioned to help lead this charge.”
Mosaic offers financing for solar, solar-plus-storage systems, and other sustainable home improvements, often providing homeowners with a credit decision in minutes for no money down loans with fixed interest rates and multiple term options. In February, Mosaic announced it had reduced pricing across its entire suite of solar loan products.
Just a year ago Mosaic announced new financing partnerships that were expected to provide loans to more than 100,000 homeowners.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/25/pv-in-the-circular-economy-modeling-tool-helps-predict-flow-of-pv-materials/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 25, 2022",PV in the Circular Economy: Modeling tool helps predict flow of solar materials,"Exponential growth of PV installations continues in the US and so will the growth in PV panel waste streams. According to the Solar Futures Study conducted by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), solar could account for as much as 40% of the nation’s electricity supply by 2035 and 45% by 2050.
To reach these levels, solar deployment will need to grow by an average of 30 GW each year between now and 2025 and then double that between 2025 and 2030—four times its current deployment rate—to total 1,000 GW of solar deployed by 2035. That’s a lot of solar panels that would start being retired from service even before 2050. Needless to say, a lot of people–including 7-year old Neil— are concerned about what will happen to solar modules at the end of their life. That concern is real and growing, and is the subject of much study around the world.

To begin this work, however, researchers need end-of-life data for solar modules. For example, they need to know how many solar modules will be retired this year, what will happen to them when they are retired, how their retirement affects the flow of PV materials, and at what rate will solar modules be retired in the future. To this end, The NREL researchers have developed the PV in the Circular Economy (PV ICE) modeling tool, which attempts to model the flow of PV materials over the next several decades. It also addresses the question of whether it is better to build more durable modules that last longer before needing replacement, or shorter-lived, fully recyclable modules. And it looks at how the evolution of PV technology, like thinner panels or new materials, may play into a more circular economy.
“There is much interest in making PV, an already clean energy source, fully sustainable economically and environmentally,” said Silvana Ovaitt, an NREL PV reliability researcher. “People jump to recycling as the solution, but for a product that is supposed to last more than 30 years—something more like a roof than a cell phone—that puts a big delay into the stream of recycled material. This gives us time to proactively plan for effective collection and recycling of modules. But it also points to the importance of alternate pathways of circularity for PV materials.”
PV ICE uses the latest data from the PV industry to model the flow of PV materials over the next several decades, helping predict the effects of different market trends, technological developments, and government policies.
Modeling today’s modules
Developed by a small team in NREL’s PV Reliability Group, the open-source tool consists of two main pieces. The first piece is a set of data files that collect the key properties of today’s solar modules. And it makes predictions on future modules, including types and quantities of materials, expected lifetimes, and power conversion efficiencies, among others.
PV technology has evolved rapidly and continues to do so. So this ‘average’ silicon module also needs to evolve to accurately capture the materials going into and coming out of the field. I started by looking at market share over time for different types of cell and module designs and created averages of what a silicon module looks like from 1995 through 2030. I drew component material and module data from a number of different sources—industry and literature—to track cell and module changes. This technique could also be applied to a single manufacturer’s bill of materials, though the PV module industry hasn’t offered this type of materials transparency to date, said Heather Mirletz, a Ph.D. student at Colorado School of Mines who helped develop PV ICE.
Modeling future modules and flow of materials
The second piece of PV ICE is modeling how these modules and the materials they contain will move through the PV life cycle. This includes projections of how many solar modules will be installed in future years and assumptions about key processes, such as manufacturing efficiencies or yields and rates of failure. It also models the decisions of stakeholders and how these decisions might modify the flow of materials.
By varying process efficiencies and stakeholder decisions, PV ICE enables researchers to explore how improved reliability or different circular pathways—such as repair, reuse, remanufacturing, or recycling—could affect how much retired module material is landfilled and how much can be recaptured to help deploy more PV modules. The result is a detailed model of how materials enter, move through, and potentially exit a circular PV economy.
“This tool is unique because it brings the PV and the sustainability communities together in an interdisciplinary approach; we capture real-life industry practices like bifaciality, merchant tail, project lifetime, and degradation. It goes beyond a first-approximation approach of simple material-flow analysis,” said Silvana Ovaitt, a member of the PV ICE development team.
For example, the PV ICE team found that several previous predictions had overestimated the rate at which today’s modules will fail and require replacement. Field data and longer-term contracts suggests modules are lasting longer. Updating this assumption in the PV ICE tool revealed that the volume of PV module waste will grow more slowly and arrive later than previously predicted.

“Our sensitivity analyses show that pre-2050 life cycle wastes are most sensitive to module lifetime and reliability,” Mirletz said. “Virgin material demands are most sensitive to manufacturing yields. Circular economy pathways—’reduce, reuse, recycle’—are in order of impact, and our sensitivity results reflect and reinforce this ranking.”

The deal builds on existing module supply agreements between the two companies, bringing the total supply capacity to  over 3 GW of modules, which are estimated to enable the construction of 18 new solar facilities from 2022 to 2024. Like every other large-scale solar developer, Leewards has begun to feel the pressures of module supply uncertainties, pressures which have only been exacerbated with the Dept. of Commerce’s anticircumvention investigation on module imports.
“This agreement creates significant growth opportunities bringing stability, predictability and diminished risk from geopolitical tensions to our solar module supply chain, and by extension to our finance, construction, and offtake partners,” said Eran Mahrer, chief strategy officer at Leeward. “We look forward to working closely with First Solar and other US-based component manufacturers as we aggressively expand our solar portfolio.”
Many large-scale solar developers have had their existing supply agreement plans turned upside-down by the Department of Commerce’s anti-circumvention investigation. In a webinar last week, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) shared preliminary survey data from more than 200 respondents across the solar industry. Within the survey 75% of respondents reported that they are already experiencing cancelled or delayed module shipments, while 11% have not yet been notified of delays, but expect them to come.
Leeward is now the third company to announce a significant supply agreement with First Solar since news broke of the Dept. of Commerce’s investigation. On April 12, First Solar announced that it came to terms on a multi-year master supply agreement with Silicon Ranch, under which First Solar will supply 4 GW of modules to Silicon Ranch’s US projects from 2023 to 2025. That news came one day after Origis Energy placed an order for 750 MW of First Solar’s modules.
First Solar is investing $680 million in expanding America’s domestic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3 GW annually, by building its third US manufacturing facility, in Lake Township, Ohio. The new facility is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023 and when fully operational will bring the company’s Northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GW.
In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building a new 3.3 GW factory in India that is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023. With First Solar’s expansion in the United States and India and optimization of its existing fleet, the First Solar anticipate that its manufacturing capacity will double to 16 GW by 2024.

Despite challenges, clean energy industries lead the energy transition in Minnesota, according to the findings.
The Factsheet is a companion to the 2022 Sustainable Energy in America Factbook, which outlines key trends influencing national and state investment and economics, energy supply and energy demand. Both resources are commissioned by the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE), with research by BloombergNEF. The Minnesota Energy Factsheet is made possible with the support of the McKnight Foundation.
“The facts support continued public policy support and investment in the clean energy sector, for its economic and environmental benefits to residents of Minnesota,” said Lisa Jacobson, President of the BCSE.
In 2021, renewable energy provided 28% of electricity generation for Minnesota, while zero-carbon sources, renewables and nuclear technologies, provided the majority at 52%. Subsequently, power sector emissions have fallen 40% over the last decade and while they rose slightly in 2021 from 2020 levels, they were still lower than their pre-pandemic levels in 2019. The increase in emissions was expected and driven by an economic rebound and a slight increase of coal-powered electricity due to the high cost of natural gas.
Minnesota’s energy productivity, or how efficiently the state uses its energy, rose again in 2021.
“The data from last year shows how the clean energy transition is happening in Minnesota in real time, and the decline of energy imports is an especially exciting metric as we work to achieve energy independence” said Gregg Mast, Executive Director of Clean Energy Economy Minnesota. “The challenges of 2021 have demonstrated why it’s more important than ever to continue expanding our clean energy sector with thoughtful policy and smart investments.”
Minnesota’s track record on renewables reflects strong support in the state.  For example, in February 2021, Minnesota Power announced plans to become 100% carbon-free by 2050, building on the utility’s EnergyForward strategy and recent achievement of providing 50% renewable energy to its customers.lawmakers in Minnesota. Also in February of last year, lawmakers introduced a bill that would check some of the powers that homeowner associations (HOAs) have over residential solar systems. The bill would allow HOAs to regulate, but not ban, the installation of solar systems.
