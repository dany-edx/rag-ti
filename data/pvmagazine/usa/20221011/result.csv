The battery bank can be charged in 1.8 hours via four 200 W SolarSaga panels, or via a wall charger. The ergonomic design fits 1002 Wh capacity in a highly portable, 12-pack cooler-sized battery unit that weighs just over 25 lbs. 
The fully charged generator can charge camping lights for 76 hours, an electric grill for 50 minutes, a mini fridge for 66 hours, Macbook Pro for eight charges, and an iPhone for 100 charges. It can be recharged with the SolarSaga panels anywhere the sun shines, with no connection to the electric grid needed.
The unit is controlled by an automotive-level battery management system (BMS) and has an updated LCD monitor for real-time energy monitoring. Displays inform users on input power, remaining power levels, output power, a fault code indicator, and a low battery indicator. The BMS preserves the battery through over-current, short-current, over-discharge, overcharge, over-voltage, and thermal protection controls. It monitors each individual battery cell and battery pack to improve overall battery life. 
The company said the battery has an ultra-long standby, lasting 365 days from an 80% battery level. The battery contains 1000 charge cycles, lasting 10 years for 1 usage/week. It comes with a five-year full warranty from Jackery. 
The Solar Generator 1000 is equipped with five DC outputs, including two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, and one 12V car port. It also houses three AC outputs at 120V, 1000 W (2000 W peak). For inputs, the solar generator contains a 120V, 50 Hz, 15A max AC port. It also contains a DC input rated at 17.5V-60V, 11A max, and can double to 22A/800 W max.
The generator operates in a super-quiet mode, marking an improvement over noisy diesel generators. The unit operates under 46 decibels.
The lithium-ion Solar Generator 1000 is optimized to operate in concert with Jackery’s SolarSaga 100W panels. The lightweight panels weigh only 9.1 lbs. and have a fold-out design for easy setup. Built-in kickstands allow for the panels to be placed at the ideal angle and azimuth for max production.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/11/electric-buses-to-be-deployed-at-community-centers-as-emergency-backup-power/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 11, 2022",Electric buses to be deployed at community centers as emergency backup power,"The California Energy Commission (CEC) announced it will fund a project by Schneider Electric, Center for Transportation and the Environment (CTE), The Mobility House, the City of Oakland, Calif. and other key stakeholders to demonstrate vehicle-to-building resilience hubs. The project will use electric buses owned and operated by AC Transit to provide filtered air conditioning to the West Oakland Public Library for local residents in the event of dangerous heat or smoke conditions.
Both EV buses and hydrogen fuel cell buses will be used as backup power, providing six hours and 11 hours of backup power, respectively. An estimated 100 lbs. of carbon emissions will be abated each hour of operation.
The Bus Exportable Power Supply with bidirectional chargers and smart software will be integrated and tested at bus-maker New Flyer’s Hayward facility, then deployed at an AC Transit bus division and the Oakland Library.
CEC awarded the project funds via its Electric Program Investment Charge program, providing $3.2 million for the resilience demonstration. The West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project and AC Transit each provided an additional $400,000 in funding.
Infrastructure is expected to be installed by mid-2023, and demonstration, analysis, evaluation, and knowledge transfer for the pilot program will continue until July 2025.
“Initiating the first community resilience hub powered by a bidirectional V2B charging system has been an incredible journey. By bringing together leading-edge technological innovation and sustainability, we are able to offer much needed emergency response benefits for both transit agencies and communities,” said Jason Hanlin, director of technology research at CTE.
EV bus fleets are particularly well-suited for backup power and emergency relief due to their large capacities and independent mobility. Schneider Electric said they can be dispatched faster than a diesel generator and operate more cost-effectively.
The solution is expected to be a benefit to Environmental Justice (EJ) communities, which are targeted by the Inflation Reduction Act as a priority in an equitable energy transition. EJ communities are low-income areas that are disproportionately affected by the negative impacts of pollution from energy production and delivery.
“Many low-income communities of color share streets and fence lines with the freight industry and suffer deadly pollution from petroleum combustion. With our electrical grids straining under the demands of global warming and solar and wind not keeping pace with the urgent need, hydrogen may offer another tool in the toolbox of zero-emission freight transportation opportunities. Communities like West Oakland will benefit from an expanded set of transportation energy options by getting cleaner, safer streets and air quality,” remarked Brian Beveridge, co-executive director of WOIEP.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/11/gm-aims-to-compete-with-tesla-as-it-moves-into-energy-storage/,"BATTERY,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,HYDROGEN,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 11, 2022",GM aims to compete with Tesla as it moves into energy storage,"General Motors isn’t focused just on car manufacturing, as the company announced it a new GM Energy unit that will offer energy storage and management services to residential and commercial markets. GM Energy plans to bundle the existing Ultium Charge 360 public charging service with two new units, Ultium Home and Ultium Commercial, which will offer stationary storage batteries, as well as solar panels and hydrogen fuel cells. GM Energy reports that several large-scale companies across the U.S. have already agreed to work with GM Energy to provide energy solutions to customers and receive product or service offerings.
“The reliability of the U.S. electrical power grid has never been more important,” said Travis Hester, vice president of GM EV Growth Operations. “GM Energy has the opportunity to help deliver sustainable energy products and services that can help mitigate the effect of power outages and provide customers with resilient and cost-effective energy management.”
GM Energy announced an agreement with SunPower to provide solar panels to its customers, thus becoming a one-stop green energy shop. SunPower will be a preferred installer for the home energy system and offer customers the opportunity to add solar to their home. The Ultium Home service will offer stationary wall boxes, going head to head with Tesla’s Powerwalls, and its release will be timed with the retail release of the Silverado EV.
The new EV truck will have bi-directional charging like the Ford F-150 Lightning, which means it will be able to feed electricity back into the home during a power outage. The F-150 was announced in February of this year. Its Intelligent Backup Power and the Home Integration Systems were developed in collaboration with Sunrun, enabling the F-150 Lightning’s battery to automatically kicks in to power the home if the grid goes down.
“GM Energy’s mission is to offer customers access to a full suite of energy products and services, including solutions beyond the vehicle, accelerating the seamless transition to an all-electric future,” said Hester. “With the expansion of our enterprise business through GM Energy and one of the most comprehensive portfolios of energy management products and services available, we will help to reduce the barriers of entry for sustainable power and further accelerate the mass adoption of EVs.”
As part of GM Energy, Ultium Charge 360 will continue to expand its existing portfolio of integrated public charging networks, integrated mobile apps, and additional product and service offerings over time.
“The massive scale of GM Energy’s solutions will allow us to better address current challenges with grid infrastructure, energy storage and energy management head on,” says Mark Bole, vice president and head of V2X Battery Solutions at GM. “By leveraging GM’s flexible technology platforms and the power of Ultium, we’re able to provide resilient and accessible energy solutions for all customers and the grid, helping to further advance the all-electric future.”
GM’s commercial service will offer larger stationary storage units, similar to Tesla’s Megapack, which was announced in 2019. And GM is also developing hydrogen fuel cell technology.
And the final piece is the Energy Services Cloud, which is a hub that manages energy for residential, commercial and EV fleet owners. The central interface will house data and energy management tools, so that customers will be able to manage their energy consumption through GM’s energy software applications. GM has already enrolled EV customers in managed charging programs through the Energy Services Cloud, with multiple utilities across four U.S. states and growing.
GM Energy has launched a V2H pilot project between GM Energy and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), similar to the Tesla virtual power plant in Texas and California markets. The GM Energy project will enable residential customers to use their compatible EVs along with a bi-directional charger, as backup power for essential home needs during short-term power outages.
After initial lab tests, the two companies anticipate expanding the V2H offer to a subset of residential customers within PG&E’s service area, expected to begin in 2023. GM Energy is also working with other companies such as Con Edison, Graniterock and New Hampshire Electric Cooperative to help deliver energy solutions to customers, while also helping to inform and advance future GM Energy offerings.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/11/enervenue-offers-20-year-20-cycle-warranty-for-its-nickel-hydrogen-batteries/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 11, 2022",EnerVenue offers 20-year/20k-cycle warranty for its nickel-hydrogen batteries,"EnerVenue, a manufacturer of nickel-hydrogen batteries, announced Capacity Assurance—what the company says is the industry’s simplest and most straightforward extended warranty for stationary batteries.
Capacity Assurance offers a 20-year/20,000-cycle warranty extension at no less than 88% capacity. While the batteries are designed to last 30 years, through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing degradation, EnerVenue says that the extended warranty covers a project while it’s in its most critical payback phase and is offered with no hidden exclusions and simple operating terms.
EnerVenue manufactures its batteries in Fremont, Calf., after having launched in 2020 during the COVID pandemic. The company claims costs per kilowatt-hour for its nickel-hydrogen batteries as low as a penny, and capital expenditure costs better than lithium-ion. EnerVenue points out that lithium-ion batteries suffer from significant battery degradation, with power output falling several percent per year. The company further claims that those using lithium-ion batteries must regularly perform expensive mitigations by adding new battery banks to their existing footprints to keep up with their contractual power output obligations. What further sets nickel-hydrogen apart from lithium-ion is that the EnerVenue batteries excel in extreme heat and extreme cold. The company said its batteries operate best in ambient temperatures from -40 F to 140 F.  The battery purportedly comes with no risk of fire or thermal runaway and includes no toxic materials, so it is also recyclable.
“For years, the stationary storage market has been asking for a simple, long-term capacity guarantee,” said Randy Selesky, CRO, EnerVenue. “Capacity Assurance delivers an industry-best promise that complements EnerVenue’s robust technology and provides our partners with both operational confidence and contractual security.”
EnerVenue recently announced several large supply agreements including one with Green Energy Renewable Solutions for 250 MWh of batteries over the next three years to be installed at construction sites and other heavy industry projects. EnerVenue also recently agreed to provide 460 MWh of its batteries to Sonnell Power Solutions for large-scale renewable and storage applications in Puerto Rico. Pine Gate recently purchased 2.4 GWh of the company’s batteries. And last spring, the company signed its first major distribution agreement with Hong Kong’s Towngas.
