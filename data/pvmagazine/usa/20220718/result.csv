“This solar project is the third project approved for full construction under the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan and an example of how public land in California plays a big role in achieving the Biden-Harris administration’s goal to achieve 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035,” said Karen Mouritsen, BLM California State Director. “The BLM is committed to responsible renewable energy development that balances conservation and utilization of public land.”
The Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) is a collaborative, interagency planning effort covering 22.5 million acres in seven California counties and it has two primary goals. First, to provide a streamlined process for the development of utility-scale renewable energy generation and transmission in the deserts of southern California consistent with federal and state renewable energy targets and policies. And second, to provide for the long-term conservation and management of special-status species and desert vegetation communities, as well as other physical, cultural, scenic, and social resources within the DRECP Plan Area using durable regulatory mechanisms.
Both the BLM and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) have legal responsibilities to conserve wildlife under the Federal Endangered Species Act and the California Endangered Species Act. The BLM must ensure the needs of wildlife, fish and plants are taken into consideration when authorizing land use. The CDFW requires that project developers avoid, minimize, and/or compensate for impacts to fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats.
Despite these safeguards, environmental groups have expressed opposition to the Oberon Solar Project. Basin and Range Watch is one such organization, which has the following statement on its website: “In spite of BLM’s new mitigation measures negotiated between the contentious environmental assessment and final decision under the DRECP, this project will still kill a significant amount of desert ironwood trees–an imperiled vegetation community in California.”
In January of this year, local paper Desert Sun published an opinion piece by Palm Desert resident Ruth Nolan who expressed her opposition to the project. “For our federal government to give license to corporations who stand to gain money by exploiting and destroying our public wilderness in this way is a disgrace and is the antithesis of environmental sustainability. Siting large-scale renewable energy projects in California’s desert wilderness areas is not only unnecessary — rooftop solar is a viable alternative — but deeply unethical.”
Last week the BLM Palm Springs South Coast Field Office authorized Oberon Solar LLC to begin full construction of Oberon 1 and II, which together will generate up to 500 MW or enough to power approximately 146,000 homes. The project will also have 500 MW of battery storage. Both are expected to be operational in 2023.
The BLM said it is currently processing 64 utility-scale onshore clean energy projects proposed on public lands in the western United States, including solar, wind and geothermal projects. These projects have the combined potential to add over 41,000 MW of renewable energy to the western electric grid.
The BLM is also undertaking the preliminary review of 90 applications for solar and wind development, as well as 51 applications for wind and solar energy testing. These clean energy projects will move the US closer to achieving the Biden administration’s goal of 100% carbon free electricity by 2035 and also supports the California Senate bill that sets a 60% renewable energy portfolio standard by 2030.

The SEI Women in Solar program consists of training, networking, mentorship, and clean energy employer and job connections, all with the goal of empowering women to join the clean energy sector and advance the careers and influence of women already working in the sector. Within the program, SEI is offering participants access to the SEI Women in Solar Online Community for career resources and networking, a mentorship webinar series, and scholarships for SEI’s tuition based online courses and annual SEI Women in Solar Hands-on Lab Week.
According to SEI, the partnership with SOLV was pursued in order to develop more training opportunities with new pathways to the many different types of jobs in the solar industry.
“As an organization, we take pride in having one of the largest teams of women instructors, curriculum developers, staff members, and women in leadership of any solar training provider in the industry,” said Elizabeth Sanderson, SEI’s executive director. “With that said, there is still a lot of work to be done.”
A 2021 survey of over 400 respondents in the U.S. solar industry from renewable energy recruitment company RO showed a 10% pay gap between men and women who worked in the same role and offered the same experience, up from 6% in 2020.
According to the most recent edition of the National Solar Job Census, with data current to the end of 2020, women represent just under 30% of the solar workforce, though that number is up from 26% in 2019. However, while data points to the number of women working in solar growing, it also shows that gender disparities still exist in the industry, as only 28% of women in the solar industry hold manager, director, or president-level positions, with SEI referencing McKinsey & Company’s 2020 Women in the Workplace report, which shows that the differences are even more stark for women of color.
That report found that white women in corporate America hold 23% of senior vice president roles and 19% of c-suite roles, compared to women of color at 5% and 3% respectively.
“Advancing equity and inclusion on our teams builds innovative, more resilient companies and a stronger solar industry,” said Jennifer Hershman, Director of Community Relations for SOLV Energy. “There are incredible career opportunities for women from all backgrounds and experiences in solar, and SOLV Energy is happy to partner with SEI to help open up the doors to our industry to a more diverse workforce.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/18/manchin-blocks-climate-bill-biden-said-he-will-take-executive-action/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 18, 2022","Manchin blocks climate bill, Biden said he will take executive action","Senate Democrats found themselves once again thwarted by Joe Manchin (D-WV) as the moderate announced he does not support the clean energy and climate related provisions in the reconciliation bill. His vote is a must-have in the 50-50 split on the Senate floor.
“If we make a real commitment on the climate front and we pay for it by making big corporations pay their fair share in taxes, that’s going to help us,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, (D-MA).
This March, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said the world will need 5.2 TW of solar power generation capacity by 2030, and 14 TW by mid-century, to have any chance of limiting global average temperature rises this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a critical threshold in limiting the worst effects of climate change.
Manchin told Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) he “unequivocally” won’t support a reconciliation package that includes climate and clean energy provisions, according to a Democrat briefed on the conversation.
This is not the first time Manchin has single-handedly blocked legislation that is designed to address the ongoing climate crisis. Last December, he shocked Democrats as he did not vote to pass the Build Back Better bill. Now, he blocked the reconciliation bill, much to the chagrin on climate-focused Democrats.
“I’m not going to sugarcoat my disappointment here, especially since nearly all issues in the climate and energy space had been resolved,” said Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR). “This is our last chance to prevent the most catastrophic — and costly — effects of climate change.”
Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said Manchin’s decision to hold back his vote “sabotaged the president’s agenda.” Sanders pointed to Manchin’s connection to the fossil fuel industry as a concern. “This is a guy who is a major recipient of fossil fuel money … a guy who has received campaign contributions from 25 Republican billionaires,” he said.
While Sen. Manchin said his focus is on helping families who are struggling with healthcare costs and inflation, Democrats and renewable energy advocates argue his move will only make life more costly for the average American, who would benefit from a stable supply of low-cost clean energy.
“Last night’s report that climate provisions and tax incentives for residential renewable energy will be stripped from the reconciliation bill is a major defeat for millions of American households who want to reduce skyrocketing utility bills, build healthier communities, and protect our climate,” said Residential Renewables for All, a coalition of environmental justice advocates. 
“The passage of 25D refundability would have allowed all families, regardless of their income level, to make the switch to an affordable and green energy solution. This commonsense provision would have helped combat inflation, helped working families make ends meet, and helped respond to the climate crisis. Failure to pass it is as reckless as it is disappointing,” said the group.
“Manchin represents the very wealthiest people in this country, not working families in West Virginia or America,” Sanders added.
Executive action
President Joe Biden stated his office will now take further executive action to address the climate crisis.
“If the Senate will not move to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen our domestic clean energy industry, I will take strong executive action to meet this moment. My actions will create jobs, improve our energy security, bolster domestic manufacturing and supply chains, protect us from oil and gas price hikes in the future, and address climate change. I will not back down: the opportunity to create jobs and build a clean energy future is too important to relent,” wrote Biden.
Last month, the Biden administration began taking strides to support clean energy buildout and combat climate change. Executive action was taken to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA), which has wide implications in its applicability. It will specifically be used to boost domestic production of solar panel parts including modules and module components, insulation for buildings, efficient electric heat pumps for heating and cooling, equipment for making electricity-generated fuels, including electrolyzes, fuel cells, and related platinum group metals, and critical power grid infrastructure like transformers.
The Act will encourage strong labor standards, including agreements for project labor and community benefits that ensure prevailing wages are paid and a quota of local hiring is met.
Concurrent with the invoking of the DPA, the White House announced it will apply super-preference to the US solar manufacturing industry. Master Supply Agreements will be put in place to enable domestic clean electricity providers to sell products to the US government rapidly and efficiently. Such agreements standardize contracts, making them easier to administer, and supporting transparent quality control for all parties involved.
It also enacted the use of “Super Preferences”, which apply domestic component content standards for federal procurement of solar projects.
The White House said these actions combined will pave the way for 10 GW of solar procurement over the next decade by the United States government alone. In cooperation with local and state governments and municipal utilities, the administration said the actions will make a potential market impact of as much as 100 GW over the next decade.
It remains to be seen what further actions the Biden Administration will take, and how the DPA will be administered. As the reconciliation package remains locked up by Manchin, executive action may serve as the main legal remedy for the United States to address the ongoing struggles with costly energy and climate change.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/18/small-cracks-have-negligible-effect-on-solar-cell-performance/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 18, 2022",Small cracks have negligible effect on solar cell performance,"From pv magazine global
Researchers from the University of York (UK) have investigated how the performance and durability of solar cells may be affected by different sizes of cracks and the formation of hotspots.
They specified that their work is intended to fill a gap of knowledge on whether all crack types can lead to a significant drop in the output power generation of solar cells. “The crack issue in solar cells becomes worse as the thickness of the wafer is being reduced,” they stated. “This is the case because the reduced thickness makes it easier to develop extra mechanical stresses in the cells when assembled into a full-scale PV module.”
Their analysis was conducted on three-busbar solar cells, provided by an unnamed manufacturer, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.61 V, a short circuit current density of 38.8 mA/cm2, and a peak power of 4.72 W.
They used electroluminescence (EL) imaging through a digital camera with a resolution of 6k × 4k pixels and a camera lens of 18-55 mm. “The solar cell samples were connected with a power supply for biasing purposes under short circuit conditions,” the scientists said. “The percentage of the crack was computed by subtracting a cracked vs crack-free image.”

The UK group submitted the cells to solar illumination under varying irradiance of 100-1000 W/m2 and their temperature was kept constant at 25 C. Through these measurements, it found the solar cells were affected by crack percentages ranging from 1% to 58%.
The researchers explained that output power losses for the cells with crack percentages below 11% were insignificant, adding that these cells are relatively equivalent to non-cracked cells. “It is recognized that a hotspot is to develop if the crack percentage, which is essentially representing an inactive area in the solar cell, is in the range between 11 and 34%,” they also explained.
According to the academics, their findings confirm that small cracks have a negligible effect on solar cell output, and they develop no hotspots. They also found that a crack percentage of over 46% is also insufficient to develop a hotspot, as there is a significant inactive area in the cells, which means the localized heat can be critical but not enough area to develop a hotspot.
They presented the results of their work in the paper “Rapid testing on the effect of cracks on solar cells output power performance and thermal operation,” published in scientific reports. “There are still some critical questions to be answered/linked with this research work; an example, how do cracks or hotspots develop over time?,” they concluded. “This has to be investigated over a long-term period for solar cells operating in diverse environmental conditions rather than simply examining the solar cells under artificial indoor illumination.”
This article was amended to reflect that the researchers are from the University of York in the UK.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/18/study-confirms-rule-of-thumb-that-pv-inverters-should-run-without-faults-for-around-15-years/,"OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,RESEARCH,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 18, 2022",Study confirms rule of thumb that PV inverters should run without faults for around 15 years,"From pv magazine Germany
Researchers at Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH) are currently investigating the durability and performance of PV inverters and power optimizers from a total of 1,280 PV systems located in Switzerland.
In their survey, the researchers considered the type of power electronics, the year the PV system was commissioned and the year the first energy-related fault occurred. Their evaluation revealed an average time until the first energy-related error occurred. “The results of all the inverters and power optimizers examined show that over 50 percent of the power electronics do not show any yield-relevant errors up to the age of 15,” the researchers wrote in their preliminary findings.
The data also showed that lifespans depend on various factors. For example, more powerful PV inverters have shorter service lives, while the power optimizers considered individually lasted the longest. However, it should be noted that the overall reliability of a PV system increases with a smaller number of electronic power components.
The Swiss scientists further found that outdoor power electronics are more susceptible to interference than indoor PV inverters and power optimizers. At the same time, they discovered that the first fault occurs earlier in PV systems with inverters with power optimizers than in systems that do not have power optimizers. The service life of the devices also varies depending on the manufacturer.
The researchers specified, however, that the validity of their results is limited, as it is a non-representative cross-section of the power electronics used in rooftop systems in Switzerland or Europe. The PV inverters considered came mainly from the manufacturers Fronius, Sputnik, and SMA and most of the power optimizers examined came from Solaredge.
The causes of the failures and defects have not yet been precisely recorded. In general, the failure of a power optimizer usually results in a lower loss of yield in a PV system rather than the failure of an inverter. Nevertheless, both defects were rated in the same in the evaluation. A fundamental distinction should also be made in that defective power optimizers are usually replaced, while defective inverters are repaired.
Despite the limited extent of their work, the BFH researchers did dare to draw a conclusion on their previous data. They believe, in fact, that the “the rule of thumb that inverters should run without faults for around 15 years” is confirmed by their findings. The research project will run until the end of 2025 and the investigation will be repeated in the future and extended to other systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/18/the-mobility-revolution-rising-gas-prices-supercharge-ev-adoption-in-the-us/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,GERMANY,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JULY 18, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: Rising gas prices supercharge EV adoption in the US,"From pv magazine global
The adoption of EV in the US is picking up pace as gasoline prices soar to record levels. According to a national survey by the American Automobile Association (AAA), a quarter of Americans surveyed say they will buy an EV as their next automobile, with millennials most eager to go electric. Of those looking to buy a plug-in vehicle, 77% said the interest was driven by a desire to save on fuel costs. When comparing two popular EV sedans against popular gasoline-powered vehicles, the AAA found that fueling a gasoline-powered vehicle (about $70 for a full tank) is twice as expensive as charging an EV at a public station (around $20 per full charge) and about four times pricier than charging an EV at home (around $10 per full charge).
In addition to fuel savings, EVs cost less to maintain because they don’t have spark plugs, need oil changes or air-filter replacements. However, upon the conclusion of a federally mandated 100,000-mile vehicle warranty, EV owners may need to cover the cost of new batteries, which range in price from $2,500 to over $10,000, the AAA notes. Even as more Americans lean into electric options, the AAA found lingering consumer hesitation surrounding price (cited by 60% of consumers), range (60%), and accessibility to charging (58%). Regarding the latter, data from the US Department of Energy suggests there are nearly 55,674 charging stations throughout the nation.
In the UK, EVs are expected to make up close to a third of used car sales by 2030. According to a report by LV= General Insurance, 31% of cars on the used market will be EVs by the time the government introduces a ban on sale of new petrol and diesel cars. “While the average annual running costs of electric cars are significantly cheaper than petrol or diesel cars, the sticker price remains one of the big barriers for drivers considering making the switch, which is why these projections for a thriving second-hand market by 2030 are so encouraging,” Gill Nowell, head of EV at LV= General Insurance said. In 2021, fully electric vehicles made up only 1.3% of cars on UK roads, numbering 399,981. That figure is expected to exceed 1 million in 2023 (3.1%) and 6.4 million in 2025 (6%). In 2021, EVs are only expected to make up 2% of the total second-hand car market with 129,032 sold. The figure is expected to grow steadily by 2026, when 1 million are expected on the road, equating to 15% of the used car annual sales market. Used EVs are forecast to rise to more than 3 million by 2030.
Volkswagen Group of America has teamed with recycling start-up Redwood Materials, founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, to establish a closed-loop battery supply chain in the US. Redwood will work directly with Volkswagen Group of America’s network of more than 1,000 dealers to recover, safely package, transport, and recycle end-of-life EV battery packs from Volkswagen and Audi vehicles. According to Redwood, the batteries will be processed at its northern Nevada facilities, where more than 95% of metals, like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper, will be recovered and then used to re-manufacture anode and cathode components that it will supply back to US battery cell manufacturers. The partnership is “the first step in creating circularity for current and future vehicles” of Volkswagen, which is aiming for 55% of its US sales to be fully electric by 2030. In Nevada, Redwood says it already recycles more than 6 GWh of lithium-ion batteries each year, enough to power more than 60,000 electric vehicles — the “majority of lithium-ion batteries recycled in North America today.” Redwood previously partnered with Ford, Volvo and Toyota in EV battery recycling. The company is also planning to establish two recycling factories in Europe.
In Germany, Volkswagen has commissioned a fast-charging park at its electric car plant in Zwickau, which is supplied with energy largely from a so-called Power Storage Container (PSC). The PSC consists of 96 cell modules with a net capacity of 570 kWh, which were formerly installed as batteries in pre-production ID.302 and ID.403 models and have now been given a second purpose. According to VW, the advantage is this fast-charging infrastructure can be built nearly anywhere, even in places with a low-capacity grid connection. It is also described as a “cost-effective alternative to the transformer station.” The automotive power bank could enable high power charger infrastructure to be built in the future where previously only AC charging at a maximum of 11 kW has been possible, for instance in residential areas, according to the car maker. The charging park at the west gate of the Zwickau plant is made up of four charging stations, each with an output of 150 kW, which can also be divided into two outputs of 75 kW. This means that up to eight vehicles can charge at the same time. The electricity comes from an adjacent PV installation, from which Volkswagen Sachsen has been purchasing green electricity since 2017, among other  renewable energy sources. Three fast-charging parks will be in operation on the plant grounds by the end of the year. For the PSC, Volkswagen Sachsen is relying on a solution that Audi already successfully used as part of its charging hub  in Nuremberg. The container cubes consist of used lithium-ion batteries from disassembled Audi test vehicles that are used as buffer storage for DC electricity.

The project is estimated to save the producer $2 million in utility cost savings over 20 years at the Paramount, California location. The system is planned to come online by Q4 this year.
The facility will employ 1,495 modules that support the food producer’s operations 717.6 kW of capacity. Paired with the PV array is a planned 556 kWh energy storage system. The battery will be controlled by Qcells’ Geli energy management system.
Qcells plans to install its Q.PEAK DUO XL-G10.3 modules with 480 W capacity. The modules are bifacial, leading to an energy yield gain of up to 20%, said Qcells. The 30-year performance warranty covers at least 98% of nominal power during first year, and a maximum of 0.45% degradation per year thereafter.
The modules have an anodized aluminum frame, weigh 64 lbs each, and measure roughly seven ft. by three and a half ft. The modules have Stäubli MC4, and Stäubli MC4-Evo2, connectors and bypass diodes in the junction box.
The project is structured as a power purchase agreement, where Jayone is offered utility savings and clean energy, while Qcells acts as owner and operator. The project qualifies for state and federal incentives, including the California Self Generation Inventive Program (SGIP) and the 26% federal investment tax credit.
Jayone Foods said it experienced significant business growth that led to the food producer investing in energy intensive equipment like double-sized cold storage units. The company started as a small tofu factory, and now is a growing producer of Korean foods. The solar and storage project is expected to meet the producer’s needs of cutting costs while mitigating carbon footprint.
“In an age when making more sustainable decisions plays an increasingly important role in how we do business, Jayone Foods Inc. is excited to partner with a complete energy solutions provider like Qcells to benefit from reduced energy costs while making a positive contribution to the environment,” said Seung Hoon Lee, president of Jayone Foods, Inc.
