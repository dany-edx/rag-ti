Since 2006, New York has offered a Solar Tax Credit that is capped at $5,000 per household installing solar. The credit is sized at 25% of the system cost, or $5,000, whichever comes first. The new bill would double that cap to $10,000, allowing customers to offset state income taxes with a credit. It would retain the 25% installed system cost.
For eligible low- to moderate-income residents, the tax credit would also be available to be collected as a tax refund. Any remaining credit that exceeds the amount due in taxes would be paid as a refund.
If passed, solar projects installed after January 1, 2025 would be eligible for the heightened cap. Energy storage tied to a PV system would also be considered an eligible cost for the credit.
The bill states:
“Though residential solar provides a net savings in energy costs, the high upfront cost of installing solar panels is an obstacle that hinders homeowners across New York from fitting their roofs with solar. Indeed, with an initial installation cost in the five-figure range – a heavy lift for many families – it can take several years for residents to receive a return on their investment. Expanding the residential solar tax credit limit will make the installation of residential solar more affordable and accelerate its expansion, assisting the state in meeting our goals.” 
The support rally is taking place Thursday, March 7, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. Participants will gather at 838 Park Place, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, an income-restricted co-op building with a rooftop solar canopy.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/06/california-community-solar-market-lies-in-limbo/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,2024-03-06,California community solar market lies in limbo,"Earlier this year assembly member Chris Ward, AB 2316 put forth the Community Renewable Energy Act that would create a community renewable energy program, including community solar-plus-storage, to overcome access barriers for nearly half of Californians who rent or have low incomes.
Community solar enables small businesses and residents who are renters or who otherwise cannot put solar on their roof to subscribe to a portion of an off-site solar facility, receiving a utility bill credit for the power it generates. 
AB 2316 is based in part on New York’s program, which has established the state as the nation’s leader in community solar. Governor Newsom signed the bill into law last September, essentially requiring the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to create an affordable and equitable community solar program. Then it advanced to the CPUC to undergo the rulemaking process.
The Community Renewable Energy Act (AB 2316) was sponsored by the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA), and met with strong support from groups like SEIA, GRID Alternatives, Vote Solar, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and more. Notably, investor-owned utilities, which serve over 75% of the electricity usage in the state, opposed the bill. Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, and Southern California Edison all signed on in opposition to the bill.
The CPUC asserted in its proposed decision that the Net Value Billing Tariff (NVBT) outlined in the Community Renewable Energy Act “conflicts with federal law and does not meet the requirements” of the bill.
In a statement released by CCSA, a national trade association representing over 125 community solar developers, businesses, and nonprofits, Derek Chernow, Western Regional Director, said the CPUC missed an opportunity to become a national leader in community solar.
“Unfortunately, this proposed decision misses the mark entirely and will make it impossible to ensure equitable access to renewable energy plus storage projects that maximize benefits to low-income communities and further environmental justice,” said Chernow.
The CCSA developed the NVBT and stated that the proposed decision’s assertion that it conflicts with federal law “manages to both misinterpret federal law and our proposal, and ignores precedent that has been set by states deploying community solar for more than a decade”.
Last month, the Department of Energy (DOE) reaffirmed the Federal Government’s significant commitment to rapidly deploying third-party developed community solar by establishing the National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP). The program set an ambitious goal of enabling enough community solar projects to power the equivalent of 5 million households, and achieve $1 billion in combined energy bill savings. This goal aligns with the DOE’s greater target of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and places a focus on ensuring that American citizens can meaningfully access the benefits of the energy transition.
CCSA noted that private developers, operating under similar models to the NVBT, have installed more than 6.6 GW of community solar capacity in more than a dozen states across the country.
Despite having to fallen behind Texas as the number one solar state in the nation, California is still a significant market. The CCSA contends that the U.S. cannot meet the DOE’s goals without a truly scalable community solar program in California.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/06/irs-releases-final-rules-for-clean-energy-tax-credit-direct-pay-and-transferability/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-06,IRS releases final rules for clean energy tax credit direct pay and transferability,"The IRS has issued its final guidance on the elective pay rules for clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The guidance removes any temporary regulations and enacts the final rules, which can be found following this link. The IRS provided updated elective payment frequently asked questions based on the final regulations. The FAQ section includes a step-by-step guide on how to become eligible for direct pay or credit transfers, and how to file these transactions.
Elective pay, sometimes referred to as direct pay, makes certain clean energy tax credits and the CHIPs manufacturing credit effectively refundable as direct payments. The entity can receive the full value of the credit because the IRS treats the elective payment amount as a tax payment. IRS then counts it as overpayment on the return and refunds it to the entity.
Eligible entities for direct pay include tax-exempt organizations, state and local governments, Indian tribal governments, Alaska Native Corporations, the Tennessee Valley Authority and rural electric cooperatives. Find a brief overview of elective pay rules here.
Transferability allows entities that can’t use elective pay but do qualify for an eligible tax credit to transfer all or a portion of the credit to a third-party buyer in exchange for cash. The buyer and seller would negotiate and agree to the terms and pricing.
Solar and energy storage accounted for about one-third of transferable tax credits sold in 2023, according to Crux, a tax credit transfer marketplace platform. Several large projects have already secured tax credit transfer deals.
(Read: “Solar tax credit transfer market gains momentum”)
The clean energy tax credit transfer market reached an estimated $7 billion to $9 billion in 2023, and this market is expected to triple in 2024. Clean energy already represents about one third of the total tax finance market in the United States. Crux expects the potential for over $80 billion in solar tax finance by 2031, with a significant portion of the growth expected to stem from transferable tax credits.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/06/battery-prices-collapsing-grid-tied-energy-storage-expanding/,"COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-03-06,"Battery prices collapsing, grid-tied energy storage expanding","We are in the midst of a year-long acceleration in the decline of battery cell prices, a trend that is reminiscent of recent solar cell price reductions.
Since last summer, lithium battery cell pricing has plummeted by approximately 50%, according to Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world’s largest battery manufacturer. In early summer 2023, publicly available prices ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 RMB/Wh ($0.11 to $0.13 USD/Wh), or about $110 to 130/kWh.

Pricing initially fell by about a third by the end of summer 2023. Now, as reported by CnEVPost, large EV battery buyers are acquiring cells at 0.4 RMB/Wh, representing a price decline of 50%to 56%. Leapmotor’s CEO, Cao Li, expects further reductions, with prices potentially dropping to 0.32 RMB/Wh this summer, marking a decrease of 60% to 64% in a single year.
EnergyTrend observed that energy storage battery cells are priced similarly to electric vehicle battery cells.
Additionally, CnEVPost reports that the battery cells being sold come equipped with advanced technologies, including faster charge rates, higher cycle life, improved temperature management characteristics, and higher energy density packaging.
A February report from Goldman Sachs attributes the accelerated price declines partly to a slight slowdown in electric vehicle adoption, leading to lower commodity prices. The finance group revised its global battery demand growth projection to 29% for 2024, down from the previous estimate of 35%, with a 31% growth expected in 2023.

Goldman also forecasts a 40% reduction in battery pack prices over 2023 and 2024, followed by a continued decline to reach a total 50% reduction by 2025-2026. Goldman predicts that these price reductions will make electric vehicles as affordable as gasoline-powered vehicles, leading to increased demand.
One of the most notable commodity price declines related to EVs is that of lithium hydroxide. Its price surged from late 2021 through 2022, then began to tumble in early 2023, and continues to decrease today.

The price decreases are attributed to several factors, including a perception of stabilizing demand as manufacturers struggle to make EVs profitable, which has led to a softening of speculative investment in vehicle metal futures markets. Other contributing factors include supply chain improvements, decreasing inflation, and new lithium supplies coming online.
Other metals, such as copper, have fallen from pandemic-era highs but have not returned to pre-2020 prices.
Interestingly, both batteries and solar panels have seen their prices drop by about 90% since 2010, with both products currently experiencing accelerated price declines. The Rocky Mountain Institute’s December report, “X-Change: Batteries – The Battery Domino Effect,” presents a chart mirroring the trends seen in solar panels over the last fourteen years.

Looking back thirty or forty years, the costs of both batteries and solar panels have decreased by 99% or more for their base units.
Driven by these price declines, grid-tied energy storage deployment has seen robust growth over the past decade, a trend that is expected to continue into 2024.  The U.S. is projected to nearly double its deployed battery capacity by adding more than 14 GW of hardware this year alone. China is anticipated to become the grid storage leader, with deployments of just over 24 GW of capacity expected. EnergyTrend forecasts a global deployment of 71 GW of capacity, representing a 46% expansion over the 177% growth seen in 2022.
There is abundant anecdotal evidence from public and private sources corroborating these price declines in the marketplace. A significant example is the drop in electric vehicle prices over the past year, so substantial that Hertz had to publicly adjust the value of its Tesla fleet due to falling resale values. pv magazine USA has spoken with multiple energy storage vendors who have reported significant reductions in pricing, though one noted that while cell pricing has fallen significantly, the broader balance of system surrounding the battery cells has not fallen as quickly.
One vendor mentioned that advancements in battery cell technology, leading to increased energy densities, have contributed to lower deployed system costs per kWh.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/06/battery-heavyweights-reaffirm-commitment-to-solid-state-technology/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,2024-03-06,Battery heavyweights reaffirm commitment to solid-state technology,"As lithium-ion batteries continue to improve in terms of both performance and cost, it is becoming increasingly difficult for alternative technologies to challenge the incumbent. However, interest in solid-state batteries, which promise better energy density and safety, has not waned, judging by recent announcements.
South Korea’s Samsung SDI is moving toward mass production of its all-solid-state battery technology with an energy density of 900 Wh/L. This week, the company is unveiling a technology roadmap at the InterBattery show in Seoul.
The document will demonstrate that every aspect of its plan for mass producing all solid-state batteries in 2027 is well on track, from development production line project launch to supply chain management, Samsung SDI said in a statement.
In December 2023, Samsung SDI established a dedicated team to promote the commercialization of its all solid-state business. Previously, it set up a pilot in its R&D Center in Suwon last year and is currently delivering proto samples.
“Our preparations for mass-producing next-generation products of various form factors such as all solid-state battery are well underway,” said Samsung SDI President and CEO Yoon-ho Choi.
Like CATL, BYD and Toyota, Samsung’s solid-state technology is based on sulfide-based solid electrolytes, which have the highest lithium ion conductivity compared to other solid state electrolytes. All solid-state batteries developed by Samsung SDI stand out for their anode-less configuration which is said to offer improved performance compared to devices featuring lithium metal anode and solid electrolyte.
Samsung’s roadmap release comes hot off the heals of the announcement of a Chinese national alliance of automakers and battery giants, including BYD, CATL, and Nio, aimed at developing all solid-state batteries.
In a bid to build a supply chain for solid-state batteries by 2030, Beijing in January set up a consortium, the China All-Solid-State Battery Collaborative Innovation Platform (CASIP), which brings together government, academia, and industry.
China already dominates the global battery market and looks determined to stay on top by boosting research and development of next-gen battery technologies, such as solid-state batteries which are particularly suited for electric mobility applications.
Among automakers, Japanese Toyota Motors has taken the lead with more the 1,000 solid-state battery patents. Last month, it said that it is preparing to mass-produce solid-state batteries by 2027 or 2028.
Nissan and Honda have previously revealed plans to establish solid-state battery manufacturing lines in-house. Meanwhile, Western automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, BMW, and Ford are also exploring solid-state batteries through partnerships with startups.
However, the production of solid-state batteries at scale is still held back by technological challenges and high costs, with industry analysts warning of a relatively tough path toward mass production in the coming years.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/06/solar-now-accounts-for-over-50-of-new-electricity-capacity-added-to-the-u-s-grid/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,CALIFORNIA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-03-06,Solar now accounts for over 50% of new electricity capacity added to the U.S. grid,"When President Biden signed the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act into law in August 2022, the U.S. solar industry was given the green light for takeoff, and it has shattered records—adding 32.4 GW of new electric generating capacity last year, or 51% since 2022. According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight, Year-in-Review 2023 by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, this is the first time in 80 years that a renewable electricity source has accounted for over 50% of annual capacity additions.
“If we stay the course with our federal clean energy policies, total solar deployment will quadruple over the next ten years,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “The Inflation Reduction Act is supercharging solar deployment and having a material impact on our economy, helping America’s solar module manufacturing base grow 89% in 2023. We must protect and optimize the policies that are driving these investments and creating jobs, and the stakes in the upcoming election couldn’t be higher.”
According to report estimates, total U.S. solar capacity is expected to grow to 673 GW by 2034, or enough to power more than 100 million homes.
With this growth comes some challenges including high interest rates, tax credit financing, U.S. supply chain, and interconnection. Coupled with uncertainty around the possibility of a new administration in 2025, the report includes high- and low-case forecast scenarios that show how policy and economic factors could impact the solar market over the next ten years, with a 200 GW difference two forecasts.

 
The Bull case is based on the possibility of overcoming many of the existing challenges, for example, interest rates decline and then stabilize, that more corporations become tax equity providers, that there are fewer supply chain restraints and that interconnection issues are resolved. The Bear case flips these assumptions, resulting in what report authors estimate could be a “200 GWdc swing in solar installations over the next decade based on various political and economic outcomes”.
“A high case for U.S. solar with increased supply chain stability, more tax credit financing, and lower interest rates would increase our outlook 17%,” said Michelle Davis, head of global solar at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “A low case with supply chain constraints, less tax credit financing, and static interest rates would decrease our outlook 24%. Various policy and economic outcomes will have big implications for the U.S. solar industry.”
Supply chain
One of the challenges of rapid growth in the U.S. solar industry is procuring domestic content and reducing reliance on imports from China and other countries. U.S. module manufacturing grew from 8.5 GW to 16.1 GW last year, and established manufacturers have bold plans for future growth. For example, First Solar produced a record 12.1 GW of solar modules, growing 33% over 2022 totals. By the end of 2026, the company expects to have 14 GW of U.S. solar capacity and 11 GW internationally, reaching 25 GW of global solar module production. Additionally, Qcells recently expanded its solar module factory in Dalton, Georgia where it added 2 GW of solar capacity, bringing the factory’s output to more than 5.1 GW. Canadian Solar set up a manufacturing facility in Texas and expect to produce 5 GW of TOPCon modules annually.
However, a few headwinds are facing module manufacturers hoping to set up shop in the U.S., including high interest rates coupled by record low prices for modules from overseas.
Market segments
According to the WoodMac SEIA report, every segment saw year-over-year growth in 2023, bringing total installed solar capacity in the U.S. to 177 GW. The utility-scale sector alone added 22.5 GW of new capacity. Despite challenges in the residential sector including changes in net energy metering (NEM) policy and high interest rates, nearly 800,000 Americans added solar to their homes.
Partly in response to cuts to NEM policies and partly to ensure resiliency, energy storage was added to 13% of residential installations and 5% of non-residential. That figure is expected to jump to 25% of new residential installations this year and will double to 10% of non-residential.
Leading states
Solar has been on an upswing across the nation, with more than half the states with 1 GW of total installed solar capacity. While California stood far ahead of the rest of the country in terms of installed solar capacity, Texas leads for the second time in the past three years with 6.5 GW of new solar installations with 6.5 GW. California’s residential solar market was woefully hurt by NEM changes, and the report authors project a  36% decline across all segments in the state. Colorado, Ohio and Wisconsin are rising stars in U.S. solar, entering the top 10 solar states in 2023.
Looking forward, the Year in Review report expects solar to nearly quadruple from 177 GWdc installed at year-end 2023, to 673 GWdc installed by 2034 and by 2040, it
is expected to make up the largest share of electric generating capacity in the US.
