“You can put solar on your roof and get a 30% tax credit” under the IRA, he said, or add energy storage, buy an electric vehicle, install high efficiency windows or an electric heat pump—“all these customer decisions are being significantly affected by this law.”
North Carolina, a “long-standing leader” in manufacturing and supply chains for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, is evaluating how to use support from the IRA to invest in charging infrastructure for the vehicles, purchase incentives, and workforce development, said Zach Pierce, senior advisor for climate change policy to North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.
Building on those points, Bryan Garcia, president of the Connecticut Green Bank, said it’s good to “see how environmental policy is good industrial policy.” With Connecticut’s reliance on methane gas generation, Garcia said the state’s electric rates recently went from 25 cents to 37 cents per kWh. “People are tired of it,” he said. “They want to put their energy costs in their own hands.” He said that low to moderate-income families in the state were pursuing solar to protect themselves against inflation.
The Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA) presented the webinar on behalf of the 100% Clean Energy Collaborative. CESA positioned the webinar as a lead-in to a state-federal “summit” next month on advancing toward 100% clean energy.
Benefits
In Minnesota, the IRA incentives will save customers of the state’s largest utility $1 billion when applied to the electric generating capacity expected under the utility’s current resource plan, said Pete Wyckoff, assistant commissioner for federal and state energy initiatives with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. Considering possible new clean energy “ambition” supported by the IRA in the utility’s next resource plan, he said, “it brings even more savings.”
North Carolina, said Pierce, will use the IRA program that helps states plan how to reduce climate pollution to “look across all of the federal funding programs,” to consider the state’s needs, and identify the most appropriate programs “to mobilize those needs.”
Garcia said that every state “should look into” the IRA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which can help “use limited public resources to mobilize private investment” to support the needs of the most vulnerable populations.
On the webinar’s theme of what clean energy trends are popular with state residents, Louise Martinez, director of New Mexico’s energy conservation management division, said the state received applications exceeding $12 million for a solar tax credit, as “New Mexicans are very interested in using the natural resource that we have available to us.” In a separate development, New Mexico’s State Land Office has reached annual revenues of $12 million by leasing land for wind and solar developments, she said.
Challenges
Turning to challenges, Wyckoff mentioned the $400 billion in federal loan guarantee authority under the IRA for clean energy transition projects, and said that “in Minnesota, we are trying to get our head around how to incentivize” the use of federally backed loans, as well as the IRA’s tax credits.
Garcia with the Connecticut Green Bank noted the IRA provision supporting state energy financing institutions, which allows the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office “to support commercially available technologies, when developers are partnering with states.” He said “all of us should be very encouraging of developers” who want to use the loan program to lower their cost of capital.
Hochschild said that California, to help ensure reliability as its grid transitions to clean power, now has 5 GW of storage and should reach 15 GW by 2030. Grid reliability is a “100% solvable” problem, he said, and is “just a matter of getting enough resources interconnected” and “being smart about grid interactive technology” to allow for flexible demand to help meet peak needs.
Wyckoff said Minnesota is “already dealing with strains” on the transmission and distribution systems, while “we want to build out in a rapid manner much more wind and solar.”
Martinez said that New Mexico’s experience is that “it takes decades to get a transmission line built.”
Hochschild lamented that the solar project best known to Americans is Solyndra, which “failed because other solar companies were lower cost and growing fast.” He said “we’ve done an insufficient job of telling the success stories, and the benefits to the public in a way that really flips the script.”
Community support
Regarding community support, Pierce said that the power sector emission targets set by North Carolina over a year ago came out of a stakeholder process and reflect broad support, not just for controlling ratepayers’ electric bills but also for economic development in the solar and offshore wind industries and their supply chains.
Hochschild said that clean air is popular in California, and that clean energy is seen as a way to get there. If you’ve “grown up with smog,” he said, “clean air sounds a lot better.”
On the topic of equity, Pierce said North Carolina is “mapping the disproportionate local air impacts of our medium and heavy-duty trucks, especially on our communities of color,” to guide the use of federal resources to invest in clean school buses or other measures.

LG Energy Solution, a manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries, unveiled a new residential energy storage system, Prime+, which features flexible capacity to meet home back-up power needs.
LG’s new residential storage system connects two 10-hour batteries or 16-hour Prime battery modules in parallel to offer a capacity of 19.2 kWh to 32 kWh, with a maximum output of 9.6kW from the inverter.
Prime+ will officially launch across the U.S. in May 2023 and represents LG’s first residential energy storage system that includes an inverter in the North American market under its own brand name.
The company reports that the storage system’s modular architecture and plug-and-play design of the inverter ensures easy installation and compatibility with any existing photovoltaic array. 
“It takes less than 10 minutes for full inverter and battery commissioning, substantially lifting the time burden for the installers,” said Ryan Simpson, sales director of LGES ESS Team in North America.
Prime+ is designed as a retrofit option for partial or whole home backup due to its compatibility with the existing PV systems. The company said that the new solution is expected to benefit California residents, as the third iteration of net energy metering (NEM 3.0), which took effect in mid-April.
Prime+ is offered in two configurations:
LG’s Prime+ platform includes a 10-year warranty for batteries, the inverter and the auto backup device, which ensures durability.
The company is hosting pilot sites under its installer network at multiple U.S. locations ahead of Prime+’s official launch to give installers the opportunity for hands-on experience of the new energy storage system.
LG Energy Solution, a split-off from LG Chem, is a global manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries for EV, mobility and energy storage markets. The company currently holds battery manufacturing facilities established through joint ventures with General Motors, Stellantis, Hyundai, and Honda Motor.  BloombergNEF and SNE Research ranked LG Energy Solution as the third largest global supplier of EV batteries this year, trailing just CATL and BYD.
In March, LG released plans to invest $5.5 billion in two U.S. manufacturing facilities in Arizona. One will be for cylindrical batteries for EVs and the other for lithium iron phosphate pouch-type batteries for energy storage systems, representing the largest single investment to date in the North American battery supply chain.
The company plans to break ground on both facilities this year, and expects mass production of 2,170 cylindrical battery cells in 2025. These batteries will primarily serve U.S. EV manufacturers who are seeking made-in-the-USA batteries in order to take advantage of tax credits offered by the Inflation Reduction Act.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/01/catl-battery-distributor-looking-at-three-states-for-4-2-gwh-battery-facility/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ARIZONA,CALIFORNIA,NEVADA,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 1, 2023",CATL battery distributor looking at three states for 4.2 GWh battery facility,"Coulomb Solutions Inc. (CSI), a commercial electric vehicle battery integrator that installs CATL lithium-iron phosphate battery cells, announced a process for site selection of a 4.2 GWh manufacturing facility to assemble lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery packs for freight, hauling and logistics vehicles.
CSI is evaluating sites in Arizona, Nevada and Texas to set up a domestic sourcing base for its commercial EV batteries that use CATL battery cells. The company expects to finalize its site selection process by early summer.
CSI, based in Livermore, Calif., is the North American distributor of commercial vehicle batteries for Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, the largest lithium-ion battery designer and manufacturer in the world.
The planned facility will have initial capacity of up to 4.2 GWh per year and can further expand capacity as the U.S. commercial EV market expands in the following years.  The facility is expected to create more than 300 highly skilled jobs in battery production, assembly, quality, engineering, supply chain, and various support and management functions.

“CSI’s new EV battery pack assembly facility will give U.S. commercial vehicle manufacturers a ‘Made in America’ battery system using the world’s most proven cutting edge LFP cells,” said David Mazaika, chief executive office, CSI. “The new U.S. production will cut our lead time in half, which supports CSI’s goal to enable the rapid adoption of electric drive systems in commercial vehicles.”
The new battery facility will produce and stock a variety of off-the-shelf battery packs that can be combined into validated battery systems ranging from 30kWh to over 3.5MWh.
Using these validated packs, traditional and emerging North American OEM customers can by-pass lengthy and expensive battery system development programs, as well as time-consuming lead times for battery components sourced from Asia.
These battery systems combined with CSI’s complete suite of plug-and-play accessories for commercial vehicle electrification will both reduce the cost and greatly improve time to market for U.S. commercial vehicle OEMs in launching new models.
CATL batteries power over 375,000 buses and trucks in daily operation with some of the largest commercial fleets. Besides LFP batteries for commercial vehicles, CSI also operates a line of accessory components for commercial EVs including battery heating and cooling systems, air conditioning compressors, electric cab heaters, steering pumps, air compressors and 20 kW onboard AC and fast DC chargers.
CSI was founded in 2019 as the North American distributor of CATL battery pack systems for commercial vehicles.  The company supplies battery systems to various Tier I and II OEMs and EV companies, including Phoenix Motorcars, Lightning eMotors and Workhorse Group. Its management team comprises a team which hails from CATL, ElectraMeccanica and Ricardo Advanced Vehicle Technologies.
According to its website, the company provides 22 kWh to 70 kWh battery packs to bus fleets, medium to heavy-duty truck fleets capable of providing up to 4,000 cycles and a 10-year battery life system for electric transportation.
The company was named after French physicist and engineer Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who standardized Coulomb’s Law, which states that the force between two electrical charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The standard international unit of electric charge, the Coulomb, was named after the French physicist.
According to BloombergNEF, about 56% of the light-duty fleet market and 31% of medium-duty trucks are to be electrified by 2040 as the transportation market turns to alternative fuel solutions. Light-duty vehicles comprises trucks, vans or buses with  a gross vehicle weight up to 8,500 pounds,  while medium duty trucks refer to Class 6 and 7 vehicles whose gross vehicle weight ranges from 19,501 to 33,000 pounds.
According to March 2023 U.S. Treasury guidance, in order to receive the federal tax credit of $7,500 for a new EV purchased under the Inflation Reduction Act, consumers and suppliers must show that 80% of the value of the EV battery system’s critical minerals are sourced from within the U.S., and that battery components are also sourced in North America. Over time this requirement starts out lower, at 40%, then ramps up. Alternatively, this benchmark could be reached using minerals sourced from free-trade partners, or the minerals could hail from elsewhere but be processed in the U.S. Vehicle purchases that meet just one of the two requirements via critical minerals sourcing or battery components sourcing are eligible to receive a $3,750 federal credit.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/01/solar-decathlon-winners-announced/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,INDIANA,MINNESOTA,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 1, 2023",Solar Decathlon winners announced,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the winners of the 21st annual Solar Decathlon, an annual collegiate contest and DOE’s longest-running student competition.
The contest challenges the next generation to design and construct high-performance, low-carbon buildings powered by renewable energy, while promoting student innovation, STEM education and workforce development opportunities in the buildings industry.
Ball State University, University of Minnesota, and the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art won the top honors at this year’s competition and were announced at the Solar Decathlon Competition Event at DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo.
“As we work to build America’s clean energy future and implement President Biden’s ambitious climate agenda, we need dedicated leaders who are ready to undertake any challenge before them with pride and passion,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk.
This year marks the 21st anniversary of the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon, which has challenged more than 40,000 students to create efficient, affordable buildings powered by renewable energy. The first Solar Decathlon competition was held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in the fall of 2002. Fourteen teams designed, built, transported, and showcased zero energy houses powered entirely by renewable energy—a feat relatively unheard of at the time. During the 21-day inaugural event, more than 100,000 people visited the first-ever Solar Decathlon.
Since those initial 14 groups, the Solar Decathlon has supported 900 teams, grown to include both residential and commercial buildings through Design and Build Challenges. After the initial U.S. events, the Solar Decathlon has expanded to 40 countries, including Europe, Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.
Design Challenge is a one- to two-semester, design-only competition, while the Build Challenge is a two-year design-build competition.
Build Challenge winner 
Ball State University took home first place in the 2023 Build Challenge after dedicating nearly two years to designing and constructing a zero-energy home. The Alley House team, made up of students from Ball State’s R. Wayne Estopinal College of Architecture and Planning (ECAP), along with dedicated faculty leads, design advisors, and interdisciplinary consultants, engaged their community in Indianapolis to reimagine a zero-energy future for historically under-used urban lots through the construction of a high-performance, functional family home. The home is not just net-positive energy, but it solves many housing issues in the area. It is designed for an aging population, promotes neighborhood revitalization, and facilitates lifestyle growth for local families. The affordable two-family home activates public alleys and integrates sustainable landscape design criteria and passive house principles.
“I am proud of our ECAP students and faculty, who earned the top prize in this international competition as a result of their skill, knowledge, creativity, and dedication,” said Geoffrey S. Mearns, president of Ball State. “This win is also a testament to the value of Ball State’s Immersive Learning and high-impact learning practices—ways we engage students in experience-based projects that benefit people in the communities that we serve. Equally impressive is the fact that this thoughtfully designed and well-constructed duplex will serve as affordable housing for two Indiana families.”
Teams also receive awards for excellence in specific aspects of building construction and design, including architecture, engineering, market analysis, durability and resilience, embodied environmental impact, integrated performance, occupant experience, comfort and environmental quality, energy performance, and presentation.
See the full list of Build Challenge Contest Winners.
Design challenge winners 
Design Challenge teams compete in the same 10 contests as the Build Challenge teams. Whereas Build Challenge teams develop residential solutions, Design Challenge teams compete in one of six commercial and residential divisions including new housing, retrofit housing, attached housing, multifamily housing, office buildings, and educational buildings. A winning team is named in each division, and from these teams, Residential and Commercial Grand Winners are selected.
The University of Minnesota and Cooper Union earned the Residential Grand Winner and Commercial Grand Winner titles, respectively, in the 2023 Design Challenge, rising to the top of a talented group of 55 competing teams from around the world.
The University of Minnesota created a deep-energy retrofit for a three-story housing structure that aims to preserve the building’s historical character while meeting the local need for affordable, durable, and resilient housing.  The Cooper Union team created an educational building design for the renovation and extension of the New York Harbor School that promotes zero energy retrofit principles and workforce development opportunities for the community.

The city of Pleasanton, Calif., in February 2022 revised its Climate Action Plan plan to increase greenhouse gas reduction goals by 2030 to 70% (from 40% in its initial plan), and become carbon neutral by 2045, as a metric of carbon emissions below 1990 levels.
In a 2022 State of the City speech, Pleasonton Mayor Karla Brown said the East Bay community, located in Alameda County, has a long-term strategy to improve the quality of life and public heath, promote community resilience, and promote thriving ecosytems while projecting to save $585,000 to the the city’s budget each year through sustainability initiatives.  To that end, its 2022 CAP 2.0 action plan places solar and energy storage on “covered projects” as item number four on a 16-point primary action strategy for sustainability initiatives grouped by energy, transportation, materials, natural systems, water and community resilience.
With rooftop solar, the Pleasanton community aims to reduce 2,300 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year and see its commercial buildings generate 38% less emissions. To date the city has has procured residential and commercial power from regionally located wind and solar resources via East Bay Community Energy, a community choice aggregator.
Now two Pleasanton commercial building operators, Hines and Principal Asset Management, are able to participate in the city’s net zero vision, interconnecting 1.95 MW of total capacity solar canopy projects and various building rooftop solar arrays currently in various stages of development.
Hines, a Houston-based private real estate investment firm, announced the completion of 1.4 MW at two solar canopy systems installed by DSD Renewables and managed by Black Bear Energy.
The two corporate office building projects generate 957 kW and 429 kW, respectively, and are expected to generate 2 GWh of clean power per year, the equivalent of powering 287 homes.
“Net zero commitments are a rapidly increasing focus for both landlords and tenants alike. As more turn to renewable energy to meet these goals, we’re happy to be a part of these projects that push the industry in the right direction, while saving money for all parties involved with low-cost, clean electricity,” said Drew Torbin, president of Black Bear Energy.
The second Pleasanton solar array is currently under construction at two buildings for landlord Principal Asset Management. Those two sites will generate 282 kW and 272 kW of power, producing 940 MWh of clean energy per year, the equivalent of 130 homes. The projects are anticipated to be operational by the end of 2023.
The projects are the first two out of four Principal-owned office campuses to install solar arrays, with the remainder of systems to begin construction this summer, and include rooftop solar, canopy solar and storage systems.
“These projects demonstrate our commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050,” said Jennifer McConkey, managing director of ESG and operations for real estate at Principal. “The clean, renewable energy generated by these installations will be used to power our Signature Center buildings and minimize electricity costs.”
Black Bear Energy, a Legence company, facilitated the energy procurement aspects of the four commercial building projects’ construction, while DSD Renewables will construct and own the projects upon completion.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/01/permitting-grid-resiliency-and-fusion-energy-are-top-of-mind-at-bnef-summit/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 1, 2023","Permitting, grid resiliency and fusion energy are top of mind at BNEF Summit","For a Monday morning at eight o’clock, the midtown Manhattan ballroom was slightly abuzz as a beyond-capacity BloombergNEF New York Summit audience started to pour into the InterContinental New York Barclay hotel ballroom.  Fifteen-second advertisements of Our Next Energy incorporating a solar-plus-storage project in coal country of Jackson County, W.Va. jumped across the screen as attendees sat down with coffee and pastries.
The BloombergNEF Summit on April 24 to 25, 2023, focused on grid innovations, climate change and renewable energy technology and saw in excess of 800 attendees turn out in person and on a live webcast. The annual event was supported by 26 corporate sponsors ranging from Arcadia Power to solar module producer Tongwei Solar, and for global energy markets, Chevron New Energies to Schneider Electric.
Jon Moore, chief executive officer of BloombergNEF, opened the conference saying that 91% of global carbon emissions are now covered by some form of government legislation such as the Paris Climate Accord, while the net zero cost to decarbonize the world comes at a cost of $196 trillion by 2050.
Lingering behind the optimism around the first day of the annual BNEF Summit, conference panelists and audience surveys revealed that permitting of utility-scale energy projects from utility solar, energy storage to offshore wind, is moving at a snail’s pace, much like further guidance on the dozen or so remaining bullet points from the massive Inflation Reduction Act.
Interconnection queues stretching back multiple years, and the struggle for a universal and rapid permitting system for hundreds of gigawatts of clean energy projects were some of the most prevalent themes at the 2023 BNEF Summit.  Patrick Decostre, chief executive officer of Canadian IPP Boralex, and Ammad Faisal, senior managing director of Marathon Capital, both pointed to permitting constraints and lack of guidance on tax credit transferability as two prevalent hindrances to a more rapid proliferation of renewable energy projects.
Sarah Ladislaw, special assistant to the president and senior director for climate and energy, said that while power transmission “is a very boring discussion, with so much of it going on, which is exciting,” it’s also one of the top three topics her bureau is focused on for federal, states and corporations seeking to achieve sweeping decarbonization goals.
Moore told the morning audience that $470 billion was invested into grid modernization efforts last year in the U.S., while so far about $52 billion has been shaken down from the $370 billion IRA package incentives for clean power and grid enhancement efforts.
David Hardy, executive vice president and chief executive officer, Americas for Orsted, said permitting risk is also very high now, with reform needed to regulate transmission and distribution system upgrades as well.
“The permitting process for offshore wind is ten years,” Hardy said. “We really need to change that.”
Financial clout
The recent collapse and insolvency of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, and the lack of a strong public capital market since 2021, has amplified setbacks to a rapid decarbonization market, “creating a tale of two cities,” said Nancy Pfund, founder and managing partner of DBL Partners, a clean-tech VC investment firm which counts Tesla, NEXtracker and SolarCity as some of its legacy investments.
With the inability of mature companies to go public through IPO, and clean-tech start-up’s now without the financial support of SVB and other big banks, Pfund said a “dark cloud” over capital markets has forced her to reach out to a SVB contact to check up in recent weeks. Ordinarily it was the commercial bank that was asking Pfund about the financial performance of DBL’s portfolio companies.
“It’s rattled the psychology in Silicon Valley,” she said during a panel entitled, “A New Age of Competition: Energy Transition, Trade and Supply Chains.”
Technology wishlist
During an afternoon fireside chat, Jigar Shah, solar veteran and director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, said since joining the government agency in March 2021, the LPO has put $35 billion of capital investment to use in new clean energy technologies and projects, with just $1 billion of which he would consider a loss, “a better rate than most commercial banks,” he told Meredith Annex, head of clean energy, BNEF.
After surveying the audience, Shah said his favorite technology under review at the LPO is small modular reactors (SMR), a fusion energy technology not expected to see commercial operations until the end of this decade.
“Countries that continue to add coal capacity should be doing SMR’s meanwhile,” Shah said.
Shah also pointed to the proliferation of virtual power plants, including the April 20 announcement that the LPO would backstop up to $3.3 billion of solar, storage and VPP assets integrated by Sunnova Energy, as a strong means to rapidly decarbonize while providing grid resiliency and affordable power in disadvantaged communities.
