With U.S. headquarters in San Francisco, FranklinWH’s international team designed the system, which is manufactured in Shenzhen, China.   The FranklinWH system integrates its lithium iron phosphate “aPower” battery with adaptive learning, which is part of the included aGate smart control system.
The 13.6 KWh battery is compatible with any PV inverter technology, the company reports, and it can connect with existing solar systems while scaling up to 15 units for a total of 204 KWh of capacity. In the event of a power failure, its black start feature creates a micro-grid for the home.
The adaptive-learning technology in the aGate control system allows it to manage complex load scenarios. This safeguards the main panel but also enables the homeowner to integrate three additional large loads such as HVAC, pool heating, or electric vehicle charging. The app prompts homeowners to modify consumption when needed or, with its smart export capability, send power back to the grid at peak rates.
FranklinWH said there is no assembly involved and that the home’s electric panel does not need to be upgraded. In addition, the aGate’s advanced monitoring helps installers pinpoint and resolve failures remotely. The Franklin Home Power solution is backed by a 12-year warranty and a bankability report from DNV. A single unit is priced at around $10,000.
FranklinWH will host a public event at Intersolar on Jan. 13 at 10 a.m. in booth 1059 to mark the company’s new UL certifications and bankability milestones. Representatives from CSA Group,  Intertek  and DNV will be on hand.
The company was founded in 2019 and employs a team of leading storage and power electronics experts. FranklinWH has more than 30 patents pending.
This was updated on Jan. 13, 2022 to change “artificial intelligence” to “adaptive learning,” and to specify that while the company is based in the U.S., the system was designed by an international team and manufactured in China.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/06/silicon-ranch-raises-775-million-in-equity-capital/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 6, 2022",Silicon Ranch raises $775 million in equity capital,"Royal Dutch Shell-backed Silicon Ranch announced the raise of $775 million in equity capital. The round was led by new investor Manulife Invesment Management, a division of Canada’s largest life insurance firm, which contributed $400 million. Existing investors Shell TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund and Mountain Group partners participated, as well. The deal is expected to close Q1 2022.
Silicon Ranch operates out of Nashville, Tennessee, owning and operating PV assets in 15 states. Shell invested in the developer in 2018, and now owns roughly 45% of the company.
Chief executive Reagan Farr told Reuters the new funds will support the buildout of about 2 GW of PV projects over the next 24 to 36 months, which would double the firm’s installed capacity. The firm has expressed interest in continuing to make acquisitions like last year’s purchase of Clearloop, a firm that sells carbon offset contracts to corporations, and uses the funds to build solar projects in low-income and high-carbon communities.
Last year, Silicon Ranch partnered with Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives to build the 100 MW Lumpkin Solar Farm in Georgia, part of a 435 MW portfolio designed to supply Facebook datacenters with power in pursuit of its 100% renewable energy procurement goals. The project included the installation of more than 300,000 First Solar Series 6 modules. An estimated 300 construction jobs in Georgia were created by the project.
The investment comes as the United States is projected to install 348 GW of solar over the next ten years, representing more than triple the current installed capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/06/sunvest-new-energy-awarded-38-mw-of-community-solar-in-illinois/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,ILLINOIS",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 6, 2022",SunVest New Energy awarded 38 MW of community solar in Illinois,"SunVest New Energy, LLC, a partnership between SunVest Solar, a Wisconsin-based solar developer with roughly 100 MW installed nationwide, and New Energy Equity, a solar developer and financing provider for more than 275 MW of commercial, industrial, municipal, and utility projects, announced that the company has been awarded 37.6 MW of community solar capacity under the Illinois Adjustable Block Program.
According to SunVest New Energy, the roughly 38 MW allotment is the largest award granted to a single developer under the program, which was officially approved in September 2021. The company has until mid-March to notify the Illinois Power Agency (IPA) about projects they intend to build in their project pipeline, which includes proposed installations across the state.
Through the previous IPA lottery process in 2019, SunVest New Energy won contracts for 10 projects totaling 27 MW, which was the third highest award in the lottery.
The passage of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act allowed the Illinois Power Agency to proceed with a solicitation, after nearly a year of dried-up funds and projects wasting in limbo.
Once the funding ran out at the end of 2020, businesses could no longer take on new projects and, as a result, the state’s solar industry lost roughly 3,500 jobs through August 2021, according to the Solar Energy industries Association. This incentive-related employment loss was essentially piling on the tens of thousands of solar jobs that were lost nationally in 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Prior to that point, Illinois had been experiencing a solar development boom that had put the state on track to meet its 2008 RPS goal of requiring utilities to source 25% of their electricity from renewables by 2025. With seven months of job loss and stagnation in development, progress towards that figure stalled entirely, and the state is now rushing to get back.
One provision of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act directs the state to pursue 3a 50% increase in the pace of renewable energy development in Illinois, putting the state on target to reach 40% renewable energy by 2030.

Modern Energy is a Durham, North Carolina-based certified B-Corp with operations in the United States and Brazil.
Industrial Sun brings founders Dan Seif and Wade Gungoll, along with a senior team that has managed multiple GW of project development, power sales, and utility-scale project financing. The company said it has a focus on cost savings for high energy-intensive facilities, like refineries, pumping stations, manufacturing plants, terminals, and datacenters.
“Modern’s experience developing, aggregating, and marketing assets across multiple technologies and regulatory regimes, along with their track record for building novel development platforms from inception to scale, was important to us in looking for a partner,” said Seif.
“Today, many developers find themselves with a large and eager universe of buyers ready to purchase and operate portfolios but limited capital to help them build their operation. We act as a bridge between early-stage and operational assets,” said Jazib Hasan, co-head of Modern Energy.
Modern Energy supports commercial, operational, and capital markets activities of its portfolio companies. Industrial Sun is actively siting projects, securing permitting, performing engineering studies, interconnection studies, and securing offtake agreements. Kirk Bedell and Jazib Hasan of Modern Energy led the transaction.

Texas is ranked second in the nation, behind only California, for the deployment of PV, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA projects Texas as the top state for solar development over the next half-decade, with an estimated 23,032 MW expected. This compares to its current total capacity of 12,308 MW. Despite this being second in the country, SEIA estimates only 2.88% of the state’s electricity used is solar.
Texas employs over 10,000 people in the solar industry, with over 500 solar companies in operation, and an estimated total investment of $14.4 billion.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/06/solar-powered-hydrogen-for-domestic-applications-via-building-integrated-transparent-platform/,"HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 6, 2022",Solar-powered hydrogen for domestic applications via building-integrated transparent platform,"A Korean-U.S. research group has created a system to produce and store green hydrogen via transparent PV (TPV) cells and transparent photo-electrochemical (TPEC) cells that could be integrated into buildings.
“We proposed a transparent, sustainable energy platform,” the research’s corresponding author, Joondong Kim, told pv magazine. “Our proposed system benefits the levelized cost of solar hydrogen by on site production and building integration and offers affordable solar hydrogen for domestic applications.”
The system is claimed to have a high average visible transmittance of around 64% and remarkable color neutrality, which the scientists said has a close chromaticity to the light source. “To ensure its suitability in building-integration, especially for windows, the visual appearance of TPV and TPEC is a fundamental issue,” the researchers noted.
The system’s solar power generator is based on 1.47%-efficient transparent metal oxide solar cells built with n-doped zinc oxide (N:ZnO) and p-doped nickel(II) oxide (p-NiO) on a glass substrate made of indium tin oxide (ITO). These cells are able to generate a high photovoltage of 0.546V and work as a photoanode to provide a stable photocurrent density of 2.28mA/cm2 in the TPEC system.
The PEC cell was fabricated with a TPEC photoanode as the positive terminal and platinum wire as the negative terminal. “Short wavelength UV with highly-energetic photons was mostly absorbed in the photoanode, with an efficiency as high as 82%,” the academics emphasized.
A proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is linked to the TPV-TPEC module, with the latter working as a hydrogen generator and the former being used as an axial medium to convert the hydrogen to electric power. These two systems are complementary to each other and complete the closed-loop energy supply chain, which can supply power without interruption. “In the daytime, the PV can supply electric power directly to the building and produce hydrogen for energy storage,” the researchers explained. “Hydrogen fuel is an efficient energy storage method and can be used during the night time or in periods when the PV system is disabled.”
The closed-loop system was experimentally demonstrated by connecting it to a 10mW electric fan. The PV cells provide power to operate the fan and, at the same time, the TPEC/PEM electrolyzer unit. The stored hydrogen is then used by the PEMFC, to produce more electric power to move the fan. Performance profiles of the solar cells were obtained by varying light intensity from 13.6 to 105mW/cm2. “The TPV-TPEC-PEMFC system is solid to provide the constant power supply to operate the fan without any interruption,” the research team stated. “The uncertainty of the light-dependent electric power production can be resolved by the merit of the energy circulation system of [the] TPV-TPEC-PEMFC [system].”
“This is the first demonstration of a TPV-PEC-fuel cell application, which suggests the potential for a transparent energy system as a building-integrated, uninterrupted, pollution-free energy supply,” Kim told pv magazine. “The proposed system is readily available for building structures that provide niche aesthetics, including angle-dependent transmittance, see-through features, UV blocking, and on site power production.”
The system is described in the study “Transparent sustainable energy platform: Closed-loop energy chain of solar-electric-hydrogen by transparent photovoltaics, photo-electro-chemical cells and fuel system,” which was recently published in Nano Energy.  The research group includes scientists from the Multidisciplinary Core Institute for Future Energies (MCIFE) in South Korea and the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States. “Our study demonstrated storage possibilities for domestic applications such as fan operation and light control,” Kim concluded.

Recycle PV Solar is planned to focus on reuse and recycling, and Solaris on logistics.
Recycle PV Solar is not new to solar recycling. The company was founded in 2018, and in 2019 it entered into a partnership with PV CYCLE, a global expert in PV recycling programs, to develop the U.S. market. Recycle PV Solar recently moved into a new location in Reno/Sparks, Nevada in part of Solaris’s expansive facility, and it has begun setting up expanded operations.
Exponential growth of PV installations continues in the US and so will the growth in PV panel waste streams. According to SEIA, around 140,000 solar panels are being installed per day. In a recent 2020 study, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) projected US solar waste streams to accrue to as much as 1.2 million metric tons (74.6 GW) by 2030. PV panel decommissioning is growing rapidly for a variety of reasons: aging systems, extreme weather damage, upgrading, and tax policies. This “someday” problem is already here and is being referred to as a “tsunami” by some PV industry experts.
“Solaris, too, has been seeing a significant growth in decommissioned PV panels over the last few years,” said Solaris’s EVP, Neville Darlaston.
Solaris, a subsidiary of Fracht USA and a part of the global Fracht Group, was established in 2019 to provide full lifecycle solutions across the globe for the solar industry and to fill in logistics and supply chain gaps.

The company’s software and mapping division, Mapdwell, acquired in 2021, charted the solar potential of roughly 75% of all U.S. buildings.
Palmetto uses this data for its own solar deployment plans and licenses the data via application programming interfaces (APIs) to utilities such as ConEd, Pepco, BGE, and others.
“Mapdwell now covers 81% of the U.S. population in 38 states and Washington D.C., including all current Palmetto service areas,” said Eduardo Berlin, executive vice president of Palmetto and Founder of Mapdwell. “Our goal is to map the solar potential and derive energy load profiles of every building across the U.S. — and we’re on track to accomplish just that in the very near future.”
Incubated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the software instantly assesses any building’s rooftop potential for solar energy production and battery storage and provides a baseline energy load profile. A cost-benefit analysis is performed within minutes, including an estimated payback period for the investment.
The tool, which features 3D modeling of the roof, won a Fast Company Design Award in 2014, and entered service for Palmetto in July 2021. Palmetto was founded in 2010, and has a business model of stripping out costs and accelerating the buying process through tech-enabled tools and a decentralized marketplace of sellers and builders. The company said it has served over 10,000 customers across 23 states.

According to the company, McCarthy began work at the site in October, which will consist of more than 415,000 First Solar thin-film photovoltaic modules, as well as a 20 MW, 50 MWh battery energy storage system.
Central Coast Community Energy and Silicon Valley Clean Energy both signed on to purchase generation from the project via 15-year power purchase agreements.
Construction on the Rabbitbrush Solar Project is expected to be completed by end of July 2022, and the facility is estimated to begin operation by the end of August 2022.  Along the way, the project’s construction is expected to generate roughly 300 new union jobs, with additional long-term operations jobs to come after completion.
According to the company, McCarthy and its partners are working closely with area groups, including the native Tejon Indian Tribe, to ensure respect for the area and its people is maintained throughout the construction process.
Central Coast Community Energy and Silicon Valley Clean Energy are both California community choice aggregators. A recent order requires the state’s load-serving entities, including CCAs, to build at least 11.5 GW of new resources by 2026.
Also in October, Valley Clean Energy signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for power from the Leeward Renewable Energy-developed Willow Springs 3 facility, also in Kern County.
Willow Springs is a 72 MW solar, 36 MW (144 MWh) storage project that is expected to supply enough energy to serve around 27% of VCE’s 125,000 customers. Leeward will own and operate the facility. Construction is set to begin this December.
Also slated to begin construction in Kern County this December is Leeward’s Chaparral Solar facility, which is planned to sell its power to Peninsula Clean Energy, a CCA that serves San Mateo County. The project is a 102 MW solar, 52 MW (208 MWh) storage facility that is  expected to come online by the end of 2023.
Other notable solar projects in Kern County include the Springbok solar cluster, a group of three projects, all developed by 8minute Solar Energy. The three have a combined capacity of 443 MW and were completed in three phases.
Kern County is also home to the 192 MW Rosamond Central solar project. Constructed by McCarthy Building Cos., this Kern County installation has power purchase agreements with regional community choice aggregators East Bay Community Energy and Clean Power Alliance, as well as the City of Palo Alto Utilities.
