Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn Power), Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec), West Penn Power Company (West Penn) and Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) are actively seeking proposals.
Eligible bids will be structured as power purchase agreements (PPA) ranging from four to ten years, with a capacity up to 20 MW. The proposal includes a request for both the electricity produced, and the associated Solar Photovoltaic Alternative Energy Credits (SPAECs).
Pre-qualification deadline for the RFP is Monday, November 7, 2022. Notification of pre-qualification will follow on November 14, 2022. The proposal due date is December 5, 2022. The RFP process is managed by The Brattle Group.
Solar in Pennsylvania
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that Pennsylvania has just under 1 GW of solar cumulatively installed through Q2 2022. SEIA projects that the state may add another 1.9 GW over the next five years alone.
Scott Elias, director of state affairs, mid-Atlantic for SEIA said that increasing the carve out under the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (APS) standard will send a demand signal to boost solar in the state. The requirement set back in 2004 was .5%, which has been exceeded. SEIA is aiming to push it to 2% or 2.5% by 2030. “We want to make sure that Pennsylvania is not less valuable for development than neighboring states,” said Elias.
As for residential adoption of solar in Pennsylvania, a positive note is that the state has no cap on net metering. In 2007, the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PUC) expanded the net-metering rules, which approved the use of third-party ownership models. Furthermore, utilities must provide the same rates to net-metered customers as non-net metered, and they may not charge any fees that do not apply to other customers.
Net-metered customers are credited for excess generation at the full kilowatt-hour rate, which includes generation, transmission and distribution changes. Meter aggregation is allowed on properties owned or leased by the customer, which can benefit commercial entities that may have multiple buildings with separate meters that fall under the same account. Virtual net meter aggregation is also allowed.

In fact, the Ocean State was the first to set a goal to meet 100% of the state’s electricity needs from renewables by 2030. Granted it is a small state, but it’s on its way. Currently ranked 29th in country for solar, SEIA projects that it will add another 438 MW over the next five years.
Standard Solar, which recently announced community solar acquisitions in neighboring states, is now expanding its community solar portfolio in Rhode Island with the acquisition of a combined 6.2 megawatts of projects from Trina Solar. The two ground-mount community solar projects developed by Trina Solar- West Main 1 and West Main 2 — are located in Portsmouth. Rhode Island. All the power generated will be subscribed using the state’s virtual net metering program, and subscribers include state agencies, municipalities, public housing authorities, public schools, private schools, non-profits, federal government, and hospitals.
“Partnerships in this industry are critical to delivering successful solar projects,” said Michael Streams, Standard Solar’s chief development officer. “We’re honored to be a trusted development partner of Trina’s, particularly in helping Rhode Island grow its clean energy footprint, and look forward to growing our mutually beneficial relationship as our company launches its next growth phase.”
Combined, the arrays are expected to produce approximately 8.600 MWh of clean energy annually, which is equivalent to offsetting the CO2 emissions from 4,134,853 pounds of coal burned, charging 454,600,730 smartphones or 727 homes’ electricity use for one year. Both projects are expected to be completed in 2023.
“We are very happy to get the chance to collaborate with Standard Solar, one of the fastest growing developers and operators of community solar,” said from Linhui Sui, president of Trina Solar International Solar System Business Unit. “We are committed to developing similar systems to expand broader customer access for local, clean, and affordable community solar.”
Standard Solar was recently acquired by Brookfield Renewable for consideration of $540 million with the potential to invest an additional $160 million to support the business’ growth initiatives. Standard Solar has a development pipeline of almost 2 GW and a presence in high value solar markets in the U.S., such as New York, Maryland, Minnesota and Maine. Standard Solar is also strong in the community solar market, recently completing a 7.1 MW project in New York.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/18/the-worlds-largest-single-phase-battery-is-now-online/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 18, 2022",The world’s largest single-phase battery is now online,"Axium Infrastructure and Canadian Solar’s subsidiaries of Recurrent Energy and CSI Energy Storage announced the two have installed and activated what they are calling the world’s largest single-phase energy storage facility. Named Crimson Storage, the site holds 350 MW / 1400 MWh of standalone battery energy storage, delivering flexible power to California’s grid.
The project is held by a fund managed by Axium (80%) and Recurrent Energy (20%). CSI Energy Storage operated as the turnkey system integrator of the project, delivering engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services. The EPC will continue to provide long-term operational support for the site.
“The Crimson Energy Storage project epitomizes California leadership – clean energy, innovation, and economic development through good, union jobs. We’ve been laser focused on quickly bringing projects like this online to achieve our goal of a 100% clean energy grid. Congratulations to the people across the public and private sectors who are responsible for bringing this major project online to the benefit of all Californians,” said California Governor Gavin Newsom.
On average, the project is expected to store and dispatch enough electricity to power more than 47,000 homes each year. It is estimated that Crimson Storage will offset 275,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions as compared to natural gas fired turbines.
During construction, the project employed about 140 union workers, including International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Union of Operating Engineers, Laborer’s International Union of North America, and the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers Union. It is expected to bring about $30 million in property tax revenue to the local community over the life of its operation.
The project is located in the California desert on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands. BLM approved the project in May 2021, marking the first standalone energy storage project to be approved on BLM lands under the Biden-Harris administration.

“The project represents another major step forward in the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. We look forward to supporting additional projects like Crimson Storage that ensure responsible energy development on BLM lands,” said Karen Mouritsen, BLM California state director.
Upon activation, Crimson Storage became the largest active single-phase storage project in the world, and second-largest energy storage project currently in operation of any configuration. The project holds two long-term contracts with utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric. Both contracts are part of reliability mandates made by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
“Recurrent Energy began developing Crimson Storage and our larger energy storage pipeline in 2015 when no large-scale storage projects yet existed. Last year, we started bringing these projects to fruition also thanks to our CSI Energy Storage team. Today we celebrate how far we have come in delivering the much-needed flexible generation that will support the U.S. and California’s transformative climate goals,” said Shawn Qu, CEO of Canadian Solar.

A total of 318 leading clean energy companies are calling on International Code Council (ICC) voters to reject a code proposal from FEMA that will upend U.S. clean energy progress, and instead, approve a set of compromise solutions. Read the text of the letter here.
“The stated goal of FEMA’s proposal is increased grid reliability, but when you needlessly make it harder to build resilient clean energy, the obvious effect is a reduction in reliability,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “This overreach is being made in an opaque process without input from experts on economic impacts, electric reliability and climate change. America’s solar and storage industry is urging International Code Council voters to consider the real-world impact of this code and approve SEIA’s compromise proposals.”
The compromise framework (S79-22 and S81-22) includes an important carve-out for solar projects to be designated as Risk Category 2. According to SEIA, it balances a significant increase in the structural requirements for solar facilities with enough breathing room for project construction to move forward. FEMA officials themselves confirmed they support the proposals put forward by SEIA and supported by the Distributed Wind Energy Association (DWEA), according to oral testimony on Sept. 15 and a voter’s guide that FEMA mailed out to voters on Oct. 13.
The FEMA proposal would require clean energy projects to be built to withstand damaging natural disasters far beyond what is needed. Most solar projects today are ranked risk category 1, and this proposal would bring it to risk category 4, placing a burden of increased costs on project construction. SEIA said this damage to project economics would lead to dozens of gigawatts cancelled clean energy projects solar deployment, according to SEIA, thereby accomplishing the opposite of FEMA’s S76-22 proposal.
A few of the potential negative outcomes from the proposal include:
“The FEMA proposal is well intended, but not well considered,” said Mike Bergey, president of DWEA. “It’s like saying that the cars for VIP’s should be bulletproof and then requiring all cars to be bulletproof. Besides that, FEMA totally misses that the grid is the weakest link and requiring more steel and concrete on solar and wind installations won’t strengthen the power grid.”
The voting period for ICC members runs from Oct. 17 through Nov. 1.
SEIA provides more details here.
