Achieving these goals would require extended dependence on China, which is responsible for much of the solar and renewable energy supply chain. Just two of the downsides to the dependence on imports include the fact that China’s manufacturing sector employs low-cost or forced labor, and its manufacturing facilities are powered with electricity produced from coal-fired plants.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures. The bill includes over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, which includes clean energy vehicles. This historic level of investment is key to achieving American manufacturing independence and clean energy security.
What’s in the bill for US manufacturing?
“With long-term incentives for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, the solar and storage industry is ready to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and get to work building out the next era of American energy leadership. This is a crucial window of opportunity that we cannot miss, and now Congress must seal the deal and pass this legislation,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The bill is expected to head to the Senate floor for a vote as early as next week.

It is expected to be passed with a 50-50 split using the Senate powers of reconciliation. The provision is “long overdue and a necessary step to ensure the United States takes decisive action on the climate crisis that helps our economy and provides leadership for the world by example,” said former Vice President Al Gore.
The bill aims at lower energy costs for Americans, energy security, decarbonization of all sectors of the economy, environmental justice, and resilience in rural communities.
Lower consumer energy costs
Lowered consumer energy costs will be targeted through direct incentives for energy efficient and electric appliances, clean vehicles, rooftop solar, and more. It contains $9 billion in consumer home energy rebate programs, focused on low income households, to electrify appliances and make energy efficient retrofits.
Ten years of investment tax credits were extended, including 30% for residential rooftop solar costs, and credits for electric HVAC and water heaters. A $4,000 consumer tax credit for low/middle income individuals to buy used clean vehicles, and up to $7500 for new clean vehicles. It will allocate $1 billion for a grant program to make affordable housing more energy efficient.
Domestic manufacturing
Domestic manufacturing provisions are central in this bill. Production tax credits, roughly $30 billion, will be assigned to U.S. manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing. And, $10 billion in investment tax credits will be distributed for facilities that make EVs, wind turbines and solar panels.
The Defense Production Act holds $500 million for heat pumps and critical minerals processing, and $2 billion in grants will be used to improve existing auto manufacturing facilities to create clean vehicles like EVs and hybrids. Along with these funds will be up to $20 billion in clean vehicle manufacturing credits. About $2 billion will be given to national labs to accelerate breakthrough energy research.
Economy-wide decarbonization
A good portion of the funds will be used to decarbonize every segment of the economy. Tax credits for clean electricity and energy storage will be distributed and roughly $30 billion in grant and loan programs will be given to states and electric utilities to accelerate the energy transition.
Almost $6 billion will support a new Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program to reduce emissions from the largest industrial emitters, like chemical, steel, and cement plants. Over $9 billion will support federal procurement of American-made cleantech, creating a stable market for such products. The U.S. Postal Service will have a $3 billion budget for zero-emission vehicles.
Environmental justice
Environmental justice is another pillar of the legislation. A $27 billion clean energy technology accelerator program will support deployment of technologies to reduce emissions in disadvantaged communities. Funded at $3 billion, Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants to invest in community led projects and address disproportionate environmental and public health harms related to pollution and climate change.
The $3 billion Neighborhood Access and Equity Grants are designed to support neighborhood equity, safety, and affordable transportation access with 4 competitive grants to reconnect communities divided by existing infrastructure barriers, mitigate negative impacts of transportation facilities or construction projects on disadvantaged or underserved communities, and support equitable transportation planning and community engagement activities.
Airport air pollution reduction efforts will be funded at $3 billion and $1 billion will be dedicated to clean heavy-duty vehicles like school and transit buses and garbage trucks.
Agricultural and rural support
The agricultural industry and rural communities are supported in the bill as well. More than $20 billion will be dedicated to “climate-smart” agriculture practices. About $5 billion in grants will be used to support healthy, fire-resilient forests, forest conservation, and urban tree planting.
Tax credits and grants will be paid to support domestic biofuel production and to build the infrastructure needed to support sustainable aviation fuel and other biofuels. To support and conserve coastal habitats and the communities that depend on them, $2.6 billion in grants will be available.
“Now, let me be clear: This bill would be the most significant legislation in history to tackle the climate crisis and improve our energy security right away. And it’ll give us a tool to meet the climate goals that are set — that we’ve agreed to — by cutting emissions and accelerating clean energy. A huge step forward,” said President Joe Biden.
The largest climate and energy package in United States history will be funded by closing tax loopholes on the ultra-wealthy and corporations. “This bill requires the largest corporations to begin to — begin to pay toward their fair share of taxes by putting in place a 15 percent corporate minimum tax,” said Biden.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/29/massachusetts-climate-bill-removes-anti-competitive-electric-choice-provision/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 29, 2022",Massachusetts climate bill removes anti-competitive electric choice provision,"Massachusetts residents’ rights to opt-in to alternative electricity suppliers that provide renewable energy will be retained in the newly revised S.2842, a climate change focused bill. The original draft of the bill had language that would have removed the ability to choose an alternative supplier for their energy, forcing many customers to return to their default utility company. 
Thousands of Massachusetts residents signed a petition and gave personal testimony that they would like to see this provision stricken from the bill, citing the desire to have personal choice, more access to renewable energy, and to prevent monopoly control by utilities like National Grid and Eversource. 
“For those of us who are committed to buying 100% renewable energy, closing the market would be a HUGE step backwards for Massachusetts,” wrote Daniel J. of Beverly, Mass. in the petition.
Now, lawmakers have decided to strip the language that eliminates this market, which nearly half a million Massachusetts households accessed in 2021.
Currently, three-quarters of the products offered in the retail energy choice market are 100% renewable energy contracts. Massachusetts law currently only mandates utilities to supply 51% renewable energy, meaning the bill could have stood in the way of clean energy goals for the state.
“The proposed closure of the competitive energy market was at odds with the intent of this climate bill, as more than three quarters of the retail market offerings are 100% clean energy products with additional innovative products supporting energy efficiency measures and offering discounted residential electric vehicle charging,” said Chris Ercoli, President and CEO of the Retail Energy Advancement League.
“We appreciate lawmakers acting on behalf of almost half a million Massachusetts customers who currently shop the market by removing this language and we look forward to continued conversations on how to best expand choice while protecting the consumer as Massachusetts leads in our transition to a clean energy future,” said Ercoli.
In a recent survey, 83% of Bay Staters said they want energy choice and to shop the market as an option. Massachusetts residents interested in shopping for alternate supply contracts can log on to the state Department of Public Utilities’ website, “Energy Switch Massachusetts,” and review terms of different suppliers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/29/carolina-utility-chasing-waterfalls-costing-consumers-billions/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NORTH CAROLINA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 29, 2022","Carolina utility chasing waterfalls, costing consumers billions","The Brattle Group has published a study analyzing Duke Energy’s recent proposal to meet North Carolina state law requiring emissions be decreased 70% by 2030. They find Duke’s decision to limit the potential of solar power in the state by nearly 50% will cost state ratepayers billions of dollars through 2035.
The report, Duke Energy Resource Mix to Meet 70% CO2 Reduction by 2030 in NC, was commissioned by the Clean Power Suppliers Association (CPSA).

Proposed annual solar caps from Duke Energy, North Carolina
The report suggests that Duke’s decision to avoid deploying the cleaner, cheaper solar capacity will mean that ratepayers will be on the hook for much more expensive fossil fuels, and small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Betting on the deployment of SMRs carries extremely high risks, since they have not yet been developed. And despite the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s approval for a new SMR design, a leading developer recently had their application rejected.

In fact, the Brattle report suggests that by limiting their solar deployment, Duke will fail to hit their legally obligated 70% reduction to emissions by 2030 – and will be forced to extend it to 2034.
The company states that SMRs – which still don’t exist in the marketplace – have a higher execution risk than the 2 GW of solar power that is currently deployed each year in the region. During presentations, the company seems to have lost their homework, stating, “[t]he Companies do not have specific underlying calculations for the annual selection constraints,” and that the constraints “are based on engineering judgment and transmission planning experience.”

Comments filed by CPSA noted that neighboring utilities were modeling the integration of significantly greater volumes of solar power. For instance, NextEra is projecting 4 GW/year of capacity in Florida, Entergy 3.5 GW/year of renewable, and Dominion in Virginia at 1.5 GW/year.
Of course, Texas is projected to install more than three times what Duke believes it can deploy. And Duke Energy claims it will take thirteen years to install that fraction of Texas’ projected solar power, while Texas prepares to deploy at least 18 GW over the next five years.
Brattle’s model finds that eliminating the solar cap would result in deployments of 9.5 GW of solar, allowing the state to comply with the 70% emissions mandate by 2030. The group suggests that 2.1 GW of that capacity would be standalone, 5.7 GW would be paired with 4 hours of storage, and 1.7 GW would be paired with two hours of storage. In total, more than 10 GW hours of energy storage would be deployed.

Strangely, the utility puts energy storage – proven hardware that has already been connected to the power grid for a decade – in the same development risk class as the yet unproven, and unavailable for purchase today, SMRs.
Duke projects that by 2035, between 570 MW and 1.3 GW of SMRs will be connected to their power grid. The company now projects that 2032 will be the earliest possible deployment date for their first SMR to be integrated into the grid, based on the assumption that the units gain approval for deployment in 2029.
Bloomberg and others have reported that Duke is working with TerraPower LLC, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec International Corp., NuScale Power LLC, and possibly others.

In a survey that asked respondents how they use batteries, the most common use is frequency regulation, which helps maintain the grid frequency of 60 cycles per second. This enhances grid reliability because deviations from that frequency could lead to power surges or other types of grid instability.
The survey found that the biggest change in use is that more systems are being used to store electricity when prices are low, and discharge when prices are high, known as price arbitrage.

During 2021, 59% of the 4.6 GW of utility-scale US battery capacity was used for price arbitrage, up from 17% in 2019. In certain markets, price arbitrage is more common than in others. For example, more than 80% of the battery capacity added in 2021 in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) service territory was used for price arbitrage.
Batteries are also being used to counter excess wind and solar generation, as they absorb excess solar or wind generation when demand is low and then discharge it later when demand is high. More than 93% of the battery capacity that came online in 2021 was co-located with solar power plants.
