The investment round was led by Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd, a unit of Reliance Industries Limited; Paulson & Co. Inc., a group that includes Ambri’s largest shareholder, Bill Gates; and new investors, including Fortistar, Goehring & Rozencwajg Associates, Japan Energy Fund, and others.
The company plans to use proceeds to commercialize and grow its long-duration system technology and to build manufacturing facilities, both in the U.S. and internationally.
Ambri also entered into a long-term antimony supply agreement with Perpetua Resources.  The agreement helps secure a domestic source of antimony for its supply chain.
The liquid metal battery is comprised of a liquid calcium alloy anode, a molten salt electrolyte, and a cathode comprised of solid particles of antimony, enabling the use of low-cost materials and a low number of steps in the cell assembly process.
The company said that the active materials in its cells reversibly alloy and de-alloy while charging and discharging. The electrolyte is thermodynamically stable with the electrodes, avoiding side reactions such as film-formation that can lead to performance degradation. The negative electrode is fully consumed when discharged, and reformed on every cycle, resulting in what the company said is a “highly repeatable process with no memory effect.”
Ambri’s chemistry is being developed to meet the demands of large industrial energy customers, such as data centers. Late last year, Ambri agreed with TerraScale, a clean infrastructure design and development firm, to deliver  250 MWh of Ambri systems to TerraScale’s Energos Reno data center project. The site’s battery will be bolstered by a reported 500 MW of on-site renewable generation.
Ambri said that following the funding round it now is able to scale for projects from 10 MWh to over 2 GWh around the globe, with durations ranging from 4 to 24 hours.

The legislation would be the largest federal investment in infrastructure projects in more than a decade. It won the support of 19 Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader. In recent days, former President Donald Trump worked to scuttle the bill.
The bill’s future is not assured, however, as it moves to the Democrat-controlled House. There, the speaker, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and the nearly 100-member Progressive Caucus, have said they will not vote on it until the Senate moves on a separate $3.5 trillion social policy bill.

That bill would include policies to address climate change, among other issues, and is expected to face a solid wall of Republican opposition.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he intends to take up the bill through a process known as reconciliation, which shields it from a filibuster. Schumer would need to hold together all 50 Democrats to vote in favor of the bill so that Vice President Kamala Harris could cast the expected tie-breaking 51st vote in favor.
Following the Senate’s successful action on the infrastructure bill, a group of Representatives sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) urging them to retain clean energy provisions in the House version of the infrastructure bill.
The letter asked that the infrastructure package prioritize what the signers said would be a “stable, predictable, and long-term tax platform” that:
It asked that given continued and projected tax equity constraints, and to maximize use by the broadest range of stakeholders, “it is important that a direct pay option be available” where project financing challenges exist.
The letter was signed by more than 170 House members.
Organizations were quick to praise the Senate action and called on the House to move rapidly to approve the spending.
Heather Zichal, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said, “As we look ahead to the budget reconciliation process, we must ensure that stable and predictable policies allow the rapid development of job creating clean energy projects across the country.”
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Suzanne Clark said that her group applauded the Senate for “doing its job on a bipartisan basis” and called on the House to “continue the bipartisan progress and send this bill to the president’s desk.”
And Lisa Jacobson, president of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, said her group was hopeful that the House will “move quickly to approve these policies, so that work on the ground can get underway across America.”

The project is the Lenox Community Solar Project, a 6.9 MW solar installation, accompanied by a 20 MWh DC-coupled battery energy storage system.
The project is east of Syracuse and was developed, installed and funded by Standard Solar. Its roughly 18,000 modules are mounted to both fixed-tilt and single-axis tracker structures.
The 6,000 MWh of energy that the Lenox project is anticipated to generate each year will provide access to clean energy and offer bill savings to area ratepayers. The battery system is expected to provide ancillary services for the area’s electrical grid.
Elsewhere in the Northeast, Standard Solar recently acquired 35 MW of solar projects in Maine, bringing the company’s total solar generation portfolio to more than 200 MW.

In the energy storage industry, it can be easy to think that the growth trajectory is exceptional.
Indeed, six months ago, in the IHS Markit Grid-Connected Energy Storage Market Tracker (our bi-annual evaluation of the energy storage industry), we predicted that the industry would double in size in 2021, with installations topping 10 GW for the first time.
This is no doubt impressive. However, the changes underway in the automotive space are happening at an even larger scale. With this huge scale, there will inevitably be speculation on how to exploit the idle batteries sitting in the millions of EVs parked at any one time as a grid asset and an enabler for higher penetrations of renewable energy.
This interface with the electricity grid, where EVs both charge and discharge, is called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and could operate at a scale that eclipses the current and projected stationary storage market.

The cost at which this storage capacity could be deployed is, potentially, significantly lower than using separate stationary batteries, as is becoming increasingly common in a range of sectors today. The reason behind this is relatively simple – the capital cost of procuring the storage asset is met by the vehicle owner and is separate from its role as a grid asset.
Standard Solar
In addition to that, the incremental increase in cost of a bidirectional charger (the key component that needs to be added to an EV/EV charger to enable V2G, compared to the conventional alternative) is falling rapidly, with near parity expected in the next five years. This just leaves the cost of enabling communication and control over the dispatch of the vehicle’s battery, and there are positive signs that this could also be incredibly low.
Automotive OEMs already have over-air communication with their vehicles in many cases, and new EV chargers now invariably come with communications hardware to schedule charging. These communication and control interfaces could be leveraged to control V2G with minimal additional complexity. The combination of these factors will potentially enable V2G to be used as energy storage at an incredibly low cost.
With significantly lower capital requirements and potentially larger scale, the use case of V2G assets is likely to be different to that of stationary storage. As domestic EV chargers are typically 7 kW, and EV battery capacity is 50 kWh to 70 kWh, V2G is inherently a long duration (10-plus hours) asset. The lower cost will enable V2G assets to be profitable on wholesale electricity markets over a narrower price spread than traditional stationary storage assets. For these reasons, it is perfectly placed to provide long-duration balancing services at the intraday scale and play a large potential role in stabilizing wholesale markets under higher penetrations of renewable energy.
While this analysis certainly paints a rosy picture of the prospects for V2G technology, there remain significant barriers to its adoption in the short and medium term. The industry largely remains in the pilot and commercial trial phase, with large challenges remaining before deployment at large scale can take place. While some of these barriers – such as licensing difficulties and lack of bidirectional support in charging protocols – will be overcome in due course, others may be more difficult for the industry.

Although the aggregation of many thousands of EVs has the potential to form a highly valuable grid asset, a key challenge is that it will offer very little value to each individual EV owner. V2G will earn very little revenue per vehicle – this will raise the question of how vehicle owners should be incentivized to make their vehicles available for V2G. Equally difficult is the issue of battery degradation; while there are some clues that batteries will last longer than the vehicle under normal use, there is little information on how V2G affects battery lifetime. This means that in the short term, at least, this will remain a major concern in the minds of many vehicle owners.
In light of the tremendous potential of this technology, with the opportunity to provide storage at huge scale and very low cost, it now comes to the industry stakeholders to overcome these barriers of low customer value and concerns over battery degradation. It remains to be seen whether an effective commercial proposition can be made amongst the web of stakeholders, including auto OEMs, energy suppliers, and flexibility providers, in order to effectively unlock the value of V2G.
Collaboration between these industry players has never been achieved at such an enormous scale before. But is likely to be the determining factor in whether V2G can be an effective enabler for grid storage and decarbonization in the
years to come.

The 360 MW Mammoth Solar II is part of the 1.65 GW Mammoth project being developed by Doral on roughly 12,000 acres in Starke and Pulaski counties in northern Indiana.
The agreement follows a long-term renewable energy purchase agreement signed by the two in April for the first phase of the project, covering 480 MW.
Mammoth Solar II is expected to begin construction during 2022 and reach commercial operation in 2024.
The developers have touted the benefits of removing so much farmland from active production to make room for the solar project, including reduced use of chemicals and fertilizers and the reduction of around 1 billion gallons a year of water used for irrigation.
AEP Energy is a unit of American Electric Power and is a competitive retail and wholesale electricity and natural gas supplier in six states and Washington, D.C. It owns an operates more than 90 behind-the-meter projects in 26 states.

The 350 MW / 1,400 MWh Crimson project will be one of the largest battery energy storage projects in the world when it enters service beginning in summer 2022.
According to a scoping document filed with the Bureau of Land Management in 2018, the project would include an estimated 2 million solar modules. The project would be designed and laid out largely in 2 MW increments, each of which would include an inverter-transformer station. Up to four substations would transform voltage from the 34.5 kV electrical collection cables to 230 kV.
Earlier this year, Southern California Edison awarded Recurrent Energy, which is a unit of Canadian Solar, a long-term energy storage contract for 200 MW / 800 MWh for phase 1 of the Crimson project located in Riverside County, California.
Both contracts are stand-alone storage projects and are part of reliability procurements directed by the California Public Utilities Commission. The newly signed agreement with PG&E is in response to a decision by the regulatory body directing California utilities to “take actions to prepare for potential extreme weather in the summers of 2021 and 2022.”
Recurrent Energy also is partnering with Southern Power and AIP Management to provide development services to add 72 MW / 288 MWh of energy storage to the 200 MW Tranquillity solar project in Fresno County, California; and 88 MW / 352 MWh of energy storage to the 200 MW Garland solar project in Kern County, also in California. The Tranquillity and Garland solar PV projects were originally developed and built by Recurrent Energy in 2016 and are now owned by Southern Power and AIP. Battery energy storage system (BESS) retrofits on both projects are under construction.
Recurrent Energy said it also is building the Slate project (300 MW solar plus 140.25 MW / 561 MWh storage) and the 75 MW / 300 MWh BESS retrofit to the 100 MW Mustang solar project. Slate and Mustang are both located in Kings County, California and are owned by Goldman Sachs Renewable Power LLC.
This article was updated on August 10 to clarify in the headline that the deal is for energy storage only.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/10/heliene-is-adding-100-mw-of-module-production-at-a-new-florida-facility/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,FLORIDA",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 10, 2021",Heliene is adding 100 MW of module production at a new Florida facility,"Solar module maker Heliene said it will open a third North American manufacturing facility in Riviera Beach, Florida.
The 75,000-square-foot facility is Heliene’s second in the U.S., and increases its manufacturing capacity by 100 MW. The company said it will begin production at the new facility in September, following upgrades to an existing solar production line previously operated by SolarTech Universal. Heliene operates other production lines in Ontario, Canada, and Minnesota.
The company expects to announce in the coming weeks a 350 MW expansion at the Minnesota facility. That expansion is likely  to include a multi-million-dollar incentive package from the state.
The Florida plant will produce super-high-efficiency heterojunction solar cell modules for residential and commercial applications. Martin Pochtaruk, CEO, said that heterojunction module technology offers the advantages of N-type crystalline silicon with the absorption and passivation of amorphous silicon.
Heliene’s 66-cell Heterojunction 370W module uses multiwire technology and 18 round microwires in place of traditional flat busbars. The design reduces shading by 25% by creating a light trapping effect, the company said. The N-type silicon results in low light-induced degradation and potential induced degradation.
Pochtaruk told pv magazine USA that the Florida move expands the company’s product line to over the “fast growing” residential market. The company previously had focused on supply modules for utility-scale solar projects.
The company opened its first production line in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, in 2010. Eight years later, it invested $18 million to open a 25,000-square-foot facility in Mountain Iron, Minnesota. That facility received $3.5 million in state aid to upgrade equipment, which had been left behind when the previous occupant, Silicon Energy, closed.
The Minnesota plant is providing solar panels to a recently approved project by Minnesota Power to build three solar facilities. The $40 million Laskin, Sylvan, and Duluth city solar arrays will have 21 MW of capacity.
In 2018, Heliene joined Canadian Solar and Silfab in opposing tariffs that the Trump administration imposed on solar imports. The trio argued that their products should be exempt from the tariffs because they violated the Trade Act and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), under which their products were protected at the time.
