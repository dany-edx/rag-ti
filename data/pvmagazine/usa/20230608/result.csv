https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/08/will-homebuyers-in-colorado-be-priced-out-by-solar-and-ev-ready-building-codes/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,COLORADO",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 8, 2023",Will homebuyers in Colorado be priced out by solar and EV-ready building codes?,"Colorado is soon to implement House Bill 1362, a law passed in 2022 that directed the state to create an energy codes agency to develop mandatory codes for clean energy and energy efficiency adoption. 
Beginning July 1, in a rolling fashion across different towns and cities in the state, new buildings will be required to be constructed in a way that makes them readymade for the clean energy transition. The code requires that buildings have prewiring for on-site solar and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The codes apply to single-family and multi-family homes, as well as commercial buildings.
Despite the long-term cost savings realized from energy-efficient appliances required by the code, home builders in the state are complaining that the moderate cost increase will “price out” many buyers.
“While we share the goals of reducing energy use and emissions, we must balance these goals with all housing costs,” said Ted Leighty, chief executive officer Colorado Association of Home Builders.
While Colorado construction firms likely don’t support any measure that adds to their costs, the arguments that EVs, solar and energy efficiency are neither desired nor cost-effective stand on shaky ground.
The new code is a forward-looking requirement that is expected to save home and business owners considerably in the long run. While preparing a home for an EV charger costs about $1,000 in the new construction process, it can cost up to $4,000 when retrofitting to an existing home, said Adam Berry, program manager, codes and efficiency, Colorado Energy Office.
Berry said the new building codes were negotiated down to being “EV-capable lite,” merely requiring a ground conduit and a higher capacity main electric panel, with wiring able to be added later on as EVs are adopted.
The Colorado Apartment Association claimed only about 1% of surveyed renters said they want an EV charger right now, yet the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association showed that 10.5% of new vehicle sales in Colorado in 2022 were electric vehicles.
State officials in Colorado have set aside $2 million in grant money for local governments to implement and administrate the new codes. The state is also directing hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives to buy new and used EVs, heat pumps and other energy efficient appliances.
The City of Denver is a leader in this regard, offering several rebates including $1,500 for a heat pump, $3,500 for a cold-climate heat pump, $3,500 for ground source heat pumps, $1,000 for heat pump water heater, and $300 for a standard electric bike, $500 for a cargo e-bike, and up to $1,200 for income-qualified buyers. Other cities and municipalities as well as utility companies offer clean energy and energy efficiency incentives, as well.
These incentives can be combined with those offered the state’s major utility Xcel Energy, including $1,500 for an efficient air-source heat pump, $2,000 for a cold-climate heat pump, and $1,300 for home wiring for a Level 2 electric vehicle charging station.
Additionally, Colorado offers among the highest EV tax incentives in the United States. Beginning July 1, the Colorado electric vehicle tax credit rises from $2,000 to up to $5,000. This can be added to the federal EV tax credit, which offers up to $7,500 in tax credits, combining for an impressive $12,500 in tax credits for the purchase of a new electric vehicle.
The Colorado Sun reported that the next round of code updates may be more contentious. While the new energy codes still require pathways for both natural gas and electricity service to buildings, the state board in 2024 is required to write “low carbon” codes.
This may spark a battle on whether new construction homes should be built electric-only, with no natural gas hookups allowed. While builders may welcome the lowered cost of having to integrate only one energy source, the natural gas industry would likely have a combative stance towards such requirements.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/08/key-capture-installs-third-new-york-storage-project-near-buffalo/,"ENERGY STORAGE,NEW YORK",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 8, 2023",Key Capture installs third New York storage project near Buffalo,"Key Capture Energy, an energy storage developer located in Albany, N.Y., announced the electrification of its third New York utility-scale storage project, the 20 MW / 45.6 MWh KCE NY 6 project, located several miles south of downtown Buffalo, N.Y. The installation included Sungrow’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery energy storage system.
The project is interconnected into National Grid’s western New York service territory, which has undergone a surge of distributed energy system deployments from solar and storage projects recently due to grid constraints.
Black & McDonald served as engineering and construction contractor for the project’s construction, including partnerships with unionized labor International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW Locals 41, 43 and 1249); United Steel Workers (USW 135) and Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) — meeting KCE’s focus on hiring locally and supporting the community.
The developer holds long-term agreements for consistent revenue contributions from the grid-scale project to the communities of Blasdell and Hamburg, N.Y., the two villages where the project is located.
“We are excited to share that KCE NY 6 is officially coming online, which is a major step towards New York’s ambitious goal of achieving 70% renewable energy by 2030,” said Taylor Quarles, vice president of development, Key Capture Energy. “The NY 6 project will help to create a more resilient and reliable grid while reducing emissions and improving air quality for communities across the state.”
KCE NY 6 received $5 million in grant funding from the Bulk Market Acceleration Bridge Incentive Program as administered by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The grant provided financial support for new energy storage systems over 5 MW, before closing in February 2021.
The western New York project marks Key Capture’s third utility-scale battery project to enter operations across the Empire State, joining the 20 MW KCE NY 1, located in upstate Saratoga County, N.Y., and the 3 MW KCE NY 3 project in downstate Rockland County, N.Y. in Con Edison utility Orange and Rockland Utilities service territory.
As New York continues to invest in and build its cleaner and more resilient grid, public-private partnerships with companies like Key Capture Energy are critical to accelerating deployment of transformational energy storage resources. KCE NY 6 is part of a growing portfolio of bulk energy storage projects that will help make renewables like wind and solar available when and where they are needed most, reduce the use of obsolete peaker plants, and ultimately lower statewide electric system costs. -NYSERDA president and chief executive officer Doreen M. Harris
New York’s clean energy targets, set by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, call for the state to reach 70% renewable energy by 2030, including 10 GW of distributed solar and 6 GW of storage to become powered by fossil fuel free assets by 2040.
The state’s Energy Storage roadmap, filed on December 28, 2022, calls for 6 GW of energy storage development by 2030, representing at least 20% of peak electricity load for the state.  In addition to 1.3 GW of existing storage projects installed to date, the roadmap supports a buildout of 4.7 GW of new storage to reduce future statewide electric system costs by over $2 billion. The distributed energy system provides further benefits in the form of improved public health because of reduced exposure to natural gas and other fossil fuel power plants.
About 6 GW of energy storage capacity would meet approximately 25% of NYISO’s 2022 estimated winter peak demand of 23,893 MW, and 18% of NYISO’s 2022 summer estimated peak demand of 31,765 MW.
Key Capture Energy, founded in 2016, became majority-owned by Korean energy major SK E&S Co. Ltd. In December 2021, a unit of SK Group, a $106 billion revenue business with 2.5 GW of solar, wind and fuel cells developed in South Korea and 700 MWh of storage assets in the U.S. and Korea.
Key Capture Energy chief executive officer Jeff Bishop told pv magazine USA earlier this year that new incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act such as energy communities provide new market opportunities for the developer to deploy more projects, pointing to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) market as a compelling region to site new storage projects in the place of retired coal generation capacity. To date the developer has developed projects in New York and Texas.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/08/rooftop-community-solar-projects-a-key-ira-thrust/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,MARYLAND,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 8, 2023",Rooftop community solar projects a key IRA thrust,"With the Inflation Reduction Act providing solar projects built in designated energy communities a 10% investment tax credit adder, city and municipal authorities are focused on getting community solar projects installed on the roofs of urban housing authorities.
Speaking at the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) Finance Forum in New York, Clark Conlisk, impact capital manager and vice president of business development, U.S. Bank, said a key challenge that statewide community solar programs do not yet address is how to unlock the opportunity of hundreds of thousands of rooftops for solar development.
To fully unlock the $20 billion or more in immediate energy communities incentivization under the IRA, “the challenge is now providing accessible clean power to renters who don’t have benefits that building owners might have for finding solar projects,” Conlisk said during an ACORE panel titled “Centering Equitable Investing Strategies.”
David Davenport, a managing director of the N.Y. Green Bank, echoed Conlisk’s observations, adding that the New York local project investment group recently unveiled a $250 million statewide fund, the Community Decarbonization Fund (CDF), to unlock new community solar and energy efficiency project opportunities around the Empire State for the $1 billion capital funded green bank.
“Normally residents did not want the smart sensors or controls products in their building when we came into housing authorities, they told us they have rodent problems first off,” said Davenport. Now with the IRA framework to incentivize disadvantaged communities, a collocated rooftop solar project that could drive 20% in monthly electricity savings is a topic that has been elevated in community discussions.
Lynn Heller, chief executive officer of the Climate Access Fund, a Maryland-based grassroots philanthropic and impact investor, said with the recent passing of Maryland’s community solar framework and adders from the IRA, her firm is spearheading the development of an 800 kW rooftop solar project in an East Baltimore, Md., low-income neighborhood.
In Maryland, Heller said the community solar market previously handicapped the low-to-moderate income community bracket, with 2 MW to 5 MW sized community solar projects historically being unavailable to LMI residents. Now her fund and statewide green banks are incentivizing housing authorities and urban authorities to look at rooftop solar as a beneficial tool for siting projects on urban rooftops and parking canopy arrays, as well, she said.
Davenport joked that with N.Y. Governor Kathy Hochul’s ambitious clean energy plan of deploying 10 GW of solar by 2030 and 6 GW of energy storage, the IRA incentives and the Green Bank’s new CDF fund, and the confluence of incentives and capital may require him to embark on a statewide bus tour to meet with constituents seeking to deploy solar, storage and efficiency projects.
The N.Y. Green Bank has a targeted allocation of investing about 35% of its $1 billion capital allocations into energy communities. The CDF platform encourages Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and other specialty lenders to apply for funding of disadvantaged communities across New York. Financing of $2 million to $25 million or approximately 20% of an applicant’s total capitalization are the parameters of the CDF fund.
In Maryland, Heller said community engagement and education is vital to rapid deployment of community solar projects over the next decade. Her group has been educating schools as well as former anti-hydraulic fracturing or fracking groups in western Maryland about the economic gains for deploying rooftop and various small-scale solar projects with various state and federal financial incentives.
U.S. Bank’s Conlisk admitted the perception of a commercial bank going into a disadvantaged community with a highly capital intensive project commitment hasn’t always been an easy proposition. But banks coming in early to demonstrate the gains of community-sited projects with an Impact Capital fund driven by municipal, state and federal incentives has begun to change misperceptions of clean energy projects.
Andrew Williams, vice president of policy and corporate affairs at developer Sol Systems, said “It comes back intentionality. We have to show up, say we’re going to hire people of the community, and to say that people from the community can operate the projects.”
“Paying prevailing wage is a non-issue,” Williams said. “That’s a mainstage item now. Showing up, being open about what your goals are in that community are essential,” Williams said about stimulating a local workforce and partnership level for community solar development.
Heller said that community solar subscriptions to the U.S. apartment rental market among the LMI community sub-set is an area that has been overlooked in IRA’s structure. Whether it be a consumer lease or building ownership model, that gap is what various statewide agencies such as CAF and various state green banks are now looking at changing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/08/solar-buildout-mapped-to-determine-biodiversity-impact-on-largest-estuary-in-the-u-s/,"SUSTAINABILITY,VIRGINIA",BERNADETTE GEYER,"JUNE 8, 2023",Solar buildout mapped to determine biodiversity impact on largest estuary in the U.S.,"from pv magazine Global
A research team from the Chesapeake Conservatory studied patterns of solar buildouts in the six states surrounding the Chesapeake Bay Watershed ─ Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, and West Virginia ─ and identified drivers for siting and land use, as well as project impacts on biodiversity in the region.
The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and is home to more than 18 million people.
According to the report, solar development in the six states has, up to now, “largely avoided important wildlife habitat.” In addition, researchers “found strong evidence that solar arrays were built preferentially on previously cultivated lands, rarely replaced natural landcover, and were in areas of average habitat quality relative to available areas.”
While patterns in the Southwest region of the US show solar projects being built near or within protected areas and replacing natural landcover, the science team found that solar array construction in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed area avoided natural landcover, and arrays were built away from protected areas. The report noted the importance of policies and standards that require attention to how solar projects affect biodiversity and the potential to benefit land conservation.
The team used a convolutional neural network to map the footprints of ground-mounted solar arrays present in satellite imagery annually from 2017 to 2021 for the examined states. In addition, researchers quantified the relationship between geospatial covariates and the rate of solar development by fitting a binomial-Weibull model to solar time-series data in a hierarchical, Bayesian framework. In all, a total of 958 solar arrays were mapped in 2021, covering 52.32 km2.
The study’s results identified places where solar buildout was most likely and provided data that could be used to “align current siting patterns with conservation priorities” in the region. The report also noted that “the transition of cultivated areas to solar energy facilities could represent a net benefit to conservation if wildlife-friendly solar practices are implemented.” Researchers identified beneficial practices such as supporting native plants and local wildlife, and “increases in pollinator abundance, diversity, and richness.”
The report ultimately concludes that the avoidance of natural landcover in favor of cultivated cropland presents “an opportunity to synergistically develop renewable energy and improve biodiversity,” and recognizes the great potential for solar energy facilities to be paired with agriculture for the benefit of native species diversity and carbon sequestration.
“From a conservation perspective, we were encouraged to see natural areas being avoided over the past six years. In places where solar is replacing previously degraded land cover, these facilities may also present a unique opportunity to restore biodiversity and ecosystem services in the watershed if native vegetation is maintained in areas under and around arrays,” said Michael Evans, a senior data scientist with Chesapeake Conservancy’s Conservation Innovation Center (CIC).
Their findings are available in the report “Predicting patterns of solar energy buildout to identify opportunities for biodiversity conservation,” published in Biological Conservation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/08/bmw-electric-vehicle-battery-supplier-breaks-ground-on-30-gwh-factory/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,JAPAN,SOUTH CAROLINA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 8, 2023",BMW electric vehicle battery supplier breaks ground on 30 GWh factory,"AESC, a Japanese battery technology company, announced it has broken ground on a Florence, South Carolina manufacturing facility. The site will support the company’s multi-year supply agreement with BMW Group, one of the world’s largest auto manufacturers.
The 1.5 million square foot facility will host annual production of 30 GWh of EV batteries. Slated for commercial operations in 2026, the facility is expected to provide over 1,170 jobs.
Batteries produced at the plant will supply BMW’s Spartanburg, S.C. electric vehicle manufacturing site. The next-generation EV batteries produced at the AESC’s facility offer a 20% boost to energy density, while reducing charging time and increasing range and efficiency by 30% compared to current-generation batteries, said the company.
AESC said the new factory will be 100% powered by clean energy, leveraging net-zero technologies from its partners. The company said it will implement renewable energy generation, carbon management and reduction software, and a battery recycling system to accelerate carbon neutrality throughout the entire battery value chain. Furthermore, AESC committed to pursuing responsible sources for its critical battery materials, providing full transparency into extraction methods.
The 30 GWh factory builds on the company’s already large footprint on the U.S., bringing AESC’s total manufacturing capacity to 70 GWh for the U.S. market. Over the past 13 years, AESC has produced power batteries for more than 800,000 electric vehicles across 59 countries.
“Today, South Carolina is proud to celebrate AESC as the company embarks on a historic chapter in our state,” said Governor Henry McMaster. “Florence County has been ripe for an investment of this magnitude — one that will transform local communities and create generational wealth for South Carolinians. The groundbreaking for AESC’s battery cell gigafactory is a landmark moment in the evolution of South Carolina’s rapidly expanding electric vehicle industry.”
Individuals interested in joining the AESC team in Florence can visit a recruitment website to explore opportunities.
Manufacturers of clean energy components from across the world are increasingly targeting the U.S. market for production following the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which packs in considerable tax credits and other incentives to support a domestic supply chain. In addition to tax credits for producers, purchasers of electric vehicles are offered a tax credit of up to $7,500 for a new vehicle, and up to $4,000 for a used one.
The American Clean Power Association said in the first eight months following the passage of IRA, 46 clean energy manufacturing facilities were announced, bringing an expected 18,000 or more U.S. jobs. Across the 46 announced facilities, 26 are solar manufacturing sites, 10 are utility-scale battery storage factories, 10 are wind power fabrications, two of which are for offshore wind technology development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/08/u-s-inflation-reduction-act-poses-threat-for-australia-in-green-hydrogen-race/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 8, 2023",U.S. Inflation Reduction Act poses threat for Australia in green hydrogen race,"From pv magazine Australia
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) Director Guy Debelle said that the sheer scale of the IRA threatens to overwhelm Australia’s renewable energy advantages, drawing investment dollars out of the country and locking up potential export markets.
Debelle, formerly FFI’s chief financial officer and now serving as a director of mining giant Fortescue’s green energy branch, said that Australia is well positioned to take advantage of growing demand for the zero-emissions fuel. However, it needs to act quickly or risk being left behind in the race to grab a share of the global green hydrogen market, he added.
Debelle said Australia’s renewable energy advantages make it an ideal location to generate green hydrogen. He also highlighted that Australia has a long history as a reliable energy exporter to nations such as Japan and South Korea but said the enormity of the IRA threatens to snap up those markets.
“I think it’s a material threat to us in terms of those export markets,” Debelle said. “There’s a real risk that with the US getting their headstart on us through the Inflation Reduction Act they are going to lock up a fair chunk of the Japanese and Korean markets. We have great potential here in Australia and we have great comparative advantage but … if you throw upwards of a trillion dollars at something, that tends to buy a comparative advantage. I think it’s a really serious risk that by the time we get our act together, that market won’t be there for us.”
The Australian government has been overt in its ambitions to establish a green hydrogen sector with Energy Minister Chris Bowen describing it as “the heart” of the government’s vision for the country as a renewable energy superpower.
Bowen’s ideal is backed by the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water which in the latest annual “State of Hydrogen” report, says that Australia has the foundations to become a global leader in green hydrogen.
Australia’s announced pipeline of major announced green hydrogen projects totals more than 100 projects worth an estimated $153 billion (AUD 230 billion) or more of potential investment. This represents close to 40% of all global clean hydrogen project announcements.
However, the department warns that most of the announcements in this pipeline are yet to reach final investment decisions. It noted that Australia already lags other key global players in the number of large projects that have moved from planning to implementation. Debelle said that these bottlenecks must be addressed quickly or Australia risks getting left further behind green hydrogen.
“The Inflation Reduction Act got legislated last August, the details are going to be put in place this August,” he said. “Once that’s there, then you’re going to see projects hitting the ground in the U.S. pretty much straight away. Those projects are happening and they’re starting this year, not next year, this year.  We need to start soon.”
Debelle said the federal government’s budget announcement of a program to scale up development is “a good start,” but said it must rolled out quickly and must be accompanied by a clear strategy for it to have any chance of success.
“What we’ve got to realize here is that we were starting a long way behind,” he said. “We’ve got to be careful that we don’t sort of take too long to follow through on the announcements. The sooner we can see the details of the Headstart program and move forward with them the better.”
The Hydrogen Headstart program will provide revenue support for investment in renewable hydrogen production through competitive production contracts. The federal government said the funding would “help bridge the commercial gap for early projects” and put the country on track to develop a gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity by 2030 via two to three “flagship projects.” Those supported projects are expected to become operational by 2026-27.
“We can’t match the IRA across the board but I think a more targeted response to it … is achievable particularly if we think about it as an investment in the future,” Debelle said. “It’s not just money out the door, it’s investment.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/08/2d-solar-cell-design-based-on-transition-metal-dichalcogenides-promises-12-87-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 8, 2023",2D solar cell design based on transition metal dichalcogenides promises 12.87% efficiency,"From pv magazine global
A group of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania have designed a 2D solar cell based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with a special superlattice structure that reportedly enables higher solar absorption levels.
TMDCs are two-dimensional materials with remarkable semiconducting properties and high optical absorption coefficients, which makes them suitable for the manufacture of semi-transparent and flexible solar cells with potential applications in aerospace, architecture, electric vehicles, and wearable electronics, where light weight, a high power-per-weight ratio, and flexibility are very desirable.
“I think people are slowly coming to the realization that 2D TMDCs are excellent photovoltaic materials, though not for terrestrial applications, but for applications that are mobile—more flexible, like space-based applications,” said lead author Deep Jariwala. “The weight of 2D TMDC solar cells is 100 times less than silicon or gallium arsenide solar cells, so suddenly these cells become a very appealing technology.”
The scientists built the cell with a monolayer absorber made of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a 3 nm insulator based on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) placed on a substrate made of Al2O3 and gold (Au), with the latter serving as a reflector. “The thickness of the Al2O3 layer has been optimized to enhance photocarrier generation,” they explained. “The active layer of the device is intrinsic and is 0.98 μm long, with silver and gold cathode and anode electrodes measuring 0.01 μm in length each.”
According to the researchers, the novelty of this cell consists of its superlattice structure, which they say can separate the layers of 2D TMDCs by a spacer or non-semiconductor layer. “Spacing out the layers allows you to bounce light many, many times within the cell structure, even when the cell structure is extremely thin,” said Jariwala, noting that the cell shows large exciton binding energies.
When tested in a series of simulations, the proposed cell design with separate contacts was able to reach a power conversion efficiency of 12.87%. As a way of comparison, real 2D TMDC solar cells were so far able to reach efficiencies of up to 6%.
“We were not expecting cells that are so thin to see a 12% value. Given that the current efficiencies are less than 5%, my hope is that in the next 4 to 5 years people can actually demonstrate cells that are 10% and upwards in efficiency,” the researchers stated.
They described the new cell technology in the paper “How good can 2D excitonic solar cells be?” published in device. “Our findings indicate that 2D TMDC-based PVs, when optimized for both optical and electronic design, exhibit superior performance compared with other thin-film materials in terms of power density, which is vital for many applications such as aerospace, remote sensing, and wearable technology,” they concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/08/u-s-solar-market-expected-to-triple-in-size-in-five-years/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 8, 2023",U.S. solar market expected to triple in size in five years,"The U.S. solar industry installed 6.1 GW of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, according to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q2 2023 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.
Several factors contributed to the record first quarter, not the least of which was the surge in demand triggered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. But in addition to the surge, projects are beginning to move forward after being delayed due to supply chain challenges that began during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts that the solar market will triple in size over the next five years, amounting to a total installed solar capacity of 378 GW by 2028.

A key component to the IRA is the domestic content adder. In May, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released guidance that provides detailed information about the domestic content bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act. Solar power projects that use domestic content are eligible for the full 30% tax credit can increase their tax credit by an additional 10%, to 40% in total, and 0.3 ¢/kWh for projects that use the Production Tax Credit.
In addition to the tax credits for clean energy developers, the IRA provides incentives for the build out of U.S. manufacturing, and it has effectively stimulated a number of companies to announce the intent to set up domestic manufacturing facilities. The SEIA/Wood Mackenzie report expects that, as a result of the surge in announced manufacturing facilities, domestic module capacity will rise from fewer than 9 GW today to more than 60 GW by 2026. At least 16 GW of module manufacturing facilities are under construction as of the end of Q1 2023.
In addition to the domestic content adder, the IRA specifies adders for energy communities and low-income community projects, intending to drive investments in underserved communities.
“As the Inflation Reduction Act begins to flex its muscle and drive demand, the U.S. solar and storage industry is eagerly awaiting further guidance on some of the most impactful pieces of the law,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA. “Timely, specific, and workable implementation guidance from the administration will have a major impact on our success in both the near and long-term. This guidance is powerful, and if done correctly, it could unlock new market potential across the country.”
The Q2 Solar Market Insight Report paints a picture of an upward trajectory, but that growth is not without some complexity. First off, navigating the maze of credits within the IRA remains complex and challenging. And secondly, it could take a few years before a full range of U.S.-made solar materials and components are available. The report points to the fact that there currently is no crystalline silicon cell manufacturing in the U.S., although a few manufacturers have announced intentions of doing so, but it will be some time before the facilities are operational.
Michael Parr, executive director of Washington DC-based trade body the Ultra-Low Carbon Solar Alliance, says making polysilicon, wafers, and cells is capital intensive and that is why we are initially seeing so many announcements that are instead about module manufacturing. Any mismatch between U.S. module and cell production capacity would see module makers remain dependent on imported cells for the foreseeable future.
“The U.S. solar industry is slowly starting to see supply chain relief,” said Michelle Davis, head of global solar at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “At the same time, qualifying for the domestic content adder will be a very complex process for solar project developers. Even once crystalline silicon cell manufacturing is established, many other components will need to be produced domestically before projects can qualify.”
The SEIA/Wood Mackenzie report also notes that the IRA rules leave the residential market without clarity because they don’t specify how adders and credits can be applied. However, the residential market grew 30% over the same quarter last year. The report estimates that the residential segment installed 1.6 GW of solar capacity in Q1 2023, and is on track to add 36 GW of solar over the next five years, growing at an average annual rate of 6%.
Looking at the utility-scale market, it rebounded from a difficult 2022 and installed a record 3.8 GW of capacity. The report points to delayed projects moving forward due to fading supply chain challenges as more module importers were able to satisfy the documentation requirements under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
The commercial market installed a record 391 MW, and is on track for 12% growth in 2023. The only market downturn noted in the report is community solar, which dropped 13%, installing only 212 MW, in large part due to interconnection backlogs.
Overall the solar industry accounted for 54% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the grid in Q1 2023.
