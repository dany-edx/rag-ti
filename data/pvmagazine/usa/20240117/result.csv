The projects are in locations across the U.S., including in California and New York. 
The transaction builds on an earlier 100 MW partnership in New York. The new agreement calls for Gutami to develop 500 MW of energy transition infrastructure assets. Scale Microgrids will acquire, finance, and own the community solar assets. 
“Community solar continues to be a priority for Scale for both its inclusivity and ability to provide more options to our microgrid customers,” said Ryan Goodman, chief executive officer, Scale Microgrids. “Community solar is a great option for those who are unable to install rooftop solar because they are renters, can’t afford solar, or because their property is not suited for it.” 
The associated assets with the deal will power roughly 80,000 homes and reduce annual CO2 emissions by about 800,000 tons. 
Scale Microgrids is a vertically integrated distributed energy platform, focused on building, financing, owning, and operating solar and energy storage projects. The company provides financing to technology providers, energy developers, and original equipment manufacturers. It also assists large consumers of energy to take charge of their energy infrastructure  
Gutami is a privately owned global developer and investor in sustainable energy solutions. The company, founded in 2006, has invested in utility-scale solar facilities, rooftop solar, energy storage, and hydrogen. 
“After our first success in New York, we were able to expand to other states,” said Gerben Pek, chief executive officer, Gutami. “The fast decision-making processes by local governments combined with clear legal structures and a well-functioning legal system, enables us to accelerate our growth in community solar in the U.S.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/17/soltec-unveils-new-solar-tracker-designed-for-u-s-market/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 17, 2024",Soltec unveils new solar tracker designed for U.S. market,"Soltec announced the launch of its new SF7 USA solar tracker at Intersolar in San Diego, booth 720.
As the build-out of large-scale solar plants escalates in the U.S., the perfectly flat land easily amenable to solar is becoming scarce. Soltec is banking on its new trackers meeting a growing need in the market.
The SF7 is designed to adapt to terrain and to be easy to install in the field by cutting installation processes, reducing pile counts and taking other measures to streamline the design.
The tracker’s mounting tolerances range from 20 to 40 inches, and Soltec reports that the solar tracker can be installed on slopes of up to 17% and can be customized.
The SF7 tracker features wireless communication designed to withstand low temperatures. It uses Soltec’s TeamTrack system to ensure maximum production, delivering up to 6.8% more yield, Soltec reports. This works by minimizing shading losses between rows, especially on uneven terrain. Bifacial tracking also boosts efficiency, the company says, optimizing its position to make use of both sides of the module.
As with Soltec’s SFOne tracker, the SF7 includes Dy-Wind technology, which offers a method for designing wind-resistant tracking structures and the optimization of the diffuse booster system for low-light conditions. It also includes a Soltec-designed algorithm for hail defense, which is aimed at better protecting solar modules.
Like the SFOne, the SF7 can be locally manufactured, which Colin Caufield, VP of sales North America said is “reflecting our strong commitment to sustainability and support for American socio-economic development. It is a strategic market for us, and we want to be more than a technology provider, positioning ourselves as agents of change towards an energy-independent United States”.
Soltec sees the U.S. as a growing market for the Spanish firm. Europe currently accounts for about 27% of its turnover, with the U.S. accounting for 25% and Latin America 47%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/17/u-s-solar-power-generation-forecast-to-grow-75-through-2025/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 17, 2024",U.S. solar power generation forecast to grow 75% through 2025,"The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) released projections for solar and wind energy growth in its recent Short Term Energy Outlook report, showing strong growth in solar and moderate growth for wind.
EIA expects solar generation to grow 75% from 2023 to 2025. In 2023, the U.S. generated about 163 billion kWh, and EIA expects this to reach 286 billion kWh in 2025.
PV Intel data indicates that from January to October 2023, solar power accounted for 5.78% of U.S. electricity, an increase from 4.98% during the same period the previous year. This marks a 16% increase in solar power generation over the previous year.
Meanwhile wind power generation is expected to grow 11%, increasing from 430 billion kWh in 2023 to 476 billion kWh in 2025.
Meanwhile, EIA expects coal generation to decline from 665 billion kWh in 2023 to 548 billion kWh in 2025. Natural gas is expected to remain the largest source of U.S. electricity generation, with 1,700 billion kWh generated in 2024 and 2025. Both natural gas and nuclear power are expected to remain relatively flat in generation contribution over the next two years.
In total, the U.S. electric power sector produced 4,017 billion kWh. Renewable sources including solar, wind, hydroelectric power, biomass, and geothermal, accounted for 22% of the total. Renewable generation as a group passed total nuclear generation in 2021 and surpassed coal in 2022.
Large additions of new renewable energy capacity are driving this shift in generation mix. Solar developers are expected to increase the nation’s total operational capacity by 38%. Total solar capacity is expected to grow from 95 GW at the end of 2023 to 131 GW at the end of 2024.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts the deployment of 45 GWdc in utility-scale solar projects larger than one megawatt in 2024. This is projected increase to about 53 GWdc in 2025. Adding Wood Mackenzie Power and Renewables conservative projections of 6 GW in residential solar and 2 GW in commercial projects, the total solar capacity expected for 2024 is 53.5 GW. Projected figures for 2025 suggest a potential total deployment of 65 GW of solar power.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/17/meyer-burger-to-cease-pv-module-production-in-germany/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 17, 2024",Meyer Burger to cease PV module production in Germany,"Switzerland’s Meyer Burger Technology has announced that it is preparing to shut down its solar module manufacturing facilities in Germany.
“With a deteriorating market environment in Europe, continuing with full-scale European solar manufacturing is not sustainable for the time being,” the company said in a statement. “Part of the plan would unfortunately be the closure of one of Europe’s largest operational solar module production sites in Freiberg, Germany, as early as beginning of April 2024, affecting approximately 500 people.”
The company said that it will make a final decision by the end of February, leaving the door open to rethink its plan if “sufficient measures to create a level playing field in Europe, such as a resilience-reward scheme,” are put into place.
Meyer Burger said that cell production at its factory in Talheim, Germany, will support module production at its 2 GW factory currently under construction in the United States.
“The R&D sites in Switzerland and Germany would not be affected by these measures and continue to develop and produce technology and equipment to support Meyer Burger’s business outside Europe,” it said.
“In the US, we can take full advantage of our leading technology position, resulting in substantial interest by partners and supported by favorable industry policies,” said Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt. “The expansion of the U.S. business is currently proceeding as planned with the ramp-up of our solar module production site in Goodyear, expected to start in the second quarter of 2024.”
By combining US module and cell manufacturing, Meyer Burger will benefit from the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit 45X system, which is a component of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Prior to this announcement, Meyer Burger was targeting around 3 GW of new annual production capacity in Germany by the end of 2024, including 1.4 GW of module production capacity in Freiberg. It also currently plans to build a 3.5 GW solar cell and module factory at an unspecified location in Spain.

The company has developed SELMA (Sinovoltaics EL mass analysiswhich, the company says, inspects 100% of purchased modules for microcracks and other cell-inherent defects. The company offers a quality guarantee underwritten by Munich Re, a global insurance leader.
Called “Zero Risk Solar”, the quality inspection service that uses the company’s AI-driven electroluminescence (EL) analysis to review modules and guarantee that orders are 100% free of microcracks and other defects before shipping. Sinovoltaics reports that If any warranty claim is filed within three years, Sinovoltaics will pay liquidated damages to cover costs, such as de-assembly, manpower, and logistics.

The company has been offering inspection by SELMA since 2020 and it has been implemented at all the major Tier 1 solar manufacturers outside the U.S., the company reports. In 2023 alone, more than 4 million PV modules were inspected. Using SELMA, the company reports that replacement rates of 1% to 3% were common at Tier 1 factories, preventing hundreds of thousands of defective PV modules from being shipped.
“100 percent module inspections is the only way to ensure high performance solar projects,” said Dricus de Rooij, co-founder and CEO of Sinovoltaics. “Our goal is to help solar manufacturers to deliver—and for solar developers to receive—the highest quality solar modules. That’s why Sinovoltaics inspects 100 percent of PV modules and does not rely on sampling methods. Every module is inspected by SELMA and replaced, if necessary, before their clients’ orders leave the factory.
“Our objective is that our clients operate high performing projects for more than 40 years. In the event that a warranty claim occurs on-site, we have skin in the game to compensate our clients through our insurance partner, Munich Re,” de Rooij added.
Sinovoltaics reports that its success is based on its experience auditing more than 200 solar PV module factories, more than 35 energy storage and inverter manufacturing facilities, and inspecting more than 18 GW of solar and storage products at factories across 15+ countries for clients from over 45 countries across 6 continents.
The company’s credentials include certification to ISO 17020, ISO 9001, as well as a CQI/IRCA-accredited and SA8000-certified team of auditors, showcasing its commitment to excellence and rigorous quality standards.
