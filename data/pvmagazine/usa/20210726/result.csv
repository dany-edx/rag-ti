The states in question are Michigan and Wisconsin, with Michigan’s community solar legislation being filed in late April and Wisconsin’s earlier this month. Both states have limited community solar programs, run by utilities or as a part of small pilots. But, until these filings, there was no law requiring utilities to provide the service, nor to cooperate with independent renewable energy developers.
Both states’ legislation would cap the size of community solar installations at 5 MW, while Michigan’s bill would require that every community solar installation has 60% of its capacity subscribed to by subscriptions of 40 kilowatts or less – essentially meaning homes and small commercial properties – with no single subscriber receiving more than 40% of a system’s overall capacity.
Neither bill has laid out concretely what price utilities would pay for the electricity generated by community solar projects, leaving that determination to each state’s regulators, with the understanding that the rate should spur future development into community solar. This aspect has seen resistance from opponents of the bills in each of the two states, with those parties arguing that such legislation would only benefit solar developers and shift costs to non-participating customers.
Both bills, however, have strong backing by their own regional renewable energy advocates. Michigan’s bill has the support of the Michigan Community Solar Alliance, a 14-member organization which includes the Michigan Municipal League, an organization which advocates on behalf of more than 520 municipalities across the state.
A release put out by the Michigan Community Solar Alliance also references a survey in which three out of four respondents, all Michigan citizens and ratepayers, expressed their support for the community solar legislation.
Wisconsin’s bill has the backing of RENEW Wisconsin, a nonprofit organization that promotes renewable energy in Wisconsin.
Supporters of the bills in both states reference National Renewable Energy Laboratory data that shows that at least 49% of households and 48% of businesses across the country lack adequate solar rooftops, and that instituting community soar is the best way to provide access to these customers, as well as expanding energy equity, as many of the homes unsuitable for solar house low- and middle-income individuals and families.
Lastly, advocates in both states point the the positive effect that community solar has had on neighboring states, particularly Minnesota, where legislation requires Xcel Energy, the state’s largest investor-owned utility to purchase power from any project that meets basic requirements. This legislation has led to the creation of the most effective community solar program in the nation, with nearly 800 MW installed to date.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/26/fpls-community-solar-program-reaches-its-subscription-limit/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,FLORIDA",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 26, 2021",FPL’s ‘community solar’ program reaches its subscription limit,"Florida Power and Light (FPL) said that residential subscriptions to its SolarTogether community solar program have sold out, with more than 48,000 confirmed subscribers and another 2,000 waiting for future capacity.
The news extends to nearly full subscriptions across all of the program’s customer segments: residential, low-income, commercial, industrial, and government. The commercial, industrial, and government portions filled up within a month of the program’s launch.  SunAssist, the program’s low-income portion, achieved a 50% subscription rate in the six months it has been available.
SolarTogether is billed as one of the largest community solar programs in the country, though calling it a true community solar program may be a bit of a misnomer. The program is one piece of the utility’s larger 30×30 program, under which FPL aims to install 30 million solar panels by 2030. SolarTogether is described by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy as 30×30’s “backbone.”
Once all of its solar installations are completed, the program will total 1.49 GW in capacity, spread out across 20 projects. This is where the phrasing gets tricky. Each of the projects within the program will be 74.5 MW in capacity, the general maximum size for utility-scale solar installations in Florida. True community solar installations, however, are considered to be in the 1-5 MW range, with some outliers pushing the boundary at 20 MW.
Moreover, SolarTogether subscribers don’t pay to directly receive the energy generated by any particular project. Instead, customers buy a subscription that helps to pay for the 20 solar energy centers FPL has built across the state. In return, the customers receive credits that eventually lower their electric bills. Subscribers are expected to achieve a simple payback on their subscription within seven years.
Roughly a year after FPL first announced SolarTogether, Duke Energy Florida filed with state regulators a proposal to develop 750 MW of new solar in the Sunshine State, which the company would then sell to customers in 1 kW blocks.
Like SolarTogether, Duke subscribers–for a fee–receive a bill credit. Duke expects that by year five of the program, the annual bill credit will exceed the subscription fee. By year seven, customer credits are expected to exceed the charges paid to-date for the program.
While Duke has been careful not to refer to the program as community solar, one of the signatories of the initial filing, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy does, calling it “one of the largest community solar program(s) in the U.S.”
When FPL and Duke each announced their programs, many solar and renewable energy advocates vocalized their belief that neither program represented true community solar.

The U.K. government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is overseeing a “longer duration” energy storage competition, with millions up for grabs for innovative entrants.
As part of the U.K.’s £1 billion ($1.38 billion) Net Zero Innovation Portfolio, the competition has as much as £68 million ($94 million) available in capital funding for new technology projects which can store energy for longer than four hours, to support renewable power generation.
The storage technologies listed in the scope of the competition include electric, thermal, and “power-to-x” projects and exclude “widely deployed U.K. commercial demonstration” tech such as lithium-ion, pumped hydro, or large water tanks.
The competition guidance document requests first-of-a-kind, full-system prototypes or demonstrator projects. While global companies can enter the contest, provided they are U.K.-registered, demonstrations must be relevant for the U.K. energy system and take place in the U.K.
Earlier in July, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) set a goal to reduce the cost of grid-scale, long duration energy storage by 90% within the decade. As the second target within DOE’s Energy Earthshot Initiative, the so-called “Long Duration Storage Shot” aims to accelerate breakthroughs that store electricity generated by the hundreds of gigawatts of clean energy that the agency expects to come onto the grid over the next few years.
DOE said that several of its offices conduct energy storage activities, and the administration’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request included a total of $1.16 billion for those activities. Pending appropriations from Congress, DOE said it anticipates funding opportunities and other activities to help advance its goals.
DOE said that long-duration energy storage – defined as systems that can store energy for more than 10 hours at a time – would support a low-cost, reliable, carbon-free electric grid. Cheaper and more efficient storage would make it easier to capture and store clean energy for use when energy generation is unavailable or lower than demand.
The U.K. competition is split into two streams for competitors to receive grants or funding.
Stream one applies to more commercially advanced projects involving actual demonstrations. Up to £1 million (€1.2 million) will be given to projects that reach phase one. A final three projects from phase one will then advance to phase two, where around £11 million will be available in grants.
Stream two involves earlier-stage projects, with lower technology readiness levels. Some 12 projects are set to be awarded, with £150,000 ($207,300) per project for phase one. As with stream one, a final three projects will then be chosen to progress to phase two development, and each will be awarded a maximum of £9.45 million ($13.1 million).
Finalists in each stream must plan to start their phase one efforts in November with a completion date in November next year. Phase two will start in December next year, with projects completed, at the latest, by March 2025.
BEIS has also launched a low-carbon hydrogen competition, with up to £60 million ($83 million) available in funding, and following a similar timeline to the longer-duration storage contest.
A previous £33 million ($45.6 million) low-carbon hydrogen competition produced five winners across carbon capture and storage technology, offshore wind-powered production, and a U.S.-based winner, with technology developed by the Gas Technology Institute, a natural gas-focused non-profit.

Multi-day iron-air batteries reach commercialization… at one-tenth the cost of lithium.  Startup Form Energy has secured $200 million  for the development of what is being called a breakthrough in energy storage.
Facing opposition, developers pull application for 850 MW solar project in the Nevada desert. Local opposition forced the action, but the same developers are moving ahead with a separate $1 billion solar-plus-storage project nearby.
Tesla Powerwalls in California join the movement to create virtual power plants. Made up of distributed residential energy storage, these “plants” stabilize the grid and often end the need for new fossil generation.
Rivian plans second plant to produce EV trucks and batteries. The Amazon-backed automaker is exploring U.S. locations to produce its electric truck and battery cells.
Ohio regulators consider another 470 MW of solar. The Clearview Solar I project and the Union Solar project are both set to have hearings in mid-August, bringing the total amount of utility scale solar proposed or approved this summer to 1,938 MW.
Storage paired with solar shows steady growth, Berkeley Lab says. The report pegged the cost of adding storage to PV on the order of $700-1,300/kWh of storage capacity and the present-value benefit to the host customer of roughly $500-1,000/kWh.

The “Battle Born Solar Project” would have been built by Arevia Power and Solar Partners VII LLC on a hilltop in Moapa Valley, which is administered by the bureau. A group of residents argued that the array would be an eyesore and could hurt area recreational activities.
The proposed plant would have covered more than 14 square miles. News reports said that Gov. Steve Sisolak wrote to federal officials in 2020 asking that they fast-track the project.
Arevia Power is involved in the $1 billion, 690 MW Gemini solar-plus-storage project, also north of Las Vegas.
Mark Boyadjian, managing partner, led power purchase agreement talks for the Gemini contract with local utility NV Energy, and for Gemini’s development capital fundraising from Quinbrook. Ricardo Graf, Arevia’s chief development officer and managing partner, came up with the project idea and acts as  representative for development-related activities associated with the project.
The Gemini project will use Maxeon Solar Technologies’ bifacial Performance 5 UPP solar panel. Gemini is being built by, and will be owned and operated by, Primergy Solar.
The module supply agreement calls for nearly 1.8 million panels to be supplied over a four-quarter period starting in the second quarter of 2022; project completion is planned by the end of 2023. Gemini also includes a 380 MW/1,400 MWh battery energy storage component.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/26/rivian-plans-second-plant-to-produce-ev-trucks-and-batteries/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 26, 2021",Rivian plans second plant to produce EV trucks and batteries,"Rivian Automotive is in the early stages of determining the location for a second manufacturing plant of their electric vehicle trucks, according to a spokesperson for the company. The Amazon-backed venture will also produce battery cells at the facility, they said.
Multiple states have submitted bids for “Project Tera,” which will be officially announced in a couple of months and is expected to break ground in early 2022, according to Reuters. Rivian’s first plant is located in central Illinois.
A new vehicle assembly plant can cost $1 billion or more, and battery cell production plants are at least $2 billion to build, said Reuters. Currently, Samsung supplies battery cells to Rivian. The new battery cell plant is expected to include a 50 GWh production operation, built in phases, according to documents seen by the Reuters news agency that were submitted to state economic development officials.
The California-based automaker will seek a valuation of over $50 billion in a potential public listing later this year. Rivian is developing a pickup truck, SUV, and a delivery van for Amazon. Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric vans through 2024, with production scheduled to begin this fall. The Rivian R1T electric truck was originally intended to release to consumers this month, but Covid-related delays have pushed that release to September, and the R1S SUV to later this fall.
The R1T truck has been the cornerstone product on display in Rivian’s offerings. It claims a 250+ mile range, with a 400+ mile model expected in 2022. The quad-motor (one motor per wheel) engine goes 0-60 in 3 seconds, can tow up to 11,000 lbs., and can wade in depths of three feet or more. The front axle is powered by a 415 horsepower unit with 413 ft lbs. of torque, and the rear axle supplies 420 horsepower and 495 ft lbs. of torque. The truck comes with a 175,000 powertrain warranty for
Fast charging at over 200kW for sustained periods are capable with the R1T, said Rivian. It also contains independent air suspension, allowing for six and a half inches of height adjustment, optimizing the vehicle’s ride height for improved handling, aerodynamics, and stability with varying payloads.
Rivian will seek to compete in the burgeoning global consumer EV market with their light duty truck and SUV models. Recent analysis by Ernst & Young (EY) shows that combined electric vehicle sales in the US, China, and Europe may outpace all other engine sales by 2033. By 2045, EY said non-EV sales could shrink to less than one percent of overall sales.
Allied Market Research estimates the global electric truck market will have a compound annual growth rate of 25.8% from 2020 to 2027. Rivian joins a growing list of manufacturers building electric trucks domestically in the U.S. that aim to be the pacemakers for this growth.
