Platte River Power Authority is a not-for-profit, community-owned public power utility that generates and delivers energy and services to customers in the Colorado towns of Estes Park, Fort Collins, Longmont and Loveland, Colorado. Its generation portfolio includes coal, wind, hydro, solar and gas resources and will in the future rely more extensively on non-carbon energy, due to the Resource Diversification Policy that was adopted in 2018. The policy calls for pursuing a 100% noncarbon energy mix by 2030, provided the organization’s core pillars are upheld. With an additional 250 MW of solar generating capacity, the utility estimates its overall annual energy production will be approximately 54% noncarbon. 
“As we continue to work toward achieving the Resource Diversification Policy goal, our ongoing challenge will be to maintain Platte River’s core pillars to safely provide reliable, environmentally responsible and financially sustainable energy and services during a time of rapidly improving technology and resource costs,” said Jason Frisbie, general manager and CEO of Platte River. “We need to proactively manage the intermittency of renewables as we continue to diversify our portfolio in preparation for a future without dispatchable coal resources.” 
The RFP calls for the largest amount of new, noncarbon generating capacity to date and encourages proposed projects to include a battery energy storage component capable of providing 100% of the project’s nameplate capacity for at least four hours and be dispatchable by Platte River when needed. 
“Connecting solar and battery storage on both the transmission and distribution systems will improve reliability and further advance our strategy of system integration,” added Frisbie. “The goal is to have distributed energy resources in every owner community.” 
Proposals are due Feb. 18, 2022, after which Platte River will develop a short list of potential projects that add up to approximately 250 megawatts and sign power purchase agreements later in the year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/16/california-first-state-to-require-solar-power-and-batteries-in-commercial-structures/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 16, 2021",California first state to require solar power and batteries in commercial structures,"California has become the first state to require solar power plus energy storage to be integrated into all future commercial structures via its most recent update to building codes. Additionally, the new building code added a requirement that all new residential construction must be ready for the addition of energy storage.
The rules that the California Clean Energy Commission (CEC) voted to approve can be found in the 2022 Build Energy Efficiency Standards. The regulatory body estimates this requirement may add 280 MW of annual solar capacity, as well as 400 MWh of energy storage.

The highest level technical requirements for the solar plus storage systems specify that the solar portion should be sized to meet a target of 60% of the structure’s loads. The target energy storage component should be sized to reduce electricity exports to 10% of the total solar generation.
The batteries must have a usable capacity of at least 5 kWh, a round trip efficiency of greater than 80%, and greater than 70% nameplate capacity remaining after 10 years (warrantied) or 4,000 cycles.
In addition to the commercial requirements, new residential construction must also be battery ready. This requires that new homes have a 225-amp busbar, four backed-up circuits (two of which must be the refrigerator and bedroom receptacle outlet), and also a subpanel or a split-bus main panel for those circuits.
The code requires battery systems to be capable of remote programming. The motivation behind this programmability requirement is the state’s goal of using distributed energy storage to ‘harmonize’ with the power grid. Many of these programmable modes also require the solar power to be coupled with the battery system.
The Basic Control mode dictates that by default, the battery must be able to charge from a solar photovoltaic system. And when the solar system isn’t outputting enough to cover the onsite load, the battery must be able to step in.
The next level control is Time of Use. In this case, the battery shall be programmed to charge only by solar electricity, and discharge during the highest priced Time of Use hours of the day. The system should have the ability to be programmed for at least three Time of Use seasons.

The last programmable feature is the Advanced Demand Response Flexibility Control. The state describes this type of storage system as being capable of altering the charge and discharge periods in response to signals from the local utility or a third-party aggregator. OhmConnect has already used this type of system to help Californians earn millions of dollars through its energy demand management during grid events.
These control requirements would allow for the solar plus storage systems to be Virtual Power Plant ready. Companies like Sunrun, Tesla, Sonnen and others are already installing systems with these technical capabilities.
The utility noted that battery sizing design would be integrated with the existing energy efficiency designs that guide sizing of heating and cooling systems, solar, within the state’s sixteen unique ‘climate zones’.
This new legislation exists, of course, within an already complex and extensive body of solar-focused, clean energy legislation in California.
The code change follows the groundbreaking 2019 Building Energy Code update, which required all residential construction to include solar panels. This author believes that the requirement may significantly lower the price of new construction residential solar power. Naturally, all of these standards contribute to California’s goal of reaching a net zero carbon footprint by 2045, and ensuing carbon negative footprint in years following that milestone.
And, Monday of this week we saw the Public Utility Commission receive a recommendation for aggressive cut backs to net metering compensation. The group specifically cited energy storage incentivization as a substantial factor in their decision.

The modules are designed to mimic the look of a shingled roof, retaining significant power output while considering the aesthetics of the home.
The panels feature hidden framing that allows for visual integration with non-solar roof sections, and customizable tempered glass in four different shades, including slate and shingle-like designs. The Solar Roof is also integrated with an anti-soiling coating.
The black asphalt mono module offers up to 300 W and open-circuit voltage up to 1000V, while the black slate mono module produces up to 350 W nominal max power and 1000V. The modules measure 80”x40” and have a temperature coefficient of –0.36% per Celsius. 
Mitrex Solar Roof panels are manufactured in Ontario, Canada and are backed by a 25-year warranty. The company said the roof-integrated PV can be installed using the same methods of traditional panel installation.
This product release comes on the heels of Mitrex’s release of its most powerful solar panel to-date: a two-module 790 W panel. 
The panel is built of two 395 W modules and contains 144 monocrystalline cells with 22.5% efficiency. The 790W panel is coated with patented anti-reflective technology, which involves color-treating the glass through pigments that are fused into the glass itself.
Mitrex also makes smaller solar modules, as well as PV facades, solar cladding, solar glass and BIPV systems.

The transaction is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of next year and is part of Rocket Lab’s plan to vertically integrate its products and services. “As one of only two companies producing high-efficiency, space-grade solar cells in the United States, Solaero’s space solar cells are among the highest performing in the world and support civil space exploration, science, defense and intelligence, and commercial markets,” Rocket Lab said in a statement. “In combining with Rocket Lab, Solaero will tap into the company’s resources and manufacturing capability to boost high-volume production, making high-performing space power technologies available at scale.”
Solaero operates an 11,000m² manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where it produces different kinds of outer-space solar cells.
These include a 30%-efficient four-junction device on a germanium substrate; a 30.2%-efficient triple-junction solar cell optimized for low earth orbit (LEO) applications; a 29.5%-efficient standard triple-junction cell based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and germanium (Ge); a 29.4%-efficient triple-junction device based on a germanium substrate; and an inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) cell with an efficiency of 32%.
Solaero claims its solar cells and products were used in more than 1,000 space missions since the company was created in 1998. “Solaero’s products have played key roles in some of the industry’s most ambitious space missions, including supplying power to NASA’s Parker solar probe and [the] Mars Insight Lander, the largest solar array ever deployed on the surface of Mars; and several Cygnus cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station,” it further explained.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/16/software-for-sub-particle-modeling-of-lithium-ion/,"MARKETS & POLICY,SOFTWARE,COLORADO,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 16, 2021",Software for sub-particle modeling of lithium-ion,"With applications in distributed energy storage, electric vehicles, co-located solar and storage, and more, the demand for lithium-ion batteries is on the rise. With this is also the demand for making improvements to performance, safety, and energy density to rapidly scale the technology.
In pursuit of these improvements, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the University of Ulm developed an unprecedented computer model that can represent the architecture of a Li-ion electrode particle with sub-particle grain detail. The findings were published in npj Computational Materials.
“This breakthrough allows NREL to perform single-particle characterization for Li-ion cells,” said Donal Finegan, NREL staff scientist and project lead. “We know that the morphology and orientation of grains within the cell can greatly affect the rate performance and life of the electrode. With this model, we can evaluate the physical conditions that lead to improved batteries.”
Initial use of the model has already led to better understanding of how physical conditions affect how lithium travels through the electrode and around the crystals. The sub-particle details will be used to inform research on extreme fast charging can be performed without accelerated degradation of the battery.
Similar breakthroughs are being made in the development and advancement of solar PV cells. A recent collaboration between MIT and Google led to the development of a high-resolution solar cell computer model.
A chief challenge in Li-ion research is that improvements must be made at the microscopic level. There are no presently-existing methods for measuring sub-particle reactions in Li-ions, so the model offers a first look into their properties. The limits of microscopic imaging have been pushed against for years, said NREL, so the model offers a new way to understand the material.
“Microscopy techniques always require a trade-off,” Finegan said. “For example, tools that measure particle morphology overlook vital information about the chemical properties or crystal structure due to systematic limitations. We’ve realized there is no way to get all of the information we need in one place.”
The fusion of two of NREL’s advanced technologies allowed for the creation of the model. X-ray nano-computed tomography captured the outer shape of the particles. Focused-ion beam electron backscatter diffraction captured the internal grain distribution and sub-particle information. Together, a model of the li-ion particle could be created.
“Merging data streams is not a trivial task,” said Finegan. “Microscopy itself is highly specialized, and these tools each output data in their own way. To generate this model, our team was tasked with not only characterizing the information from each data source, but then translating it to an entirely new format.”
NREL said future research will employ machine learning to speed the data acquisition and analysis process, leading to faster insights in the future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/16/sunverge-to-develop-residential-virtual-power-plant-in-maryland/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETING,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOFTWARE,MARYLAND",TIM SYLVIA,"DECEMBER 16, 2021",Sunverge to develop residential virtual power plant in Maryland,"Sunverge and Delmarva Power announced that the two companies have entered into an agreement with PJM Interconnection (PJM) to explore how the Elk Neck Battery Storage Pilot Program will participate in the region’s wholesale market for ancillary services.
The project, a virtual power plant (VPP) with a planned capacity of 0.55 MW/2.2 MWh, is anticipated to be fully operational by Q1 2022 and has received the necessary regulatory approvals from Maryland regulators. The project will be the first battery energy storage residential VPP to participate in PJM’s wholesale market, potentially providing benefits to both consumers and the grid.
VPPs work to augment an electric supplier’s energy supply by relieving the grids of excess renewable energy as production spikes and absorbing excess energy when needed. The result is intended to reduce peak demand and provide fast frequency response to balance the grids. The renewable energy storage systems will collectively respond to grid needs dynamically, moment-to-moment.
The VPP is being used as a pilot project to prove the efficacy of distributed energy resources under real-world market conditions, demonstrating just how dynamic the grid has become and how new technologies can benefit customers and the broader regional energy system.
The Elk Neck Battery Storage Pilot Program is not the only residential virtual plant project Sunverge is currently working on. In late November, the company announced a similar project, being developed in partnership with LG Electronics USA for customers in Northern and Central California.
The California project is also expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2022, and is intended to explore ways in which intelligent and dynamic load control and solar/energy storage can be aggregated as dynamic multi-service and multi-asset VPPs. The intent is to create value on both sides of the meter and helping utilities transition to more resilient and flexible distribution grids.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/16/microgrids-a-solution-for-modern-day-energy-challenges/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 16, 2021",Microgrids: A solution for modern-day energy challenges,"With a traditional utility grid, electricity is generated at central power plants and transported over long distances. Buildings and municipalities connect to this power through a series of substations and transmission lines. With few redundant paths for energy to be delivered, thousands of users can be left without power if one part of the grid fails or needs to be repaired.
In contrast, a microgrid uses local energy sources to generate power for individual buildings or a campus of buildings. Microgrids can operate autonomously (in “island mode”) or be connected to the larger utility grid, making it more adaptable and resilient.
When a microgrid connects to the primary grid, it parallels the grid, matching its characteristics, such as voltage, frequency, and phase rotation. Depending upon the generation capacity, in circumstances such a partial shutdown of a central power plant, utilities can use the microgrid as a back-up generation source.
Some of the local, distributed energy resources utilized by microgrids can include engine generators and/or renewable sources, such as solar, wind, or hydropower. Many newer microgrids also incorporate energy storage and electric vehicle charging stations.
Who might consider a microgrid system?
Grocery stores that depend on large refrigeration systems for their products and hospitals that must keep life-saving/sustaining equipment and HVAC systems running at all times are two prime examples.
For ShopRite grocery stores on the East Coast, our Cushing Terrell team configured combined heat and power microgrid systems that generate power using a lean-burn, natural-gas engine. Set up to operate in island mode, when Hurricane Isaias hit in August 2020, the stores remained operating and were able to keep frozen and refrigerated goods from perishing, saving millions of dollars for this particular client.
Additionally, you can see this type of system in action for the Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Maryland. Two large, highly efficient natural-gas engines produce power for the hospital at all times. The system recaptures waste heat off the engines and pipes it into the boiler system, reducing the amount of natural gas burned in boilers to heat the hospital. This combined heat and power system can be placed in island mode, so if the utility grid goes down due to a hurricane or other outage, the hospital can disconnect from the main grid and keep running.
Some microgrids aren’t attached to a larger grid at all. These are typically found in very rural settings where extending power from a central hub would be too difficult or expensive.
For example, Cushing Terrell designed the Lamar Buffalo Ranch power system in Yellowstone National Park, which uses a solar photovoltaic array, micro-hydro turbine, Toyota recycled nickel-metal hybrid car batteries, and a small propane back-up generator. The system allows the facility to operate in a way that conserves energy and water, and reduces waste. Toyota sponsored this project in an effort to find a secondary use for hybrid car batteries after they reached the end of their life in a vehicle.

Not all microgrids are considered greener, as many are powered by diesel generators, but more and more organizations are using renewables to power their microgrids. Environmentally friendly energy sources such as wind and solar are variable, meaning they ramp up and down based on nature’s schedule. However, when paired with the central grid or integrated into a form of storage (batteries, pumped hydro, or hydrogen), the swings that can occur with renewables are balanced out.
The Lamar Buffalo Ranch Power System in Yellowstone National Park is 100% off-grid.
Why all the buzz?
More companies and governments are considering microgrids as the solution to a variety of challenges. There’s evidence that microgrids could reduce safety concerns, propel the use of electric vehicles, eliminate transmission losses, and even enable a more robust sharing economy.
Failed power lines due to high-wind events can leave customers without power and, even worse, cause large wildfires. We saw recent examples of this in California where wildfires devastated homes and communities. To address these natural disasters, local utilities have begun to de-energize power lines during high-wind events, which can result in hundreds of thousands of customers without power for a few hours to several days.
Microgrids have the potential to help with this situation in two ways. First, local power sources can eliminate the need for such long-distance delivery, thus reducing the potential for a power line to spark or short out in a dry zone. Second, if power lines do need to be shut down in anticipation of a high-wind event, the microgrid can switch to island mode instead of relying on power served from these lines. This can result in health, safety, and economic benefits when it comes to power needed for medical equipment and keeping refrigerated and frozen goods from perishing during extended outages.
Wildfires are not the only natural disaster that demonstrates the fragility of the utility grid. With climate change causing more frequent superstorms like the recent hurricanes on the East Coast, aging traditional energy infrastructure (power lines and substations) can be damaged or destroyed. It can take anywhere from a couple of days to several weeks after these storms pass to restore power to the areas affected. However, microgrids that operate independently from the primary grid can continue operating during these events. An example of this independence is the continued operation of ShopRite grocery stores on the East Coast during Tropical Storm Isaias.
Electric vehicles (EV) also benefit from microgrids, and vice versa. Microgrids can better power EV charging stations, while EV popularity can drive interest in microgrids. EV charging structures — especially fast chargers — can exceed the capacity of utility substations and distribution lines, meaning that utilities may need to update distribution infrastructure to meet this increased demand.
Microgrids are especially important as businesses and public transit authorities electrify their fleets. If the existing electrical distribution grid can’t accommodate the energy loads necessary to power a fleet, microgrids can help with power availability and offer cost control and predictability. Additionally, microgrids can ensure a percentage of the power going into these fleets is from renewables or low-carbon sources. In the future, EVs could start to play a role as an energy-storage device with the potential to release energy back to the grid when not being used for transportation.
Peer-to-peer trading
The sharing economy has reached utilities. The New York Times reported on one such microgrid in — where else? — Brooklyn. In this example, the microgrid is a virtual, peer-to-peer energy trading system built on blockchain. With peer-to-peer energy trading, residents and businesses have control over the energy that’s produced in their microgrid, rather than an energy company. They use a virtual trading
platform that allows solar-energy producers to sell excess-electricity credits from their systems to buyers in the group.
They’re not the only group engaging in this approach, as neighbor-based systems exist in Australia, India, Germany and elsewhere, with members trading their stored energy (typically generated via solar panels) among one another.

During a commissioning ceremony last night, FPL illuminated the night sky with a light and drone show powered by the solar battery charged with power from the solar installation adjacent to the Manatee Energy Storage Center in Parrish, Florida.
“It’s been a momentous year for clean energy in Florida – FPL opened the year by formally shutting down its last coal-fired plant in the state and now we’re closing the year by shattering a world record and commissioning the largest solar-powered battery in the world,” said Eric Silagy, FPL president and CEO.
The newly operational battery has a 409 MW capacity and can deliver 900 MWh of energy, or enough energy to power approximately 329,000 homes for more than two hours.
During the day the battery system will store extra solar energy produced by the solar array at the Manatee Solar Energy Center. By deploying energy from the battery to the grid when there is a higher demand for electricity, FPL will offset the need to run other power plants. thus further reducing emissions and saving customers money through avoided fuel costs.
Florida Power and Light
The giant battery, which is the Manatee Energy Storage Center, is made up of 132 energy storage containers, organized across a 40-acre plot of land, equivalent to 30 football fields. It is powered by a field of over 340,000 solar panels on a 751-acre site.

The Manatee Energy Storage Center is part of a broader FPL plan to retire two 1970s-era natural gas generating units. FPL’s investments in battery storage technology complement the company’s expansion of solar energy. In addition to this solar-powered battery storage facility, FPL expects to complete construction on eight more solar energy centers by early next year. By the end of the decade, FPL forecasts that nearly 40% of the company’s power will be generated by zero-emissions energy sources – a more than 65% increase from 2020.

The deal will combine Stem’s storage optimization capabilities with AlsoEnergy’s solar asset performance monitoring and control software, which the companies hope will lead to a one-stop-shop solution for renewable energy projects.
In addition, Stem will offer its smart energy storage solutions to AlsoEnergy’s existing front-of-meter and commercial & industrial customers, who generally have limited storage attachment to their solar assets today, and AlsoEnergy will gain earlier visibility into solar plus storage projects through Stem’s extensive customer and partner network.
The two companies also believe the deal will provide significant opportunities to cross-sell and leverage each platform’s extensive customer base, with just 30% of AlsoEnergy’s customers also being customers of Stem. On top of this, the acquisition expands Stem’s global market presence, as AlsoEnergy currently provides performance, analytics, monitoring, and control solutions for roughly 32.5 GW of solar assets across 50 countries.
AlsoEnergy, as a company, is also no stranger to merger and acquisition activity. In 2018, AlsoEnergy announced its merger with Locus Energy, in a move that brought roughly 6.6 GW of project capacity to AlsoEnergy’s platform. This move marked AlsoEnergy’s first significant European expansion, as the company had largely operated in North America prior to the Locus Energy deal.
