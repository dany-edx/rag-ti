The company won a $50,000 prize and will next compete for a prize of $100,000. The unique folded frame is roll-formed steel, which the company says lowers material cost and reduces emissions from production as it requires less time to make and can be sourced through local or regional supply chains.
According to Origami Solar, using aluminum for module frames contributes more than ten times the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than its steel frames. The company said emissions are 14 kg of per 1 kg of aluminum, whereas steel production results in about 1.2 kg of GHGs for every 1 kg of steel. Recycled steel produces even less GHGs.
“It is exciting to see Origami Solar recognized by the DOE because steel frames have the potential to improve the mechanical durability of solar panels, especially large-format designs,” commented Jenya Meydbray, CEO of PV Evolution Labs (PVEL.)
The American-Made Solar Prize is a multi-million-dollar prize competition designed to energize U.S. solar innovation through a series of contests and the development of a diverse and powerful support network that leverages national laboratories, energy incubators, and other resources across the country. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office and directed and administered by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
In August 2020, Toledo Solar received a federal Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the doe for the development of cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar modules with glass-enameled steel backs.

The three projects in question are the 100 MW Lumpkin Solar Farm, located in Stewart County, right on the Georgia-Alabama border, and constructed in partnership with IEA; the 80 MW Lancaster Solar Farm in Colquitt County, north of Tallahassee, Florida; and the 107 MW Snipesville II Solar Farm in Jeff Davis County, midway between Macon and Jacksonville, Florida. The latter two projects were constructed in collaboration with McCarthy Building Companies.
The solar facilities are part of an ongoing collaboration between Walton EMC and Silicon Ranch to supply 100% renewable energy for Meta’s data center in Newton County, Georgia. Since the initial agreement in 2018, Walton EMC and Silicon Ranch have completed the installation of six projects totaling 435 MW in capacity.
The companies have also broken ground on the seventh project in the portfolio, the DeSoto I Solar Farm, a 125 MW facility being constructed in Lee County, just east of Stewart County. Silicon Ranch plans to hire more than 400 craft workers to build the project, which is expected to be completed before the end of 2022.
The entire portfolio will integrate Silicon Ranch’s Regenerative Energy model, an approach to design, construction, and operations that co-locates renewable energy production with regenerative agriculture practices. Through managed sheep grazing using regenerative pastureland management practices, Silicon Ranch said it can restore the land at each array site to a functioning grassland ecosystem, while keeping each site in agricultural production.

If enacted, the law would ban all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang unless the products are determined to not be connected to forced labor.
The region, which is home to 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, an essential material in conventional solar modules, has come under scrutiny for its human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that President Biden will sign the bill, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the bill will be sent to the Senate for “swift action.”
In June, the Biden administration ordered a ban on U.S. imports from Xinjiang-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., as well as three other companies in the region, and banned exports to what it said is the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC). Shortly thereafter the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of International Labor Affairs took an unprecedented step by publishing a Federal Register Notice that targets polysilicon produced in the region.

“The world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh. Corporations like Coca-Cola and Nike have lobbied against the new bill, which would have a major impact on supply chains that are deeply woven into China’s economy.
In August, an anonymous group of solar companies sought tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The group called for anti-dumping and anti-circumvention tariffs, pointing to uncertainty in the companies’ supply chain ties to China, and suspected dumping of forced-labor goods.
Solar industry leaders described the tariffs as potentially crippling. The Department of Commerce rejected the request in November, which Solar Energy Industries Association president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper called “a major victory for America’s 231,000 solar workers.”
In 2020, the EIA reported U.S. imports of solar panels fell 27% in the third quarter, as tensions between Washington D.C. and Beijing rose.
With sanctions increasing internationally, the U.S. looks to bolster its own domestic supply chain as it pursues goals of decarbonizing energy.
The Senate Finance Committee released its draft of the Build Back Better (BBB) infrastructure bill, which includes incentives for the U.S. manufacture of thin-film PV and crystalline silicon PV. The bill also added incentives for U.S.-made solar trackers, inverters, and other renewable energy technologies.

Simultaneously, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) sponsored a bill passed by the House in November that also pursues a boost in U.S. manufacturing. Similar to the BBB provisions, Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act would offer tax credits for domestic manufacture of solar-grade polysilicon, wafers, cells, modules, as well as trackers and inverters.
With polysilicon largely sourced from the Xinjiang region, the U.S. is exploring other photovoltaics, like cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film panels, and Earth-abundant but relatively unstable perovskites.

The system consists of a 65-kilowatt, bifacial ground-mount solar array plus 30 kilowatts of energy storage with a natural gas and propane backup generator. It also includes charging stations for electric vehicles that will replace the farm’s gas-powered vehicles over time and further use clean energy production for their operation.
Headquartered at Purdue Research Park in West Lafayette, Indiana, Emergent Solar Energy provides solar solutions to the commercial, industrial, municipal and agricultural sectors across the state of Indiana
Jeremy Lipinski, managing partner at Emergent Solar Energy, said it is the company’s first design with multiple sources of power generation and energy storage.
“This microgrid solution uses solar energy plus energy storage along with being connected to the REMC, or Rural Electric Membership Corp., utility grid,” Lipinski said. “It optimizes the farm’s energy use of the lowest-cost source of energy at any moment, thereby reducing the energy costs and fixing an increasing input.”
Emergent Solar Energy
The Corya System is a group of integrated agribusiness investment and operating companies that own, develop and lease farmland and specialized agricultural infrastructure including crop production, grain storage and livestock production facilities.  This is the first addition of PV to Corya System’s portfolio. P. David Corya, general manager of the Corya System, decided to implement solar energy options for several economic and sustainability reasons.
“From an economic perspective, the project offsets traditional grid usage and insulates our operation from rising energy prices, creating a significant and growing cost of production advantage, while enabling additional future cost savings from electric vehicle fleet conversion,” Corya said.
“From a sustainability perspective, we are committed to stewardship practices that protect air, soil, water and wildlife.”
Lipinski said the application of on-farm solar plus energy storage makes sense when renewable energy can be dispatched to offset the highest-cost demand and charge the battery bank at the lowest cost.
Total solar investment in Indiana is approximately $1.5 billion. Growth projection is 5,971 MW over the next five years and the State is ranked 18th (up from 32nd in 2020), according to SEIA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/15/solarpro-posts-10-million-for-texas-grid-upgrades/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 15, 2021",SolarPro posts $10 million for Texas grid upgrades,"In Texas, Solar Proponent (SolarPro) has a development pipeline of over 6 GW solar + storage through 2024. In order to connect its massive utility-scale solar project to the ERCOT grid, the company needed to contribute to funding upgrades.
The company announced it reached a $10 million interconnection agreement to connect the 345 KV portion of its Lunis Creek Solar project. The project, due for operations between 2023-24, is planned to reach capacities of 765 MW AC, with storage capacity to be announced.
This interconnection secured 480 MW along the South Texas Project – Angstrom transmission line, with the company having further plans to connect 600 MW AC to the line. The facility is also planned to be connected with a smaller adjacent 138 KV solar project.
As storms this February caused massive outages in the state, there is increasing pressure for bolstering the grid, adding extreme weather resilience, and integrating energy storage. 
In March, a Colorado-based grid analysis firm Vibrant Clean Energy released a whitepaper that modeled the impact of energy storage on reliability. It found that in a “high renewables” attachment rate to the grid, about 40,000 MW of storage would have met all February blackout requirements in the state “with room to spare.” 
Also planned for 2023-24 operation in Texas is the Clear Fork Creek solar project, a 650 MW AC facility with storage capacity to be determined. In total, SolarPro estimates its current projects can power about 230,000 homes per year, reduce emissions equivalent to 300,000 cars, and sequester carbon equivalent to planting 25 million trees.
SolarPro is backed by a $1.2 billion growth capital fund from EnCap Energy Transition, and has investors from Yorktown Partners and Mercuria Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/15/solar-takes-25-with-one-hand-gives-31-with-the-other/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 15, 2021","Solar takes 25% with one hand, gives 31% with the other","WoodMac Renewables & Power lowered their projections by 25% for solar power capacity to be installed in the United States in 2022, according to the US Solar Market Insight report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie. They’ve also added a big 44 GW asterisk next to all projections going forward — a projection increase dependent on the passage of the Build Back Better/Reconciliation Bill.

 
From the hand that takes, WoodMac cited supply chain constraints and logistics challenges as they lowered their quarterly estimates for deployed solar power capacity estimates in the United States. The 25% reduction – of 7.4 GW  implies that prior projections were 29.4 GW, and that revised projections are now 22.2 GW of deployed capacity.
This US Solar Market Insight report adds to a bevy of projections suggesting that market projections are getting complicated going forward.
Michelle Davis, the report’s author at WoodMac, says costs have increased across all market segments for the second quarter in a row — and that these increases have undone two years worth of hardware price decreases. Other than the price hikes that hit the residential market in 2015, this year’s supply chain price increases were the highest they’ve been since WoodMac started tracking the data in 2014.
Additionally, solar panel availability and pricing has been affected by anonymous petitioners who sought to add additional tariffs to solar panel imports. Their petitions have since been rejected. 
WoodMac suggests that these challenges, in addition to interconnection woes, is at least partially responsible for the commercial and community solar sectors slowing by 10% and 21%, respectively, quarter over quarter.
 

Amidst these price increases and market complexities, utility scale capacity has continued to set quarterly deployment records, as the sector is likely to be insulated from hardware costs by its long term supply chain choices. However, one might assume the utilities are taking a harder hit on shipping price increases – and delays – due to their large product volumes.
WoodMac also sees that residential installation volume has kept up growth. This may be due to the sector’s higher priced projects and premium product selection, which are better able to absorb subcomponent price increases.
In the end, the growth of two out of three sectors helped solar power to continue increasing its market share of new generation capacity as the USA seeks to extend a nearly two-decade march toward a cleaner grid.
 

 
Along with this downward projection, the group suggests that the solar market might increase by 43.5 GW of deployed capacity between 2022 and 2026, if the Build Back Better/Reconciliation Bill is signed with the current solar tax benefits in place.
WoodMac projects that 14 states will see at least a 1 GW of solar capacity increase due to the legislation, with another 14 states adding 500 MW of capacity. Texas alone could add 7 GW of capacity.
The most recent headline on the bill is that the US Senate has released their draft version of the document. The changes in the Senate version versus the House’s version include adding tracking manufacturers to incentivized hardware manufacturers list, as well, pulling the “Direct Pay” version of the 30% tax credit forward to projects installed in 2022 for residential customers — matching business projects.
The 10 year, 30% Tax Credit extension along with the “Production Tax Credit” for large scale projects are expected to greatly increase capacity.
Some projections even suggest that capacity in 2022 might slow a bit because the pressure to complete projects before 2023, when the prior tax credit would have expired, is no longer there.
