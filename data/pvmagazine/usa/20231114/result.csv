The facility includes 500 MWac of solar and 250 MW / 1 GWh of co-located battery energy storage. The project, among the largest solar facilities in the United States, is large enough to provide power for over 207,000 homes per year.
In-line with Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) priorities of using domestic content in solar projects, the Oberon project consists of First Solar modules from Ohio, NX Horizon trackers from U.S.-based Nextracker, and U.S.-made structural steel. The energy storage is comprised of batteries from Tesla’s battery facility in Lathrop, California.
More than 900 skilled union jobs were created at peak construction. Intersect hired labor from California’s LiUNA Local 1184, IBEW Local 440 and others, prioritizing local area hires.
“[The project is] a case study in how the clean energy industry can maximize project benefits by prioritizing domestic supply chains and union labor to ensure the rewards of the clean energy transition are felt by all Americans,” said Intersect Power chief executive officer, Sheldon Kimber. “This project demonstrates that Intersect continues to pioneer procurement standards for our industry that live up to the vision of the IRA and deliver transformative clean energy projects that move the needle on the deep decarbonization of our economy.”
The Oberon project is also the first to achieve operations through a streamlined Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan. Over 10 million acres of conservation and recreation lands were designated as part of the plan, while also designating Development Focus Areas for renewable energy. The plan resulted from six years of collaboration between the federal government, conservation groups, Native American tribes, the renewable energy industry, utilities, and members of the public.
Energy, Renewable Energy Credits and Resource Adequacy generated by the Oberon project will be purchased by a combination of offtakers including Calpine Energy Solutions, Constellation, Ava Community Energy (formerly East Bay Community Energy), Microsoft, and San Diego Community Power.
The portfolio term debt was provided by certain funds and accounts managed by HPS Investment Partners, and other co-investors.

France’s Eiffage, the U.S.’ First Solar, and India’s Sterling & Wilson complete the top five, respectively.

Wiki-Solar highlights that all the top 35 companies they track have more than 1 GWac of solar installation experience, with 20 exceeding 2 GW. The resurgence of solar across Europe has propelled contractors from Germany, Spain, and, surprisingly, France up the list. Despite France’s strong nuclear presence, which has kept it out of the top ten countries for solar, it boasts two EPCs in the top six.
As India, the world’s largest nation in population, broadens its solar initiatives, companies like Tata are climbing the ranks, joining compatriots Sterling and Wilson, Acme and Mahindra.
Wiki-Solar’s list of top EPCs indicates that these 35 contractors account for approximately 96 GWac of installed solar, about 18% of the global total. However, Wiki-Solar notes that the “EPC Contractor” field is available for only 30% of their projects.
The website also acknowledges historical underrepresentation of Chinese data, anticipating that Chinese companies will move up the list in future rankings. Currently, only one Chinese installation company features in the top twenty.
SOLV Energy, with over 224 projects totaling 12 GWac of installed capacity listed on Wiki-Solar, retains its number one ranking from January 2022. Since then, the company has added 2.4 GW of capacity across sixteen facilities.
Wiki-Solar tracks both the projects and locations of various companies. The accompanying map highlights SOLV Energy’s solar projects in the database.

In early 2022, SOLV Energy announced the commencement of a 1.3 GW Mammoth Solar facility project.
McCarthy Building, ranking second, has deployed over 5.4 GW of solar. The company recently started construction on projects totalling more than 1 GW in the U.S. Southwest. These include:
First Solar’s ranking on this list is based on its performance up to 2022. Because the company no longer operates as an EPC, its position on this list is a reflection of its historical contributions to the industry.
Recently, a new map tracking the majority of U.S.-based utility-scale solar power plants has been developed from government project databases. Named the U.S. Large-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database (USPVDB), it focuses on ground-mounted, front-of-the-meter projects that are 1 MWdc or larger.
This significant endeavor was a collaborative effort involving the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Energy Resources Program and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Energy Markets and Policy Department. Funding for the project was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technologies Office and the USGS Energy Resources Program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/14/long-duration-storage-and-renewables-can-cut-global-industrial-emissions-by-65/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"NOVEMBER 14, 2023",Long-duration storage and renewables can cut global industrial emissions by 65%,"Long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies, paired with renewables, could shrink global industrial greenhouse gas emissions by 65%, a new report from the LDES Council and Roland Berger has found. 
These technologies can be used to support firm, renewable electricity for off-grid applications, and can reduce the cost to decarbonize certain fossil fuel-powered industrial processes, according to the report. 
Long-duration energy storage is likely to be a key component of a highly-renewable grid, and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates the country could need between 225 GW and 460 GW of the resource to achieve a net-zero economy by 2050. The agency categorizes the technologies into four segments – up to four hours of storage, or short duration; inter-day, which provides 10 to 36 hours of storage; multi-day, which can extend to 160 hours; and seasonal shifting, which exceeds that. The LDES Council represents 70 members across 19 countries, and is focused on the acceleration of long-duration energy storage. 
Long-duration electric and thermal storage technologies can be used to “firm” wind and solar for off-grid use, meaning renewable energy can be used to decarbonize certain industrial processes currently powered by fossil fuels, the report said. The technologies are already economically attractive to allow off-grid facilities to switch from diesel to this firmed renewable energy – even without carbon incentives, according to the report
The report acknowledged that currently, there is very little deployment of long-duration storage technologies in hard-to-electrify sectors, like steel and cement. This is due to integration requirements for electric technologies to support high temperature, radiative heat needs in these industries, the authors said. 
However, these technologies “can already reduce emissions in these sectors by enabling those industrial users to take advantage of intermittent renewable generation for their round-the-clock electricity needs, and accessing CO2-free heat supply and recovery waste heat for lower temperature processes,” according to the report. 
Industrial carbon emissions comprise around a quarter of annual global greenhouse gasses, and are growing by 2% every year. In fact, the demand for industrial heat is expected to grow by 34% between 2019 and 2040. 
However, allowing these technologies to reach their full potential will require a series of policy interventions, including technology support, long-term market signals and revenue mechanisms. The first category could include things like grants and incentives, while the second would include things like carbon pricing, procurement targets for long-duration storage and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, the report said.
And then once you have long-duration resources on the grid, or they’re going to be on the grid imminently, the question is “how do you make sure that they’re compensated, and how do you make sure that the value that they bring to the grid is recognized?” said Gabe Murtaugh, director of markets and technology with the council. 
These could include measures like long-term bilateral contracts for balancing or ancillary services, or building out capacity markets, according to the report.
“Obviously this is a very high-level list – the devil tends to be in the details on some of these, and there are a lot of efforts the LDES Council is working on…” said Murtaugh.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/14/vppas-help-paper-and-packaging-company-demonstrate-environmental-commitment/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 14, 2023",VPPAs help paper and packaging company demonstrate environmental commitment,"WestRock, a company committed to sustainable packaging, is going a step further in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by entering into two virtual power plant agreements (VPPA) with Engie North America.
WestRock has been demonstratong its environmental stewardship in several ways. The company developed new technologies and partnerships to replace plastic with fiber-based materials and it has partnered with customers on recycling initiatives. The company also practices sustainable forestry, water stewardship and is actively working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
With a target of reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 27.5% (from 2019 levels) by 2030, WestRock achieved a 5.6% reduction last year. The company also intends to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 27.5% from 2019 levels, which includes fuel use and energy consumption, transportation and more. To this end, WestRock has signed the two VPPAs for clean energy generated from the two Texas facilities.
The VPPAs support the Bernard Creek solar project in Wharton County, Texas and Chillingham Solar in Bell County, Texas. Schneider Electric, which integrates process and energy technologies, end-point to cloud connecting products, controls, software and services,  provided advisory services and strategy management for the agreements.
WestRock will contract 207 MW from Bernard Creek, a 230 MW solar project that is expected to have an annual output of approximately 500 GWh. The project, slated for completion in the first half of 2024, is expected to generate more than $45 million in revenue for Wharton County over its lifespan and to create more than 250 jobs during construction.
From the 350 MW Chillingham Solar project, WestRock will contract 75 MW or an annual share of approximately 200,000 MWh per year. The Chillingham project, expected to be complete in 2023, will help support two local school districts with an estimated $70 million in revenue generated over the life of the project, of which $53 million will be paid directly to the school districts.
“We are delighted that Bernard Creek and Chillingham Solar will support WestRock’s ambitions to meet their 2030 science-based targets,” said Dave Carroll, chief renewables officer and country manager, Engie North America.
Engie North America Inc., based in Houston, Texas, is a regional hub of Engie, a global corporation focused on low-carbon energy and services. Engie’s total corporate PPA portfolio in the U.S. reportedly exceeds 7 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/14/california-aims-to-absorb-renewable-generation-with-flexible-demand-appliances/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 14, 2023",California aims to absorb renewable generation with flexible demand appliances,"New flexible demand appliance standards are “coming down the road” in California for water heaters, behind-the-meter batteries and electric vehicle chargers, said California Energy Commission (CEC) Commissioner Andrew McAllister at a CalFlexHub symposium.
CalFlexHub is a proving ground for flexible load technologies at Berkeley Lab, funded by the CEC, that is evaluating 12 technologies for flexible demand, in collaboration with manufacturers.
After setting flexible demand appliance standards for pool controls last month, the CEC expects to open a dialogue on a new appliance category every six months, said a spokesperson.
McAllister expects that a rulemaking for electric water heaters will be “in full swing” by late 2024. Ten of the largest heat pump manufacturers have committed to help California reach its goal of 6 million heat pumps for water or space heating by 2030, he said.
California’s standards for pool controls, which McAllister said have created a template for future standards, will require new equipment to default to flexible demand, yet allow the customer to override that setting. Maintaining the default flexible demand setting will save customers money on their electric bills, as the appliance will operate more often on lower-cost renewable generation.
Mary Ann Piette, who leads CalFlexHub, said one concern is whether that lower cost of operation will motivate adoption of flexible demand appliances. She suggested that adding an emergency demand response capability with customer compensation would “provide the most value.”
Piette said “We believe that flexible load in many cases will be more cost-effective than installing a battery.” She also noted that CalFlexHub is exploring heat pumps with thermal storage.
As the CEC sets standards for appliances that can respond to flexible rates—such as lower rates when renewable generation is high—the California Public Utilities Commission is working with the state’s utilities to develop flexible rates. The CPUC aims for the state’s investor-owned utilities to offer hourly marginal cost-based rates and programs by January 2027, according to a slide that McAllister presented.
McAllister said that for California to reach its goal of 7 GW of load flexibility, the state aims to combine 3 GW of price-responsive demand from appliances with 4 GW of traditional demand response, in which some customers “drop load” during the 100 highest-demand hours of the year.
Global interest
“People are so excited globally about what we’re doing with load flex,” McAllister said. “I mean, the word is out, and the light bulb goes on.” People decide, he said, “Of course we’re doing that; that makes sense, and we really want to learn from what California is doing.”
The CEC foresees a future that goes beyond flexible demand to “transactive energy.” While flexible demand involves one-way communication of rates from utilities, through a state database known as MIDAS, to appliances, transactive energy would involve appliances with two-way communication capability, enabling electric vehicles, for example, to send energy stored in the battery back to the grid.
Noting that California’s grid is set to become carbon-free by 2045, McAllister said that in the near term, “load flex is going to help decarbonize,” and over the long term, “load flex is going to help us optimally run the grid when it is 100% carbon-free.”
California’s work on flexible rates builds on analytical support provided by a white paper by the CPUC energy division staff and an analysis of potential cost savings from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
Recordings and slides from the CalFlexHub symposium are expected to be made available later this month, said a Berkeley Lab spokesperson.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/14/compliance-achieved-trina-module-imports-meet-uflpa-ad-cvd-requirements/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 14, 2023","Compliance achieved: Trina module imports meet UFLPA, AD/CVD requirements","The US Department of Commerce’s (DOC) final determination on Anti-Dumping and Anti-Circumvention (AD/CVD) duties and the US Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA) have stirred uncertainty in the solar industry.
Trina Solar says the company has taken steps over the past several years to prevent forced labor in its supply chain and to ensure that modules imported into the US comply with the country’s regulations.
The DOC’s 2012 ruling exempted modules produced outside China, provided they incorporated cells made outside of China. However, the recent DOC ruling extended AD/CVD rates to modules from other Southeast Asian countries. Although this change conflicts with the previous definition of “substantive transformation,” Trina Solar says it has already diversified its supply chain to mitigate these challenges.
According to the company, it expanded its operations to comply with regulations before the DOC’s recent determination. The company opened a 6.5 GW wafer facility in Vietnam and has used non-Chinese polysilicon for all modules imported into the US market since 2021. By using polysilicon sourced from the United States and Europe and by manufacturing wafers, cells, and modules in Southeast Asia, Trina Solar has established a fully independent supply chain outside China to meet US market requirements.
In 2022, Trina Solar expanded its compliance infrastructure to trace materials upstream to mining activities. This expansion reflects the company’s dedication to preventing the use of materials associated with forced labor allegations.
The manufacturer has also secured the capability to procure 4-of-6 Bill of Materials (BOM) listed by the DOC for its modules outside of China, which further ensures compliance with US regulations.
Trina Solar emphasizes it has been sourcing 100% of the polysilicon used in its US modules from well-respected United States and European partners since 2021. It took this step as a proactive measure to ensure ethical sourcing practices and to prevent the inclusion of conflict minerals, aligning with the UFLPA.
Trina Solar established an advanced traceability infrastructure and rapid response system that enables efficient response to CBP compliance requests, providing detailed documentation.
In a time of regulatory uncertainty, Trina Solar offers a model for ethical and compliant supply chain practices in the solar industry. Its proactive approach and commitment to sustainability demonstrates that it is possible to navigate the challenging regulatory landscape while upholding the highest ethical standards.
