The council said it plans to guide governments and grid operators on how LDES technologies will support decarbonization of the grid as the lowest-cost option to society.
Between 85 and 140 terawatt-hours of LDES deployment will be required to achieve a net-zero grid by 2040, according to the council’s upcoming November 23rd report. The council also estimates a need of 1 TWh of LDES deployment by 2025 to pace for decarbonization by 2040, as well.
The LDES Council comprises 24 tech companies, users, and investors.  Long-duration iron flow battery maker ESS Tech, Inc. CEO Eric Dressselhuys entered the council as a founding member.
These deployment projections would entail a $1.5 to $3 trillion investment. The council said renewable energy stored in these technologies could eliminate 1.5 to 2.3 Gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, or about 10-15% of global power emissions.
ESS is joined by members from Alfa Laval, BP, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Form Energy, Highview Power, Siemens Energy, and others. 
ESS batteries offer 4 to 12 hours of flexible energy storage for utility-scale and commercial applications. The battery chemistry employs earth-abundant materials like iron, salt, and water for the electrolyte.

Sponsored: Director, Utility Scale Solar Development, New York, New York 
Wou will manage and oversee the Company’s greenfield development portfolio of primarily utility-scale solar and energy storage projects. The VP will have full P&L responsibility for the Company’s greenfield development pipeline and will be responsible for day-to-day aspects of the project development process including: site acquisition, local stakeholder engagement, permitting, transmission/interconnection, power marketing, and project monetization / financing. Reporting to the Chief Commercial Officer, he/she will directly manage and lead the existing development team, provide strategic direction, set development goals and budgets, and continue to build and grow the team to support the growth targets of the Company.
The VP will be expected to oversee the greenfield development pipeline with minimal oversight and ensure that projects are developed in a manner that minimizes risk, maximizes the Company’s returns, and will complete financing due diligence processes. The Company’s greenfield development business has demonstrated significant success to date, and we are seeking a dynamic and experienced development leader who can help us build upon our prior success to grow the business. To that end, the right candidate has strong fundamentals in all aspects of the project development process, is comfortable making good decisions with limited information, thinks several steps ahead, and is extremely driven to see projects to their successful completion.
The right candidate will be capable of implementing more organization and structure to support the growing business and team. Finally, it’s important that the VP rolls up his/her sleeves up and gets in the weeds with the development team – not just manages from afar. We expect the VP will be working collaboratively with developers on a regular basis to help them make decisions, plan ahead, and solve problems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/10/dc-solar-owner-sentenced-to-30-years-for-ponzi-scheme/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",TIM SYLVIA,"NOVEMBER 10, 2021",DC Solar owner sentenced to 30 years for Ponzi scheme,"Jeff Carpoff, a co-owner of DC Solar, who had previously pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in a Ponzi scheme that pulled in more than $900 million, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison by U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez.
According to court documents and the Department of Justice (DOJ), DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generator units – generators mounted on trailers – for seven years, while simultaneously carrying out accounting and lease revenue fraud using Ponzi-like circular payments. The trailers were promoted as having capability to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting events.
Carpoff and his co-conspirators misrepresented the market demand and third-party revenue leasing for their units, and used false financial statements and lease contracts to cover the inaccurate figures. The circular payment scheme began with Carpoff and others using new investor money to pay older investors the supposed lease revenue that they were expecting.
As DC Solar lost vast sums of money, DOJ outlines that Carpoff and other conspirators stopped building the units altogether, selling thousands of non-existent generators to investors. Furthermore, Carpoff and others made it appear that units existed in locations that they did not, swapped vehicle identification number stickers on units that had been built earlier, and attempted to deceive investors during equipment inspections. All told, DOJ outlines that at least half of the approximately 17,000 mobile solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by DC Solar never existed.
Carpoff and his associates were able to attract investors with the generous federal tax credits related to the mobile solar generator units. The company grew to secure NASCAR sponsorships, a luxury box for home games of the then-Oakland Raiders, and a private concert from Mr. Worldwide, Pitbull.

Among the investors was Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, which invested $340 million to garner federal tax benefits in tax-equity funds.
The scheme came crashing down in December 2018, when company headquarters were raided by the FBI.
In January 2019, DC Solar Solutions filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in an attempt to voluntarily reorganize. At the time, DC Solar’s parent company was claiming $1-10 billion in assets and minimal liabilities. However, in March, the case was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation.
That story concluded in May 2019, ending with the auction at the company’s Benicia, California headquarters of more than 16,000 Talesun and Renesola PV modules and 2,000 SMA inverters. The equipment was auctiioned as part of the company’s $50 million in abandoned solar hardware used in the firm’s trailer-mounted solar generator business.
According to DOJ:
“The forfeiture included seizing and auctioning 148 of the Carpoffs’ luxury and collector vehicles, including the 1978 Firebird previously owned by actor Burt Reynolds. This historical auction resulted in recouping approximately $8.233 million.”
“Jeff Carpoff orchestrated the largest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the Eastern District of California,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Talbert. “He claimed to be an innovator in alternative energy, but he was really just stealing money from investors and costing the American taxpayer hundreds of millions in tax credits. Today’s substantial sentence reflects the seriousness of the offense and provides just punishment. The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to protecting the public and promoting respect for the law.”
Paulette Carpoff and some of the other defendants, Robert A. Karmann, Ryan Guidry, and Alan Hansen, yet to be sentenced, face a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. Karmann, Guidry, and Hansen are scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 14, 2021. Paulette Carpoff is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 16, 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/10/competitive-power-ventures-acquires-460-mw-solar-portfolio/,"ACQUISITIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,ILLINOIS,KENTUCKY,MASSACHUSETTS,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 10, 2021",Competitive Power Ventures acquires 460 MW solar portfolio,"Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) acquired two solar projects from Belltown Power to the tune of 460 MW. The transaction includes the 360 MW Prairie Dock Solar project in Illinois, and the 100 MW Stonecrop Solar project in Kentucky.
CPV has roughly 3 GW of renewable energy projects under development. Prairie Dock and Stonecrop solar are expected to begin construction second half 2023.
Illinois, which the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports as having invested $1.5 billion in solar, has a cumulative installed capacity of less than 700 MW. The 360 MW Prairie Dock project would help the state take a step closer to its renewable portfolio standard that requires 25% renewable energy generation by 2025.
Kentucky has 64.4 MW of installed capacity, landing at 47th in SEIA’s state solar rankings. However, its growth projection of 815 MW over the next 5 years ranks 36th in the nation. SEIA reports a $125 million investment in solar in the state of Kentucky, a number that is likely to rise precipitously in the next several years.
Belltown is a solar developer working primarily in the PJM and ERCOT regions, starting operations in the USA in late 2016. The firm primarily operates greenfield development projects and typically advances its projects through notice to proceed and commercial operation date. The company has a track record of 14 transactions involving over 2.5 GW of generation and storage, and has a pipeline of 30+ projects totaling 5 GW or more, it said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/10/plus-power-lines-up-financing-for-565-mwh-storage-project/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HAWAII",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 10, 2021",Plus Power lines up financing for 565 MWh storage project,"Energy storage developer Plus Power said it closed a credit facility for its 185 MW/565 MWh Kapolei Energy Storage (KES) project, which is under contract with Hawaiian Electric.
Financing includes $188 million in non-recourse construction debt and $31 million in letters of credit. Mizuho Securities USA LLC and KeyBank led the financing, and were joined by Silicon Valley Bank and CoBank.
Plus Power said the financing serves as a “strong signal” of capital market support for standalone energy storage projects.
KES received approval from the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission in May, and construction is slated to start later this year.
The lithium-ion battery project will be located on eight acres in an industrial area, where it will interconnect with a Hawaiian Electric substation. The project will provide load shifting and fast-frequency response services to Hawaiian Electric, enhancing grid reliability and accelerating the integration of renewable energy. The project is planned to enter service in June 2022 in advance of the closing three months later of the island’s last coal-fired power plant, which is owned by AES.
The KES project is intended to have a lifespan of at least 20 years. The original battery systems are anticipated to operate for at least 15 years. As the original system degrades over time, plans call for KES to be augmented with supplemental battery storage units. At the end of the project’s operating life, KES is required to remove the battery system and restore the land to pre-existing conditions. Plans call for the system to be shipped off-island for recycling and salvage.
Utility regulators last spring backed off of several conditions they earlier had imposed on the energy storage project. Regulators had imposed operational and financial conditions that drew objections from Hawaiian Electric, which said that without changes it would have been “nearly impossible” for the project to move forward.
In their modified decision, regulators said they had voiced concerns about the BESS on several occasions, particularly when it came to the utility’s plans to charge the battery with fossil-fueled generation in both the short- and long-term, as well as the utility’s ability to deliver benefits to its customers.
