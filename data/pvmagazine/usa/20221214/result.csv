Either through buying or leasing a portion of an off-site solar project, customers typically receive a utility bill credit for the electricity generated by their share of the community solar system, similar to the way rooftop solar net billing works.
This class of solar projects is also hailed as an opportunity to ensure a more equitable energy transition. Residential rooftop solar has been historically adopted by higher-income customers, though that trend has been softening recently.
There are many reasons why one might invest in community solar instead of rooftop solar, including: 
Community solar differs from larger projects, often called utility-scale, which sell its power directly to the electric utility or to large corporate buyers.
The top three states projects for community solar in terms of project count are New York, Minnesota, and Massachusetts, each of which have diverse state incentive programs that have helped launch the market. The projects in these states average about 1.6 MW in capacity, according to a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
National Community Solar Partnership 
The Department of Energy (DOE) is promoting the buildout of community solar through the National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP). NCSP, along with the Biden administration, set a goal to achieve the equivalent of 5 million households subscribed to community solar projects by 2025, leading to $1 billion in bill savings based on an assumption of a 20% bill discount. 
The goal represents a 700% increase in total community solar deployment, growing from 3 GW in 2020 to 20 GW in 2025. NCSP works to achieve these goals through engaging stakeholders, providing technical assistance, and collaboration on addressing common development barriers through sharing resources and information. 
A full list of NCSP and affiliate resources can be found here. 
The NCSP is also working to meet the goals established in the Justice40 Initiative, which requires that 40% of overall benefits of targeted Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities.  
Justice40 primarily focuses on clean energy, energy efficiency, and Environmental Justice, and applies to over 145 DOE programs. Much of the $62 billion investment in DOE under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is allocated to Justice40. The initiative provides funding pathways for both non-competitive formula grants and competitive grant programs. 
The Disadvantaged Communities Reporter is an interactive mapping tool that allows developers to identify which communities qualify as Disadvantaged Communities. 
NCSP activities include: 
DOE and Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) is hosting the third NCSP Annual Summit on January 19, 2023, at the Bahia Resort Hotel in San Diego, California. There will also be a virtual option for attendees who cannot attend in person. A registration link is forthcoming, said DOE. Last year’s summit can be viewed in full here. 
The summit will be co-located and hosted in coordination with the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) and RE+ Events Community Solar Power Summit.

Fellow solar technology suppliers Enphase Energy and SolarEdge Technologies are also on the S&P 500 Index.
Inclusion in the S&P 500 index is given to U.S. companies with a minimum market capitalization of $8.2 billion. In addition to having liquid common shares, at least 50% of the company’s outstanding shares should be available for public trading and the company must be reporting positive earnings over its most recent quarter.
First Solar’s debut on the S&P 500 is effective December 19 and marks a cap to a momentous year in which the module manufacturer received close to 22 GW of domestic and international orders for modules, driven in part by the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In November, First Solar procured an additional 4.9 GW module order from power producer Intersect Power, bringing its sub-total with the customer to 7.3 GW.  Earlier that month, it selected Lawrence County, Alabama as the location for its fourth U.S. PV module manufacturing facility.
The Alabama factory is part of a previously announced investment in scaling First Solar’s American manufacturing footprint to over 10 GWDC by 2025, and is expected to create over 700 new direct jobs in the state. The southern facility represents $1.1 billion in new investments and is expected to have 3.5 GW of annual production capacity.
First Solar, founded in 1999, has had a manufacturing presence in Ohio since 2002 when it produced 1.5 MW of modules and employed 150 people. In 2019, First Solar commissioned a second U.S. factory, and just recently it announced that a third Ohio factory is under construction.
In November, First Solar signed a 4.9 GW module order with Intersect Power, which was announced shortly after the company received 2 GW module orders apiece from Swift Current Energy and Arevon Energy. Over the summer, First Solar signed orders with Silicon Ranch (700 MW), bringing its sub-total with the Shell-owned developer to 4 GW, as well as National Grid (2 GW), Azure Power (600 MW), Akuo Energy (500 MW), and Scout Clean Energy (378 MW).
First Solar modules utilize cadmium tellurium (CdTe) thin-film, which is primarily used in utility-scale projects. With the signing of the IRA legislation to boost America’s clean energy economy, coupled with the goal of attaining 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, there is a push for increasing U.S. manufacturing across the solar supply chain. First Solar intends to scale its U.S. manufacturing base in support of the effort to decarbonize the American economy and achieve self-sufficiency in reliable and competitive renewable energy technologies.
The company estimates that new investments in Alabama and Ohio of $1.3 billion will bring its total investment in U.S. manufacturing to over $4 billion.
In addition to its U.S. facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building its first new manufacturing facility in India, which is scheduled to begin operations in the second half of 2023.
First Solar common shares increased 36% from $118 on August 15, a day before the IRA was signed into law, to $160.25 per share in afternoon trading today, with a market cap of $17.07 billion. Peers Enphase and SolarEdge traded at $333 and $339.80 per share today, with $45.3 billion and $19 billion market caps respectively.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/14/solar-electric-camper-boat/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 14, 2022",Solar electric camper boat,"Swedish startup POL has announced the POL Lux, a solar electric catamaran camper boat that will start at $135,000. The 25-foot craft is designed for up to 13 passengers.
The catamaran design creates a canopy space for integrated PV. The boat can operate purely on solar power at a reduced speed of about 4 knots (4.6 miles per hour).
On a full charge of the 18 kWh battery, the craft can travel about 70 miles. The dual electric motors can propel the craft at a max speed of about 13 miles per hour, and cruising speed tops out at about 8 miles per hour. The company said the dual motors are much quieter than their gas-powered counterparts, making for a more serene nature exploration experience.
The eight foot wide POL Lux has a modular, adaptable design that can readily convert from a day-cruiser with ample seating to a tented, private area with multiple beds and a raised hammock. The boat also contains a large net that can be released out of the bow for passengers who want to lounge in the water.
The lightweight craft features a twin-hull design and large front and rear bumpers for safety. It is designed with a large overlapping deck with cork flooring and chamfered intersecting edges to frame out the living area.
“We created a flexible space, with modular components to allow for multiple configurations, encouraging you to use the space how you wish. Bring on board what you need, leave behind what you don’t,” said POL.
The boat is undergoing prototype testing this year, and the company is currently accepting waitlist applications to be first in line for the new technology when it is released.
Electric shipping
Electric boats are unconventional, but may serve a larger role than recreational vehicles like the POL Lux. Battery-powered electric boats are now being seriously considered for large-scale shipping.
Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have released a study which examines “the technical outlook, economic feasibility, and environmental impact of battery-electric containerships.”
Breaking from previous studies, the researchers have classified the volume of space housing the batteries as an opportunity cost, rather than a fixed technical constraint. After modeling a wide variety of containership sizes, as well as 13 major world trade routes, the research suggests that more than 40% of the world’s fleet of containerships could be electrified “cost-effectively and with current technology,” by the end of this decade.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/14/nanograf-to-produce-advanced-battery-materials-in-facility-near-chicago/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 14, 2022",NanoGraf to produce advanced battery materials in facility near Chicago,"NanoGraf plans to launch production of advanced silicon anode materials for the U.S. battery supply chain in 17,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Chicago. Production is set to begin in Q4 2023, with an expected phase one material production capacity of 35 tons per year, which is enough for 24 million battery cells. NanoGraf said it intends to ramp production to 1000 tons of material production per year by 2024.
In addition to the manufacturing facility, the company will use 2,500 square feet to support NanoGraf’s ongoing R&D, quality assurance, and quality control efforts, along with 3,500 square feet for office space. NanoGraf said it plans to double its current team by the end of 2023.
The U.S.-based company, a spinout of Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory, previously produced its silicon anode battery materials in Japan, but decided to its manufacturing in order to support the emerging U.S. battery supply chain. The proprietary silicon anode enables the world’s most energy-dense 18650 cell, the company reports.
“It is imperative to have a robust domestic supply chain for the battery industry, and as an American company we are thrilled to help lead the way with our new Chicago manufacturing facility,” said Dr. Francis Wang, CEO of NanoGraf. “In Illinois, we’re surrounded by civic and business leaders who are united to grow the battery supply chain and manufacturing industry here, and we’re confident that with this new facility we can both drive this industry forward and bring new jobs and opportunities to Chicago.”
Last year pv magazine usa interviewed Kurt “Chip” Breitenkamp, vice president of Business Development at NanoGraf, who offered insight into how the Biden administration might tackle the battery and storage challenge following its “Made in America” executive order signed. The order directs the federal government to replace its entire existing vehicle fleet with EVs.
“If we believe that electrification is going to be the future of the new green economy, we can’t be reliant on other countries,” said Breitenkamp. “I think we learned that lesson from fossil fuels over the last 50 years.”
He noted that at the time, domestic battery manufacturing was virtually non-existent. Making those batteries requires the supplies to go with them, and NanoGraf’s new production facility aims to help develop an American battery production supply chain.
The recent announcement comes on the heels of two major milestones for NanoGraf. In October of 2022, the company set the new industry benchmark for the most energy dense lithium-ion 18650 battery. The next-generation cell will increase the energy density of batteries by over 20%, considerably lightening the load for users. NanoGraf’s research was aided by funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, with the goal of developing a longer-lasting and potentially lighter per-cell lithium-ion battery, designed to provide U.S. military personnel with better portable power.
The new chemistry, however, has uses beyond military portable electronics. NanoGraf said the biggest opportunities for more energy-dense batteries lies with electric vehicles, as the cell technology could provide an immediate boost to vehicle range.
“Battery innovation in the Midwest is ramping up as the public sector implements policies that encourage its expansion here,” said Ralph Wise, advisory board member of NanoGraf. “We look forward to being a key part of this growth and delivering the world’s best battery performance in electric vehicles, military applications, consumer electronics, industrial equipment, and more.”

Held Tuesday in Albany, N.Y. NYSEIA’s executive director Zack Dufresne introduced the daily conference panel session audience with stats that the Empire State continues to lead the nation in community solar development, with a total installation rate of 693 MW of solar assets deployed in 2022.
Doreen Harris, president & chief executive officer of New York Research Development Authority (NYSERDA), the state’s energy development authority, echoed Dufresne’s statements on community solar and distributed generation progress, saying that the state has deployed 4.24 GW of cumulative solar installations, mostly due to the NY-Sun program and 13,000 solar energy jobs created to date.
Initiated in 2011 by then Governor Andrew Cuomo, NY-Sun is the Empire State’s platform for solar incentives and financing to make solar available to all residential homeowners, renters, and commercial businesses.
This week’s Solar Summit came close to the one-year anniversary of NYSERDA’s December 17, 2021 submission of Distributed Solar Roadmap in which the state has set a goal of deploying 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030 pursuant to PSC docket 21-E-0629.
Harris, Dufresne and other agency officials said concluding this year, the state is well on its way to surpassing 50% of its DG mandate in 2023.  The NY-Sun program is the framework for $4.4 billion in private investments and state funding to solar development in the upstate New York C&I (2.9 GW target) region, downstate Consolidated Edison service territory (300 MW) and various residential solar blocks (150 MW) around the state.
NYSERDA is submitting a final scoping plan on December 19 that outlines carbon reduction goals outlined for 2023 to 2030 under the state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which highlights the state’s net zero goals by 2030. The CLCPA encompasses not only clean energy mandates, but energy efficiency, water, infrastructure and other sustainable improvements.
Harris did not comment yet on whether the state’s agency will increase its 10 GW mandate if pace keeps up with utility-scale and community solar development.
The vibe in mid-December upstate New York with a crisp 15 degree air temperature walking into the Albany Capital Center was just that, crisp and slightly abuzz.  pv magazine USA crossed paths with commercial solar developers and lightweight solar racking producers from Buffalo, N.Y., to rooftop storage and solar canopy integrators from Brooklyn, N.Y. including NineDot Energy, Brooklyn Solar Canopy and Ecogy Energy.

Utility-developer partnerships unlock non-wire alternatives
A fireside chat between developer Nexamp and National Grid highlighted the importance of distributed generation partnerships between project development teams and local utilities.  In western New York, National Grid was faced with a difficult task of upgrading a few billion dollar capital cost power sub-station in a stranded region of aging 5 kV power stations.
Rather than commit to a multi-year and multi-billion dollar T&D upgrade, the utility partnered with developer Nexamp to unlock the knotted transmission capacity in Watertown, N.Y. with non-wire alternatives, or distributed generation.
In September, the companies announced plans to install an 8.4 MW solar project with 10 Tesla Megapack batteries providing 31 MWh of storage capacity, giving National Grid the ability to call on the system for up to 5.7 MW / 29 MWh up to 25 times per year from the panels or batteries.
Rob Ritchie, director of energy storage for Nexamp, said the utility was looking at a stranded grid asset with Watertown, N.Y., a mid-tier city whose population is just shy of 25,000 residents, located more than 3 miles from the Coffeen utility sub-station in question.
Nexamp found that a non-wire alternative project with solar-plus-storage would save time and money rather than rely on the prior approach of updating a sub-station and countless power lines and poles.
Tom Vaccaro, director of transmission for renewables at National Grid, said the London utility’s U.S. business applied a technique for fixing grid congestion that was used in the UK by National Grid’s Western Power Distribution  affiliate.
“Distributed generation is not an alternative, it’s a whole new asset category that does not require a 100-year power line and wires upgrade,” said Vaccaro. “It can no longer be a stranded asset. Now it can be changed every 15 years if needed with non-wire alternative solutions.”
Vaccaro said utility-developer partnerships and regular conversations with independent system operators is the quickest way to rapidly scale up distributed generation resources such as community solar and storage.
Nexamp has eight New York projects with approximately 80 MWh of power capacity, and the company recently announced it would build a Hawaiian community solar portfolio for Hawaiian Electric to provide community solar to local residents.

Community solar and energy equity
NYSERDA’s president Doreen Harris said while it should come as no surprise that New York continues to rank number one in overall community solar output, the state’s agencies have seen 1.6 GW of community solar generation made available to low-to-moderate (LMI) income households and building owners, previously an underserved demographic by energy standards.
Harris and other state legislators argued that the NY-Sun program in effect for over a decade and tools such as the NY Solar Mapping toolkit and website have made solar an easy addition to the state’s carbon emissions reduction goals.
Austin Perea, manager of New York policy and market development at retail energy provider Arcadia, said New York has deployed about 1.4 GW to 1.6 GW of community solar projects, while Arcadia itself provides power from about 500 MW of solar assets in New York.
“Nowhere else but New York does community solar exist as the centerpiece of climate change reduction goals,” Perea said during an afternoon panel titled, Community Solar – Energy Equity and Environmental Justice.
Noah Ginsburg, director of SolarOne, a New York City non-profit group providing clean energy training solutions, said an imbalance still exists between utilities and ratepayers in the state for community solar access to affordable energy.
Distributed generation and community solar should have set metrics between ratepayers and the utility, though Ginsburg said, “utilities are bad actors right now,” taking community solar generation and selling it at their higher retail energy rate.
While the Inflation Reduction Act allows for non-profits to participate in distributed generation, federal and state programs need to include an adder to deploy more private investments to enable more low-to-moderate income household participation in New York community solar, Ginsburg said.

Solar-plus-storage
Looking to 2023, much end of year buzz at the New York Solar Summit centered around the Energy Storage Roadmap, which is the NYSERDA’s revised framework of setting a multi-year target of deploying 6 GW of energy storage assets, which is double that of Governor Kathy Hochul’s initial 3 GW storage target.
Jon Carbajal, director of product development for NineDot Energy, said the ambitious 10 GW of solar and 6 GW of energy storage statewide goals are certainly attainable. The majority of new solar capacity will come from the upstate and Hudson Valley region with abundant land, and energy storage can be deployed on smaller tracts of land including in the metropolitan New York City region.
Carbajal said that urban project developers like NineDot have been able to deploy 5 MW worth of Tesla Megapack storage systems in 10,000 square feet, or 0.25 acre land plots in and around the New York City area.  That compares to an approximate 25 acres needed to install a comparable 5 MW solar array at an upstate community solar project, he said.
Developers NineDot, Urban Energy and Ecogy Energy have pointed to gains of downstate distributed generation from getting to know local stakeholders such as vacant building and lot owners, non-profit organizations such as churches and local representatives of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
In Long Island, Bob Boerner, manager of renewable energy for Public Service Enterprise Group – Long Island said thus far about 14% of the Long Island region’s load comes from rooftop solar and storage systems, while the utility has seen no trouble signing up residents in oversubscribed solar and storage blocks across the island.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/14/to-make-room-for-more-distributed-solar-and-storage-new-mexico-to-require-smart-inverters/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW MEXICO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"DECEMBER 14, 2022","To make room for more distributed solar and storage, New Mexico to require smart inverters","New Mexico will require smart inverters for new distributed solar and storage, joining several other states in doing so, starting next March.
The new requirement aims to help utilities meet rising customer demand to install rooftop solar and storage, as some utility circuits are considered “at saturation” and unable to accommodate new interconnections without significant upgrades and substantial costs, said the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, in its final order.
While the state’s largest utility, PNM, offers an online hosting capacity map showing which distribution circuits have room for rooftop solar, regulators said in their order that “what solar customers and developers saw most was a large sea of red of constrained areas, especially in areas that were fast growing and where customers desired rooftop solar.”
Requiring smart inverters can make room for more distributed solar and storage by helping control voltage on a distribution circuit. That makes some grid upgrades designed to control voltage unnecessary. California and Hawaii have required smart inverters for several years, with good results.
Enabling more distributed solar and storage is especially important in New Mexico, regulators said, due to the state’s recent Energy Transition Act, which calls for 50% renewable electricity by 2030, and its Community Solar Act. Together these laws “have set the state on a course to more effectively integrate distributed energy generation and storage,” they said.
Interconnecting storage
New Mexico regulators said they sided with distributed generation developers, not utilities, in choosing “a comprehensive revamp of the interconnection rule and screening processes” as proposed by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), “drawing in part on some provisions of IREC’s BATRIES report.”
An IREC statement says New Mexico’s new rules create “pathways that will make it easier” to interconnect distributed solar-plus-storage and standalone storage, as the rules now “recognize the concepts of ‘non-export’ and ‘limited-export’ projects,” and provide specific review processes for these cases. The rules also guide how to evaluate the potential impacts of “inadvertent export,” IREC said, which can occur while an export control device responds as on-site load drops off.
Several different technologies are available to control a project’s export, IREC said, and while they can be deployed on solar-only systems, they are “particularly valuable for systems with energy storage.” For example, when a solar system is coupled with energy storage, the system is “often designed such that the solar and storage will not export simultaneously.”
Until now, in New Mexico as in many other states, IREC said that “utilities would just study a project as though it exported all of its power to the grid,” even if it was designed to prevent that export.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/14/50-states-of-solar-incentives-louisiana/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,LOUISIANA",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 14, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Louisiana,"The pv magazine USA tour of solar incentives last stop was Arkansas, and now moves to Louisiana. The rate of solar in “the Pelican state” is paltry at best, although major installations are about to nearly triple the current rate of 200 MW of solar installed.
Ranked 38th in the nation, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Louisiana has a relatively low electricity rate, at 14.10 cents per kWh, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), up from 11.69 a year ago. Yet the states’ per capita energy consumption is the second highest in the nation due to energy-intensive chemical, petroleum and nature gas industries, plus it has a high demand for air conditions during its hot, humid summers. Louisiana is the third highest natural gas producer in the nation, according to the EIA, and the second largest natural gas consumer on a per capita basis, after Alaska, with natural gas accounting for 65% of the state’s electricity generation.
Louisiana has lagged behind in embracing solar energy to the point where solar provides just 0.0043% of the state’s electricity, or enough to power 20,352 homes, according to SEIA. However, there are currently several large utility-scale solar projects under construction including the Ventress Solar project, which will be the largest in the state at 345 MW. The Bayou Galion Solar Project is also under construction, and it will add another 98 MW.
Louisiana’s small-scale, customer-sited solar installations are growing at a slower rate, although they account for a larger share, about three-fifths of the state’s total solar power generation, according to the EIA.
No renewable portfolio standard
Louisiana is one of only 13 states in the United States that does not have a renewable portfolio standard (RPS). In 2010, the Louisiana Public Service Commission concluded, after a renewable energy pilot program, that the state did not need an RPS. Fortunately, the state has other policies to encourage the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency, including voluntary electric utility efficiency programs, energy standards for public buildings, net metering, property tax exemption, and home energy loans.

Net metering
Louisiana allows net metering for small-scale installations of up to 25 kW for residential systems and up to 300 kW for commercial and agricultural systems. Total consumer net metering capacity connected to the grid is limited to 0.5% of each utility’s monthly retail peak power demand load, and several large electric utilities in the state have already reached their net metering cap.
In 2019 the distributed generation rules were changed in Louisiana. Those who had distributed generation installed before December 31, 2019 were grandfathered for 15 years for their current net metering billing. These customers pay the retail rate for the difference between the electricity they purchase from the utility and the electricity they supply to the grid. Those residents with distributed generation installed after Dec. 31, 2019 are billed using a crediting mechanism known as two-channel billing. Each month those customers pay the applicable retail rate for electricity purchase from the utility and they receive the full retail value for that which they produce and use behind the meter at their home or business. Any surplus energy is credited on the customer’s bill at the current “avoided cost” rate.
Beginning in 2020, Louisiana’s Public Service Commission cut by two-thirds the rate that utilities have to pay new net metering customers for excess electricity they put on the grid from their rooftop solar panels.
Home energy loan program
Louisiana’s Home Energy Loan Program (HELP) offers low-interest home improvement loans to improve the energy efficiency of their home and/or to install solar. Loans are up to a maximum of $12,000, and participants must go through an underwriting process.
Property tax incentive and solar rights
The State of Louisiana exempts solar energy systems from being included in property assessments. The state also enacted solar rights legislation (HB 751) in 2010 that prohibits entities from restricting a property owner from installing solar generating equipment. This can include homeowners’ associations, however some exceptions include historic districts, historic preservation areas and certain landmarks.
New Orleans’ community solar
The City of New Orleans has its own citywide community solar program. In partnership with Madison Energy Investments. a developer and operator of distributed generation assets, the city will construct a series of solar gardens, which interested residents buy into and receive a credit on their electricity bills for their share of the power produced. The City of New Orleans holds approval rights over the locations to make sure they align with the city’s underserved neighborhoods. The city is also exploring city-owned sites such as rooftops and vacant land for developing the projects. Installations are capped at 2 MW in capacity and projects must have a minimum of three, 1kW subscribers.
Landmark installations
The LA3 West Baton Rouge Solar Facility in West Baton Rouge is currently the largest operating facility in the state. At 74.5 MW, the solar power plant produces enough electricity to power nearly 8,000 homes. Developed by DEPCOM, the project became operational in 2020 and is currently owned by Helios Infrastructure. The power from the ground-mounted project is sold through a power purchase agreement to Entergy Louisiana.
Corporate users in Louisiana include Brookfield Properties Retail, Walmart and Abita Brewing, with Brookfield’s 1.3 MW Mall of Louisiana solar project representing one of the largest corporate installations in the state.
These projects will soon be dwarfed, however, by the previously mentioned Ventress solar farm, which is currently being constructed by Lightsource bp and expected to be operational in 2023. The energy it generates will be sold to McDonald’s Corporation and eBay under long-term power purchase agreements. Ampirical Solutions, headquartered in Louisiana, has been selected as the EPC for the project substation and the switchyard. The project has created approximately 400 construction jobs and will provide an estimated $30 million dollar boost to Pointe Coupee Parish over the project lifetime.
“Beyond improving the health and energy security of communities across America, large-scale solar projects help strengthen local economies. As the owner and operator of the Ventress solar farm, we look forward to bringing economic benefits to Pointe Coupee Parish, along with fostering long-term community partnerships,” said Kevin Smith, CEO of the Americas, Lightsource bp.
