NREL has unveiled a new version of its Best Research-Cell Efficiency Chart. The tool highlights the highest confirmed conversion efficiencies of research cells for a range of PV technologies.
With the new interactive version, users can pull up decades of research data and compare custom charts that focus on specific technologies or time periods, NREL said in a statement. They can now find data on a cell’s current, voltage output, and fill factor, in addition to efficiency. The availability of those details will depend on the information in NREL’s records.
The highest research cell efficiency recorded in the chart is 47.1%, for a four-junction cell. Its interactive nature allows users to visualize the recent jump in conversion efficiencies for emerging technologies like perovskite solar cells. That contrasts with the steady improvement of silicon solar cell efficiency since the 1980s.
“It’s possible that the NREL efficiency chart is the most presented graph that you can find at the annual PV Specialists Conference and similar conferences,” said Sarah Kurtz, senior research fellow at NREL. “But it has gotten so full that it’s difficult to see the data. With the new interactive chart, researchers will be able to still use the data, but present it in a way that communicates better for their talk.”
The cell efficiencies are measured by independent testing centers, including NREL, before earning a spot on the chart. All of the figures are also available as a downloadable file.

The US Department of Homeland Security is funding the commonwealth of Puerto Rico’s EV Arc deployments under a general services administration contract, in which the federal contract can be made available to state and local entities.
“Governments and companies are becoming increasingly reliant on electricity for fuel as the adoption of EVs is rapidly accelerating, said Desmond Wheatly, chief executive officer of Beam Global.  “The increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters calls for heightened disaster preparedness. Beam products are designed and engineered to perform in extreme conditions.”
According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), grid outages have increased by 64% over the last decade, with 83% of grid outages caused by a weather event.
The most recent Hurricane Irma and Maria caused more than $130 billion in damage to Puerto Rico’s electric grid to fix and replace the island’s infrastructure, while many companies such as Beam, Sunrun and Sunnova Energy have provided solar and storage products to residents and government agencies across the island.
Beam’s EV Arc is a mobile and off-grid charging system comprised of a 4.3 kW solar module whose canopy measures 21 feet by 10.6 feet and provides up to 265 miles of AC powered charging range using J-1772 connections for most EV models. The battery can be installed in 22, 32 or 43 kWh power output configurations.
The system stands at 15.3 feet height and weighs in at just under 12,500 pounds, capable of withstanding winds of 120 miles per hour, and flood-proof to 9.5 feet.
In March, Beam acquired AllCell Technologies, allowing the EV charging systems integrator to source its own lithium-ion batteries internally from a producer of batteries from North America.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/22/oklahoma-utility-petitions-state-to-purchase-power-from-1-gw-solar-and-wind-portfolio/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,OKLAHOMA",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 22, 2022",Oklahoma utility petitions state to purchase power from 1 GW solar and wind portfolio,"The Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO), a subsidiary of investor-owned utility American Electric Power (AEP), petitioned the state’s corporate commission for approval to purchase power from a 995.5 MW solar and wind project portfolio. 
PSO named the portfolio the “Fuel-Free Power Plan,” a large set of projects that involve a total investment of $2.47 billion. It includes the 103 MW Chisholm Trail solar facility and 150 MW Algodon solar facility in Texas, as well as the 189 MW Pixley solar facility in Kansas, expected to come online in April 2025. The portfolio also includes three large-scale wind facilities. 
The utility said the plan will lessen reliance on natural gas resources, shielding customers from volatile prices and cutting emissions. It is also designed to help meet increasing demand as required by the Southwest Power Pool. 
All facilities are expected to reach operation by the end of 2025. PSO said the massive buildout will lead to an average monthly bill cost increase of $3.48 per month, a modest increase and more stable than what is expected from volatile natural gas prices. 
Currently, PSO operates 3.8 GW of generation capacity, with aims to reach 50% renewable energy by 2032. 
“At PSO we understand the importance of providing affordable service and through this plan, we are excited to keep delivering on that commitment to our customers,” said Leigh Anne Strahler, president and chief operating officer of PSO . “This investment in fuel-free power is another step in our efforts to shield our customers against high costs while meeting their energy needs.” 
The projects are set to significantly boost Oklahoma’s total solar generation capacity, a welcome sign for a state with high solar irradiance. Through Q2 2022, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that Oklahoma has 100 MW of solar deployed, ranking it in the bottom five states in the nation.
The state houses 26 solar companies, including three manufacturers, 12 installers/developers, and 11 others, employing 868 people. SEIA reports that $189 million has been invested in solar in the state, so the Fuel-Free Power Plan may mark the birth of a new era of solar in Oklahoma.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/22/building-renewables-emits-carbon-building-them-faster-emits-far-less/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 22, 2022","Building renewables emits carbon, building them faster emits far less","Though it costs no emissions to harvest sunlight or wind, to build clean energy components costs carbon emissions. Research published by Columbia University Climate School’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory made an attempt to trace just how much carbon the world may emit as it mines, manufactures, transports, constructs, and maintains solar and wind resources.
The report concludes that emissions expected as a result of building the energy transition are non-negligible, but there is a positive feedback loop where the faster we build, the less emissions will result. Having non-emitting power on-hand to build more renewable energy resources will only lower the embodied emissions and stem the tide of climate change more rapidly. The findings were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The amount of emissions tied to an electricity generating facility from raw materials to operations is often referred to as a “carbon backpack.” 
The current pace of renewables buildout is currently predicted to lead to about 2.7 degrees C temperature increase by 2100, leading to 185 billion tons of carbon backpack. This is equivalent to about five or six years of global emissions at current rates. 
The backpack is lighter with a more aggressive path. If humanity is to build infrastructure fast enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees C, which international agreements aiming to come under the 2 degree mark, the carbon backpack would be cut nearly in half to 95 billion tons by 2100. If the energy transition exceeds all expectations and we limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C, the carbon backpack would be more of a handbag – amounting to 20 billion tons by 2100, or about six months of current global emissions.
“The message is that it is going to take energy to rebuild the global energy system, and we need to account for that,” said Lesk. “Any way you do it, it’s not negligible. But the more you can initially bring on renewables, the more you can power the transition with renewables.”
Lesk and his cohort of researchers point out that these are likely conservative estimates. The study includes generation-side emissions, and omits the cost of deploying energy storage and transmission. Distributed energy resources require much less of this type of infrastructure than centralized power, so the profile of solar and wind projects will impact this outcome greatly.
The study also modeled carbon emissions from adapting to sea-level rise. It found that construction of sea walls and moving cities inland where necessary would generate 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2100 under the 2 degree C scenario. More energy will need to be expended to control inland flooding, irrigation in areas that might become drier, and adapting buildings to higher temperature extremes.
Lesk remains optimistic. He said that given cost decreases in recent years for renewable technologies, 80% to 90% of what the world needs could be installed in the next few decades, especially if current subsidies for fossil-fuel production are diverted to renewables.
This global clean energy transition is estimated to cost $3.5 trillion per year every year through 2050 in order to reach net-zero emissions, according to one study, or up to about $14 trillion for the United States alone in the same timeframe, according to another.
“Despite these limitations, we conclude that the magnitude of CO2 emissions embedded in the broader climate transition are of geophysical and policy relevance,” wrote the authors. “Transition emissions can be greatly reduced under faster-paced decarbonization, lending new urgency to policy progress on rapid renewable energy deployment.”
The study’s author Corey Lesk is a postdoctoral fellow in the Neukom Institute and Department of Geography at Dartmouth College. Previously he was a graduate student at Columbia Climate School’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
The study was made in cooperation with Denes Csala of the United Kingdom’s University of Lancaster; Robin Krekeler and Antoine Levesque of Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research; Sgouris Sgouridis of the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority; Katharine Mach of the University of Miami; Daniel Horen Greenford and H. Damon Matthews of Canada’s Concordia University; and Radley Horton of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/22/swell-energy-raises-120-million-to-expand-deployment-of-virtual-power-plants/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 22, 2022",Swell Energy raises $120 million to expand deployment of virtual power plants,"Swell Energy announced today that it has raised $120 million to further expand its virtual power plant (VPP) programs. The round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Greenbacker Development Opportunities Fund I, LP, with participation from Ares Management Infrastructure Opportunities Fund.
Santa Monica, California-based Swell is developing 350 MWh of VPPs that leverage 16,000 battery storage systems located at homes and businesses.  The company provide a variety of grid service capabilities in territories including Hawaii, California and New York.
The company said that VC funding will support existing VPP development and the deployment of an additional 200 MWh of contracted capacity through approximately 10,000 energy storage systems that will integrate into new VPPs across the United States.
Swell creates VPPs by linking utilities, customers, and third-party service providers together and aggregating distributed energy resources. In particular, working with utilities to compensate customers for operating their batteries for savings and security helps create a cohesive network of solar-powered batteries that supports overall grid reliability, stability and sustainability.
As explained in a recent article by Jigar Shah, director of the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, a VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar, energy storage, electric vehicles chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances). The benefits of VPPS is more than just providing decarbonization and grid services. VPPs offer grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. Shah noted that by deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants.
VPPs are relatively new in the United States, having been established in 2020 under FERC Order 2222, which opened the door for VPPs in the United States. “To truly unlock VPP’s potential, wide reaching deployment at the national scale is needed,” said Shah.
“Swell’s business model is an innovative application of existing technology directly solving two large issues plaguing the grid and renewable energy adoption: transmission and load shifting,” said Ben Baker, Managing Director and Principal of Greenbacker Development Opportunities Fund. “We couldn’t be more pleased to partner with Swell, its impressive management team, and the existing investor base. The company’s three business verticals—Grid Services, Finance, Development—are mutually beneficial, and together will swiftly expand the proliferation of renewable resiliency, providing value to both customers and utilities.”
Swell is also pursuing development in underserved markets where critical grid services are necessary to strengthen and modernize infrastructure. For example, in New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and key western and southern states, local grids must evolve to accommodate more renewable energy and electric vehicle adoption. VPP programs can help provide grid flexibility without forcing utilities to invest in new fossil fuel generation.
“Swell is at the forefront of executing on the promise of virtual power plants, which we believe can be one of the most important and necessary advancements in smart grid service technologies available,” said Keith Derman, Partner and Co-Head of the Ares Infrastructure Opportunities strategy. “Ares has been working with Swell since its Series A raise in 2019, and we are excited to continue building upon that relationship with this follow-on investment.”
Swell is working with multiple California utilities to help expand residential participation in capacity bidding programs. Through a VPP, homeowners with solar and energy storage systems support the reliability of their local grids while reserving battery power for personal emergency use. The efforts are part of the California Public Utility Commission’s goals to reduce the state’s load during California Independent System Operator emergency power events.
Formed in 2014, Swell Energy has raised $582 million in funding to date and counts CIT Group, For Good Ventures, Aligned Climate Capital and Third Sphere as investors in the VPP business.
