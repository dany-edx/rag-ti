Governor Kathy Hochul announced that New York is leading the consortium, which includes states along the I-95 corridor, a critical step in implementing the New York governor’s directive in her 2022 State of the State address to make New York State a green hydrogen hub. The announcement also supports New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 85% by 2050. Today’s announcement is
“New York is proud to lead the way in forming bold partnerships to combat the existential threat of climate change,” Governor Hochul said. “Expanding the hydrogen market is critical to New York’s aggressive pursuit of clean-energy alternatives that will supercharge our economy and advance our climate goals.”
Consortium partners have committed to collaborate with NYSERDA, NYPA, and ESD on proposal development to advance hydrogen projects. They will also coordinate with their respective state entities to help align the consortium’s efforts with each state’s climate and clean energy goals. These include Connecticut’s Global Warming Solutions Act goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050, Massachusetts’ goal to be carbon neutral by 2050 and New Jersey’s Global Warming Response Act goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050.
The Department of Energy has $8 billion of funding available, expected to launch in May 2022, and the consortium plans to develop a proposal in response.
“With our partners, New York State is positioning the region as a leader in the development of green hydrogen with a vision for how to provide a significant part of the national hydrogen infrastructure network while delivering benefits to vulnerable and disadvantaged communities by displacing local fossil fuel generation and creating clean energy job opportunities,” said NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris.
In addition to the states of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, the partners include:
With the execution of these agreements, the partners will work together to:
One of the business partners is Next Hydrogen Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Next Hydrogen Solutions, an Ontario-based designer and manufacturer of hydrogen electrolyzers.
“We are joining an impressive group of industry leaders to evaluate and develop this hydrogen hub proposal with the shared goal of facilitating the development of resilient clean energy infrastructure in the United States,” said Raveel Afzaal, President and CEO of Next Hydrogen.
The consortium continues to seek additional public and private partners in the region and focus on coordinating the regional fuel cell innovation ecosystem. The coalition will seek to integrate offshore wind and solar PV into hydrogen production and deploy hydrogen for use in transportation, including for medium and heavy- duty vehicles, heavy industry, power generation and maritime applications or other appropriate uses consistent with decarbonization efforts.
Future consortium partners may include utilities, electrolyzer suppliers, fuel cell solution providers, transportation, fueling infrastructure and industrial partners, government agencies, community organizations, institutes of higher education, community colleges, vocational schools and non-profit organizations.

One such alternative is the sodium-ion battery.
When cycled at a high voltage around 4.5V, sodium-ion batteries can significantly increase their energy density. However, rapid degradation in charge-discharge cycles have barred sodium-ion batteries from reaching commercialization.
Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory discovered an effect in the creation of the cathode material that may lead to improvements in battery resiliency. It was found that during the rapid cooling process in the creation of the cathode, a “structural earthquake” occurs, which disrupts the atomic makeup of the material. During rapid cooling in cathode synthesis, the particle surface became rough, and large areas showed strain on the material. The effect was also found when cycling the cathode at high temperatures above 130 degrees Fahrenheit or when performing fast-charging of one hour versus a ten-hour charge cycle.
With the knowledge of this structure-damaging event, cathode makers can now adjust synthesis conditions to create a purer cathode that is better able to pair the anode material. Earlier research by the team also led to an improved anode, and the team expects pairing the two will have dramatic effects.
“Now, we should be able to match our improved cathode with the anode to attain a 20% – 40% increase in performance,” said Guiliang Xu, assistant chemist in Argonne’s chemical sciences and engineering division.  “Also important, such batteries will maintain that performance with long-term cycling at high voltage.”
The results were published in Nature Communications. The Argonne team said the findings could result in a longer range and more affordable electric vehicles, and low-cost energy storage for the grid.
“Seeing is believing,” said Yuzi Liu, a CNM nanoscientist.  “With Argonne’s world-class scientific facilities, we do not have to guess what is happening during the synthesis.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/25/federal-budget-includes-500-million-for-promoting-energy-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 25, 2022",Federal budget includes $500 million for promoting energy storage,"Senator Susan Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, announced that the 2022 omnibus spending bill, which passed earlier in the month, contains $500 million in funding to support the development of energy storage technology.
The funding, which is available for energy storage activities authorized under the Better Energy Storage Technology (BEST) Act, is set to be divided across divided across five government agencies:
The BEST Act aims to increase the affordability of energy storage and related technologies by supporting Department of Energy (DOE) research, planning and technical assistance, and demonstration and pilot projects.
“Energy storage technology holds great promise in our efforts to combat climate change,” said Senator Collins. “By strengthening current technology and advancing next-generation energy storage, we can integrate more renewables, such as wind and solar, which in turn will help to reduce emissions.”
Recognizing the significant cost declines and subsequent increase in economic viability that solar and wind have seen in the last decade, the Federal Government has made a concerted effort as of late to realize the same cost declines in storage, which will only serve to bolster the efficacy of all renewable generation sources.
In July 2021, DOE set a goal to reduce the cost of grid-scale, long duration energy storage by 90% within the decade, as part of its Energy Earthshot Initiative. I’m announcing that goal, DOE also shared that increased federal funding would be needed to make this goal a reality. Both the Energy Earthshot Initiative and the funding initiatives enabled by today’s announcement will consider all types of technologies, including electrochemical, mechanical, thermal, chemical carriers, or any combination with the potential to meet duration and cost targets for grid flexibility.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/25/solar-starts-strong-growing-40-year-over-year-in-january/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 25, 2022","Solar starts strong, growing 40% year over year in January","Solar PV reached new heights through 2021, with top line estimates pegging total global deployment at the inspiring milestone of 1TW of installed active capacity on the planet. In January 2022, the United States made its latest contribution by bringing 22 projects to commercial operation, adding 952MW of capacity.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its January Electric Power Monthly update. For the month, solar photovoltaics generated 8GWh, which represented 2% of total (utility scale) electricity generated for the month in the United States. Impressively, January’s generation increased nearly 40% year-over-year. When including estimates for small-scale solar, EIA reported the United States generated 11.17GWh of solar photovoltaic energy, up from 8.47GWh in the previous year, or a 33.5% increase.
The three largest projects added in January were Fort Powhatan Solar in Virginia, with a nameplate capacity of 150MW, followed by Searcy Solar in Arkansas with 100MW, and Assembly Solar III in Michigan, clocking in at 79MW nameplate capacity.
Renewable vs. sustainable 
Renewable energy, including solar PV, solar thermal, wind, biomass, geothermal, and conventional hydroelectric power combined for a total generation of 79.29GWh.
A distinction should be made between “renewable” and “sustainable” energy. Johns Hopkins University describes renewable energy as something that comes from sources that naturally renew themselves to meet our energy needs. This can include such technologies as biomass, hydropower, etc. “Sustainable” energy is defined as energy that can support both the current generation as well as future generations. John Hopkins considers solar and wind as primary sources of sustainable energy.
While hydropower is the chief source of “renewable” energy on the planet and mitigates carbon emissions onset by fossil fuel generation, its sustainability has come under question. Hydropower does not directly pollute, but its facilities have large environmental impacts by changing the environment and affecting land use, homes, and natural habitats in the dam area.
The climate is posing risks to the generative capability of hydropower, too. Take Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona, for example. The dam, which has a capacity of 1.32GW and serves over 5 million customers, has reached alarming low levels of water caused by human activity and the most extreme drought in 1,200 years. Water levels are so low, that they threaten to fall below the intake for the turbines that generate energy for millions of Arizonans and five tribal communities.
Excluding hydropower, solar PV and wind led the way for sustainable energy, contributing a combined 46.2GWh. Currently, the hot topic in Texas is whether solar and wind can now replace coal. In the rapidly drying Western states that rely on a good deal of hydroelectric power, the conversation may turn to finding how much solar and wind energy is needed to replace the dams.
A year of challenges
Solar PV has reached new heights in the face of a year of challenges. In the residential and commercial sectors, major markets like California and Florida waged battles in an attempt to preserve net metering, a policy in which utilities pay solar customers for sending their excess solar generation to the grid. In Florida, a bill has been passed that will phase out net metering, and in California, the heavily-criticized net metering 3.0 bill has been delayed indefinitely.
At the utility- scale costs rose significantly in 2021, with SolRiver Capital managing partner Brandon Conard telling pv magazine that bifacial modules shipped-to-site costs rose from $0.28/W to $0.42/W from 2020 to late 2021. Conard said he expects price pressures to alleviate by the end of this year.
Conard said that legislation like the Biden administration’s Build Back Better Act would have gone a long way to spurring even higher record deployment numbers, but that has been shelved. In December, Senator Joe Manchin pulled out his must-have vote, and Republican Senators voted unanimously against the bill that was designed to prepare the United States for the climate and energy profile of the future.
Multiple anti-dumping and anti-circumvention cases are another hampering force on the industry. Though solar reached new heights in January, major solar developer SOLV Energy CEO George Hershman told pv magazine that “deployment is frozen.” Hershman said the uncertainty caused by these tariffs is simply too much to digest in a utility-scale solar project, where module prices can account for 50% of the cost or more. SOLV‘s projects can exceed $300 million, so a 50-250% tariff would impose between $75 -$375 million in additional costs. This level of risk is untenable and is why Hershman describes the case as “an affront to the solar industry.”
Despite all of these hurdles, the solar PV train keeps rolling. The White House calls for 100% carbon free electricity by 2030, at least half of which would be locally supplied clean energy meeting 24/7 demand. The nation has eight years to get there, and solar PV is positioned to be center-stage for the next decade of deployment.

The BTMS markets are expected to see strong growth, as noted in Wood Mackenzie’s Global Energy Storage Outlook, which forecasts 57GWh of new deployments through to 2030. The report points out that the residential sector is being driven by cost reductions and consumer awareness, coupled with solar hybridization and electric vehicle adoption.
Researchers in the BTMS Consortium at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) are working with other national laboratories to develop energy storage technologies for stationary applications below 10MWh. Their recent work, which aims to improve lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery designs is published in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, delved further into promising opportunities, as well as limitations, of using LTO/LMO battery cells for stationary storage use.
“We already know a lot about Lithium-ion batteries, but batteries for different applications have different requirements,” said NREL Researcher and Project Leader Yeyoung Ha. “Our research looks at how to leverage the developments from electric vehicle battery research for new applications in stationary storage.”
According to the researchers, BTMS systems have different charging and discharging patterns than a typical electric vehicle and require Li-ion battery materials that meet these unique priorities. BTMS systems, for example, are expected to operate safely and efficiently over a long lifespan. The researchers looked at Li-ion battery designs using a Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode and LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathode, which are promising critical-material-free candidates that offer the safety and long lifespan required, however, their low energy density is a drawback.
NREL researchers evaluated the temperature-dependent performance of LTO/LMO cells with various electrode loadings, and they determined that using thicker electrodes in battery designs can increase the cell capacity and energy density, while decreasing overall cell costs. However, these thicker electrodes require ions to travel a longer path, limiting the use of electrodes. They found that temperature adjustments can alleviate these negative impacts but may introduce added complications.
“Our goal with this research is to identify a ‘sweet spot’ to leverage the advantages of electrode loading and increased temperatures to maximize the performance of LTO/LMO battery cells,” Ha said. “Our research refined material designs for BTMS specifically, converting this well-known power chemistry to energy cells.”
By applying electrochemical modeling to simulate reactions at different temperatures and electrode thickness, they verified their experimental results. Instead fully discharging the batteries, as for electric vehicles, they found that allowing batteries to have intermittent rest during discharge, the electrode use was significantly improved. And they determined that this type of pulsed discharge is well suited for BTMS stationary applications, where the batteries will be used only when there is intermittent demand and then transitioned back to a resting stage.
Although these optimized LTO/LMO battery cells offer many advantages, the research team is also exploring cathode options that may better meet the needs of the stationary energy storage systems that are critical to ensuring that the power from renewable energy sources is available when and where it is needed.
