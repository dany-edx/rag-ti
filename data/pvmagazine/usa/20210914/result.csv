Terms were not disclosed.
The projects are the Maverick 6 Solar-plus-Storage Project, a 131 MWdc solar array coupled with a 50 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage system; and the Maverick 7 Solar Project, which has a capacity of 179 MWdc.
The projects use horizontal single-axis tracking technology and are located adjacent to one another, east of Los Angeles, in Riverside County. The projects are on federal lands within a Solar Energy Zone and Development Focus Area, managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Both projects are under construction with operations to start in December.
EDF Renewables North America has a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement with CleanPowerSF for output from the Maverick 6 project. CleanPowerSF is a not-for-profit program operated by San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC).
The transaction involving MEAG is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals. Macquarie Capital acted as exclusive financial advisors.
MEAG, acting on behalf of Munich Re, has more tF Renewables</ihan 1 GW of wind and solar assets under management in Europe and in the U.S. It said it plans to “substantially increase” its investments in the U.S. renewable energy space over the next years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/14/smud-proposal-would-cut-net-metering-credits-impose-interconnection-fees/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",TIM SYLVIA,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2021","SMUD proposal would cut net metering credits, impose interconnection fees","The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) Board of Directors plans to vote on a proposal to cut the credits that solar customers receive under net metering.
The utility currently has a range of solar compensation rates for customers, depending on the month and time of day. From June 1 – September 30, solar customers are credited anywhere between 12.77 cents per kWh  to 31.05 cents per kWh. During the rest of the year, customer credits range from 10.82 cent per kWh to 14.94 cents per kWh.
The SMUD board will vote on a proposal to set a flat rate of 7.4 cents per kWh. That rate would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2022 for new solar customers; for solar customers who increase their solar generation capacity by more than 1kW or 10%, whichever is higher; and for homeowners who buy a home with an already-installed system.
For legacy net metering customers, the new rates would be applied in January 2031. California has long guaranteed that solar users receive the same net metering credit for the lifetime of their solar system.
In addition to the reduced credits, the SMUD proposal also would allow virtual net energy metering. Through that tool, multi-tenant buildings that go solar would have available credits divided among each tenant’s electricity bill and on multifamily properties that are designated as low-income. Credits would not be extended to any other sort of multifamily property.
The proposal also would reinstate a provision under which a potential new solar system could only be sized for a home’s current energy usage, not for its projected future energy usage. That would mean customers looking to add, say, an EV + charger might need to retroactively upgrade their solar system, potentially at additional cost.
SMUD’s proposal also would place one-time interconnection fees on properties going solar. The proposal calls for fees of $475 for small (<10kW) solar systems on homes, $900 for large (>10kW) solar systems on homes, and $2,500-$5,000 for solar systems for businesses and non-profits. Investor-owned utility PG&E’s interconnection fee, for reference, is $145.
To sweeten the deal, SMUD’s proposal also includes an incentive to get a solar-powered battery. The incentive amounts to at least $2,500 in the first year and declining annually for those who choose to opt into SMUD’s demand response and peak-shifting energy management programs. For people who choose not to join those programs, the incentive amounts to $500 with a similar annual step down.
In response to the proposal, solar customers and climate change activists plan to stage a protest on September 16 outside SMUD’s headquarters in Sacramento. The protest is being held at the same time as the meeting during which SMUD directors are expected to vote.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/14/solar-powered-ev-truck-charging-on-a-megawatt-scale-is-coming-to-california/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2021",Solar powered EV truck charging on a megawatt scale is coming to California,"WattEV was awarded a $5 million grant to support the buildout of a 12 electric truck, 4 MW charging station in Bakersfield, California, backed by an onsite solar plus storage facility. The grant is from the California Energy Commission, and will represent one of the state’s first solar-powered truck charging stops dedicated to heavy-duty electric trucks.
The facility will be supported by 5 MW of solar power plus second-life energy storage. As the site scales to as many as 40 charging stations, it will be upgraded to 25 MW of solar plus storage at the 110 acre site, with 40 MW of charging capacity.
Image: WattEV
The site will have light-duty, medium and heavy chargers with rates of 250 kW, 350 kW, and 1 MW capacities. The 1 MW chargers will deliver 320 miles of range to a Class 8, 80,000 pound truck in 30 minutes.
No hardware or design specifics were available on the solar or energy storage project.
Joining WattEV on the project are the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, the Central California Asthma Collaborative, Greenlots, and Power Electronics, among others.
In addition to the Bakersfield project, WattEV said it is in the planning stages for similar projects in San Bernardino and Gardena in Southern California. Both of those truck stops would serve the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach and the warehouses fed by goods coming through the ports.
To date, WattEV raised $6 million in private equity seed funding led by Canon Equity to enable these projects and support further expansion.
WattEV said it expects to break ground at the Bakersfield facility in October. The initial buildout will cost in excess of $10 million, an is expected to take two years to construct. Reaching the company’s goal of 40 charging stations is estimated to cost more than $30 million.
The company said it hopes to have 12,000 trucks under management by 2030, with 1 GW of charging capacity. Recently, it signed a deal with Volvo for six VNR Electric Class 8 trucks. The VNR has a 264-kWh lithium-ion battery, which charges up to 80% within 70 minutes. It has an operating range of up to 150 miles.
The company also secured purchase incentive vouchers from the California Air Resources Board’s Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project. WattEV also applied for an additional 24 vouchers, in an effort to reach 30 units before the end of 2022. It also placed a reservation for 50 Tesla semis.
WattEV also signed its first electric truck transportation contract with TTSI for 16 trucks to haul loads from ports to regional destinations. TTSI will use WattEV’s trucks, charging infrastructure, and EV management services.
One question is how the solar-plus-storage microgrid facility will be used. It’s probably safe to assume that the facility will be used to mitigate energy costs, while prioritizing demand charge management.
The quantity and source for the second-life batteries is not yet known. Eventually, batteries may come from used electric trucks, creating a circular economy for batteries.
When combined with software being developed by WattEV to meet transportation company sustainability requirements, a growing percentage of emission-free electricity (particularly solar) could directly power the trucks.
When considering the large volumes of the California power grid which need to be upgraded in order to carry higher loads, and that those costs are typically shouldered by solar developers, it may well be that the solar-plus-storage facility was chosen to minimize transmission upgrade costs.

An independent testing laboratory heated a zinc manganese-dioxide cell from Urban Electric Power to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and subjected it to to abuse tests consistent with UL 9540A standard for thermal runaway fire propagation in battery energy storage systems. It found that “thermal runaway was not achieved,” a single time across all tests.
The same battery cells also passed testing to the UL 1973 standard earlier in the year, approving batteries for use in stationary applications such as for capturing power from PV solar and wind turbine, uninterruptible power supplies, etc.
Urban Electric’s modular batteries can provide backup electricity for personal use, may be installed in a home garage or basement, grouped as part of a commercial microgrid, or installed en masse at grid scale by an electric utility or independent power provider.
The company is currently taking part in a large-scale demonstration project of its battery technology at a San Diego State University data center that was in need of a specific backup power solution. The center’s previous backup provided about 15 minutes of power, but the center needed two hours. The data center also required the storage to be entirely safe for indoor operation and available at a small form factor, since space was limited.
Urban Electric’s chemistry served as a suitable solution, as it allowed the center to achieve 2 MWh of storage indoors, using the existing racking and inverters already in place from the previous system. The battery had virtually no risk of fire or toxic leaks, and at a lower cost per kilowatt-hour than the center’s owners paid for their previous lead acid battery system.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker was expected to sign the legislation into law. The measure is expected to provide a pathway forward for the state’s solar industry, which has been languishing for almost a year following the exhaustion of previous incentives.
The solar industry has applauded the passage of what was perhaps the most-anticipated state legislative package of the year.
“As a result of this landmark legislation, Illinois is now ready to embark on its clean energy future,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “Opening the Illinois market is critical to the growth of energy sources that will clean the air, create jobs and jumpstart the state’s economy. Illinois is now a national leader in crafting renewable energy solutions.”
Lesley McCain, executive director of the Illinois Solar Energy Association, said that after years of advocacy, the state now has a path to “reverse job losses and deliver clean electricity for families across Illinois.”  
And Vote Solar said in a statement that the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act will mean “thousands of good jobs, millions of dollars in local investments, and cleaner and healthier communities.”
Provisions of the bill include:
That final line item includes $34 million for a grant program to provide seed capital to emerging disadvantaged businesses; $1 million for the Jobs and Justice Fund, a nonprofit “green bank” that will infuse disadvantaged businesses with capital; $21 million for a 16 clean energy workforce training hubs across the state; $21 million for a system of contractor incubators to provide training and technical support to disadvantaged clean energy contractors; $9 million for contractor accelerators that will support further growth of clean energy businesses to become prime contractors and project developers; and $6 million for a training program for Illinoisans in institutions that are preparing for their return.

The trifecta of price increases was a first since Wood Mackenzie began modeling system price data in 2014. In the latest report, prices were found to have risen the most for the utility-scale segment, about 6% year-over-year. Many solar developers have sufficient inventory for 2021, but will likely begin to see price increases in 2022, the report said.
“Price increases, supply chain disruptions, and a series of trade risks are threatening our ability to decarbonize the electric grid,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper in releasing the report.
Headwinds included recent import enforcement actions on Xinjiang metallurgical-grade silicon and two new tariff petitions that allege dumping by Chinese producers. Taken together, these actions could “significantly exacerbate supply chain constraints and increase solar system prices,” the report said.

The price increases and renewed trade uncertainty come at a critical time for the solar industry. Earlier in September, the U.S. Department of Energy released its Solar Futures Study examining solar’s role in decarbonizing the nation’s electric power grid. It said that by 2035 the U.S. would need to quadruple its yearly solar capacity additions and provide 40% of the electricity on the grid, on the order of 1,000 GW.
By mid-century, solar energy would need to provide 1,600 GW on what by then would be a zero-carbon grid, the study said. Decarbonizing the entire energy system could result in as much as 3,000 GW of solar by 2050 as result of increased electrification in the transportation, buildings, and industrial sectors.
But new forecasts from Wood Mackenzie showed that the U.S. on track to average just over 29 GW of new annual solar capacity additions through 2026. It said that pace “is far short” of what is needed to reach 2035 clean energy targets. To reach those targets, the solar industry must install more than 80 GW of solar annually from 2022 through 2035, the firm said.
In June, a “Withhold Release Order” was issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). The order targeted a company called Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., which is located in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The government order instructed personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.

Price increases, supply chain disruptions, and a series of trade risks are threatening our ability to decarbonize the electric grid,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper in releasing the report. The order was issued in response to what officials said were credible reports of forced labor in the solar supply chain originating in the Xinjiang region of China.
By mid-August, reports began to surface that solar module shipments to the U.S. were already being detained by CBP agents. Reports said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents, and that the manufacturer may not ship hundreds of megawatts of capacity to the U.S. as long as the customs inquiry is in process.
A problem is being able to prove to CPB agents that a solar module’s supply chain is free of forced labor input.

Sources said that while the volume of equipment that appears to have been detained is small, concern is rippling through the solar sector that the risk is potentially much larger. A problem is being able to prove to CPB agents that a solar module’s supply chain is free of forced labor input.
But obtaining that evidence is difficult because China so far is prohibiting most second- and third-tier suppliers from cooperating with the supply chain audits that are needed to prove to customs agents that no forced labor was used in the supply chain.
To a degree, it’s a matter of semantics. Chinese officials vigorously deny that forced labor even exists in the country. Terms like worker relocation are preferred instead, and don’t suggest that any alleged coercion was involved. As a result, Chinese officials are barring companies from taking part in audits that are premised on Western allegations of forced labor.
Without a clear audit trail, it’s difficult to know how much product from Hoshine is included in refined polysilicon.

An even larger challenge may come from the antidumping challenge lodged with the U.S. Department of Commerce in August.
In that action, a group of companies (that declined to be named but claimed to be players in the U.S. solar industry) asked Commerce to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Data from the Energy Department showed that in 2020, Vietnam was the leading exporter to the United States, followed by Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand. The American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed three petitions requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
The group said that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
The department is expected to make a preliminary determination in the case in early October. Trade experts suggest that the complaint may have merit. If Commerce does agree to take up the case, it could pose a problem for the U.S. solar sector. That’s because although it would have until next summer to issue a finding, any tariffs that result would be retroactive to when the Commerce Department investigation began. Sources said that few projects could weather the impact of what could be a sizable tariff on any affected imported components.
Michelle Davis, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the second quarter market report, said that the industry is “bumping up against multiple challenges” that range from elevated equipment prices to complex interconnection processes. She said that addressing these issues “will be critical to expanding the industry’s growth and meeting clean energy targets.”
The second quarter report said that the solar industry will likely continue to set annual installation records until the solar Investment Tax Credit fully phases down in 2024. Industry growth is expected to flatline in 2025 and 2026. These forecasts do not account for additional trade actions, which represent what Wood Mackenzie call “a substantial downside risk” to its outlooks.
