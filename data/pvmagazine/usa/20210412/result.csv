The battery is intended to take stress off the utility’s grid on hot summer days when electrical usage soars.
It is the second lithium-ion battery system the two have placed as part of a demonstration project. The first went into service early last year on Staten Island. An agreement gives Con Edison the right to discharge the batteries to provide power to customers as needed.

Under the demonstration project, GI Energy and Con Edison choose customer locations where the utility’s analysis shows the electrical grid needs support. When Con Edison is not using the energy storage unit for grid support, GI Energy plans to dispatch power into the wholesale market.
The utility said that battery storage will take on greater importance as New York State increases the amount of renewable energy lighting homes and businesses, running vehicles and providing heating and cooling.
Con Edison and a partner, 174 Power Global, also recently announced a 100 MW /400 MWh battery at the site of a former fossil fuel plant near the East River in Astoria, Queens. The company also has a 2 MW storage system in Ozone Park, Queens.

Solar panels have been installed on 26 of the 45 buildings Zara Realty owns and manages in Queens, enough to power more than 125 households, producing 1.3 million kWh and representing about half the 2.7 million kWh that will be produced when the project is complete at the end of the year.
Zara is converting all energy use in the common areas of its Queens buildings to solar energy. Nearly 3,000 of the planned 6,500 panels have been installed and are currently supplying energy. The $6.5 million installation project is being carried out by Premier Solar Solutions, a veteran-owned New York based solar installation company.
Construction was briefly delayed in spring 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic but was resumed when solar energy installation was declared essential by New York State.
Installation of the solar panels on Zara’s 45 buildings will be designed to maximize efficiency by using standard panels affixed to racking systems and panels that lift and tilt above the roofline to ensure every available surface is used.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/12/clearway-starts-work-on-solar-plus-storage-projects-in-hawaii/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE PV,HAWAII",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 12, 2021",Clearway starts work on solar-plus-storage projects in Hawaii,"San Francisco-based Clearway Energy Group broke ground on two utility-scale solar projects in Hawaii. The 39 MW Mililani I Solar and 36 MW Waiawa Solar Power sites will be paired with a combined 300 MWh of storage.
The two projects represent a $280 million investment. Construction is being led by Moss and is expected to be complete in 2022.
This is Clearway’s second set of renewable projects in Hawaii. In 2019, the company completed construction and commissioning of three utility-scale solar projects: a 45.9 MW site in Waipi‘o and a 14.7 MW site in Mililani, both in central O‘ahu, and a 49 MW site in Kawailoa on O‘ahu’s North Shore.
Once Mililani I Solar and Waiawa Solar Power are complete, Clearway’s five solar projects totaling 185 MW will serve Hawaiian Electric’s grid. Hawaiian Electric reached a 34.5% consolidated renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in 2020. That performance exceeded the interim state mandate and put the utility on a path toward meeting Hawaii’s 100% by 2045 RPS goal.
In December, Clearway announced a joint equity transaction for a 1.6 GW portfolio that includes Mililani I Solar and Waiawa Solar Power. Around 90% of the generation from the projects are contracted with investment grade counter-parties, including utilities and load serving entities, Fortune 500 corporations, commercial and industrial customers, and financial institutions. The portfolio has a greater than 14-year blended average contract length.

The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, revealed that power purchase agreements for seven large-scale solar power projects in various regions of the Kingdom were signed by the government and several undisclosed developers.
“The output capacity of these projects, in addition to the projects of Sakaka and Dumat Al-Jandal, will amount to more than 3,600 MW,” he said in a statement, adding that one of the projects – the 600 MW Al Shuaiba PV IP project – will sell power at a world record low price of $0.0104/kWh. The project was selected by the Ministry of Energy in Round 2 of the procurement scheme that is being held under the umbrella of the country’s National Renewable Energy Program (NREP).
The 3.6 GW of capacity refers to the cumulative installed power that was assigned through the first two rounds of the scheme, including the Sakaka solar plant, which was connected to the grid in November 2019, and the 1.5 GW Sudair project, which is being developed in direct negotiations with the Saudi authorities.
“More renewable energy projects will follow across the Kingdom, which we will announce when the time comes,” the crown prince stated, without providing further details on the results of Round 2.
The second round of the program initially drew 250 bidders. In July, REPDO said the number of bidders it had narrowed the bidders down to 60 companies, including 28 that were based in Saudi Arabia.

The monofacial HiKu7 and bifacial BiHiKu7 modules are based on 210 mm cells, and are intended to reduce balance of system  and other costs for commercial and utility-scale solar power plants.
The company said that nameplate production capacity of the HiKu7 and BiHiKu7 modules will reach 10 GW by the end of 2021. It said “a significant portion” of that total has been booked, with the first deliveries beginning in April.
(Canadian Solar executives spoke with pv magazine last fall when the company first introduced its 600+W module.)
The modules offer power classes of up to 665 W and module efficiencies of up to 21.4%. The modules include Canadian Solar’s cell technology and module design, including hetero-type ribbon (HTR) and paving technology. Both technologies reduce the gap between solar cells by more than 50%, increasing the power output of solar modules over the same area.
The modules are designed to further reduce light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID) using technology that cuts cell and module power degradation, thereby increasing power output and lengthening the modules’ useful lifetime.
The company said the modules are expected to reduce balance of system costs by up to 5.7%, and long-term cost of energy (LCOE) by up to 8.9%, compared to 445 W modules.
A climate bill that requires Rhode Island to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 was signed into law by Gov. Daniel McKee on April 10.
The 2021 Act on Climate (2021-S 0078A, 2021-H 5445A) makes the state’s climate goals outlined in the Resilient Rhode Island Act of 2014 more ambitious and updated with current science. Under the bill, the state would develop a plan to cut all climate emissions from transportation, buildings and heating, and electricity to a level 10% below 1990 levels this year, 45% below 1990 levels by 2030, 80% below 1990 levels by 2040, and net-zero by 2050.
The plan will be updated every five years and addresses environmental injustices, public health inequities, and a fair employment transition as fossil-fuel jobs are replaced by green energy jobs, according to the governor’s office.
The bill directs the state’s Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council to draft plans designed to meet the bill’s goals. The council was created in 2014 to advise the governor on what state agencies can do to address climate change. It includes heads of state agencies, including the departments of environmental management, transportation and health, and the energy resources office.
Opponents said the bill gives the council too much power and could prove costly to homeowners and businesses.
Lithium-ion battery recycling company Battery Resourcers said it completed a $20 million Series B equity round with financing led by Orbia Ventures.  Other investors included At One Ventures, TDK Ventures, TRUMPF Venture, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures and, Jaguar Land Rover’s InMotion Ventures.
The financing will support development of a commercial-scale processing facility with the annual capacity to process 10,000 tons of batteries, equivalent to around 20,000 electric vehicles a year.
The financing will support development of a commercial-scale processing facility.

The company said it is engineering a graphite recovery and purification process, which it said will enable it to return both the cathode and anode active materials back to manufacturers of new batteries.
The U.S. Department of Energy, Israel’s Ministry of Energy, and the Israel Innovation Authority awarded up to $6 million to two universities for work in the area of cyber security for energy infrastructure.
