https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/30/centipede-battery-energy-storage-launched-by-powin/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,OREGON,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 30, 2021",Centipede battery energy storage launched by Powin,"Powin announced the release of Centipede, a modular battery energy storage system. The system consists of pre-integrated modular units containing batteries, thermal management equipment, and other safety features.
The company said Centipede requires half the time to procure and deploy and uses 30% less space onsite, while reducing lifecycle costs, when compared to contemporary modular storage systems. The Stack750E battery will be the first unit integrated for the Centipede system, and is designed for 2-hour to 4-hour durations. The design offers scalability and supports up to 200 MWh storage per acre.
The third-generation battery module was updated with new thermal controls, a change that Powin said will create an anticipated 80% reduction in service times. The modular units allow for granular control and monitoring of the system, increasing visibility into safety
Mass production of Centipede is expected by late Q1 2022, with first deliveries scheduled a year later. Powin said it has secured more than 2 GWh of contracts for the battery system from multinational independent power producers and utilities.
Powin president Geoff Brown said the platform will aid in increased renewables penetration, non-wires alternatives, and power decentralization. “With Centipede we have meticulously reinvented our entire storage ecosystem, including our supply chain, battery hardware, and balance of system design to create [the design],” he said.
During Centipede’s development, Powin worked with Energy Safety Response Group (ESRG), an independent testing firm, to validate the efficacy of the lithium-ion battery safety systems. The ESRG study found that in instances of failure and fire, fire does not propagate from one unit to the next, and that explosion risk to neighboring units is effectively mitigated. The system exceeded UL standards, said the company.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/30/koch-expands-its-solar-reach-with-epc-firm-acquisition/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 30, 2021",Koch expands its solar reach with EPC firm acquisition,"Koch Engineered Solutions said it acquired Arizona-based DEPCOM Power, an engineering, procurement and construction firm that builds utility-scale solar power plants and manages ongoing operations, maintenance, and refurbishment services. Terms were not disclosed.
DEPCOM’s portfolio includes approximately 5 GW of projects representing completed, in-construction, and pre-construction stages across the U.S.
Elements driving Koch’s entry into the renewables space are what it said is the cost-competitiveness of utility–scale solar on an unsubsidized basis, causing solar to become an “increasingly significant part” of the generation mix. It also cited growing energy usage among businesses and households, and what it said was “continued consumer preference” for renewable electricity.
Stinson LLP served as legal advisor to KES on the transaction, and Greenberg Traurig LLP served as legal advisor to DEPCOM.
In late March, solar energy developer Greenbacker said that a 22 MW project in Colorado began commercial operation, including an onsite Tesla battery pack capable of storing up to 2 MWh of energy. DEPCOM Power handled the plant’s engineering and construction and will manage the project and deliver output to Platte River Power Authority, which signed a 20-year power purchase agreement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/30/duke-energy-and-clean-energy-advocates-come-to-terms-on-new-net-metering-rates-in-north-carolina/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NORTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"NOVEMBER 30, 2021",Duke Energy and clean energy advocates come to terms on new net metering rates in North Carolina,"Duke Energy’s new net metering rates in North Carolina have been finalized, as the company has come to terms on compromise with a number of environmental organizations, including the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association; the Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of Vote Solar and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy; Sunrun and the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Now that compromise has been reached and the rate design has been finalized, all that remains is approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). Once approved, the new net metering tariffs will go into effect for customers submitting applications on or after Jan. 1, 2023. Active customers and ones who submit applications before that date may elect to remain on their existing rates until January 1, 2027.
To kick off the new rates, each Duke Energy Carolinas customer will start with a monthly minimum bill of $22, minus the sum of the customer’s monthly basic facilities charge, “Customer and Distribution Energy Charges” and riders, assuming that sum is less than $22.
Solar customers within the net metering program will receive a monthly net excess energy credit of 2.68 cents, per kWh, with a monthly non-bypassable charge of 36 cents per nameplate kW of their system. Systems over 15 kW in capacity will be subject to a monthly Grid Access Fee of $2.05 for each kW over 15 kW.
As established in 2019, net metering customers are served under a residential rate schedule with time of use (TOU) and critical peak pricing (CPP). Two customer segments exist; the Time of Use with Critical Peak Pricing Schedules (RSTC) for standard customers, and Time of Use with Critical Peak Pricing Schedules (RETC) for all-electric customers. The rates differ considerably.
The RSTC rates:
The RETC rates:
The same basic structure applies to Duke Energy Progress customers. The monthly minimum bill calculation is the same, but set at $28. Solar customers within the net metering program will receive a monthly Net Excess Energy Credit of 2.64 cents, per kWh, with a monthly non-bypassable charge of 44 cents per nameplate kW of their system. Systems over 15 kW in capacity will be subject to a monthly grid access fee of $1.50 for each kW over 15 kW.
Rather than RSTC or RETC, Duke Energy Progress customers are charged under a flat TOU and CPP calculation, which has some variance as follows:
According to the NCUC filing, the new net metering rates and charges align with the policy goals of North Carolina to enable 70% carbon reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050 and were developed in accordance with a comprehensive rate design study that investigated the costs and benefits of serving net metering customers, as called for by North Carolina House Bill 589.
The rates nearly mirror a similar net metering agreement in South Carolina from September 2020.
“Duke Energy is committed to finding collaborative paths forward to help with the clean-energy transition and carbon-reduction goals in the Carolinas.” said Stephen De May, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president. “This deal ensures fair and reasonable treatment for all customers whether they choose to install solar or not.”
General Counsel and Director of Policy at North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, Peter Ledford, believes the agreement will push forward progress in North Carolina’s clean energy economy, saying “Not only does it advance the residential solar sector, it also provides a framework and agreement to work collaboratively on the next generation of non-residential net metering.”
“This agreement reflects the critical role that rooftop solar must play in North Carolina’s economy, clean energy transition, and workforce development,” said Southeast Senior Regional Director at Vote Solar, Lindsey Hallock, adding that the inclusion of a low-income solar program down the line could “bring the voices of low-income customers to the table, remove prohibitive cost barriers, and unlock the benefits of solar for more North Carolinians.”

The project is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2022, and is intended to explore ways in which intelligent and dynamic load control and solar/energy storage can be aggregated as dynamic multi-service and multi-asset VPPs. The intent is to create value on both sides of the meter and helping utilities transition to more resilient and flexible distribution grids.
The project is designed to deliver grid and consumer services to 100 homes in Pacific Gas and Electric Co.’s service area using LG’s energy storage systems and Sunverge’s distributed energy resource (DER) software. The project is also expected to use energy management circuit breakers from Eaton Corp., enabling the Sunverge platform’s load control capabilities, in addition to energy storage and solar photovoltaic control management and aggregation.
The project is expected to evaluate time of use and real-time pricing signals, load shaping and shifting, and event-based demand response, as well as contingency reserve, frequency regulation, and voltage support ancillary services.
Sitting on top of the LG hardware and the Sunverge DER platform, the LG ThinQ Energy app is expected to provide a means for homeowners to manage their home’s energy profile by enabling them to view and control their home’s solar generation, battery, storage, and load control.
