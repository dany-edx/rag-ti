https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/05/the-race-for-100-solar/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 5, 2023",The race for 100% solar,"The perennial top three countries – China, the United States, and India – continue to account for some two-thirds of global utility scale solar generation capacity. Look beyond those simple totals, however, and you find some impressive relative results by many of those countries in the remaining one-third.
From Wiki-Solar’s comprehensive database of more than 22,000 utility scale solar projects around the world, it is possible to derive a wide range of comparators, including site performance ratios, average yield, and land utilization. This article looks at national achievements and rates of progress.
Firstly, we have assessed the nominal annual output of the large solar capacity in each country and compared it with national electricity consumption. On that basis, five countries now meet more than 10% of their electric power demand from utility scale solar. Most of these figures would be significantly higher if rooftop and other small scale solar arrays were factored in.

Chile tops the list, thanks in part to its exceptional yield from so many high-altitude desert sites. El Salvador and Jordan feature strongly, with solar contributing substantially to their more modest electricity demand. Spain carries the banner for Europe while Australia has progressed strongly after a slow start.
The UAE owes much of its elevated position to a single huge project, the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. India may be only number three, in terms of total generation capacity, but leads the United States and China in relative terms, with 8.6% of its electricity from utility scale solar, and 13.2% from overall solar capacity.
An extended list which shows most of the countries with significant utility scale solar capacity is available on the Wiki-Solar website. There you will find Germany, with 3.2% of its electricity demand met by big solar, a few places above China, which sits at number 29, with 2.6%
The rate of progress is another key indicator. We have evaluated this by looking at the change over the five-year period from 2017 to last year.
For comparison, we have extended this rate forward until utility scale solar would meet 100% of electricity demand. This is, of course, a theoretical exercise. No nation would, in practice, generate all of its power this way and neither the growth of solar nor the trend in electricity consumption will continue as a straight line. The results of the exercise are, nonetheless, illuminating.

Chile again tops the list and would need just 25 years to achieve that notional 100% utility scale solar coverage. Spain has seen outstanding renewed growth in recent years, taking it to number two on this list, with El Salvador and Jordan not far behind. In theory, the top ten countries for solar progress would all reach 100% solar, from utility-scale alone, before the end of the century.
Again, the full list is available online and features a strong European contingent – Portugal, Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark – just outside the top ten. Some countries where recent progress in utility scale solar has been slow would need several centuries to reach 100%, by this measure.
The large solar power stations we are considering here are not, of course, for individuals or households. Another measure of comparative achievement is relative solar generation capacity per person.

Inevitably this is quite similar to the first table above but this time the UAE and Australia leapfrog Chile. The United States has a much higher ranking in this table because its power consumption per capita – from all generation sources – is substantially higher than most other nations. Again, the full table is available online.
Wiki-Solar has accurate site footprints for the majority of utility scale plants, enabling us to assess the land area typically used for big solar sites in different parts of the world. When this number is related to the land area of each country, it is no surprise to find that land usage is seldom an issue.

The most that any country currently devotes to utility scale solar is just over one tenth of 1%. Only two, relatively small and energy intensive countries – Taiwan and South Korea – would need to allocate more than 3% of their land for PV, even to achieve the theoretical 100% solar paradigm.
The full list shows the United States down among the countries that would need to devote around 0.5% of total surface area for 100% solar. The use of building-mounted systems and the growth of agrivoltaics, of course, means that the land allocated can also be productive for other purposes.
The expression “nominal output” refers to the design or expected annual output of solar power stations. Actual output in practice will vary with solar radiation and other climatic and site factors, such as grid constraints.
The 100% solar paradigm is used for illustrative and comparative purposes. A 100% renewables scenario featuring wind, hydro, and biomass alongside solar is more realistic.
National power consumption figures are mainly taken from French data company Enerdata and the International Energy Agency; population data is mainly taken from the United Nations. Utility scale solar figures come from the Wiki-Solar database. For consistency, generation capacity is quoted in MW/TW (AC) to enable direct comparison between PV and concentrating solar power plants and other forms of generation.

The lightweight mobile device is USB-A, USB-C, and barrel cord compatible for versatile charging.
The device is designed for charging phones, tablets, power banks, speakers, and Ryobi batteries when combined with a power bank. The panel can charge a Ryobi 18V One+ 2 Ah battery in under an hour and charge a phone in about an hour and fifteen minutes, said the company.
The solar panel is manufactured for durability and flexible setup with a kickstand as well as four secure grommets in the corners. Ryobi backs up its 60 W solar panel with a 3-year manufacturer’s warranty.
When folded for transport, the device measures 20.4 inches by 16.5 inches and weighs 6 pounds. It has an integrated storage pocket to carry cables, adapters, and other accessories. While the 60 W panel is not a large powerhouse, it can offer some additional off-grid electricity support on the job in remote areas.
The panel can charge Ryobi 18V One+ batteries that are used in many of its portable electric power tools when integrated with the company’s 1800 W portable battery power station, which contains an inverter and generator.
The power station has an 1800 W output, supports 120 V and contains a 4-stroke gas engine for additional power support. It has four ports for charging Ryobi 40 V lithium batteries.
Ryobi’s power station includes an LCD screen for monitoring battery level and load levels, an external LED light, and is built with a rugged exterior with handles for carrying on the job site. It includes three 120V AC 15 A outlets, two USB-C ports, and four USB-A ports.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/05/mattiq-developing-iridium-alternatives-to-solve-constraint-on-green-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"OCTOBER 5, 2023",Mattiq developing iridium alternatives to solve constraint on green hydrogen,"Clean chemistry company Mattiq is working on developing a portfolio of alternatives to iridium – a rare, costly material used in clean hydrogen production – in what the company calls the most comprehensive, systematic study of iridium alternatives ever conducted. 
Iridium oxide catalysts are used in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers, a product that is being manufactured at larger scales in part to support the hydrogen industry. However, iridium is rare to find and very expensive — the current production of the material will only be enough for annual manufacturing capacity of around 3 GW to 7.5 GW of electrolyzers, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. In contrast, forecasts indicate demand for 100 GW by the end of the decade. 
“Deploying alternatives to iridium oxide is essential to support this rapid growth, reducing supply chain risk and accelerating the scaling of clean hydrogen, an essential enabler in the effort to decarbonize hard-to-abate industrial sectors,” the company said. 
The company has to keep the specific alternative materials confidential to protect its intellectual property, but in general, the alternative catalysts are mixtures of metals that, by virtue of “alloying,” take on new properties compared to individual metals, Mattiq CEO Jeff Erhardt told pv magazine USA.
“As a result, we reduce or eliminate iridium content while retaining the performance of state-of-the-art iridium-based catalysts,” Erhardt said. 
The company expects to announce a commercial partnership within the first half of 2024. Mattiq is also in discussions with a number of industrial partners to commercialize and rapidly scale these products to market, and has seen a lot of interest so far, Erhardt said. 
However, the industry still faces some challenges in terms of ramping up the deployment of these iridium alternatives. One key challenge is the standardization of reliability testing for electrocatalyst materials, Erhardt said. 
The reason iridium catalysts are state-of-the-art is because they are durable and reliable over long periods of times in electrolyzers, and electrolyzer OEMs who want to integrate novel iridium alternatives into their equipment will first need to evaluate them under standardized testing conditions against the state-of-the-art catalysts they use now, he added. 
There are certain measures policy makers can take to help address these challenges. For instance, they could support third-party testing facilities, like national laboratories, that validate the performance of novel catalyst materials using best-practice protocols accepted by industry, Erhardt said. They could also continue supporting novel technologies across the development chain. 
Most importantly, he said, while hydrogen is currently garnering a lot of attention, policy-makers need to understand that electrolyzers and electrochemistry can do much more than produce hydrogen.
“We are working to enable the clean production of a vast range of chemicals, plastics, and fuels beyond hydrogen – and do so in a clean way. This is what will enable us to decarbonize the “hard-to-abate” chemicals industry,” said Erhardt.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/05/dominion-energy-proposes-more-than-a-dozen-utility-scale-solar-projects/,"EMPLOYMENT,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,VIRGINIA",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 5, 2023",Dominion Energy proposes more than a dozen utility-scale solar projects,"Dominion Energy proposed in its annual clean energy filing with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) more than a dozen new solar projects for Virginia customers. If approved, the company estimates that the projects will generate 772 MW of electricity, or enough to power nearly 200,000 Virginia homes at peak output.
Dominion Energy is a power and energy company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia that supplies electricity to residents in parts of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The company also supplies natural gas to parts of North Carolina, South Carolina and other areas. The company has stated the goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.
In addition to moving the company toward its own clean energy goals, the projects will also help the company achieve the requirements of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which mandates that the state, via a renewable portfolio standard, must derive at least 1% of its generation mix from solar energy.
Further incentive comes from the federal funding offered in the Inflation Reduction Act that offers an extended investment tax credit (ITC) along with various adders, plus the production tax credit (PTC).
Dominion’s proposal includes six solar projects that, if approved, would total 337 MW that will be owned or acquired by Dominion Energy Virginia. It also includes 13 power purchase agreements (PPAs) totaling 435 MW with independently owned solar projects. The PPAs were selected through a competitive solicitation process.
“These projects support our ongoing efforts to deliver reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy to our customers,” said Ed Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia. “They will also bring jobs and economic benefits to communities across the Commonwealth.”
If these projects are approved, Dominion will have more than 4.6 GW of solar in Virginia,  or enough to power more than 1.1 million homes at peak output.
In order for the projects to move forward, Dominion must secure SCC approval, and the utility-owned projects require local and state permits. If approved, construction is expected to be complete between 2024 and 2026. The company estimates that construction of the projects will support more than 1,600 jobs and generate more than $570 million in economic benefits across Virginia.
Dominion reports that the cost of the projects is estimated to add approximately $1.54 to the average residential customer’s monthly bill. According to EnergySage, electric rates in Virginia are 14 cents per kWh, which is 12% lower than the national average.
