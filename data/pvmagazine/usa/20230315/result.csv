To ameliorate this the Inflation Reduction Act offers up to a 10% tax credit adder for projects within designated “energy communities” that will face challenges from the transition away from fossil fuels.  The available tax credit is increased by an additional 10% if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met or 2% if those requirements are not met for projects over 1 MW.  Privately owned residential projects do not qualify for the energy community bonus, but they do qualify if part of a commercial portfolio.
The IRA defines energy communities based on three possible criteria: brownfields, coal communities, and tax and job revenue.  Locating and taking advantage of these three types of energy communities will be integral for renewable energy developers.  LandGate, a leading provider for data solutions and an online marketplace for US commercial land and resources, recently published a guide for profiting from these energy communities using their PowerData tool.
Brownfields are sites with environmental contamination as defined in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 and designated by the EPA.  While these sites are typically smaller, this designation allows for additional funding for redevelopment and cleanup.  Programs like the EPA’s RE-Powering Initiative, and Massachusetts’ SMART solar incentive have already assisted this effort.
Coal communities are defined as a census tract, and any adjoining tracts, which has at any point after Dec. 31, 2009, had significant employment or local tax revenue related to the extraction, processing, transport, or storage of coal, oil, or natural gas.  A census tract with a coal mine closed after Dec. 31 1999 or a coal-fired electric generating unit retired after Dec. 31, 2009, is also eligible.  These tracts cover about 20% of the overall area of the United States, as seen below.  Developers will be paying particular attention to this as building new solar projects is already less expensive than operating existing coal plants, according to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology.
The IRA defines a third case for a metropolitan or non-metropolitan statistical area that meets criteria on tax and job revenue.  The area must have both an unemployment rate at or above the national average for the previous year and 0.17 percent or greater direct employment or at least 25 percent of local tax revenues related to the extraction, processing, transport, or storage of coal, oil, or natural gas.  As seen below, the light green area represents regions with at least 0.17% fossil fuel employment along with an above-average rate of unemployment.  This covers about 39% of the total US area but further clarification is anticipated from the Department of Treasure and Energy as unemployment rates vary over time.
Further clarification is also required for defining areas where at least 25% of local tax revenue is provided by fossil fuels.  Most local governments do not currently publicly publish their tax revenue for infrastructure or fossil fuel related facilities.  Instead, LandGate offers access to data for fossil fuel resources to estimate the associated local tax revenue.  While further clarity is required for some of these broad definitions, energy communities will define the playbook for solar developers looking to maximize incentives in the years to come.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/15/generac-introduces-off-grid-portable-solar-panel/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 15, 2023",Generac introduces off-grid portable solar panel,"Generac Power Systems unveiled the GS100, a 100 W solar panel designed to be paired with the company’s off-grid portable power stations.
Each 100 W panel is designed with a tri-fold configuration with built-in kickstands for easy set-up and portability. The units are waterproof, dust proof, and chemical resistant, said Generac. The 100 W panel is currently priced at $299.00 MSRP.
“Pairing our portable power station with the new GS100 Solar Panel provides an ideal energy solution for off-grid camping, adventuring, or any activity that requires true energy independence, as it fully recharges with only the sun,” said Kyle Raabe, president of consumer power, Generac.
Specifications include:
The panel is compatible with the GB1000 and GB2000 portable power stations and is packaged with a cable for connecting with Generac devices. Up to four panels can be connected in parallel, offering up to 400 W of solar charging power.
The GB1000 power bank can charge from 0% to 80% in 2.1 hours from a wall output and supports charging from solar, car outputs, and generators. It features AC and 12V DC outlets, USB ports and a 15W wireless charging pad for use with compatible devices.
Generac also introduced charge enhancers for its two portable battery power stations, including 200 W and 450 W options. The 200 W option can increase charge times by 25%, while the 450 W option, compatible with the GB2000, offers 50% faster charge times, said Generac. The charge enhancers are priced at $99.50 to $139.00 MSRP.
Solar business activity
Generac, known for its residential backup generator offerings, is increasingly entering the solar market with new products and services.
In January, it announced the introduction of a residential electric vehicle charger. The 48A / 11.5kW Generac EV charger is a Level 2 home charger, which Generac said is capable of charging a car battery in as little as four to six hours, depending on the car battery’s capacity and charge need. The unit’s J1772 connector is out-of-the-box compatible with nearly all EVs on the market today. The charger’s NEMA-4 enclosure makes the unit rated for both indoor and outdoor residential installation.
In August 2022, Generac announced its Grid Services division entered an agreement with Arizona Public Service (APS), to deliver additional grid capacity from residential battery storage systems. APS serves 1.3 million homes and businesses across the state. Demand management and response is particularly important in Arizona, where extreme heat leads to air conditioning usage, thereby leading to high peak demand. Distributed battery energy storage is hailed for its ability to more efficiently distribute power, leading to a reduced need for reserve generation and transmission resources.
Generac will dispatch its scalable PWRcell batteries, which range from 3 battery modules for up to 9 kWh of capacity and 4.5 kW output, to a 6-module configuration providing up to 18 kWh of capacity and 9 kW output. Under the partnership, Generac will aggregate residential energy from PWRcell batteries over a five-year term starting in January 2023. The aggregated energy will support both system-wide capacity via demand response events, as well as locational capacity on target system feeders. The network of batteries may also be able to provide additional services to the grid when otherwise available.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/15/can-the-u-s-fill-its-domestic-solar-supply-chain-gaps/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 15, 2023",Can the U.S. fill its domestic solar supply chain gaps?,"from pv magazine 3/23
The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August 2022 by US President Joe Biden, greatly expands incentives to deploy clean energy and includes a new set of production tax credits for domestic solar, battery, and wind manufacturing. As a result, many companies, including newcomers, have announced US factories which are sorely needed to meet expected demand. The question remains, however, whether manufacturing facilities will ramp fast enough and, if not, where the gaps will be and how dependent US solar will remain on Southeast Asian imports.
According to the US Solar Market Insight Q3 2022 report published by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), US solar generation capacity could rise from 129 GW today to 335 GW in 2027.
While installations fell in 2022, mostly due to Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act trade issues, the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Energy Information Administration expects the solar market to rebound, with 29.1 GW to be added in 2023. That would more than double the 2021 utility-scale record of 13.4 GW.
The DOE’s “Solar Futures Study” predicts aggressive cost reduction, supportive policy, and large-scale electrification will mean solar could supply 40% of US electricity in 2035, and 45% in 2050. That would require average annual growth of 30 GW in new solar capacity this year and next, rising to 60 GW extra per year from 2025 to 2030, for a terawatt of new solar capacity by 2035.
The IRA delivers the supportive policy needed to increase domestic manufacturing by way of an advanced manufacturing tax credit, known as Section 45X, which provides tax incentives for specific manufactured goods produced and sold in the United States. The credit lasts through 2029 and then begins to phase down.
The IRA offers “quite generous incentives” along the entire supply chain for manufacturers, said Christian Roselund in a recent pv magazine webinar. Roselund, senior policy analyst at US solar and battery supply chain management business Clean Energy Associates (CEA), said it costs $0.245/W of generation capacity to ship a Southeast Asian solar module to the United States. It cost $0.35/W to make a module in the US before the IRA, Roselund said, but now “suddenly, it costs $0.18 a watt.”
Many manufacturers have announced their intent to begin producing modules in the US and some have promised more upstream supplies, such as cells, wafers, ingots, and polysilicon.
South Korea’s Qcells plans to build it all. The company has announced it will invest more than $2.5 billion to bring fully integrated solar manufacturing to the US. Considered the largest solar investment in US history, it will make the business – a subsidiary of conglomerate Hanwha Group – the first to establish a facility to manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells, and modules annually. The company estimates it will be producing 8.4 GW of product in Dalton, Georgia, by 2024.
Alex Barrows, head of PV at UK-based solar consultant Exawatt, believes 60 GW of manufacturing capacity is possible but admits it is too early to say if it will come to fruition. Italian business Enel Green Power, for example, is planning a 3 GW-per-year heterojunction solar cell and module facility at an undisclosed US location which, the energy company says, will scale to 6 GW.
Barrows said 30 GW of US module production capacity “should be achievable” based on confirmed announcements. The Exawatt analyst noted it’s likely module manufacturing will achieve 60 GW but ingot, wafer, and cell production will lag. Barrows said the cell capacity planned thus far is part of the integrated strategy of Qcells, Enel, and others that plan to manufacture a similar level of around 10 GW. Cells produced by vertically integrated manufacturers are unlikely to be available to other module makers.
Despite the IRA incentives luring manufacturers to set up shop in the US, several challenges remain to ramping up domestic production across the supply chain. Michael Parr, executive director of Washington DC-based trade body the Ultra-Low Carbon Solar Alliance, says making polysilicon, wafers, and cells is capital intensive and that is why we are initially seeing so many announcements that are instead about module manufacturing. Any mismatch between US module and cell production capacity would see module makers remain dependent on imported cells for the foreseeable future.
If imports from China are not considered, Parr says, the US is short on wafer supply. “If you want a domestic supply chain, wafer is where you want to be,” he says. Parr notes US solar manufacturer CubicPV – formerly 1366 Technologies – is planning domestic wafer production. CubicPV has announced plans for 10 GW of wafer capacity in the United States, driven by IRA incentives, in a move that would create an estimated 1,500 jobs.
There is also a mismatch in anticipated US polysilicon, ingot, and cell production capacity. CEA expects around 30 GW of annual module manufacturing capacity in 2027 but only 3 GW of ingot and wafer lines and 17 GW of polysilicon fabs. Germany’s Wacker Chemie and Michigan-based Hemlock Semiconductor are manufacturing polysilicon in the US, and Norwegian business REC Silicon intends to restart its idled plant in Moses Lake, Washington this year.
That means significant gaps, CEA’s Roselund says, even if some of the 30 GW module capacity announced includes First Solar’s cadmium telluride products. “There will still be much more module than cell [manufacturing]” he adds.
Ingot manufacturing faces similar challenges and no construction has started to date, despite announced plans for production lines. Roselund says it could be challenging for ingot manufacturers to “reach the capacities they’re talking about.” He explains that there are not many players in the area that have extensive, recent experience in making ingots and wafers using industry-standard production methods.
Even if the United States does achieve 60 GW of polysilicon, ingot, wafer, cell, and module production capacity, it will still be importing various other materials including glass, frames, and junction boxes.
As Exawatt’s Barrows notes, “you would still be likely to rely on imports, within the supply chain, to some extent.” With the nation likely to reach that figure only in terms of annual module manufacturing capacity, Barrows says the key challenge is that US manufacturing is “meaningfully more expensive than manufacturing in SE [Southeast] Asia – labor and capex [capital expenditure] in particular.”
Referring to the practice of slapping trade tariffs on solar imports, though, Barrows says production incentives will have a role, adding, “Realistically, we know that tariffs alone won’t work – you need both a carrot and a stick.”
With some module imports likely to be necessary to meet US solar demand, CEA’s Roselund says the big manufacturers in SE Asia are developing Uyghur forced-labor-prevention-compliant modules and, “generally speaking … that value chain is adapting to requirements of US trade law.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/15/u-s-energy-storage-capacity-to-increase-nearly-6x-in-five-years/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 15, 2023",U.S. energy storage capacity to increase nearly 6x in five years,"Energy storage is paired with renewable energy to boost flexibility and resilience of intermittent generation sources. Over 82% of actively planned capacity additions in the United States are solar, wind, and energy storage, with solar representing over 50% of all planned U.S. generation capacity.
A report from American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie project that the nation may add as much as 75 GW of energy storage between 2023 and 2027 to meet the needs of an evolving grid.
Energy storage has been ramping up considerably in recent years. In 2017, only 288 MW / 645 MWh was added. Five years later, in 2022, 4.8 GW / 12.1 GWh was brought online. The 2022 total for deployment was nearly equal to the totals in 2020 and 2021 combined, as deployment rates continue to heat up.
“Energy storage had its best year yet in 2022. Cumulative operating utility-scale storage capacity increased by 80%. While we saw a slight dip in installations toward the end of the year, the trend is clear: Energy storage is on a rapid growth curve and is already a key component of building a resilient grid that supports abundant clean energy,” said John Hensley, American Clean Power Association (ACP) vice president of research and analytics.
Despite the banner year for deployment thus far, energy storage took a dip in late 2022, particularly in the utility-scale. The U.S. added just over 1 GW across all segments in the fourth quarter of 2022, making the quarter only the fifth highest for installations. Deployment 33% lower than Q4 of 2021, the highest quarter on record.
The dip in deployment was largely attributed to supply chain and interconnection constraints, said the report. These major headwinds led to over 3 GW of projects scheduled to come online in Q4 being delayed or cancelled.
While utility-scale storage slowed, residential batteries continued to rise in adoption, growing to 171 MW installed in Q4, an 11% increase over the previous quarter. Capacity additions rose every quarter in 2022, suggesting increased demand for backup power.
“Despite a slow fourth quarter, total 2022 installations were still 44% over 2021. Grid-scale installations increased by 7% year-over-year, CCI [community, commercial, and industrial] by 3%, and residential experienced the strongest growth with installations up 36%,” said Vanessa Witte, senior analyst with Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team.
“Looking ahead, we expect the U.S. storage market to install almost 75 GW between 2023 and 2027. Grid-scale installations account for approximately 60 GW, 81% of the new capacity added,” said Witte.
The report added that project volume in the interconnection queue from 2023 to 2028 fell by about 10% from the last quarter. This occurred as a result of independent system operators filtering through applications, and developers withdrawing applications now that the rush to secure queue positions has calmed.
Over 7 GW of projects with an original 2022 planned commercial operation date were pushed into later years or cancelled outright. ACP said this was likely due to increased costs and developers’ inability to procure equipment within their projects’ timeframes.
ACP added that price relief for batteries is on the horizon as commodity prices decline. System cost declines are expected in 2023, but issues in supply delays and a tight labor market will likely persist as headwinds this year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/15/scheduled-home-charging-of-evs-could-expand-ev-hosting-capacity/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 15, 2023",Scheduled home charging of EVs could expand EV hosting capacity,"Shifting the home charging hours of electric vehicles to the middle of the night could reduce upgrade costs on a single distribution circuit by almost $400,000 through 2050, a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) analysis has found.
If increasing numbers of EVs on a distribution circuit were instead charged as soon as drivers arrived home, that would increase peak demand on the circuit over time and require upgrading the circuit’s secondary transformers to handle the higher peak load.
PNNL partnered with the utility Southern California Edison (SCE) to model, for a single SCE distribution circuit serving a residential area, EV adoption through 2050 and the need for transformer upgrades, if charging began when EV drivers arrived home. PNNL also modeled transformer upgrades needed when a “smart charge management” approach was used.
Smart charging that postponed home EV charging until after midnight, PNNL found, could defer the need for many individual transformer upgrades for 5 to 15 years each. The nearby graph shows the reduction in required transformer upgrades for the modeled distribution circuit in each five-year period.
The costs of implementing smart charging were not estimated, the analysis said, “due to uncertainties” regarding what technology may prevail in the future. The study said that third-party EV charging management organizations may offer EV charging controls via cell phone infrastructures and telemetrics to the vehicle “such that no or minimal cost on the utility are incurred.”
Charging with renewables
In Texas, where wind power is often abundant at night, Tesla plans to offer unlimited overnight home charging for $30 a month, the company announced at an investor day earlier this month. Solar power that has been stored in batteries could also be delivered to EVs overnight. An alternative approach, workplace EV charging, would enable use of daytime solar power.
SCE’s ongoing work
SCE Director of Business Planning and Technology Brian Stonerock said the utility is continuing to conduct additional validation and improvements in the engineering and simulation study assumptions to inform its system planning.
The utility is deploying “actual charge management systems” in both lab and field settings, he said, as it works to assess the technology further, measure the costs of deployment and operation, and show the effectiveness of such systems integrated with SCE’s grid management system. That system incorporates a distributed energy resource management (DERM) system, according to a company presentation.
The PNNL analysis, completed in March 2022 and recently made publicly available, is titled “Electric vehicles at scale – Phase II distribution system analysis.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/15/50-states-of-solar-incentives-missouri/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,PROCUREMENT,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,MISSOURI",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 15, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Missouri,"Like much of the central Midwest states, solar capacity in Missouri is measured in hundreds of megawatts, as opposed to gigawatts in Illinois, Minnesota and further east. Missouri currently ranks 35th in the United States for solar, with 472 MW of installed capacity through the end of 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Missouri is a transportation hub for the U.S. at the junction of its two longest rivers, Missouri and Mississippi. With three of the largest recorded earthquakes to take place in southern Missouri, nuclear power has been avoided from deployments in the state, while coal power continues to represent 74% of the state’s generation portfolio, as well as eight out of the ten largest power plants in the state, according to the Energy Information Association.
The Show-Me State adopted a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in 2008 requiring its investor-owned electric utilities to generate 15% of their electricity with renewable energy by 2021. The RPS standard required that solar generation account for at least 0.3% of total electricity retail sales by 2021.
Ameren, based in St. Louis and the largest Missouri electric utility, reported in April 2022 that it met the RPS target for 2021. At the beginning of 2022, Missouri had more than 2.2 GW  of operating wind farms and ranked 13th in the U.S. for wind power generation in the previous year.
According to American Clean Power’s database, Missouri has 613.4 MW of solar projects advanced stages of construction for the coming years, with the Morris Plains (250 MW, Adair County) and Huck Finn project (200 MW, Audrain County) being the two largest utility-scale projects under development by developers AES Corporation and EDF Renewables, respectively.
Incentives
Missouri allows net metering across residential and business rooftops since 2007, as per the “Easy Connection Act” or PUB-2238, allowing ratepayers to net meter from systems up to 100 kW of capacity from solar, wind or other renewable sources.
Ameren, whose electric service territory encompasses about one-third of the state towards the east, credits ratepayers $0.0287 per kWh generated for excess energy residents generate over the summer months. The utility credits $0.0284 per kWh generated for excess solar energy produced over the winter and spring months. For net metering, residents are charged a one-time fee of $226 per bidirectional single-phased meter per location, or $169 per three-phased meter.
On June 1, 2018, Missouri Senate Bill 564 (SB 564) was signed into law, which provided Ameren Missouri solar programs to offer solar rebates and also enable utility-owned solar. The framework affected programs to begin operations in January 2019.
SEIA
Community solar
During the 2022 legislative season, shared access to a statewide community solar program came close to passing under SB 824, but community solar has not been officially signed into law in the Show-Me State. Penned by Senator Bill White (R-Joplin), SB 824 proposes the state would implement a community solar pilot program which run for a three-year phase, from 2023 through 2025. The legislation calls for electric utilities to honor the pilot program until the total solar demand from community program subscribers equals 2% of the electric utility’s sales for the previous year.
Third-party entities or subscriber administrators will not be classified as electric suppliers under the community solar bill, leaving them outside of the jurisdiction of the Missouri Public Service Commission, the state’s utility regulator.
Missourians participating in the community program would also receive a credit to offset their electric bill, with the value of that credit to be determined by the PSC. Credits would be determined based on the value of a kilowatt hour of energy. Another credit would also be established for low-to-moderate income residents.
While shared community solar projects are not yet mainstream across the state, Ameren is already operating two of its own community sites under its Community Solar program, with one in Lambert, Mo. (0.9 MW) adjacent to St. Louis Lambert International Airport,  and another in Montgomery County (5.7 MW). The company plans to continue investing in renewable energy hubs and customer accessibility across the state over the next several years as part of its commitment to minimizing its carbon footprint.
According to the National Renewable Energy Lab’s “Sharing the Sun” community solar database, over 18 MW of community solar projects were installed across Missouri through early 2022.
Net zero aspirant
In 2022, the city of Columbia, Mo. revised a 2004 ordinance, making a net zero pledge to become 100% renewable powered by December 2030. As of December 2022, its utility Columbia Water & Light purchased or generated 18.2% of its total electricity from renewable energy resources, of which wind (12.9%), landfill gas to energy (2.9%) and solar (2.3%) represented its renewable portfolio, according to the municipality’s website.
Over the past year, the city of Columbia has also grown its net-metered solar portfolio from 3.76 MW to 4.75 MW of installed solar capacity, as 112 new customers added rooftop solar or expanded existing systems in 2022, according to its website.
The average cost for renewable energy in Columbia, Mo. was $37.77 per  MWh in 2022, 19.2% higher than $31.67 per MWh for conventional power, the city stated.
Notable installation
On May 7, 2021, Columbia Water & Light celebrated the commercial operations of Truman Solar, a 10 MW utility solar project built by DEPCOM Power in Columbia, Mo. with 35,019 modules on a 90.3-acre site. The solar facility is connected to the 13.8 kV Rebel Hill substation and produced 23.3 GWh of clean energy over its first year at a cost of $44.81 per MWh, representing 1.8% of the city’s total energy system. The City of Columbia holds a 30-year power purchase agreement for the facility.
