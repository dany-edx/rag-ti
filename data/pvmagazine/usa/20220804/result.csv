Princeton University released a Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT) in collaboration with Dartmouth College, Evolved Energy Research, and Carbon Impact Consulting, outlining the potential impact of the bill should it become law.
The impact on the US solar industry would be huge, to say the least. Princeton said solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said Princeton.
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The Act would lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said the report.
Annual US energy expenditures are expected to fall by at least 4% in 2030 under the act, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses and industry. This translates into hundreds of dollars in annual energy cost savings for US households. Tax credits, rebates, and federal investments in the Act would shift costs from energy bills to the progressive federal tax base.
The Act has numerous provisions to boost solar, from a long-term extension of the solar investment tax credit at 30%, to $30 billion in production tax credits for renewable energy and storage manufacturing, a 100% manufacturing tax credit, and other funds to support environmental justice and agriculture.
The REPEAT report said the Inflation Reduction Act could cut annual emissions in 2030 by an additional 1 billion metric tons below current policy, including the impacts from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This would represent closing two-thirds of the remaining emissions gap between current policy and the nation’s 2030 target of lowering emissions 50% below 2005 levels.
“It really makes me incredibly optimistic,” said Princeton’s Jesse Jenkins, leader of the REPEAT Project. “It doesn’t get us all the way there on its own, but it keeps us in the climate fight.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/04/remote-yukon-gold-mine-encampment-now-powered-by-solar-and-batteries/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,CANADA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 4, 2022","Remote Yukon gold mine encampment now powered by solar, batteries","Solvest announced it has activated a 27 kW solar, 121 kWh battery storage system at Snowline Gold’s Forks camp, a remote gold mine encampment in Yukon, Canada. 
The off-grid system is comprised of 64 bifacial modules on a ground mount, a lithium-ion battery bank, and a power rack organizing the off-grid equipment. The entire kit was designed to be modular and mobile so that it could be flown via helicopter to the remote mine.
The array will power the 45-person exploration camp and charge the battery bank, saving an estimated 12,527 liters of fuel savings annually, representing a 90% reduction in carbon emissions. The project means the camp will no longer rely solely on a diesel generator, which creates noise pollution and disturbs residents and wildlife.
“Remote mineral exploration camps are faced with many challenges including high fuel and transportation costs. This challenge presents an opportunity for highly economic solar-battery system deployments which also achieve significant and impactful emissions reductions. Solvest is proud to have had the opportunity to work with great partners in NNDDC and Snowline Gold to deliver this first of its kind project and we hope it becomes a blueprint for others to follow”, said Ben Power, CEO and co-founder of Solvest.
The system is designed, constructed, and maintained by Solvest, while the Na-Cho Nyäk Dun Development Corporation (NNDDC) owns the operational assets. The project provides direct economic benefit to Yukon First Nations.
“We see this investment as just the first of many of its kind and we are working towards building a fleet that can be deployed throughout the Traditional Territory,” said Jani Djokic, CEO NNDDC.
Solvest started operations in the Yukon region in 2015 and has become an expert in remote northern PV and energy storage. Off-grid diesel generators are a common source of power in this region, which require expensive deliveries of gas to remote locations, and contribute to noise pollution. Solvest’s mission is to reduce remote communities reliance on diesel and enable them to become more self-sufficient.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/04/doe-offers-26-million-to-demonstrate-that-grid-can-run-on-clean-energy/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 4, 2022",DOE offers $26 million to demonstrate that grid can run on clean energy,"The Biden-Harris Administration, through the US Department of Energy (DOE), announced $26 million to fund up to ten projects that will demonstrate that America’s electricity grid can run reliably on renewables.
The $26 million is funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Solar and Wind Grid Services and Reliability Demonstration Program, and it intends to show not just that a mix of solar, wind, energy storage, and other clean distributed energy resources can provide enough energy, but that grid services, which maintain voltage and frequency stability, can ensure grid reliability. Demonstrating that a grid fully powered by inverter-based resources can reliably provide these services is a necessary step in the clean energy transition.
Projects funded under this program will support the development of controls and methods for inverter-based clean energy resources to provide the same grid services as traditional generation. The intended goal is to increase the reliability of energy systems, which will help meet the Biden administration’s goals for 100% clean electricity by 2030.
“Americans do not have to choose between a clean grid and a reliable one as we move forward towards our goals of a net-zero economy by 2050,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Thanks to funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, DOE is proving that transitioning to solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources can keep the lights on without service interruptions, while creating good paying jobs.”
Today’s mix of clean energy technologies presents a new challenge to grid operators, and while new tools have been developed that enable grid operators to manage this complex network, DOE is supporting the demonstration of these tools at a broader scale to increase their adoption and build trust among grid operators. Today the potential for grid disruptions is real, including threats such as cyberattack, extreme weather events and wildfires. The demonstration program should prove that clean energy sources are able to support the grid during normal as well as emergency situations.
DOE is encouraging academic institutions, private companies, nonprofits, state and local governments, and tribal nations to apply and form diverse teams that include representation from entities such as historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions, and community-based organizations.   Projects will also demonstrate how a clean energy grid prevents blackouts by quickly identifying and responding to faults.  The testing will take place at plants of at least 10 MW in size from a mix of solar, wind, or other generation or storage technology,
To support grid enhancement and modernization, DOE is deploying more than $20 billion in federal financing tools, including through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s new $2.5 billion Transmission Facilitation Program, $3 billion expansion of the Smart Grid Investment Grant Program, and more than $10 billion in grants for States, Tribes, and utilities to enhance grid resilience and prevent power outages, and through existing tools, including the more than $3 billion Western Area Power Administration Transmission Infrastructure Program, and a number of loan guarantee programs through the Loan Programs Office.
An informational webinar will be held on August 17 at 1 p.m. ET. Mandatory concept papers are due by September 1 at 5 p.m. ET.

Aces Delta, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development LLC, plans to build an underground storage project with a capacity of 300 GWh in Delta, Utah.
Advanced Clean Energy Storage I, LLC recently won a $504.4 million loan guarantee from US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office for the construction of the storage facility. The project will store hydrogen generated by the Intermountain Power Agency’s IPP Renewed Project – an 840 MW hydrogen-capable gas turbine combined cycle power plant located in the area.
“The plant will initially run on a blend of 30% green hydrogen and 70% natural gas starting in 2025 and incrementally expand to 100% green hydrogen by 2045,” Aces Delta said in a statement.
US-based contractor WSP USA has secured an engineering, procurement and construction management contract (EPCM) to build the two underground hydrogen storage caverns, each with a capacity of 150 GWh.
“This stored green hydrogen becomes an energy reserve that can be released to produce fuel for electric power generation at any time,” said WSP USA.
The storage caverns and the power plant will form the Advanced Clean Energy Storage hub, which Aces Delta says will convert renewable energy via 220 MW of electrolyzers to produce up to 100 metric tons of green hydrogen per day. The development of the project began in May 2019.
“Central Utah is the ideal location for this project, and Utah is a business-friendly state for projects like this,” said Craig Broussard, CEO of Magnum. “Magnum’s site adjacent to the Intermountain Power Project is positioned to take full advantage of existing regional electricity grid connections, fully developed transportation infrastructure, ample solar and wind development capacity, a skilled workforce currently transitioning away from coal, and, of course, the unique salt dome opportunity.”
Magnum Development also owns a domal-quality salt formation in the western United States and five operational salt caverns for liquid fuel storage.
