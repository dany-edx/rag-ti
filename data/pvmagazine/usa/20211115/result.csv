This occurred after the group held firm in its decision to keep its makeup hidden from the public.
“We strongly disagree with Commerce’s rationale for denying proprietary treatment of our identities,” the group said through its law firm, Washington, D.C. based Wiley Rein. It said the government is “well aware of the real risk of retaliation” that members of American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC) face from the Chinese government and Chinese competitors. “It is unfortunate that we are being forced to choose between revealing our identities and exercising our trade remedy rights.”
The group said it is “evaluating all options,” including refiling an anti-dumping (AD), anti-circumvention (CVD)  petition that would satisfy Commerce Department concerns.
In a November 10 decision, Abdelali Elouaradia, director of the Commerce Department’s AD-CVD office, said that A-SMACC’s insistence to keep the names of its member companies from the public would “prevent Commerce from obtaining and considering” information related to an inquiry.
Elouaradia wrote that “not disclosing A-SMACC members’ names publicly hampers interested parties from fully commenting on the requests for circumvention inquiries and may hamper them from commenting on certain issues that could arise if Commerce were to initiate circumvention inquiries.”
In a statement, Solar Energy Industries Association president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper called the decision to reject the petitions a “major victory for America’s 231,000 solar workers.”
She said the Commerce Department’s decision “provides a rush of certainty for companies to keep their investments moving, hire more workers and deploy more clean energy. This is a critical time for climate progress, and we cannot afford to go backwards at a time when we need to be deploying more clean energy than ever.”
In its November 15 statement, A-SMACC urged Commerce Department officials to consider launching their own circumvention actions and trade cases. The group said it was ready to work with the administration “to strengthen U.S. manufacturing, R&D and supply chains in the critically important solar sector, while meeting our nation’s renewable energy goals.” It said that although U.S. solar manufacturing is recovering, “we should not have to compete with the unfair trade practices of China and Chinese-owned companies.”

The New England College Renewable Partnership (NECRP) said the project led to capital expenditures of around $150 million. It also will generate nearly $17 million in tax revenue over the next 30 years. 
A unit of NextEra Energy Resources built the facility, and Competitive Energy Services operated as advisor to the colleges.
The contract locks in the price of electricity supplied to the schools, offering savings and predictability for budgeting. Amherst, Bowdoin, Hampshire, Smith, and Williams each sourced a portion of the project’s total generation.

Bowdoin College signed up for 5% of the total production, and targets 100% renewable energy to power campus-wide operations by the end of 2023.
Bowdoin has a relatively long history of investing in solar. Its first project developed in 2014 with Solar City was at the time the largest rooftop installation in the state of Maine. The college’s renewable energy push is in conjunction with a longer-term goal of electrifying the campus’s heating load.
Larger projects like this 490-acre facility, which offer lower prices due to economies of scale, are otherwise too large to source by smaller colleges. The NECRP potentially presents a workable model for further solar collaboration in the educational and institutional space.
The approach mirrors the corporate world’s adoption of solar, where companies also sign power purchase agreements on large-scale off-site facilities.
For example,  McDonald’s and eBay signed up to buy energy from the 345 MW Ventress solar project in Louisiana this past August. McDonald’s aims for a 31% reduction in emissions intensity per metric ton of food and packaging across its supply chain by 2030 from 2015 levels. eBay, meanwhile, is working towards achieving 100% renewable energy-powered operations by 2025.

U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmark: Q1 2021 details installed costs for PV systems as of the first quarter of 2021.
The report said that costs continue to fall for residential, commercial rooftop, and utility-scale PV systems by 3%, 11%, and 12%, respectively, compared to last year.
In a change from previous years’ reports, balance of systems costs have increased or remained flat across sectors this year. However, the report said this increase in balance of systems cost was offset by a 19% reduction in module cost, causing overall costs to continue their decade-long decline.
The report’s authors used a cost modeling approach that accounts for all system and project development costs incurred during installation to model the costs for residential, commercial, and utility-scale PV systems, with and without energy storage. They also modeled typical installation techniques and business operations from an installed-cost perspective. NREL said this approach helps ensure that hardware costs reflect the actual purchase price of components as well as the sales price paid to the installer, including profits. The benchmarks assume a business environment unaffected by the novel coronavirus pandemic and represent national averages.
The major cost drivers that helped reduce the system installation costs of PV and energy storage systems in Q1 2021 were lower module cost, increased module efficiency, and lower battery pack cost, said NREL’s solar and storage techno-economic analyst, Vignesh Ramasamy.
Starting with the 2020 PV benchmark report, NREL began including PV-plus-storage and standalone energy storage costs in its annual reports. The 2021 benchmark report finds continued cost declines across residential, commercial, and industrial PV-plus-storage systems, with the greatest cost declines for utility-scale systems (up to a 12.3% reduction). Standalone storage systems also experienced cost declines.
A major component of total installed system costs is the cost of the PV modules. In a second report, Photovoltaic Module Technologies: 2020 Benchmark Costs and Technology Evolution Framework Results, NREL researchers calculated a minimum sustainable price (MSP)—the price necessary to support a sustainable business over the long term—for modules. The report calculated that price by using bottom-up manufacturing cost analysis and applying a gross margin of 15%.
The report benchmarked three established, mass-produced PV technologies as well as two technologies that NREL described s “promising” and that currently are under development or in pilot production.
Crystalline silicon (c-Si) dominates the current PV market, and its MSPs are the lowest—$0.25–$0.27/watt across the c-Si technologies analyzed. Cadmium telluride (CdTe) modules have a slightly higher MSP ($0.28/watt), and the copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) MSP takes a still bigger step up ($0.48/watt), largely as a result of higher labor, equipment, and facility costs.
The two developing technologies the report considers are III-V and perovskite PV technologies. At $77/watt, the III-V MSP benchmark is higher than the benchmarks for established technologies, which has kept III-V PV technology in niche markets, such as space and terrestrial concentrator applications. NREL said this challenge is reflected in the III-V road map, in which several potential cost reductions still result in a long-term projection of $20/watt, some two orders of magnitude higher than the long-term MSPs of the other technologies. However, III-V modules could still be worth pursuing, the report said, because they are the highest-efficiency PV products on the market. The current highest research-cell efficiency is 47.1% for a multijunction III-V device, and even higher efficiencies are possible.
The report also offered NREL’s first techno-economic assessment of perovskite PV modules. The estimated MSP for a single-junction sheet-to-sheet perovskite module at a small production scale is $0.38/watt, with potential cost reductions projected to reduce the MSP over the long term to $0.18/watt, assuming performance can be improved without driving up costs. Perovskites can also be combined with other PV technologies in multijunction configurations. The report estimated an MSP of $0.31/watt for perovskite-on-Si tandem modules in early production based on pilot production results.
Cost reductions from economies of scale as production grows and the accumulation of manufacturing experience are also important, but they are not included in NREL’s cost-reduction road maps. Other module price drivers not captured in this analysis include global supply and demand fluctuations, domestic policies related to PV deployment and manufacturing, trade policies, and corporate strategies.
