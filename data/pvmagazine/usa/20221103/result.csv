Researchers at the University of Alcalá in Spain have developed a cooling technique for solar modules that uses an underground, single–phase, closed-loop heat exchanger circuit that acts as a natural heat sink.
“Our analyses, made for various types of residential and commercial installations, show that the system is economically viable with investment amortization periods that range between five and 10 years,” researcher Ignacio Valiente Blanco told pv magazine.
The cooling technique involves the application of a heat exchanger onto the back side of a solar panel to remove excess heat. This heat is transferred underground by a coolant fluid that is refrigerated by another U-shape heat exchanger introduced in a borehole at a depth of 15 meters, filled with natural water from the aquifer in the underground.
“The cooling system needs extra energy to activate the pump of the coolant,” the researchers explained. “As it is a closed-circuit, the potential energy difference between the bottom of the borehole and the solar panel does not impact the power consumption of the cooling system.”
The scientists tested the cooling system at an off-grid PV installation, which they described as representative of a typical solar farm with single–axis tracking systems. The array consists of two 270 W modules supplied by Spain’s Atersa. They feature a temperature coefficient of –0.43% per degree Celsius.
The heat exchanger of the solar panel is mainly composed of a set of six plastically deformed, flattened U-shaped copper tubes, each measuring 15 mm in diameter. The tubes are all thermally isolated by polyethylene foam and are connected to common 18-mm-diameter inlet and outlet collectors. The research group used using a constant coolant flow rate of 3 l/min or 1.8 l/min per square meter of solar panel.
The experiment showed that the cooling tech could reduce the operating solar module temperature by between 13 C and 17 C. It also improved module performance by around 11%, which means that during an entire day, the cooled panel would provide 152 Wh more than its uncooled counterpart, according to the study.
The academics introduced the cooling system in “Efficiency Improvement of Photovoltaic Solar Modules by Cooling Using an Underground Heat Exchanger,” which was recently published in the Journal of Solar Energy Engineering.
“With the necessary investment, the system is perfectly usable in conventional installations,” said Valiente Blanco.

Innovation, economies of scale, and incentivization have driven down costs and placed the technology in the center stage as a major component of new builds going forward.
In fact, U.S. construction prices for solar have been cut in half since 2013. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that in 2013, solar project construction costs were nearly $4,000 per kW on average. As of 2020, those costs have fallen to an average of $1,655 per kW for utility-scale developers.
Meanwhile, wind turbine construction costs have remained relatively flat, increasing slightly in recent years. Wind projects averaged less than $2,000 per kW to construct in 2013, and in 2020 averaged $1,498 per kW. Like solar, wind energy is set to have further cost relief from incentives contained within the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Natural gas facilities have also been relatively the same cost to construct over the same time period. In 2013, it was roughly $1,000 per kW to build a natural gas plant, while in 2020 the technology averaged $1,116 per kW.
While natural gas remains cheaper than solar and wind, energy production should pay heed to differences in environmental externalities. This sentiment is increasingly being reflected in utility resource plans and U.S. industrial policy, which contain heavier incentives for renewable, non-emitting resources.
These three technologies—solar, wind, and natural gas—accounted for over 95% of the capacity added to the U.S. electric grid in 2020, said EIA. Investment in new electric generating capacity in 2020 increased by 40% compared with 2019 to $46.3 billion dollars.
By technology, tracking crystalline silicon utility-scale solar projects had the lowest average construction cost on a per kW basis in 2020. These projects were $1,587 per kW on average, followed by cadmium telluride tracking projects ($1,631), fixed-tilt cadmium telluride projects ($1,684), and fixed-tilt crystalline silicon ($1,957). Note that regional differences in tracker types used may affect the cost per kW. For example, in New England, single-axis trackers support only 8% of active capacity, while 86% of capacity in the Plains region are mounted on single-axis trackers.
While supply chain issues and increased logistics costs have caused a rise in solar project construction costs since 2020, the larger trend is that economies of scale and incentive support will continue to alleviate cost pressures. The American Clean Power Association (ACP) said in its quarterly report that the U.S. may deploy 550 GW of renewable energy by 2030. Solar is expected to lead the charge in this decade of energy transition, representing 59% of active renewable energy projects in queues.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/03/utility-scale-solar-slowed-in-q3-2022-but-momentum-expected-to-build/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 3, 2022",Utility-scale solar slowed in Q3 2022,"With just under 1.9 GW of utility-scale solar installed in Q3 2022, the industry experienced its slowest quarter since Q3 2020. This was expected to be a landmark year for solar, but global supply challenges have hampered growth, delayed projects, and driven up prices.  
Despite this, long-term optimism remains. The American Clean Power Association (ACP) said in its quarterly report that the U.S. may deploy 550 GW of renewable energy by 2030. Solar is expected to lead the charge in this decade of energy transition, representing 59% of active renewable energy projects in queues. Along the way, the U.S. is expected to cut economy-wide emissions by 40% below 2005 levels. This progress will be accomplished by a clean power workforce of 1 million, said ACP.
“President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law on August 16th. This unprecedented national commitment to clean power is the largest policy investment in clean energy on record. The IRA is set to catalyze clean energy growth, ultimately more than tripling annual installations of wind, solar, and battery storage by the end of the decade,” said the report.
Despite a slow quarter, 2022 remains the second highest year for solar deployment in history, falling just behind 2021 totals. Quarterly installs were down 23% compared to the same period next year. This slowdown may persist for some time as solar module supply issues remain, and the U.S. works to inject Inflation Reduction Act funds into a new domestic manufacturing supply chain.
In total, solar installations in 2022 reach just over 7 GW. This brings total utility-scale solar operating capacity to 68 GW. In-quarter, developers activated 41 solar projects, spanning 18 states and totaling 1.87 GW, said ACP. California leads in cumulative installed operating capacity with 16.8 GW active, followed by Texas with 9.9 GW. Iowa increased its solar capacity by nearly 40% this quarter by installing 100 MW.
The largest utility-scale solar project commissioned this quarter was Old 300 Solar, a 430 MW facility in Texas. Developed by Ørsted, the project is selling its capacity to Microsoft via a power purchase agreement.
Utility-scale solar remains dominantly characterized by crystalline-silicon (C-Si) panels, though thin-film panels hold a sizeable foothold in the market. Of the total operational facilities, 69% are C-Si, and 25% are thin-film. Six percent of projects have not reported technology used. Thin-film deployment had landmark years in 2010 and 2014, where it represented more than 50% of installs. It is possible the technology will gain ground on C-Si, as the U.S. domestic manufacturing supply chain ramps up. Thin-film panels are typically provided by U.S. companies, primarily First Solar, which provides thin-film Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) panels.
Single-axis trackers, which rotate panels on one axis to follow the sun, are a rising trend in this sector, said ACP. The technology currently accounts for 61% of operating solar capacity. Fixed-tilt mounts make up 25% of operational capacity, while 2% use a dual-axis tracker. ACP said it is unable to determine the remaining 12% of operating capacity.
Makeup of tracker technologies varies widely by state. In New England, single-axis trackers support only 8% of active capacity, while 86% of capacity in the Plains region are mounted on single-axis trackers.

Due to the growing threat of blackouts, the DoD, through its Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP), has enlisted Xendee, a provider of microgrid development software, to help cut energy system engineering costs.
Xendee’s software is demonstrated at three DoD installations. At the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia, a project design focus is resilience against outages, and another initiative was examining the ongoing installation upgrades to determine feasibility, return and alternatives. For the USAG Bavaria project in Grafenwöhr/Vilseck, Germany, the focus included optimizing investment, placement, dispatch, financial analysis, power flow engineering and training for Army staff. The Naval Base San Diego used the Xendee platform to examine how an onsite microgrid installation could be more cost- and emission-efficient than running new cabling to the building.
To support these installations, Xendee partnered with Arizona State University to create a specialized curriculum designed to train service members on how to use the Xendee software. Xendee also completed DoD Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), making it a cyber secure platform for DoD applications. The Xendee platform can model up to 25 different distributed energy resource technologies and calculates the optimal techno-economic solution for each site to meet organizational goals. These goals can include reducing costs, cutting CO2 emissions, increasing resilience, or a combination of all three.
Xendee’s platform assessed various of technologies at these installations: solar, battery storage, diesel generators, heat pumps, combined heat and power (CHP) engines, and cable and transformer upgrades. Xendee’s optimization engine analyzed and optimized the investment strategy taken, the sizing and placement of technologies, and the actual dispatch of the system over every time step of the year.
“Our primary objective was to train uniformed and civilian military personnel on a standardized, repeatable process for building and interpreting microgrid models,” said Nathan Johnson, Associate Professor in The Polytechnic School at Arizona State University and Director of the Laboratory for Energy And Power Solutions (LEAPS). “Additionally, by mapping the training program and certificates to military job codes, ASU and Xendee have created a pipeline for training and deploying DoD certified users at scale.” This effort extends a history of training provided by Arizona State University to installation personnel and transitioning Veterans.
Xendee recently announced an integration with UtilityAPI to offer engineers more accurate load data and emission profiles. The integration is meant to aid users in efficiently downloading past building load data directly from utilities, giving engineers more accuracy in past usage and peak project requirements. Xendee also unveiled its new multi-node feature for designing sustainable communities, large facilities, and utility-scale microgrids, which enables users to connect up to 25 different technologies to generate advanced microgrid designs applicable to real-world positioning.

Formed earlier this year by Copenhagen, Denmark-based European Energy, EE North America is developing a 10 GW project portfolio of solar, storage and wind projects in the U.S. through 2026, with Arizona representing 20% of its project pipeline.
European Energy has a 40 GW global project development pipeline with solar projects in 19 countries and wind farms in 14 countries in Europe and Latin America. The company holds a majority interest in ten affiliated companies developing solar and storage projects in Massachusetts, Maine, Delaware and Texas, among other states, according to its 2021 annual report.
Elio Energy Group is an Austin, Texas-based greenfield project developer whose management team led by Davin Mehta is developing 2.5 GW of solar and storage projects in Texas, Arizona, North Carolina and South Carolina, with a 6 GW long-term pipeline. The team’s recent project, Pflugerville Solar Farm (144 MW) in Travis County, Texas, was acquired in January 2021 by Duke Energy Renewables from Canadian Solar company Recurrent Energy.
This portfolio will bolster Arizona’s already strong solar standing, which, according to SEIA, Arizona ranks fifth in U.S. solar deployments with 5.98 GW of current project installations as of September 8, while the state ranks sixth in the country for jobs, with 8,278 employees currently working in the Arizona solar industry.

In addition to a domestic supply agreement, the alliance also includes joint investment opportunities in emerging technologies to improve lithium battery performance and supply chain optimization.
ABF and Anovion were recent recipients of federal grant funding from the Department of Energy under President Biden’s 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which awarded a total of $2.8 billion to advanced materials companies that have begun to source battery material components from new and recycled materials using lithium, graphite and other materials sourced in North America.
American Fork, Utah-based ABF is receiving $57.7 million in DOE funding to build and operate a 5,000 metric tons per year lithium hydroxide cathode material production facility near sedimentary mining resources in Tonopah, Nevada. The cathode facility will have the ability to expand over time to produce 30,000 MT/y of the LiH material as demand for EV batteries ramps up. The Nevada facility will create 150 jobs and the facility is partnered with the University of Nevada – Reno and the Southwest Central Regional Economic Development Authority to support hiring and regional business interest in the advanced materials facility.
Chicago-based Anovion is receiving $117 million in DOE funding under the Bipartisan legislation to expand and modify a $294 million capital cost synthetic graphite anode production facility in Sanborn, New York, in order to produce 150,000 MT/y of anode material for EV and energy storage applications.  The facility near Niagara Falls, NY will have initial production capacity of 35,000 MT/y and will bring 300 long-term jobs to a region effected by industrial job offshoring over the years. Community support for the Anovion project comes from Niagara County and the State University of New York – University of Buffalo.
“Anovion’s leadership team has a proven track record of manufacturing a high-quality product with excellent performance and consistency,” said Paul Charles, CEO of American Battery. “We are pleased to collaborate with a US-based supplier who shares our values and vision for the overall battery market and is equally committed to making energy independence a reality for everyone,” said Charles.
The Department of Energy on October 19 awarded $2.8 billion in a first phase of project funding under President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for EVs, energy storage, aerospace and defense applications, among others.  ABF and Anovion were among 20 corporate recipients to funding of advanced material production and recycling facilities located in 12 states.

All three of California’s large, for-profit utilities have come out against the proposal. The Public Advocate’s Office of California has suggested that the proposal be dismissed, as the group would like to complete its own microgrid standards development.
The proposal is partially based upon the definition of an `electric microutility’, as per Section 2780 of California’s Public Utility Code. The code defines the microutiliy as:
Any electrical corporation that is regulated by the commission and organized for the purpose of providing sole-source renewable and stand-by generation, distribution, and sale of electricity exclusively to a customer base of fewer than 2,000 customers.
The original filing, Application…for a Certificate…To Construct and Operate Public Utility Microgrids and to Establish Rates for Service, is based on a simulation of a proposed 500 customer community by SCMC. The average home size of 2,300 sq feet would require a 7 kW solar system and a battery with two 5-10 kWh batteries. The community would build an additional 300 kW solar plant and have a local standalone battery of approximately 2 MWh. The plan includes a backup generator with a capacity of 2 MW.
SCMC estimates the installation would cost $8 to $10 million. Analysis suggests that the microgrid would experience less than 30 minutes of annual down time, and could supply power in isolation for over 300 hours if the broader grid went down.
Homes within the microgrid would get approximately 82% of their electricity from the microgrid, and the remaining 18% from the grid.
Source: Sunnova public filing
The image above shows a simulation of a single family home within the microgrid. During the peak evening period, the home draws from its own battery before shifting to the microgrid battery (around 21:00). SCMS says that they expect to make use of the “Sunnova Adaptive Home technology to manage load through behavioral demand response,” to mitigate grid demand during critical peak periods.
Because each project’s generation capacity is less than 50 MW, distribution equipment is under 50 kV, and costs are under $50 million, these microgrids are small enough to avoid the detailed scrutiny of utility scale projects.
The state’s for-profit utilities have advanced a handful of justifications for the proposal to be dismissed.
Among San Diego Gas & Electric Company’s objections is an argument that Sunnova’s microgrid cannot be defined as an electricity microutility, since a microutility must get its electricity from a single source, and Sunnova’s proposal indicates that 18% of their proposed microgrid’s electricity would be supplied by the broader grid. The utility company also advanced an argument stating that since the electric microutility account limit is 2,000 customers, Sunnova’s plan to create multiple unique companies containing 2,000 customers inappropriately attempts to circumvent those rules.
Source: Sunnova public filing
Pacific Gas & Electric took issue with Sunnova’s proposal as well, pointing out that an electric microutility is required to submit exact designs of their facility before being approved as a microutility. However, SCMC had already stated that they would provide designs upon creation of the individual communities.
The state’s Public Advocacy Office filed a motion to dismiss the application. Their first objection notes that if SCMC’s proposal were approved in its requested form, it would be operating under “drastically limited regulations,” and would require a number of rules to be waived. They also expressed concerns about how rate-making would be established.
The Public Advocacy Office also requested that the state finish designing its own microgrid rules before proceeding. Those rules have been under development since 2020.
Sunnova has since filed a response to the dismissal, and to many of the arguments put forward by the utilities.
A group of five, including the Center for Biological Diversity, filed a proposal in support of SCMC, noting that SCMC’s proposal gives California a chance to commercialize the microgrids within the state. They cite the 2030 goal of deploying 2.5 million more homes in the state.
