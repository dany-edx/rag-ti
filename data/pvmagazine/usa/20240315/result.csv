California rulemaking signals changes in energy policy: The California Energy Center must now assess costs and benefits related to health and environmental externalities of energy generation and transmission. The rulemaking decision marks the first positive development for distributed renewable energy in California, a state that has taken numerous regressive policy actions over the past eighteen months.
What might a new administration cut from the Inflation Reduction Act?: A live podcast by Norton Rose Fulbright discussed how a Republican administration might handle the Inflation Reduction Act. The panel noted that several provisions have bipartisan support, including carbon capture, hydrogen, fuel credits and possibly domestic manufacturing tax credits. The group said repeal of the IRA may not be an all-or-nothing scenario, but a potential new administration may tweak or remove the things they don’t like.

Experts deep dive into IRA tax guidance: At SEIA’s annual Finance, Tax, and Buyer’s Seminar, key topics included tax credit transferability rules, the process of filing for and monetizing “elective pay”, domestic content and brownfield tax adders, capital structures, and the evolving finance structures. Also covered was the risk of tax credit recapture by the IRS, which can occur when solar projects fail to meet the technical requirements that initially qualified them for tax benefits.
Giant solar project in Texas secures nearly $600 million: Primergy Solar closed commitments for $588 million in debt financing for the 408 MW Ash Creek solar project in Hill County, Texas, south of Dallas. Once complete, the project is expected to generate the equivalent electricity demand of 90,000 homes per year, though it will be fully dedicated to Microsoft through a power purchase agreement.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/15/solar-can-help-with-marijuanas-green-problem/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW MEXICO,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-15,Solar can help with marijuana’s green problem,"Indoor cannabis growing operations use a staggering amount of electricity, requiring high-powered lighting, heating and cooling, ventilation, water pumping, and more.  
Back in 2012, before cannabis growth was legalized, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimated that 1% of the electricity consumed in the United States was diverted to indoor cannabis growing operations.
Since then, nearly half the states half legalized marijuana. Industry researcher Brightfield Group estimates the industry had $31.8 billion in annual sales in 2023, and that figure is expected to grow to $50.7 billion by 2028.
Today, fossil fuels still represent about 60% of U.S. electricity generation, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). According to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NPCC) one pound of cannabis growth requires about 2,000 kWh to 3,000 kWh of electricity consumption. For context, the average U.S. home uses about 900 kWh of electricity per month, said EIA.
This adds up to an enormous amount of greenhouse gas emissions to produce cannabis. While the industry could cut emissions by moving more production outdoors, or using more passive growing conditions like greenhouses, the quality and quantity advantages of growing indoors leaves little incentives for investors in large growing operations to change their operations fundamentally.
This creates an opportunity for the solar industry to step in as a partner to cannabis growers, helping cut emissions, lower electricity costs, and create a marketing competitive advantage for climate-conscious marijuana users.
One grower and processor, Bright Green Corporation, seized this opportunity, investing in a 102 MW solar project to power its new $250 million expansion project in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Maxeon Solar Technologies is providing the solar panels for the project, while Baker Tilly is leading construction.
The cannabis facility currently burns natural gas and oil for electricity. The company will now install three 40 MW electric boilers and power them with the solar facility, which is expected to take about 30 months to construct. Bright Green Energy said the cost savings over the 30-year lifetime of the equipment is expected to save the company “hundreds of millions of dollars.”
“This source of energy will reduce and fix our substantial heat and electric costs annually. The future growth of this company is highly dependent on Innovation and long-term efficiency,” said Lynn Stockwell, Bright Green Corporation founder. “The uncertainty of the long-term costs and pricing predicated on supply and demand for the traditional fossil fuels for this type of mega factory compared to clean energy from the sun advances the company’s economics and ethos.”

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/15/debunking-solar-myths-what-about-all-that-land/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,2024-03-15,Debunking solar myths: What about all that land?,"‘Uncle Bob’ is that proverbial character who shares at family gatherings all he believes to be true about solar and why it just isn’t a good idea. Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker, has had this experience. Based on his 33 years in the solar industry, he offers short, fact-based responses to Uncle Bob’s assertions, which range from “solar is taking coal jobs” to “solar is unreliable.”
In this part four of the series, Shugar debunks myths about solar using too much land.
The proverbial Uncle Bob asks, “What about all that land being used by solar, if we try to power the country with solar, the whole country is going to be covered with solar panels.”
You could say, listen Uncle Bob, if we were to power 100%, and I mean generate extra energy in the day so batteries are using their power at night for everything, solar would cover less than one half of 1% of the land area.
But of course, solar is not just on land. It is being put on rooftops on homes or businesses. It covers carports. We see those a lot of solar on schools and for systems that are on the ground, which typically follow the sun with a tracker, we’re seeing customers increasingly use dual-use applications. For example, one of our great customers, Silicon Ranch Corporation, has pioneered the idea of dual use with agriculture and ranching where we’re seeing many solar power plants grazing livestock, sheep, cattle, and pollinators.
There’s plenty of area out there and we’re creating economic value in communities where projects are being built. We’re not manufacturing things in a faraway land and dumping them in communities, but they’re being made in the communities in which they’ll be used.
One of the most gratifying projects we’ve done at Nextracker with our manufacturing partner, J.M. Steel, brought new life to a manufacturing facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that had previously been a Bethlehem Steel facility, but it had been dormant for many decades. In fact, at that exact facility they made landing aircraft that were used to support the Normandy landing in World War Two. But we were able to use that existing technology with steel conveyors and equipment and infrastructure to start making modern solar plants. So, we’ve been able to create a new ecosystem.
It’s the ground zero of the new industrial revolution in clean energy.
Episode four: What about all that land being used by solar?
 
We’ll continue this series with fact-based responses to additional myths such as “solar takes too many coal jobs”.
Stay tuned as we unpack these objections, so you’re ready for your next dinner party with Uncle Bob.

Over 4,500 ET Solar modules will be mounted on an Erthos mounting system, and because of the unique qualities of Erthos, the project will take up just 4 acres of land and is expected to take just nine weeks to install. Chaberton told pv magazine USA that being in a suburban setting, the project is significantly land constrained.
“The Erthos solution provides the highest electricity production per acre and also provides a low-profile solution relative to conventional racking systems, which helped us secure the support of the surrounding community,” Chaberton said.
The project is expected to be built this summer using what Erthos calls Earth Mount Solar, because it installs solar on the ground with no mounts or trackers below. While most utility-scale solar installations use single-axis trackers, Erthos said that with the drop in solar module prices, it is more cost-effective to buy additional solar modules to make up for the loss of efficiency from foregoing trackers.
The company said the design also increases panel density, which reduces the amount of land needed. Visual impact is minimal because the modules sit on the ground. And the company says it can install the modules in about half the time.
“This project is not just a step towards expanding our footprint; it’s a leap into the future of solar energy,” said Jared Donald, president and CEO of PureSky Energy. “By utilizing the Erthos mounting system, we are setting a new standard for solar installations that are both community-friendly and efficient.”
PureSky Energy, based in Denver, Colo., is a developer, owner, and operator of community solar, C&I and storage projects. The company entered the U.S. market in 2016 and now has approximately 233 MW installed across 44 sites or under-construction projects expected to be completed in the short term.
Chaberton Energy, based in Maryland, is a public benefit corporation focused on developing sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy projects. Its work ranges from site conception to full operations. After four years of growth, Chaberton reports it controls 650+ MW of community solar sites in Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, New Jersey and Italy.

Canada’s Capsolar, a manufacturer of vehicle-integrated PV (VIPV) systems, recently completed an electric tow tractor ground transport project.
“We designed, built and installed the solar PV system, including the electronic and physical integrations. It is used at one of the largest US-based automotive industry original equipment manufacturers (OEMs),” Capsolar’s CEO, Samy Benhamza, told pv magazine. “Our customer uses electric ground-support vehicles for heavy-duty material transport.”
The Capsolar system consists of 5.6 kW of power based on 20 solar panels, a high-efficiency controller system, and a data management tracking platform. It enables a 30% to 40% range increase per battery charge, according to Benhamza.
Looking ahead, the Canadian company is in discussion to equip the rest of the OEM’s fleet with “an improved and larger system with higher efficiency.”
The U.S. ground support vehicle project comes on the back of Capsolar completing construction of a 3 MW pilot line at 560.3 m2 facility in Montreal, Quebec.
Capsolar was founded in 2020 and began developing custom PV systems for small vehicles, such as electric golf carts, and has since expanded into electric passenger vehicles, boating and ground transportation applications.
It typically uses cells supplied by US-based manufacturer Maxeon that have 24% efficiency, along with high-efficiency charge controllers to optimize power output. The company can customize module shape, texture, size, and color to match clients’ requests.
