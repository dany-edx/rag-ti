With all the advantages of a burgeoning solar industry come challenges, and finding workers is one of them.
Respondents to the Solar Jobs Census survey conducted by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) indicated that they expect a 9% growth in employees, which would bring the total to 287,632 solar workers. The report notes that in 2022, 44% of solar industry employers said it was “very difficult” to find qualified applicants—the highest such percentage ever recorded in the Solar Jobs Census.
To try to attract new workers, Solar Landscape, Edison Job Corps and Lyft are removing barriers by offering transportation. The partners are hoping that the offer of flexible transportation will help attract qualified candidates in under-represented communities and help to fill the growing number of clean energy jobs.
The project came to fruition as a result of a job training program identifying the need for reliable and flexible transportation for new workers. Called the STEP-UP program (for Solar Training and Education Partnerships for Underserved Populations), the national program partners with organizations to bring solar installer training to low-to moderate income communities as part of community solar projects. The STEP-UP program is run by career development firm Edison Job Corps, and has trained nearly 2,500 residents in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and New Mexico.
Edison Job Corps is a nationwide training program for students ages 16 to 24 with 120 campuses across the U.S. and  Puerto Rico. Since 1964, the program has offered hands-on training to more than 3 million individuals.for careers ranging from  healthcare to IT to construction to solar installations. A great benefit to low-income students is that it is fully funded by the Federal government and free to students. Edison Job Corps will administer the workforce partnership program by providing the Lyft credits to its trainees and graduates.
Solar Landscape is developer, designer, installer, owner, and operator of community solar and solar energy solutions for the commercial/industrial, municipal, public school and non-profit marketplaces. The company currently employs more than 150 people and has more than 200 MW of solar energy projects completed or under construction.
The partnership between the three organizations is expected to provide hundreds of Lyft rides to Edison Job Corps students who need reliable transportation to job interviews or the first few weeks of a new job.
“This partnership is truly a bridge to brighter futures,” said Kate Gold, director of workforce at Solar Landscape. “As the demand for commercial rooftop solar continues to surge, so does the need for jobs in the sector. We’re grateful to Lyft and Edison Job Corps for innovating with us to creatively connect community members to jobs in clean energy and help kickstart new careers.”

A solar panel supply chain often starts with silicon, which is then processed into ingots, then wafers, then cells, and finally assembled into a module, otherwise known as a solar panel. While the U.S. has large amounts of module manufacturing capacity, ingot, wafer, and cell capacities lag behind, and expansion of these capabilities will be essential to establishing a domestic supply chain.
RE:Build Manufacturing said the system was redesigned to meet or exceed the most stringent U.S. safety standards and provide a secure and reliable environment for crystal growth operations. The RBM600 offers integrated process monitoring and data insights capabilities designed to maximize output and minimize downtime.
The RBM600 comes standard with the capability for a 600 Kg charge size producing up to a 300 mm diameter ingot. With the optional top-off feeder, the ingot length can be as much as 3.2 M long. In addition, the RBM600 comes standard with a hot zone and product recipe to enable immediate production following installation, said the company.
“Our hardware and process expertise combined with our unique software and digital tools put the RBM600 at the forefront of crystal growth technology,” said Miles Arnone, chief executive officer, Re:Build Manufacturing. “The team’s dedication to innovation and their deep understanding of robust, industrial process development are evident in every aspect of the RBM600’s design and functionality. We are proud to play a role in the future of photovoltaic manufacturing in the U.S. and to create more jobs in a high-growth, high-tech industry.”
The RE:Build Manufacturing team will be exhibiting at the RE+ show in Las Vegas at booth #22002. The company is currently taking orders for delivery of the ingot maker for delivery by the end of 2024.
Re:Build Manufacturing was established with six employees in 2020 and has grown to over 850 people over eleven business units. The company has stated a mission to revitalizing America’s manufacturing base by creating long-term, sustainable jobs in areas that have been deindustrialized.
This article was amended on Augu. 25, 2023 to state that the company makes monosilicon, not polysilicon.

A group of Italian researchers has investigated the cost competitiveness of nine different floating PV (FPV) configurations installed on a water basin in Southern Italy, and compared it with that of ground mounted PV (GPV) systems. Their analysis was based on Capex and Opex, as well as on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE).
The scientists emphasized that moving a monofacial PV array from land to water increases the performance by almost 5%. “An additional 2.5% enhancement could be achieved if monofacial modules are replaced with bifacial modules,” they added. “More improvements are possible, as expected, if trackers are mounted.”
By using a tracker configured with a vertical axis in their simulation, the group found that the FPV system may provide a 20% higher yield compared to an FPV system with a fixed structure. It also ascertained that an FPV system relying on two-axis trackers may have a higher yield compared to a fixed and single vertical axis configuration, by 40% and 16%, respectively.
The scientists modeled the energy and economic performance of different FPV designs on a water basin in Sicily, Southern Italy, based on energy parameters sourced from previous literature. The model also takes into consideration potential revenues resulting from the reduced water evaporations thanks to the shading effect of the FPVs. This water may then be used for hydropower generation or in agriculture.
The academics also found that FPVs have a higher Capex than ground-based installations, noting that the floating solar technology is still at the early stage of development and the limited installed capacity of FPV compared to GPV. “In 2020, FPV had the same capacity that GPV achieved in the early 2000s,” they added.
The researchers conducted a sensitivity analysis of the LCOE to account for potential future reductions in the capital cost of FPVs. They concluded that with a 30% reduction in Capex, the bifacial FPV with fixed structures would be the most competitive system at the given location, resulting in a 19.9% reduction in LCOE compared with a fixed monofacial GPV.
The group emphasized that the use of non-evaporated water at FPV system sites can achieve revenues greater than $3/kW if used for irrigation and higher than $4/kW if sold to generate hydroelectricity. “This demonstrates the added value that active cooling and non-evaporated water can bring to the floating system,” they concluded.
Their findings are available in the report “Economic comparison of floating photovoltaic systems with tracking systems and active cooling in a Mediterranean water basin,” published in Energy for Sustainable Development. The group comprises researchers from the University of Catania, Sapienza University of Rome, and the University of Florence.
The researchers stressed that, while the conditions of the site in Sicily chosen for this comparative study could be considered representative of other locations overlooking the Mediterranean, “the quantitative results will have to be adjusted to the site-specific conditions of any new location where the investigation is repeated.”

The final determination was in line with the preliminary ruling made in December 2022, assessing a blanket finding of circumventing for the four named nations. Only three major suppliers from the four named countries were found not to be in violation: Jinko, Hanwha Qcells and Boviet. 
Clean Energy Associates (CEA) said that certain suppliers will not be able to avoid paying tariffs and are unlikely to export directly to the U.S. market after Biden’s tariff moratorium lifts on June 6, 2024. 
In an industry note, CEA said there are multiple pathways to continue to export to the U.S. duty free: 
CEA said that most suppliers will find it relatively easy to switch bill of material supply chains under the “no more than two” rule. As a result, CEA said it is likely module supply from Southeast Asia will continue, though some suppliers will likely have to adjust their supply chains to continue to enter the U.S. duty-free.
However, for cells exported directly to the U.S., it is more challenging to avoid duties. These suppliers will not be able to take advantage of the “no more than two” ruling.
“This limits the already scarce potential available supply of cells for U.S. module manufacturers, including the many module factories which have been announced and/or are under construction,” said CEA.
CEA noted that manufacturers in third countries, like India and Mexico, can import PV cells from the named countries, use these in module assembly, and export to the U.S. without being subject to duties. This applies to cells that would otherwise be subject to duties if exported directly to the U.S.
While the final ruling was not a positive or negative surprise in relation to the December 2022 preliminary ruling, it is set to pose challenges in cell supply in the U.S. Read more about the solar industry’s reaction to Commerce’s final ruling here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/23/extended-grid-infrastructure-grant-deadline-encourages-more-native-nations-to-apply/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,ALASKA,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"AUGUST 23, 2023",Extended grid infrastructure grant deadline encourages more Native Nations to apply,"The Department of Energy (DOE) announced that the Grid Deployment Office (GDO) is extending applications for its Grid Resilience State and Tribal Formula Grants program to August 31. This addendum applies to Native American Nations and Alaska Native Corporations. 
The decision was made in response to updated disaster data. This new information increased grant allocations for 243 tribes to better account for the probability of climate-related disruptions on native land. 
The program is funded through section 40101 of The Administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It provides awardees with capital to construct and renovate power grids better able to accommodate extreme weather and natural disasters resulting from climate change. This includes ensuring communities have continuous access to affordable reliable and green electricity. 
Allocation of funds to states and territories, in addition to Native American Tribes as well as Alaska Native Regional and Village Corporations, is based on population density land area likelihood of disruptive events and the locality’s historical expenditures on mitigation efforts. Those that receive funding must distribute investments among a diverse set of projects. 
Stakeholders are encouraged to prioritize financing developments that generate the most significant community benefit, in line with President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. Andy Sendy, founder and president of SolarReviews.com, suggests that aligning state and local policy with the Biden Administration’s agenda is one way to ensure continued domestic investments in infrastructure that uses renewables to power an equitable economy. 
To date, GDO has awarded 28 states 24 tribal entities one territory and the District of Columbia a combined total of $455.05 million. As of last week, California and Texas have received the highest funding at $67 and $60 million, respectively. The Galena Village (Louden Village) and Chalkyitsik Village Tribes in Alaska were awarded the lowest at $112,894 and $112,439. 
California will invest in reducing the frequency and duration of power outages. It will ensure that clean energy infrastructure is accessible to all residents, prioritizing safety and affordability so those in historically disadvantaged communities also get their energy needs met.
In Chalkyitsik Village, stakeholders will invest in decreasing the number of power outages and improving emergency response services after severe weather events. The funds will also be allocated toward developing battery energy storage systems while providing low-income tribal members access to affordable and reliable clean energy.
Louden Village will also allocate funds toward building and maintaining a reliable green-energy grid. Community members will research alternative backup power storage methods and advance partnerships with utilities to develop clean energy. 
Allocating funds toward researching energy storage systems can help to increase clean energy jobs, which the DOE suggests grew by 4% between 2021 and 2022.  
In response to feedback from Tribes, Native Nations and Alaska Native Corporations are now eligible to submit a single application as a Tribal Consortium. GDO will assist Tribes in modifying a submitted application if they wish to join a Tribal consortium. The grants are non-competitive.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/23/california-utility-settles-false-renewable-advertising-fined-175000/,"MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 23, 2023","California utility pays $175,000 settlement for false ‘renewable’ advertising","In a recent settlement with the state of California, the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) faced accusations of misleading the public regarding their use of “renewable natural gas.” Authorities in the state accused the company of violating two California laws: the Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 et seq.) and the False Advertising Law (§ 17500 et seq.)
Under the terms of the settlement SoCalGas is required to pay a fine of $175,000, halt its deceptive advertising that labels their gas as ‘renewable’, and release a statement on their website noting that only 5% of their gas originates from renewable sources.

The complaint filed by the state of California revealed that SoCalGas deliberately misled consumers. While ‘renewable’ gas does exist, the company falsely marketed their conventional gas product as such. The evidence is stark: in 2018, despite their claims of selling ‘renewable natural gas’, they sold absolutely none. By 2022, they had only managed to provide 5% renewable gas to residential, small commercial, and industrial customers.
In 2019, California authorities turned a spotlight on SoCalGas’s advertising tactics. They discovered that the company made sweeping ‘renewable’ marketing claims on informational displays, backdrops, and promotional items like hats, t-shirts, and notepads. These were widely distributed at approximately 14 conferences and community events that SoCalGas either participated in or sponsored. Among these events was the “Ag Expo,” a massive three-day gathering attracting approximately 100,000 attendees, where SoCalGas featured an ‘educational’ and interactive display. The company also sponsored a “Heal the Bay” event, providing a photo booth backdrop for attendees.
Gas is primarily composed of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Historically, the term ‘natural’ was applied to it in the 1800s to differentiate methane obtained directly from the ground from the gas derived from coal processing. Today, a more apt, modern descriptor for this energy source is ‘fossil gas’.
SoCalGas’s misrepresentation of its fuel as ‘renewable’ gas, as described by California’s filing, references biomethane primarily derived from landfills and dairy operations, then converted to biomethane, mostly for use in transportation. Using biomethane instead of fossil gas achieves a “net reduction” in the emission of greenhouse gasses that exacerbate climate change.

However, fighting climate change by capturing and burning biomethane and releasing the resulting CO2 has a modest effect at best. Alternatively, recent emission studies on cows’ diets at the University of California, Davis and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization at James Cook University in Australia showed that replacing 2% of a cow’s diet with macro red algae can cut methane emissions from enteric fermentation by 99% via an enzyme inhibitor in the algae.
