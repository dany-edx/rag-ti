In recognition of this reality, NASCAR, the nation’s premier stock car racing league, has instituted a number of policies under its Green initiative to attempt to improve the sport’s environmental impact.
While the NASCAR Green initiative looks to create more energy-efficient car designs, run cars on ethanol fuel, and design tracks to be more eco-friendly, six of the sport’s major raceways have taken matters into their own hands, installing solar installations of various sizes on or at the speedway.
In Charlotte, North Carolina, 773 photovoltaic modules make up a 247 kW array that houses the speedway’s  Turn 4 Sun Deck. The installation was developed by Renu Energy Solutions and installed in 2017. The panels create a facade that provides shade to fans perusing the entertainment, food, and lodging options located at the deck.
Across the country, in Sonoma, California, a 353 kW installation lines Turn 10, a portion of the grandstands, the Russell School of Racing, and a restaurant at Infineon Raceway. Completed in June 2011 and developed by Panasonic Enterprise Solutions, the solar arrays offset up to 41% of the racetrack’s electrical load. The installation consists of 1,580 SANYO HIT Power 215 W solar panels and 72 SANYO HIT Double bifacial 195 W solar panels.

The venue that hosts one of NASCAR’s most historic and prolific races, the Daytona 500, is also home to a 2.1 MW solar project installed by Florida Power and Light (FPL) in 2016.
The FPL Solar Circuit includes three solar arrays, located at the Midway, Sprint FANZONE, and Lot 10 parking area, which form canopy-like structures and provide shade for visitors. The FPL Solar Circuit is also a live laboratory for solar energy research, focused on improving the integration of solar energy and smart grid technologies.
In Pennsylvania, nearly 40,000 photovoltaic modules make up the 3 MW installation at Pocono Raceway, completed by EDF Renewables in 2010. The installation was among the first that started the trend of installing solar at sporting venues, being recognized as the world’s first privately owned solar-powered sports facility.
The raceway installation was also an early adopter of another trend that’s becoming common with solar projects: using a flock of sheep to manage vegetation levels at the site.

The Indianapolis Motor Speedway Solar Farm is a 9 MW project located adjacent to the actual speedway. It holds the designation of being the largest solar farm at any sporting facility in the world. (For now, at least. More on that later.) The project went live in 2014.
SunWize Technologies and Blue Renewable Energy co-developed the 39,312-panel project. The system was built by Swinerton Energy, while Indianapolis Power & Light Co. is the system off-taker under the terms of a power purchase agreement and owns the solar renewable energy credits produced by the system.
While the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Solar Farm currently holds the record for the largest solar farm at any sporting facility in the world, that’s all set to change in 2022 when the 50 MW Watkins Glen Solar Energy Center Project is completed.
Located in Watkins Glen, New York, the project is being developed by NextEra Energy Resources and broke ground in 2019. Like the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Solar Farm, the Watkins Glen Solar Energy Center will be located adjacent to the track itself.

Swinerton Renewable Energy is serving as the engineering, construction, and procurement contractor, and the project is expected to come online by year’s end.
As announced in 2020, Prairie Wolf has a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Cargill, the privately held global food corporation. This marked the second VPPA contracted between Cargill and National Grid Renewables; the first was for a portion of the 200 MW Crocker Wind Farm in South Dakota.
Eric Hoegger, director of global renewable energy for Cargill, said the Prairie Wolf groundbreaking is an “exciting step forward” on the company’s path to reducing its emissions by 10% by 2025.
National Grid Renewables includes the company formerly known as Geronimo Energy.
The Solar Energy Industries Association says that Illinois ranks 26th among U.S. states with about 375 MW of installed solar capacity.

On Feb. 22, the utility issued a request for proposals (RFP) seeking to procure 1 GW of renewable energy resource capacity. The RFP also calls for 500 MW/2 GWh of energy storage capacity with an effective duration of four hours, including 150 MW to be provided by virtual power plants made up of distributed generation, storage, and demand response resources.
This RFP represents the first of six tranches soliciting proposals for a cumulative total of 3.75 GW of renewable generation and 1.5 GW of energy storage during a three-year period. The procurements are in accordance with the Integrated Resource Plan approved by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau on Aug. 24, 2020, and additional orders issued by the bureau.
The island’s grid has been undergoing a transition ever since it was devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. Puerto Rican leaders and regulators pushed to rebuild the power infrastructure with a stronger reliance on renewable energy.
Under Act 17, which was signed into law in 2019, PREPA is required to obtain 20% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050.
Proposals for PREPA’s initial RFP are due May 3. The full document is available here.

GSA was established by the utility as a way to allow large-scale customers to offset power purchases by securing renewable energy from projects connected to the Duke Energy grid. The program offers large customers a bit of flexibility in their procurement, as they can select and negotiate all price terms directly with whichever renewable supplier they choose, as well as retain renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated by the facility.
The program will be available until its 200 MW capacity is fully subscribed. Of the 200 MW, 35 MW will be set aside for local government and university customers for nine months. The remaining 165 MW will be reserved for large nonresidential customers, with this capacity further divided into 125 MW for Duke Energy Carolinas and 40 MW for Duke Energy Progress.
Duke has had consistent success with GSA in North Carolina, having brought on-board three large-scale renewable energy buyers: Duke University, the City of Charlotte, and Bank of America. Those three customers represent 161 MW of the North Carolina GSA’s 600 MW in total capacity.
The application window for the program opens March 29 at 9 a.m. on a first-come, first-served basis.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/23/bloombergnef-expects-up-to-209-gw-of-new-solar-for-this-year/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",BloombergNEF expects up to 209 GW of new solar for this year,"BloombergNEF has forecast that 2021 may become a record year for PV with over 200 GW of newly installed PV capacity.
In the latest 1Q 2021 Global PV Market Outlook, the analyst expects new PV additions for this year will range from 160 to 209 GW. For comparison, in 2020 and 2019, newly deployed solar had reached 135 and 118 GW, respectively.
Looking forward, BloombergNEF provides a conservative scenario and an optimistic one. Under the first scenario, new grid-connected PV systems are expected to total 160 GW this year and 163 and 179 MW in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Under the second scenario, new PV additions are predicted to reach 209 GW this year and 221 and 240 GW in the following two years, respectively.
BloombergNEF analysts believe that supply bottlenecks for glass and polysilicon will not hold the market back. “Most country solar markets will grow in 2021, particularly India, which has a large number of projects delayed from 2020, and China, which is expected to maintain growth to keep course for its 2060 net-zero target,” BloombergNEF explained.
BloombergNEF analysts believe that supply bottlenecks for glass and polysilicon will not hold the market back as new capacities for both products are gradually coming online to meet strong demand. “Along with expected new glass capacity, there should be adequate supply as new factories for glass and polysilicon come online, although polysilicon will be the bottleneck and prices will probably stabilize around $12/kg this year,” the analyst said. “There is plenty of module capacity and we expect prices to drop to about $0.19/W for standard modules, based on 166mm wafers, with larger-format modules commanding a premium in markets without punitive trade tariffs.”
A few weeks earlier, BloombergNEF chief analyst Jenny Chase had forecast that the world could add 151-194 GW of new solar generation capacity this year. The analyst also predicted a recovery of the supply of glass needed for solar panels would see average module prices fall a further $0.02/W, to $0.18/W, this year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/23/maryland-issues-an-ambitious-climate-plan-a-year-late/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MARYLAND",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",Maryland issues an ambitious climate plan–a year late,"Better late than never? The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) released a long-overdue climate action plan for the state, leaving some stakeholders questioning its viability and wondering how the goals ultimately will be met.
The 280-page plan was published about 14 months past its deadline, but it also sets ambitious goals for Maryland, including larger cuts to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than required under state law and a potential roadmap to 100% clean electricity.
When the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act (GGRA) was reauthorized in 2016, the law tasked MDE with adopting a plan by Dec. 31, 2019. The department published a draft in late 2019, but did not release its final plan until Feb. 19, 2021.
“This was time well spent,” Jay Apperson, a spokesperson for MDE, told pv magazine USA. He said that MDE continued outreach on the draft plan and updated models and policy scenarios to work toward greater climate goals. “The result is a plan that is probably the most detailed and number-crunched of any state in the nation,” he said.
Apperson said that Maryland continued to take “important actions” during the 14 months, including implementing and expanding the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, joining a multistate clean trucks initiative, and enacting rules to phase out hydrofluorocarbons and reduce methane emissions.
The GGRA called for cutting state emissions 40% below 2006 levels by 2030. In its announcement, MDE said its final 2030 GGRA Plan outlines a path toward that target while also proposing a new goal to cut emissions by 50% by 2030. The plan also includes a longer-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2045. MDE said that the independent Maryland Commission on Climate Change recommended the higher targets.
According to MDE, the 2030 GGRA Plan includes a range of programs across several sectors, as well as more investments for renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, and other environmental initiatives.
MDE estimated that its proposals could lead to more than 6,000 new jobs and a $5.3 billion economic boost in the state by 2030.
As for renewables, MDE said the plan aims to build on the state’s current 50% by 2030 renewable portfolio standard. It also cited the proposed Clean and Renewable Energy Standard (CARES), legislation backed by Gov. Larry Hogan, to establish a 100% clean electricity by 2040 goal.
The CARES bill called for more solar, combined heat and power systems, new zero-carbon nuclear power, and natural gas or qualifying biomass power plants with carbon capture and storage. The bill failed to pass during a truncated 2020 General Assembly session; MDE said a revised CARES bill is slated to be reintroduced during the upcoming 2021 session.
MDE’s final plan has coal exiting the power sector by no later than 2030. “This is a change from the 2019 draft climate action plan, which shows the Hogan administration recognizes we need to move off of dirty coal,” said Josh Tulkin, state director of the Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club. He urged the state legislature to pass the Coal Community Transition Act, a bill to shutter Maryland’s remaining coal plants and create new funding to help impacted workers and families.
With the 2030 GGRA Plan now finalized, some stakeholders have raised concerns about how specific goals, especially regarding clean transportation, will be realized. The delayed plan also includes programs and initiatives that have already been created or completed, suggesting some aspects of the plan might be outdated from the start. More broadly, local environmental groups signaled a need for certainty.
Kim Coble, executive director of Maryland League of Conservation Voters, told a local publication, “I am glad that they have put out something ambitious, but how do we know it is going to be implemented?”
And Mike Tidwell, executive director of Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said, “The report often says ‘we will build on’ and then describes a program that already exists.”
Apperson said that the plan is intended to build on progress from Maryland’s existing actions by “continuing and improving those actions, and proposing new actions, so it includes a mix of existing and new programs.”
For example, he said the EmPOWER Maryland program is an existing energy efficiency program whose investments continue to reduce emissions for decades after they occur, so it must be accounted for in any forward-looking plan. He said the 2030 GGRA Plan proposes to extend that program beyond its current 2023 expiration date, and reform it to support “beneficial electrification of building heating systems.”
Apperson said the plan also proposed a number of measures that will need to be put in place either by regulation or by legislation.
The Sierra Club’s Tulkin cautioned that a plan is “only successful if it is implemented.”
“With the plan coming out a year late, there is an extra burden on MDE to demonstrate its commitment not just to setting these goals, but to achieving them,” Tulkin said. An early indication of MDE’s commitment will be how the agency engages with legislation during the upcoming 90-day legislative session.
“Where the plans fall short, we call on the General Assembly to take the lead,” he said. “Acting on climate is everyone’s responsibility.”

Researchers will develop flexible solar cell sheets, each roughly the size of a piece of paper, that can be assembled into larger structures.
One space-based solar array could include tens of millions of sheets and be as large as a square mile. An array that size could generate about 800 MW, the researchers said.
“With 37% stronger sunlight above the atmosphere than on a typical sunny day here on Earth’s surface, orbital solar arrays offer a critical opportunity to harness renewable energy, achieve sustainability goals, and provide strategic power for a wide range of orbital and airborne technologies,” said Dr. Randall Ellingson, a member of the university’s Wright Center for Photovoltaics Innovation and Commercialization who will lead the five-year project.
Work will focus on developing tandem solar cells on thin, flexible supporting materials. The researchers will sandwich a variety of combinations of solar cells, including perovskites, silicon, cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide.
They also will explore lightweight, flexible supporting material to create the solar cell sheets. Those materials also need to be resilient, ultra-thin and tolerant to high and low temperatures. Semitransparent and thin ceramic, plastics, and glass all are under consideration.
In 2019 the U.S. Air Force awarded Ellingson’s team $7.4 million to develop solar technology to power space vehicles using sunlight.
Volta Energy Technologies announced an initial closing on its venture fund focused on batteries, energy storage, and related hardware and software required to enable the use of lower-cost electric vehicles and renewable power generation.
The battery and energy storage markets are projected to grow by nearly 25% by 2025. The new fund closed with $72.6 million of committed capital in December and will continue to accept additional capital commitments through the end of the first quarter. The firm’s pledge fund launched in 2017 with the backing of Albemarle, Exelon, Equinor and Hanon Systems.
The fund has deployed capital into investments including:
The Brooklyn Public Library is outfitting the roofs of four buildings with solar energy backup systems that will help provide their surrounding area with safe havens during emergencies.
Local nonprofit Solar One is partnering with the library system to install the solar panels. The nearly $1 million project is being funded through the New York State Governor’s Office of Storm Recovery, and is one of many projects planned for the borough’s coastal areas to better prepare for emergencies.
In the event of a power outage, the libraries would disconnect from the power grid and use a battery system to provide electricity. Residents could charge their electronic devices or use any emergency services that may be available during a power outage.
