The project, once complete, will rank among the top ten largest solar facilities in Canada.
A partnership between Saturn Power and Ocean Man First Nation formed an entity called Iyuhána Solar for the project. The utility-scale solar facility is valued at about $200 million (CDN). It represents that largest power purchase agreement with a Canadian utility since 2015.
Under the PPA, Iyuhána Solar will construct and operate the facility, which will generate power for municipal utility SaskPower for the next 25 years. Located in the Rural Municipality of Estevan in southeast Saskatchewan, the project is large enough to power the equivalent of 25,000 homes.
As a founding partner, Ocean Man First Nation will have an ownership stake in Iyuhána Solar. Band members will also receive training in the maintenance of solar facilities and will be offered employment opportunities with the project. Additionally, partnering with two of Saskatchewan’s leading post-secondary academic institutions, Iyuhána will provide scholarships, internships, and direct research projects in clean energy to benefit the community.
“Our partnership with GSI and SaskPower will bring great opportunities for Ocean Man First Nation, including employment and revenue that will provide stability and sustainability for our Band,” said Chief Connie Big  Eagle, Ocean Man First Nation. “We are proud that this project, which is able to generate clean power, will be known as Iyuhána Solar, which, in Nakotah translates to ‘everyone’ or ‘all of us.’”
This is the first of many renewable energy infrastructure projects for SaskPower, which plans to add approximately 3 GW of capacity by 2035.
“This new solar facility will play an important role in our path to net-zero by 2050 or sooner,” said Rupen Pandya, SaskPower president and chief executive officer.
Last year, GSI acquired Saturn Power’s solar and battery development portfolios, including its team of seasoned developers an a 1.4 GW pipeline of early- to late-stage solar and energy storage projects. Today, GSI has a footprint across Canada and in 12 U.S. states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/24/distributed-solar-and-storage-policy-trends/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 24, 2024",Distributed solar and storage policy trends,"State-level policy is a key factor in distributed solar and energy storage markets across the United States. Policies change frequently across the 50 states, and tracking these changes are essential for businesses looking to maximize the value they provide.
The North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center maintains DSIRE, or the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency, to keep businesses and consumers up-to-date on distributed energy regulatory structures and related incentives. Below are 2023 trends as reported by DSIRE in a January 2024 report.
“Many states and utilities are transitioning away from traditional net metering structures and are researching or implementing new rate structures, whether that be net billing, time-of-use based net metering, or something in-between,” observed Rebekah de la Mora, senior policy analyst. “These changes are not just affecting residential customers, but also non-residential customers.”
A total of 273 state and utility level distributed solar policy and rate changes were proposed, pending, or decided in 2023, said the NC Clean Energy Technology Center.
Transition to net billing
In 2023 states continued to move toward net billing structure for distributed solar generation exports. California, Arkansas, and Idaho implemented a move from net metering to net billing. Hawaii’s HECO utility attained approval for its next generation of distributed energy resource tariffs, which will include an option for a net billing structure.
Low-to-moderate income incentives
States are submitting applications for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar for All program, which provides incentives for income-qualified customers to adopt solar. A number of other states have approved community solar incentives for LMI customers, and California included an LMI customer adder for customers participating in virtual net metering programs.
Time-varying crediting
States are increasingly relying on time-varying rates for crediting the export of excess generation. North Carolina regulators approved a new time-of-use net metering tariff for Duke Energy, while the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission approved time-varying export credit rates for HECO’s new smart distributed energy resource tariff. California implemented time-varying credit rates as part of its NEM 3.0 tariff.
Distributed generation fees rejected
Utility proposals in recent years have included calls to implement fees on distributed generation customers like rooftop solar owners. These attempts continued in 2023, with limited success. Regulators in Michigan and Wisconsin denied these fees, and NC Clean Energy Technology Center noted a decline in such fixed fee requests from utilities.
Community solar expansion
Community solar typically entails customers subscribing to a portion of an off-site solar facility’s generation in exchange for utility bill credit. Regulators in Maryland, Minnesota and New Jersey approved plans for next-generation community solar programs last year. All three programs include annual aggregate capacity allocations, as well as specific provisions to promote low- to moderate-income customer participation. Regulators in California are also considering the design for a new community solar program.
Project siting for community solar
States are beginning to implement rules that limit eligible sites for community solar project or offer incentives or bid preferences for projects cited in preferable locations like brownfield sites and highway rights-of-way. For example, Maryland’s new community solar program will allow projects to exceed certain size limits if they’re built on specified site types, like rooftops, brownfields, or industrial areas.
Increasing size limits
Regulators have enacted legislation increasing system size limits or aggregate capacity limits for distributed generation programs like net metering. West Virginia, Michigan, and North Carolina all made changes to size qualifications for distributed solar in 2023.
Solar-plus-storage
States and utilities are increasingly structuring programs in a way that promotes pairing a battery with rooftop solar. North Carolina regulators approved a time varying net metering successor for Duke Energy, along with a new “Power Pair” incentive for solar-plus-storage. Hawaii’s new distributed energy resource tariffs will also encourage paired systems, while several states have begun offering incentives for customer-owned storage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/24/woodmac-predicts-strong-yet-flat-global-pv-growth-through-to-2032/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,WORLD",PATRICK JOWETT,"JANUARY 24, 2024",WoodMac predicts strong yet flat global PV growth through to 2032,"From pv magazine global
Analyst firm Wood Mackenzie forecasts the solar industry will shift from a high growth industry to a slower-growing, mature industry in 2024.
According to predictions in a new report shared with pv magazine, annual average growth will be flat over the next eight years, bucking a trend of rapid growth over the last decade. Between 2024 and 2032, global solar installations are expected to reach around an average of 350 GW each year, peaking at 371 GW of installed solar in 2025 and 2030.
“Starting in 2024, the industry is officially past the inflection point, characterized by a slower growth pattern. The global solar market is still many times larger than it was even a few years ago, but it’s natural for an industry’s growth to slow as it matures,” the report says. “In this new era of solar growth, companies will need to be more diligent and focused than ever. Competition amongst suppliers will intensify and efficiency improvements will be critical to remaining profitable”.
Wood Mackenzie says a few major markets are driving this new growth pattern. China’s solar market is expected to reduce slightly in 2024. While it will continue to be the world’s largest market, it is predicted to shrink due to grid infrastructure investments not keeping pace with project growth, changing revenue schemes for utility-scale solar reducing prices and distributed solar growth slowing.
Europe, which saw annual installation growth of 38% in 2022 and 26% in 2023, is expected to see an average annual growth of 4% over the next five years. The report cites a spike in retail rates as the energy crisis wears off, the slowing down of distributed solar growth and grid infrastructure capacity limits for the slowing down.
Average growth in the United States, which reached 27% between 2019 and 2023, is expected to fall to 6% between 2024 and 2028. But Wood Mackenzie expects the full breadth of the Inflation Reduction Act to materialize in 2024. It predicts this will lead to more contracted utility-scale solar projects, benefits for the distributed solar segment, and see the U.S. domestic module manufacturing sector nearly triple in 2024, with 40 GW of capacity expected to be operational by the end of the year.
The analysis firm also forecasts solar manufacturing will face “a reckoning” in 2024.
Market expansion has been primarily driven by China, whose module manufacturing capacity alone is already nearly three times global demand. This oversupply is driving China to module price record lows and Wood Mackenzie says cheaper Chinese modules will challenge many countries’ plans to build out vertically integrated domestic solar supply chains. It predicts many planned facilities will fail to materialize, while existing facilities will be hard-pressed to stay in business as utilization rates decline.
“This is not new – solar manufacturing is known as being a notoriously challenging business. But the sector has also never been this large. With global demand growth slowing, manufacturers will have to be as innovative as ever to remain a going concern,” the report states.

These lending institutions focus not just on clean energy financing, but they help with first home buying, car purchases as well as financing healthcare clinics, charter schools, houses of worship, and other small businesses that improve the lives of community members.
Climate lending is a relatively new area of focus for these institutions, and in recent years formal training programs have taken shape. One such program is at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), which received $1.2 million in funding in 2022 from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO).
The UNH Carsey School of Public Policy partnered with the Inclusiv Center for Resiliency and Clean Energy to develop the Solar and Green Lending Professional Training progam.
This 8-week virtual program teaches lending professionals how to develop new solar and green lending products, collaborate with partners to provide solar and green financing, and deploy new loans or investments. After completion, the lending professionals continue to receive support through regular workshops, a peer sharing site, and tools like guidebooks and sample loan policies.
Almost 700 students have enrolled in the UNH program since it began three years ago. These students represent nearly 300 community-based financial institutions  including community development credit unions, community banks, minority depository institutions, community development funds, and mission-driven green banks. The institutions serve more than 11,000 households, including over 5,000 low- and moderate-income households.
The participants report learning more about their markets and the benefits of solar energy. The program aims to add in the next few years a formal technical assistance component to further support lending institutions as they launch clean energy products. This training also has the potential to help lending institutions get ready to deploy Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The training program’s success inspired SETO’s Community Power Accelerator Learning Lab, which provides training on community solar project development and business models for developers, nonprofits, and other organizations looking to integrate meaningful benefits into their portfolios.
SETO’s learning lab at UNH includes a short, self-paced 101 course as well as a more intensive, seven-week course on the community solar development process. Administered by the Center for Impact Finance at the Carsey School of Public Policy in partnership with the National Community Solar Partnership and is available at no cost to participants. Interested organizations are encouraged to apply.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/24/solar-installations-can-be-haven-for-insects/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",PATRICK JOWETT,"JANUARY 24, 2024",Solar installations can be haven for insects,"From pv magazine global
A research team from the Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have said that insect levels have tripled in less than five years at two solar sites built on retired agricultural land in southern Minnesota.
Native grass and wildflowers were planted at the two solar facilities, operated by Enel Green Power North America, in early 2018. Between August 2018 and August 2022, the research group conducted 358 observational surveys of flowering vegetation and insect communities.
They found that total insect levels tripled, with native bees showing a 20-fold increase in numbers. The most commonly observed insect groups were beetles, flies and moths. An increase in native plant species was also noted, while pollinators from the solar sites were seen visiting and pollinating soybean flowers in adjacent crop fields.
Lee Waltson, a landscape ecologist and environmental scientist who was the lead author of the study, said the research “highlights the relatively rapid insect community responses to habitat restoration at solar energy sites.”
“It demonstrates that, if properly sited, habitat-friendly solar energy can be a feasible way to safeguard insect populations and can improve the pollination services in adjacent agricultural fields,” said Waltson.
The Argonne National Laboratory said the findings suggest that habitat-friendly solar sites could play an important role in conserving biodiversity and mitigating land-use conflicts associated with the conversion of farmland for solar energy production. It noted that this could be particularly beneficial for the future development of ground-mounted solar.
However, they warned that additional research is needed to understand the feasibility of habitat-friendly solar across different regions and to meet ecological goals such as conserving target insects or wildlife species.

In support of this goal, over $46 million will help fund 30 projects that enhance EV charging reliability and workforce development. The projects, which are in 16 states and Washington, D.C. are expected to boost EV charging performance while enhancing resiliency and reliability, support equitable access to clean transportation solutions, and grow the clean energy workforce.
“The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on ensuring that America wins the EV race, capturing good-paying jobs and the benefits of a clean energy manufacturing economy,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “These funds are part of that mission, helping to grow our new automotive economy with EVs and EV chargers that are made in America by American workers.”
Electrifying America’s transportation sector is essential to mitigating greenhouse gas pollution and addressing climate change, and the transition will improve health outcomes, reduce fuel and maintenance costs, and strengthen our national energy security.
The funding will be executed by the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation is making targeted investments in the following area:
The projects support clean transit and school bus deployment, enhance charger resiliency to hurricanes and wildfires, and accelerate workforce development pre-apprenticeship programs. The funding is made available through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to accelerate the electrification of the nation’s transportation sector and spur private sector investments in clean transportation. Several projects will make use of complementary funding from other federal programs.
Battery development
Key to boosting clean transportation is the build of of American battery manufacturing. To this end, the DOE announced $131 million for projects to advance research and development (R&D) in EV batteries and charging systems. It also funds a consortium to address critical priorities for the next phase of widescale EV commercialization.
The advanced battery consortium will engage key stakeholders, including universities, national laboratories and manufacturers that supply critical materials and components to the battery industry.
“The investments announced today will supercharge the development of a convenient and reliable EV network, and expand the domestic battery supply chain—securing our nation’s energy independence and spurring economic opportunity,” said U.S. deputy secretary of energy David M. Turk.
DOE announced 27 projects to receive $71 million to develop innovative and equitable clean mobility options, alleviating supply chain concerns for EV batteries, and increasing the drive range. The selected projects aim to:
The United States Advanced Battery Consortium LLC, based in Southfield, Michigan, will receive $60 million for pre-competitive, vehicle-related advanced battery R&D that addresses critical priorities for the next phase of widescale EV commercialization. The consortium will focus on R&D for EV batteries with enhanced performance; EV batteries using earth-abundant and domestically available battery materials; light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicle batteries; and more cost-efficient battery recycling processes. Click here to learn more about the selected projects.
Modernizing the grid
According to the DOE,  the electric power distribution system in the U.S. has over 5.5 million line-miles with over 180 million power poles, all of which are susceptible to damage by weather and its effects and account for a majority of power outages in the country. Twelve projects across 11 states will share $34 million in funding to support undergrounding electric power lines, modernize the grid and replace aging power infrastructure through development of cost-effective, high-speed and safe undergrounding technologies.
The selected projects also support the nation’s goal of 100% clean electrical grid by 2035. They are expected to lower costs, reduce inefficiencies, mitigate disruptions from extreme weather events, and accelerate the adoption of renewable clean energy resources.
The projects to receive this funding, managed by DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), include small and large businesses, national labs, and universities. More information and complete project descriptions for the teams announced today can be found on the ARPA-E website.
Energy conservation in federal facilities
The first step toward a clean energy future is to make existing facilities as energy efficient as possible. As the federal government is nation’s largest consumer of energy, according to Energy Secretary Granholm, the DOE announced $104 million for energy conservation and clean energy projects at 31 federal facilities.
The Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies (AFFECT) program, which was established in 1992, will receive three disbursements from the historic $250 million in funding for the program in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
The projects announced for funding today align with President Biden’s December 2021 Executive Order that calls for a 65% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions from Federal operations by 2030, 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035, and a net-zero building portfolio by 2045. AFFECT helps agencies cut energy consumption, and saves taxpayers money through building electrification, geothermal heat pumps, on-site solar generation, and battery energy storage, among other initiatives.
“President Biden has charged the Federal Government to lead by example by transforming its footprint of over 300,000 buildings to be more energy efficient and climate resilient, which means cleaner air across the country,” said Brenda Mallory, chair of White House council on environmental quality, Brenda Mallory.
Projects were selected for facilities of the Social Security Administration; the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, the Interior; Transportation, and Veterans Affairs; the U.S. General Services Administration; and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The 31 selected projects are expected to double the amount of new carbon-free electricity capacity at federal facilities over the amount brought online in 2022, resulting in 27 MW of additional clean-energy capacity. The projects will also leverage more than $361 million in private investment.
