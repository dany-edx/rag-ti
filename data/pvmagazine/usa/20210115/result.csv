https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/15/massachusetts-governor-vetoes-climate-and-clean-energy-bill/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 15, 2021",Massachusetts governor vetoes climate and clean energy bill,"On January 14, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker vetoed sweeping climate legislation, which would have set ambitious environmental, social, and clean energy goals.
A bill summary of S.229, “An Act Creating a Next-Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy,” laid out several key provisions.
The bill would have established a 2050 net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions limit, as well as statewide limits every five years instead of 10; raised Massachusetts’ renewable portfolio standard by 3% annually for 2025-2029, ensuring that at least 40% of the state’s electric power would be renewable by 2030; mandated more offshore wind energy procurement; set a number of energy efficiency requirements; pumped millions of dollars into clean energy workforce development; and, for the first time, codified in state law the criteria defining “environmental justice” populations.
According to the summary, the bill also included several solar-specific provisions.
It would have loosened net energy metering (NEM) caps by ending “load zone” restrictions; exempted large businesses from the NEM cap; mandated a state agency to prioritize low-income communities in its SMART solar program; closed a gap in the NEM law to enable small municipal buildings to host rooftop solar; bolstered utilities’ rights to own solar projects; and created a new solar energy grant program for nonprofits helping those in need.
The bill also included a long-awaited agreement between state tax assessors and developers. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) played a major role in reaching the compromise, which would have provided critical tax certainty for solar projects.
As David Gahl, SEIA’s senior director of state affairs, explained when the bill was passed, “In short, homeowners and small businesses will not see their property taxes increase when they install small solar systems. Larger solar systems will be exempt from taxes if they already have an agreement in place for other tax payments.”
Following months of negotiations, state lawmakers passed the bill on January 4 in an eleventh-hour vote before the legislative session ended. With the session closing shortly after the bill reached his desk, the governor had little time to return the bill for amendments. He was left with three options: sign the bill into law, “pocket veto” the legislation by doing nothing within a 10-day deadline, or veto the bill. He ultimately chose the latter.
In a letter to lawmakers, Baker said that although he supports the bill’s goals and is “largely in agreement with many of its proposals,” he “reluctantly” couldn’t sign the legislation in its current form.
Specifically, Baker said some of the the bill’s provisions, including a proposed net zero energy stretch code, would hinder the state’s development and affordable housing initiatives.
“While my administration wholeheartedly supports the environmental justice goals of this bill, intent without the tools to address those issues are empty promises,” Baker wrote. “This bill does not have language or funding to address the ongoing impacts of climate change faced by those communities.”
In the letter, Baker claimed the bill didn’t rely on “scientific and detailed data analysis” and used “certain out-of-date policies” to devise some of its emissions goals, which may be too aggressive and risk “undue expense.” He also noted concerns about potential economic impacts to large sectors as the state works to recover from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Baker administration has a history of supporting renewables and climate change initiatives, most recently outlining new goals and releasing a duo of roadmap reports.
However, State Sen. Mike Barrett said in a statement he was “perplexed” by the governor’s rationale for the veto, noting that the bill has been in the works for a year and charging that the Baker administration did not raise certain concerns on the “multiple occasions” Barrett’s staff reached out throughout the process.
“The near-total absence of critical feedback from the administration for the entirety of 2020 makes me think the kerfuffle of the past two weeks is really about politics, not policy,” said Barrett.
This is likely not the end of the climate bill. On January 13, when local reports suggested Baker may veto, State Senate President Karen E. Spilka and House Speaker Ronald Mariano issued a joint statement vowing to refile the bill in the new legislative session.
In his letter, Baker said he looked forward to working with the lawmakers to “improve the bill and quickly reach agreement.”
Although there’s hope for a new climate law in Massachusetts, several solar and environmental groups have signaled their disappointment with Baker’s veto.
SEIA’s Gahl, for example, said the trade group “remains committed to seeing meaningful climate legislation passed into law this year.” He added that the tax changes SEIA helped negotiate “need to stay there if we want to continue to grow the Massachusetts solar industry and create jobs.”
Stephan Roundtree Jr., Northeast director of advocacy group Vote Solar, has called for immediate action.
“This outcome is particularly disappointing because, in addition to positioning Massachusetts as a leader on climate-readiness, the bill addresses environmental inequity and injustice,” said Roundtree. “Communities of color, non-English-speaking and under-resourced communities across the commonwealth will continue to bear the brunt of the climate impacts this bill so thoughtfully and robustly sought to address. We fear the consequences of justice delayed.”
Ben Hellerstein, state director for Environment Massachusetts, said, “In the race to 100 percent renewable energy, this bill was going to take us the first few steps out of the starting blocks. We’ll need to do everything in this bill, and a lot more, if we want to cross the finish line.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/15/what-happens-to-floating-pv-when-the-surface-freezes/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,O&M,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 15, 2021",What happens to floating PV when the surface freezes?,"From pv magazine Global
Sungrow Floating, a unit of Chinese inverter maker Sungrow, built a 500 kW floating PV array on a water surface located in Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, in Northeast China, where temperatures in winter can reach -20 degrees Celsius. The plant covers around 90% of the water surface of a lake and the company has explained what happens to the PV system during freezing times.
“The lake freezes for about four months from November to March each year,” Kane Wang, manager of system solution department at Sungrow Floating, told pv magazine. “During the freezing period of lake water, the entire array will be frozen.”
The ice layer may be squeezed and uplifted where it is thicker, and the floating PV system is fixed on the surface of the ice layer, Wang noted. The anchorage construction in extremely cold areas is usually installed before temperatures reach the freezing point.
“If the installation is required in the freezing period under special circumstances, the corresponding ice-breaking plan shall be adopted first, and the ice shall be removed before construction,” Wang explained. “At the same time, the influence of floating ice and frost heaving on the floating array should be considered in the design of anchorage system.”
When using concrete piles or gravity anchors as underwater anchoring material, the frost heave resistance of concrete should also be considered. When using a shore anchor, it is necessary to consider the squeezing and floating effects of freezing on the anchor. These are different from those of an anchoring system in non-freezing areas.
Wang also highlighted that extremely cold areas are often accompanied by high snow loads, which necessitate special anchoring materials, relatively slow construction efficiency, and a higher project cost than that of conventional floating PV projects.
“Then the technical requirements for the floating system are more important,” he added. For instance, a larger buoyancy-weight ratio should be considered in the design, and the floating body can be flexibly adjusted base on the difference of snow load in each area. The quantity of the floating body can be increased or reduced based on the local snow load to realize the adjustable buoyancy per unit area so as to achieve the optimal system cost, he said.
Sungrow Floating says its products comply with the key requirements of extremely cold and freezing areas. “The product materials need to be able to resist extreme low temperature so that brittle cracking or fracture will not occur,” the manager stated. “The structure design also needs to consider the influence of frost heaving.” That means that the entire array structure needs to have enough strength to resist freezing, and needs to be verified by a series of freezing tests and temperature cycle tests.
The selected components must also have the ability to resist heavy snow loads and sufficient safety buoyancy must be considered. “Finally, in terms of the anchoring system, it is necessary to consider the impact load of the floating ice on the array as well as the safety of the anchoring construction during the freezing period and temporary anchoring measures to ensure that the floating system will not have failure and accident damage,” Wang said.
Furthermore, he specified that the low temperature during the freezing periods will increase the power generation of the floating system. The plant was commissioned in 2018 on a water surface of around 5,000 square meters. It relies on Sungrow inverters ranging in power from 60 to 80 kW and solar modules with power output between 275 and 315 W provided by an unnamed manufacturer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/15/frank-pallone-and-joe-manchin-gatekeepers-of-the-biden-energy-agenda/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 15, 2021",Frank Pallone and Joe Manchin: Gatekeepers of the Biden energy agenda,"With the Georgia runoff elections settled and Democrats poised to take control of both Houses of Congress, a path exists to achieve President-elect Joe Biden’s pledge to work toward 100% clean electricity nationwide by 2035 and invest $2 trillion into the energy transition.
The path is not an entirely smooth one, however. Democrats will lack a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Without bipartisan support, legislation still can be slowed or blocked entirely by Republicans.
Then there is the nontrivial matter of who chairs two pivotal congressional committees. The two lawmakers who will be key if Biden’s energy goals are to be achieved are the expected chairs of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee: Representative Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV).
The committees serve as gatekeepers to passing any meaningful renewable energy policy and both committee chairs are Democrats, like Biden. But legislative success isn’t a simple matter of party alignment.
To understand what the future of energy and climate policy will look like, it’s critical to understand these two chairs first as representatives of their states.
Joe Manchin is West Virginia’s Democratic senator, serving alongside Republican Shelley Moore Capito.

Manchin has been frequently described as the senate’s most conservative Democrat. West Virginia’s historic role as a major coal mining state means that Manchin’s career has often been aligned with the coal industry.
For example, he long retained financial ties to a coal brokerage that he helped run before being elected to the Senate; is the fourth-largest recipient of coal mining donations in the U.S. Senate to date, according to Open Secrets; and famously fired a rifle at cap-and-trade bill as part of a campaign commercial.
Policy-wise, Manchin has taken an unequivocal stance against ending the current filibuster, opposed the Green New Deal and has been historically in favor of an “all-of-the-above energy policy,” with specific focus on developing technologies aimed at trapping carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuel burning before it enters the atmosphere.
In 2019, he said, “While I appreciate the renewed conversation around climate change that the Green New Deal and its supporters have sparked, I think we need to focus on real solutions that recognize the role fossil fuels will continue to play.”
Manchin was also the only Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee who failed to sign on to a letter calling on Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) appointee and former professional fossil fuel advocate Bernard McNamee to recuse himself from any rule makings where one resource would be pitted against another.
Manchin’s appointment to ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee was described by 350.org as “completely at odds with any plan for real climate action.” 
Frank Pallone represents New Jersey’s 6th Congressional District and has served as chair of the Committee on Energy and Commerce since 2019.

Where Manchin’s relationship with climate change and renewable energy is long and well-documented, the same is not so true of Pallone, whose chief political focus has been on healthcare, which is also overseen by committee.
Unlike West Virginia, New Jersey has been a leader of the energy transition, with continued support for the development of solar and energy storage technologies.
But like Manchin, Pallone takes a somewhat more conservative approach toward energy and climate policy, at least for a Democrat.
For example, Pallone does not support the Green New Deal, and would instead prefer to pursue a policy of incremental change. Pallone has also expressed opposition to the creation of a select committee on Climate Change. 
Legislatively, Pallone pushed the Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation’s Future Act — or CLEAN Future Act, in lieu of the Green New Deal.
With Pallone’s policy focus on health care rather  than energy and Manchin taking what some may describe as an antithetical stance towards President-elect Biden’s climate and energy goals, their critical role in Congress could spell trouble for clean energy goals.
That may not be the case, however.

Biden ran on a $2 trillion climate investment pledge. As the chairs of the committees that will largely craft the policies that bring this pledge to fruition, Pallone and Manchin have obligations to their party that go beyond their personal and home-state interests. No doubt, enormous pressure will be focused on these two chairs to deliver rapidly on the new President’s priorities.
In return for playing ball, however, it is likely that we will see some specific provisions that will benefit their home-state interests.
For Manchin, the most pressing interest will be the future of energy employment in West Virginia. Some observers argue that he will work to shape the way that Biden’s policies are delivered to minimize harm and maximize benefit to coal miners in particular.
Manchin isn’t blind to the move towards renewable energy and away from fossil fuels and he likely doesn’t want to impede the inevitable. What he will likely look for in return is a just transition for West Virginians who will find themselves out of a job as the coal industry continues to decline. Finding new means of economic development, workforce training and job transition are going to be what Manchin needs in return for his help with Biden meeting the goals of his platform.
With that sort of understanding in place, observers think that Manchin will become an ally for more climate and renewable energy-aggressive Democrats.
“I think this is a tremendous opportunity for everyone, as Americans, to have this kind of leadership at the administrative level and infused throughout all of the executive administration departments,” SEIA’s Vice President Of Congressional Affairs, Erin Duncan, told pv magazine USA. “I don’t have any doubt that, under their leadership, we will see some really positive action.”
“We saw that already from the House and the Senate last year, with the big infrastructure package that Mr. Pallone helped craft and the energy bill that Mr. Manchin fought and scrapped to have pulled together,” Duncan continued, “That’s a testament to their commitment to legislating.”
One place that the two chairs and the new administration will be able to find common ground comes from an oft-overlooked aspect of the energy transition: transmission.
Image: David Wagman
Manchin has long been a supporter for investment in an inter-regional, high-voltage transmission network, in part because it’s  source-agnostic: electrons move across the transmission infrastructure regardless of whether they are generated by fossil or renewable energy resources.
Seen this way, investment in transmission upgrades would require a significant labor force, creating jobs across the country, as well as in Manchin’s home state.
It’s an issue that Manchin’s been vocal about in the past, telling the audience at the 2020 WIRES Fall Member Meeting, “We know that transmission is an essential component of a reliable and resilient grid because we know what happens when congestion disrupts the system.” He argued that in addition to cost-effective energy storage, “long distance, interregional transmission can be the key to accommodating more intermittent generation on the grid without sacrificing reliability or affordability.” He argued that if done in the right way, “expanding transmission can be an economic boon for rural communities.”
While Manchin, Biden and the rest of the Democratic party may be able to find common ground on the issue of transmission, cooperation likely won’t end there.
The sunrise movement has gained significant traction within the Democratic party, with its members expecting much more than just green infrastructure investment provisions. Without meeting some of these larger party demands, Pallone and Manchin risk causing a schism within the Democratic party.
Any such rift would make passing significant climate and energy policy all but impossible. Some issues will likely sidestep the risk of filibuster by Senate Republicans by falling under the Congressional Review Act; however that act’s scope largely covers undoing some of the Trump Administration’s regulatory rollbacks.
At the end of the day, President Biden will have to deliver on some of the climate and energy policy that became foundational to his campaign and Democrats.  Left-leaning members of his party will likely demand a more-than-moderate agenda on climate and energy policy.
And as key gatekeepers, neither Pallone nor Manchin are expected to oppose either president or party. Meaningful energy and climate legislation likely will be passed within the next two years, while Democrats control both the legislative and executive branches of government.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/15/rhode-island-issues-its-plan-to-achieve-100-renewable-electricity-by-2030/,"COST AND PRICES,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RHODE ISLAND",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 15, 2021",Rhode Island issues its plan to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2030,"A year ago, Executive Order 20-01 cemented in a place Rhode Island’s goal to meet 100% of the state’s electricity demand with renewable energy by 2030. The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources (OER) worked through the year on an economic and energy market analysis, and developed policy and programmatic pathways to meet the goal.
In the most recent development, OER and The Brattle Group co-authored a report detailing how this goal will be achieved, The Road to 100% Renewable Electricity – The Pathways to 100%.
Image: David Wagman
The report includes economic analysis of the key factors that will guide Rhode Island as it accelerates adoption of carbon-free renewable resources.
The pathway rests on three principles: decarbonization, economics and policy implementation.
The report says the state needs to address the gap between projected electricity demand in 2030 and projected renewable generation capacity. The report predicts a need for 4,600 GWh of additional renewable energy to close the gap. Deploying that much capacity represents a 150% increase in the amount of renewable energy the state has procured to date. The final figure could as much as 600-700 GWh higher or lower.
The state is making progress to close the gap.
Rhode Island recently announced plans to solicit proposals for up to 600 MW of additional offshore wind resources. A draft request for proposals (RFP) is expected to be filed for regulatory review in the coming months. Assuming the procurement is authorized and the full 600 MW is acquired, new offshore wind would add about 2,700 GWh per year, or about 35% of 2030 electricity demand.
Beyond this offshore wind procurement, development of retail solar through existing programs could add another 1,500 GWh per year. That leaves a smaller–though still sizable–gap of around 400 GWh per year of renewable electricity.
All this capacity will come with a hefty price. The report finds that rate impacts would likely boost e a typical 2030 monthly residential bill by about $11 to $14 with utility-scale renewables, or by as much as $30 if the entire gap were to be filled with retail solar.
The upside is that if the renewable resources are developed in-state, the local economic activity would boost Rhode Island’s gross domestic product and local jobs, especially when compared to procuring out-of-state resources or buying Renewable Energy Credits (RECs).
One policy item that has to be addressed is the state’s Renewable Energy Standard (RES), which currently calls for meeting 38.5% of electricity deliveries with renewables by 2035. For example, RES compliance at present does not require the physical procurement of power produced by renewable energy facilities. Instead, electricity providers meet their requirements by purchasing RECs.
The report recommends amending the state’s RES to seek methods by which Rhode Island can retain all of the RECs procured through existing policy and program channels, along with RECs resulting from ratepayer investment in net metered projects.
The report also recognizes that the RES alone is unlikely to drive sufficient investment renewable generation and should be paired with programs and policies to ensure sufficient renewable generation to meet the 100% goal. The state also needs to address the RECs created by behind-the-meter systems that add mechanisms to better match the timing of renewable energy generation with real-time demand. The policy would have the 100% RES remain in effect beyond 2030 and also match shifts in energy demand, particularly as other parts of the economy electrify.
The state also is putting a high priority on making sure the transition to renewables is an equitable one.
The report recommends partnering with and listening to frontline communities about their needs and goals in the clean energy transition. This will include providing traditionally underserved communities with expert consultation to help guide decision making. The report also recommends holding listening sessions to increase accessibility to and understanding of energy system basics.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/15/sunrise-brief-renewables-forward-publishes-inclusiveness-handbook/,"EMPLOYMENT,FINANCE,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 15, 2021",Sunrise brief: Renewables Forward publishes inclusiveness handbook,"Renewables Forward, a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative of leading U.S. renewable and clean energy companies, released what it is calling a DEI playbook.
The publication offers steps that renewable and clean energy companies can take to tackle diversity and inclusion within their organizations and across the solar and clean energy industry. Among other things, it includes steps for “unconscious bias training, inclusive recruiting practices, and enhancements to performance reviews and promotional processes.”
Liz Weir, Chief Operating Officer for Sol Systems, said, “This HR playbook represents the strength of a united front and the dedication of our member companies to move beyond general discussion of DEI issues and drive actual, tangible change in our solar businesses.”
The group said it more than doubled in membership to 28 with the addition of 16 new member companies and organizations: 3Degrees, Act Power Services, Amicus Solar Cooperative, Amicus O&M Cooperative, Edison Energy, Empower Energies, Energy Storage Association, Infrastructure Finance Advisors, Leyline, MD Strategic, OneEnergy Renewables, Plante Moran, Safari Energy, Sphere Solar, SunCommon, and Sun Tribe.
Renewables Forward launched in October around four principles:
Founding members include Capital Dynamics, Cypress Creek Renewables, EDF Renewables, Generate Capital, Mosaic, Nautilus Solar Energy, New Columbia Solar, Nextracker, Sol Systems and Volt Energy, as well as the Solar Energy Industries Association and The Solar Foundation.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) offered technical help to Michigan regulators to revise and streamline interconnection rules that had not been uodated since 2009.
In 2018, the state’s two big utilities saw high growth in requests for grid interconnection to solar and other DERs. In previous years, the state’s total operating solar generation had been just over 100 MW, but more recent requests amounted to 3 GW.
Dennis Schroeder/NREL
NREL engineers Michael Ingram and David Narang first began discussing interconnection challenges with MPSC in 2019 and have provided technical assistance since then.
Using Minnesota’s experience as a reference point to update the Michigan rules, Ingram and Narang developed a two-part plan.
The first objective was to help staff understand technical requirements of DERs based on IEEE Standard 1547-2018. The standard provides technical specifications and configurations to help utilities, grid operators, and other stakeholders think through interoperability and communications details to safely integrate DERs into the electric grid.
The second objective was to help Michigan’s utilities evaluate the pre-application report that provides technical details about their distribution system—such as feeder locations and voltages—to help determine how new DERs would affect the grid.
Throughout 2020, MPSC worked through its updated interconnection rules with stakeholder groups to finalize a draft to begin the formal rule-making process.
MPSC also contributed to NREL’s new “Guide for Authorities Governing Interconnection,” which is under review at the U.S. Department of Energy.
Tigo Energy, which produces Flex-MLPE (Module Level Power Electronics) announced a $20 million round of investment led by Energy Growth Momentum.
The investment will be used to improve upon existing products and develop next generation solutions that maximize returns for PV customers. A portion of the new funds will be used to scale up operations. Tigo said its growth has “accelerated significantly” recently as the company’s products have reached more customer segments and countries globally.
Tigo’s products are used in PV systems that range from residential solar to utility scale sites, roof-top, ground mount and floating systems.
