The solar project marks Doral’s first in Ohio.
HBSC acted as sole lender, providing $114 million financing, which consisted of a $36 million construction-to-loan facility, $57 million tax equity bridge loan, and a $21 million letter of credit facility.
Once in operation, the project will supply power to the PJM regional transmission operator via a power purchase agreement (PPA), generating enough electricity roughly equivalent to the demand of 9,000 homes. The Great Bend Solar project is located on 370 acres about 100 miles against southeast of Columbus. The single-axis tracker project is expected to provide over $400,000 per year of new annual tax revenues for the county.
“We are thrilled to have collaborated with HSBC to raise this innovative project debt which will enable us to bring Great Bend Solar, our first project in the Buckeye State, to commercial operation around the end of 2025,” said Evan Speece, chief financial officer at Doral Renewables.
PJM
A report from LevelTen Energy said permitting challenges, a lack of construction companies available in the region, and a projected increase to PJM electricity prices over the next 10 to 15 years are driving higher prices. A lack of transmission to deliver clean energy to areas with high demand is also driving congestion and basis risks, thereby driving up prices.
LevelTen said In PJM, solar PPA prices increased 12% in-quarter. PJM’s solar P25 prices have now risen 31% year-over-year.
Analysis by nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) found that PJM grid operator could enable interconnection of 4.8 GW of solar and 0.7 GW of wind capacity by 2027 through 95 deployments of grid-enhancing technologies (GETs). GETs would also enable 1.1 GW of stand-alone storage plus additional storage co-located with new solar.
The GETs would cost $100 million and yield production cost savings of $7 billion over six years, mostly due to the lower cost of operating renewable energy generators enabled by GETs, the report says. That translates to a 70-to-1 benefit-cost ratio.
PJM is the world’s largest wholesale electricity market, the report says, serving 65 million people; its service area is shown on map above. Wind and solar combined provided less than 5% of generation in the PJM region last year. PJM has instituted a pause on new interconnection applications until 2026.
HBSC (Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) is a bank that originated in Hong Kong and now headquartered in London with offices, branches and subsidiaries in 62 countries and territories across Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, North America, and South America.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/21/kkr-and-eig-invest-more-than-1-billion-in-equity-and-debt-financing-in-avantus/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-03-21,KKR and EIG invest more than $1 billion in equity and debt financing in Avantus,"Global investment firm KKR announced the signing of an agreement to acquire a majority stake in Avantus, marking KKR’s first U.S. investment under its global climate strategy.
The investment reflects the rapid growth in solar in the U.S. In 2023, solar made up over half of new generating capacity for the first time. The report estimates that in 2023, the U.S. solar market installed 32.4 GWdc of capacity, a 51% increase from 2022. This was the industry’s biggest installation year by far, exceeding 30 GWdc of capacity for the first time.
“Solar is the fastest growing electricity source in the U.S., and along with energy storage, will serve as the backbone of a modern electric grid that is clean, reliable and resilient,” said Patrick Goff, chief financial officer at Avantus. “KKR’s investment provides Avantus the financial backing and expertise to execute on our ambitious portfolio and lead the energy transition across the Western United States.”
Founded in 2009 as 8Minute Solar Energy by Tom Buttgenbach with the intention of fighting climate change by developing renewable energy at scale. The company expanded that vision in 2022 to include what it calls an “advanced ecosystem” of clean energy products and services. With the expanded vision came the new name, Avantus, and the plan to bring to life one of the largest clean energy development pipelines in the country.
Avantus has a project pipeline of 30 GW of solar and 94 GWh of battery storage, enough to provide 20 million people with clean energy. The company has developed and sold 6.5 GW and 6.3 GWh of solar and storage projects, respectively.
Following the close of the transaction, KKR and existing investor EIG, will be the sole equity investors in Avantus. Both equity sponsors secured commitments for a development financing facility alongside their equity commitments to the company, totaling upwards of $1 billion in the aggregate.
“To support an economy-wide energy transition, there is a need to significantly expand renewable energy generation by 2050 and enable grid electrification,” said Charlie Gailliot, partner and co-head of global climate strategy, KKR. “Because of these tailwinds, we see enormous opportunity for Avantus. The company’s impressive team and development track record, coupled with its mature project pipeline, set it apart from other renewables developers.”
Following the closing of the transaction, KKR announced plans to support Avantus in creating an equity ownership program to provide all employees the opportunity to participate in the benefits of ownership of the company. Since 2011, KKR reports its portfolio companies have awarded billions of dollars of total equity value to over 60,000 non-management employees across more than 40 companies.

700 W-plus power output is a notable achievement in any solar module, but the 2023 Modules winner packs a heap of innovation inside to set it apart. Alongside its heterojunction (HJT) cell, Hyper-ion deploys Risen’s own patented version of busbarless (0BB) cell interconnection – branded Hyper-link, cell thickness at an industry-leading 90 to 100 micrometers, and the option of a steel frame to make a module that truly stands out.
The efficiency and power results are also notable. The module datasheet confirms the Hyper-ion comes with a power range of 680-705 W, in dimensions of 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm, at a weight of 41 kg. Inside are 210 mm half-cut HJT cells.
Beyond performance, Risen has beefed up its warranty, putting it ahead of TOPCon rivals. It offers a 15-year product warranty and 30-year power warranty, guaranteeing 90.3% of nominal power output.
German company Solar Cooling Engineering (SCE) has taken an innovative approach to refrigeration with its PV Cool Kenya project. SCE has developed solar-powered cooling technology that is based on a sustainable refrigerant (R600a) and insulation materials.

Unlike cold rooms that rely on traditional grid-tied cooling methods, the SelfChill system uses modular thermal storage to balance cooling peaks. Water is chilled and frozen, and stored in a water chiller that provides cold water to a fan coil inside the cold room. In this way, energy fluctuations can be balanced by energy stored in the form of ice.
Battery storage can be added if required, but it is not a necessary component of the system. The cooling unit itself was designed in-house, with SCE opting to create a DC unit that is powered by PV modules.
This year’s winner is Deye Technologies SUN-29.9-50K-SG01HP3 – a hybrid inverter for the C&I market. It is available in power classes from 29 kW to 50 kW and is well-suited to retrofitting. The inverter’s 400 AC output fits with older installations, making it a good candidate for revamping PV plants.
Category juror Cormac Gilligan, director clean energy technology at S&P Global, said there is a growing market for revamping and retrofitting solar systems in Europe with the addition of battery systems to increase self-consumption. He saw the flexibility of the Deye inverter as a noteworthy feature. For example, it can be cascaded into a 500 kW application and work entirely off-grid. The option to connect a diesel genset and charge the batteries that way means this inverter could meet demand in regions where weak grids are prevalent.
Origami Solar is rolling out production of its patent-pending steel frame design with contract manufacturers in the United States. Frames are expected to be available from the end of 2023.
Frames are manufactured using recycled steel in a continuous process that Origami Solar says is 10 times faster than aluminum frame making, producing one frame every 15 seconds. It also claims frames have demonstrated increased stiffness in testing, making modules better equipped for heavy loading from snow or wind. Further testing is underway with partners including the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
On price, the company expects to be able to sell frames at least 5% lower than aluminum competitors. There is a sustainability case to be made, too. Origami Solar has worked with consultants Boundless Impact to demonstrate a significantly lower carbon footprint per module.
Multinational steel producer ArcelorMittal claims its XCarb steel is both long lasting and sustainable. XCarb is a certified low-carbon material and the company reports that it is made from predominantly scrap steel, with production carried out via an electrical arc furnace that uses 100% renewable energy.
The steel producer’s Magnelis steel also boasts sustainability credentials. It is long-lived, making it suitable for solar installations in challenging environments. Magnelis steel is a double-sided hot-dip galvanized carbon steel, coated on both sides with a zinc-aluminium magnesium alloy.  “Anything you can do to make a solar asset last longer is a positive climate impact,” said juror Jenny Chase, solar analyst at BloombergNEF.
ArcelorMittal has a target of achieving a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity per ton of crude steel by 2030.
The US storage specialist Fluence has developed a storage-as-transmission asset (SATA) that can help network owners and operators to manage renewables curtailment, increase the use of power lines, and limit congestion. UltrastackTM, provides network owners and operators with fast-acting response of less than 150 milliseconds and with higher than 99% system uptime to meet the availability requirements of critical infrastructure. Its advanced control applications, some with pending patents, include synthetic inertia, power oscillation damping control, grid-forming inertia, dynamic voltage control, emergency power contribution, and black start.
Unlike “regular” big batteries, SATA projects are operated to mimic transmission line flows by injecting and absorbing power. In such applications, they can be used to bolster or even replace existing power lines, offering infrastructure planners a new, versatile solution for transmission transition.
US-based Atonometrics is targeting utility-scale solar projects with its monitoring innovation, the RDE300i. The system performs in-situ measurement of current/voltage (IV) curves within a string of modules. This allows technicians to get a direct view of the performance of individual modules within an array, and eliminates costs associated with installing and maintaining reference modules at a site.
The manufacturer is keen to point out that in-situ IV curve measurement could be useful on many fronts in plant monitoring, and that it is working with laboratories and industrial partners to develop new applications for the technology.
For now, the use case for RDE300i is focused on monitoring soiling. Here the system promises more accurate results than the common approaches of reference modules or optical sensors – and it can also integrate with these systems so monitoring teams have all bases covered.
It’s high time that we recognize leading module manufacturers in this category and this is no easy task. There is a wealth of module makers with strong track records and impressive product portfolios.
In 2023, the nod goes to JinkoSolar, which has shipped more PV modules than any other manufacturer. In November 2023 JinkoSolar hit the historic mark of 200 GW modules shipped since it delivered its first panels in 2010. The manufacturer has quickly transitioned to n-type TOPCon and the higher efficiencies it offers. In October 2023 the company announced a new n-type TOPCon cell efficiency record of 26.89% for a 182 mm cell.
But JinkoSolar is much more than just a module producer. It has expanded its product portfolio to include battery energy storage systems (BESS) to offer its customers around the world a complete solution involving both state-of-the-art modules and the latest BESS technology.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/21/sodium-ion-batteries-a-viable-alternative-to-lithium/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,2024-03-21,Sodium-ion batteries – a viable alternative to lithium?,"From pv magazine print edition 3/24
Sodium ion batteries are undergoing a critical period of commercialization as industries from automotive to energy storage bet big on the technology. Established battery manufacturers and newcomers are jostling to get from lab to fab with a viable alternative to lithium ion. With the latter standard for electric mobility and stationary storage, new technology must offer proven advantages. Sodium ion looks well placed, with superior safety, raw material costs, and environmental credentials.
Sodium ion devices do not need critical materials, relying on abundant sodium instead of lithium, and no cobalt or nickel. As lithium ion prices rose in 2022, amid predictions of material shortages, sodium ion was tipped as a rival and interest remains strong, even as lithium ion prices have started to fall again.
“We are currently tracking 335.4 GWh of sodium ion cell production capacity out to 2030, highlighting that there is still considerable commitment to the technology,” said Evan Hartley, senior analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
In May 2023, the London-based consultant had tracked 150 GWh to 2030.
Cheaper
Sodium ion cells, produced at scale, could be 20% to 30% cheaper than lithium ferro/iron-phosphate (LFP), the dominant stationary storage battery technology, primarily thanks to abundant sodium and low extraction and purification costs. Sodium ion batteries can use aluminum for the anode current collector instead of copper – used in lithium ion – further reducing costs and supply chain risks. Those savings are still potential, however.
“Before sodium ion batteries can challenge existing lead acid and lithium iron phosphate batteries, industry players will need to reduce the technology’s cost by improving technical performance, establishing supply chains, and achieving economies of scale,” said Shazan Siddiqi, senior technology analyst at United Kingdom-based market research company IDTechEx. “Na-ion’s cost advantage is only achievable when the scale of production reaches a manufacturing scale comparable to lithium ion battery cells. Also, a further price drop of lithium carbonate could reduce the price advantage sodium offers.”
Sodium ion is unlikely to supplant lithium ion in applications prioritizing high performance, and will instead be used for stationary storage and micro electric vehicles. S&P Global analysts expect lithium ion to supply 80% of the battery market by 2030, with 90% of those devices based on LFP. Sodium ion could make up 10% of the market.
Right choices
Researchers have considered sodium ion since the mid-20th century and recent developments include improvements in storage capacity and device life cycle, as well as new anode and cathode materials. Sodium ions are bulkier than lithium counterparts, so sodium ion cells have lower voltage as well as lower gravimetric and volumetric energy density.
Sodium ion gravimetric energy density is currently around 130 Wh/kg to 160 Wh/kg, but is expected to top 200 Wh/kg in future, above the theoretical limit for LFP devices. In power density terms, however, sodium ion batteries could have 1 kW/kg, higher than nickel-manganese-cobalt’s (NMC) 340W/kg to 420 W/kg and LFP’s 175 W/kg to 425 W/kg.
While a sodium ion device life of 100 to 1,000 cycles is lower than LFP, Indian developer KPIT has reported a lifespan with 80% capacity retention for 6,000 cycles – dependent on cell chemistry – comparable to lithium ion devices.
“There is still no single winning chemistry within sodium ion batteries,” said IDTechEx’s Siddiqi. “Lots of R&D efforts are being undertaken to find the perfect anode/cathode active material that allows scalability beyond the lab stage.”

Referring to United States-based safety science organization Underwriter Laboratories, Siddiqi added that “UL standardization for sodium ion cells is, therefore, still a while away and this makes OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] hesitant to commit to such a technology.”
Prussian white, polyanion, and layered oxide are cathode candidates featuring cheaper materials than lithium ion counterparts. The former, used by Northvolt and CATL, is widely available and cheap but has relatively low volumetric energy density. United Kingdom-based company Faradion uses layered oxide, which promises higher energy density but is plagued by capacity fade over time. France’s Tiamat uses polyanion, which is more stable but features toxic vanadium.
“The majority of cell producers planning sodium ion battery capacity will be using layered oxide cathode technology,” said Benchmark’s Hartly. “In fact, 71% of the [cell] pipeline is layered oxide. Similarly, 90.8% of the sodium ion cathode pipeline is layered oxide.”
Whereas cathodes are the key cost driver for lithium ion, the anode is the most expensive component in sodium ion batteries. Hard carbon is the standard choice for sodium ion anodes but production capacity lags behind that of sodium ion cells, ramping up prices. Hard carbon materials have recently been derived from diverse precursors such as animal waste, sewage sludge, glucose, cellulose, wood, coal and petroleum derivatives. Synthetic graphite, a common lithium ion anode material, relies almost exclusively on the latter two precursors. With its developing supply chain, hard carbon is more costly than graphite and represents one of the key hurdles in sodium ion cell production.
Partially mitigating higher costs, sodium ion batteries exhibit better temperature tolerance, particularly in sub zero conditions. They are safer than lithium ion, as they can be discharged to zero volts, reducing risk during transportation and disposal. Lithium ion batteries are typically stored at around 30% charge. Sodium ion has less fire risk, as its electrolytes have a higher flashpoint – the minimum temperature at which a chemical can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture with air. With both chemistries featuring similar structure and working principles, sodium ion can often be dropped in to lithium ion production lines and equipment.
In fact, the world’s leading battery maker CATL is integrating sodium ion into its lithium ion infrastructure and products. Its first sodium ion battery, released in 2021, had an energy density of 160 Wh/kg, with a promised 200 Wh/kg in the future. In 2023, CATL said Chinese automaker Chery would be the first to use its sodium ion batteries. CATL told pv magazine late in 2023 that it has developed a basic industry chain for sodium ion batteries and established mass production. Production scale and shipments will depend on customer project implementation, said CATL, adding that more needs to be done for the large scale commercial rollout of sodium ion. “We hope that the whole industry will work together to promote the development of sodium ion batteries,” said the battery maker.
Charge to sodium
In January 2024, China’s biggest carmaker and second-biggest battery supplier, BYD, said it had started construction of a CNY 10 billion ($1.4 billion), 30 GWh per year sodium ion battery factory. The output will power “micromobility” devices. HiNa, spun out of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in December 2022 had commissioned a gigawatt-hour-scale sodium ion battery production line and announced a Na-ion battery product range and electric car prototype.
European battery maker Northvolt unveiled 160 Wh/kg-validated sodium ion battery cells in November 2023. Developed with Altris – spun out of Uppsala University, in Sweden – the technology will be used in the company’ next-generation energy storage device. Northvolt’s current offering is based on NMC chemistry. At the launch, Wilhelm Löwenhielm, Northvolt senior director of business development for energy storage systems, said the company wants a battery that is competitive with LFP at scale. “Over time, the technology is expected to surpass LFP significantly in terms of cost-competitiveness,” he said.
Northvolt wants a “plug-and-play” battery for fast market entry and scale-up. “Key activities for bringing this particular technology to market are scaling the supply chain for battery-grade materials, which Northvolt is currently doing, together with partners,” said Löwenhielm.
Smaller players are also doing their bit to bring sodium ion technology to commercialization. Faradion, which was acquired by Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries in 2021, says it is now transferring its next-generation cell design to production. “We have developed a new cell technology and footprint with 20% higher energy density, and increased cycle-life by a third compared to our previous cell design,” said Faradion Chief Executive Officer (CEO) James Quinn.
The company’s first-generation cells demonstrated an energy density of 160 Wh/kg. In 2022, Quinn said that Reliance’s plan was to build a double-digit-gigawatt sodium ion factory in India. For now, it seems that those plans are still in place. In August 2023, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani told the company’s annual shareholder meeting that the business is “focused on fast-track commercialization of our sodium ion battery technology … We will build on our technology leadership by industrializing sodium ion cell production at a megawatt level by 2025 and rapidly build up to gigascale thereafter,” he said.
Production
Startup Tiamat has moved forward on its plans to start construction of a 5 GWh production plant in France’s Hauts-de-France region. In January 2024, it raised €30 million ($32.4 million) in equity and debt financing and said that it expects to complete the financing of its industrial project in the coming months, bringing the total financing to around €150 million. The company, a spinoff from the French National Centre for Scientific Research, will initially manufacture sodium ion cells for power tools and stationary storage applications in its factory, “to fulfill the first orders that have already been received.” It will later target scaled-up production of second-generation products for battery electric vehicle applications.
In the United States, industry players are also ramping up their commercialization efforts. In January 2024, Acculon Energy announced series production of its sodium ion battery modules and packs for mobility and stationary energy storage applications and unveiled plans to scale its production to 2 GWh by mid-2024. Meanwhile, Natron Energy, a spinoff out of Stanford University, intended to start mass-producing its sodium ion batteries in 2023. Its goal was to make 600 MW of sodium ion cells at battery producer Clarios International’s exiting lithium ion Meadowbrook facility, in Michigan. Updates on progress have been limited, however.
Funding
In October 2023, Peak Energy emerged with $10 million in funding and a management team comprising ex-Northvolt, Enovix, Tesla, and SunPower executives. The company said it will initially import battery cells and that was not expected to change until early 2028. “You need around a billion dollars for a small scale gigawatt factory – think less than 10 GW,” Peak Energy CEO Landon Mossburg said at the launch. “So the fastest way to get to market is to build a system with cells available from a third party, and China is the only place building capacity to ship enough cells.” Eventually, the company hopes to qualify for domestic content credits under the US Inflation Reduction Act.
Some suppliers, such as India’s KPIT, have entered the space without any production plans. The automotive software and engineering solutions business unveiled its sodium ion battery technology in December 2023 and embarked on a search for manufacturing partners. Ravi Pandit, chairman of KPIT, said that the company has developed multiple variants with energy density ranging from 100 Wh/kg to 170 Wh/kg, and potentially reaching 220 Wh/kg.
“When we started work on sodium ion batteries, the initial expectation of energy density was quite low,” he said. “But over the last eight years the energy density has been going up because of the developments that we and other companies have been carrying out.” Others are on the lookout for supply partnerships. Last year, Finnish technology group Wärtsilä – one of the world’s leading battery energy storage system integrators – said that it was seeking potential partnerships or acquisitions in the field. At the time, it was moving toward testing the technology in its research facilities. “Our team remains committed to pursuing new opportunities in terms of diversifying energy storage technologies, such as incorporating sodium ion batteries into our future stationary energy storage solutions,” said Amy Liu, director of strategic solutions development at Wärtsilä Energy Storage and Optimization, in February 2024.
Nearshoring opportunity
Following many mass-production announcements, sodium ion batteries are now at the make-or-break point and investor interest will determine the technology’s fate. IDTechEx’s market analysis, carried out in November 2023, suggests anticipated growth of at least 40 GWh by 2030, with an additional 100 GWh of manufacturing capacity hinging on the market’s success by 2025.
“These projections assume an impending boom in the [sodium ion battery] industry, which is dependent upon commercial commitment within the next few years,” said Siddiqi.
Sodium ion could offer yet another opportunity to near-shore clean energy supply chains, with the required raw materials so readily available across the globe. It appears that train has already left the station, however.
“As with the early stages of the lithium ion battery market, the main bottleneck for the global industry will be the dominance of China,” said Benchmark’s Hartley. “As of 2023, 99.4% of sodium ion cell capacity was based in China and this figure is only forecast to fall to 90.6% by 2030. As policy in Europe and North America seeks to shift lithium ion battery supply chains away from China, due to the reliance on its domestic production, so too will a shift be needed in the sodium ion market to create localized supply chains.”

With 70 technical training sessions taking place, the conference draws solar in NABCEP-certified installers seeking re-certification. The newest certification is the Energy Storage Installation Professional (ESIP). With support from a grant from the National Science Foundation, NABCEP teamed up with the CREATE Energy Center  and the Midwest Renewable Energy Association to develop the standard of education and training for those working with battery energy storage systems technology.
Steve Kalland, Executive Director of the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center delivered the keynote presentation to a packed room of solar professionals, highlighting solar history, current policies and new opportunities. He noted the changes in the technology and overall perception, saying that back in the 1980s PV stood for “potentially viable”. Since that time efficiencies are up, costs are down, policies have been created, and Kalland said the new challenge is how fast it can get built.
With NABCEP being just over 20 years old, a “Pioneers in Solar Breakfast” was added to this year’s agenda to celebrate those attending who have been in solar for decades. Also being recognized are the winners of the annual Walt Ratterman and Les Nelson awards. The Ratterman winner receives a donation of $500 to a charity of their choice and the Les Nelson Scholarship covers NABCEP Conference.
