Auxin began a long saga related the enforcement of AD/CVD on solar goods imported to the U.S. when it filed a petition alleging that four Southeast Asian nations were in violation of trade laws.
Solar component suppliers in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia, responsible for roughly 80% of the U.S. supply at the time, were alleged to be in violation of harboring tariff-dodging goods from Chinese manufacturers. Goods found in violation of AD/CVD laws can be assessed with tariffs as high as 50% to 250%.
In June 2022, President Joe Biden issued a moratorium on solar tariffs, pausing any collection of fees for two years. The move came as solar industry advocates pleaded with the administration to halt tariffs, citing a great deal of uncertainty and solar project delays and cancellations related to the financial risk of tariff assessments.
Auxin argued in the December 29, 2023 suit that Commerce and CBP are not required to follow Biden’s executive order placing a moratorium on tariffs. Biden reaffirmed the June 2022 order in April 2023 with a veto.
The solar panel manufacturer claimed that it was unlawful for Commerce to enact procedures that prevent the application of AD/CVD tariffs, the liquidation of seized assets, and the collection of cash deposits for imported solar goods. It requested that the Court of International Trade reject the moratorium as “an abuse of discretion” by Commerce.
The lawsuit claims Commerce has supported “lawless” solar cell and module marketplace characterized by “a massive and sustained” wave of cheap solar components. Auxin and its co-plaintiff Concept Clean Energy claim the pause on tariff collection has denied its right to relief from dumped Chinese products.

In a December 2023 vote, the town approved the “Solar Farm Ordinance,” which prohibits all solar power systems greater than 40 kW. The ordinance’s key section, shared with pv magazine USA by Town Hall officials, states:
Section 2. Purpose: The purpose of this Ordinance is to prohibit all commercial Solar Farms within the Town of Moscow.
The ordinance does not specify whether existing commercial solar projects are grandfathered and exempt.
According to Jake Freudberg’s report in Maine’s Morning Sentinel, the vote had 16 in favor of the ban and four against. Freudberg spoke with First Selectman Donald Beane, a dissenting voter, who commented, “We had legal opinions from our lawyer and [the] Maine Municipal [Association] saying it wouldn’t hold up.”
Freudberg interviewed Dee Laweryson, who remarked, “They take up too much space,” and Joan Peterson, who called the farms an “eyesore” and raised questions like, “What’s going to leak into the ground?”
Nationwide, there is a growing trend of legislation that limits solar development. Research indicates that the siting of solar power is a key factor in public acceptance, with more restrictive zoning laws increasing across the nation. Generally, rooftop solar is highly regarded across various political ideologies.

However, it’s important to note that some opposition to solar energy is strongly influenced by political partisanship and funding from the fossil fuel industry. For example, a claim promoted by Susan Ralston’s group, ‘Citizens for Responsible Solar,’ suggests that heavy metals might leach from solar panels into the soil and potentially into water sources. This claim has been debunked as a falsehood.

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), by the end of 2022, Maine had installed 948 MW of solar capacity, contributing to 9.18% of its electricity generation from solar sources. SEIA projects a substantial growth in the state’s solar capacity, expecting it to more than double within the next five years with an additional 1.1 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/08/new-solar-tree-design-offers-improved-module-cooling-lower-shading-losses/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,HUNGARY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 8, 2024","New solar tree design offers improved module cooling, lower shading losses","From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists from the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences designed a prototype of a solar photovoltaic tree that purportedly offers an optimal balance between energy production and thermal management.
The key feature of the system is a larger distance between the solar modules compared to conventional solar tree designs. This approach is intended to reduce shading losses between the panels while improving cooling and heat dissipation.
The prototype has a total diameter of 660 mm and relies on solar modules based on cells provided by Shenzhen Xiangxinrui Solar Energy Co., Ltd. China. Each panel has a size of 180 mm x 60 mm x 3 mm and an efficiency of 22%.  The solar tree also relies on a stem measuring 1800 mm in height and a flat wooden sheet segmented into fifteen branches.
In order to validate the proposed design, the scientists compared its performance with that of a flat PV system with the same characteristics. “Both the solar tree and the flat module were integrated and configured within the same electrical circuit, featuring six rings connected in parallel,” the scientists explained. “Each ring consisted of three modules connected in series, resulting in a total of eighteen PV modules.”

Both the solar tree and the flat PV system were tested with a south orientation and tilt angles of 20, 30 and 45 degrees.
The tests revealed that with the 45-degree angle the solar tree recorded a maximum temperature of 49.8 C and the flat system had 38.05 C. As a result, the solar tree configuration yielded a maximum power output of 14.54 W, while the flat system produced 11.8 W.
Under the 30-degree tilt angle configuration, the flat system reached a temperature of 51.3 C and the solar tree reached 40.75 C. The latter achieved a maximum power output of 13.84 W, compared to 11.05 W for the flat system. With the 20-degree tilt angle, the solar tree reached a maximum temperature of 33.95 C and the flat system of 43.86 C. The former produced 14.05 W and the latter 11.4 W.

“Empirical results indicate that the flat PV module’s temperature exceeds the solar tree’s by over 10 C, owing to the less efficient convective heat transfer,” the academics stated, adding that the temperatures of the ground shaded by the solar tree were reduced by 3–7 C compared to the unshaded ground. “The efficiency of the solar module configuration proposed herein witnessed an increment of 16–23 % relative to the flat module.”
The researchers also observed that the solar tree offers a land footprint reduction of 96 % compared with the conventional PV systems.
“An examination of the ground footprint revealed that the sunflower PV module afforded 85 % land savings relative to the flat PV module,” they stated. “The area under the solar PV tree can be used for parking and agriculture purposes.”
Their findings were presented in the study “Sunflower solar tree vs. flat PV module: A comprehensive analysis of performance, efficiency, and land savings in urban solar integration,” published in Results in Engineering.
Researchers from the Korea Maritime Institute recently proposed the use of solar trees to build photovoltaic plants in mountainous forest areas in land-scarce South Korea. They defined the new concept as forest-photovoltaic and explained that it would both maintain carbon absorption activities under the solar trees and produce solar power on the upper part of forest land.
Other researchers from Amity University, Noida, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, recently developed four different designs for solar photovoltaic trees that purportedly require less physical space than conventional PV systems in urban environments.

The OFA – representing 38,000 farmers – submitted feedback in December over proposed changes to the government of Ontario’s Electricity Act in the Canadian province.
According to the Environmental Registry of Ontario, the government of Ontario is proposing to “accelerate” new electricity generation in the renewable-rich province, which installed 2.7 GW of solar in 2022.
Changes center on commercial and industrial customers being able to offset their electricity demand by establishing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable generation facilities, spanning wind, solar, biofuel, battery storage and hydropower less than 10 MW.
OFA submitted written feedback to the policy change, which included seven recommendations.
The OFA said regulators prioritizing energy and storage infrastructure sited on commercial and industrial land should “discourage” projects sited on land with certain soils; “prime” agricultural areas, as well as lower priority agricultural lands and rural land, should be considered as a last resort for renewables to protect “Ontario’s finite and declining farm lands”; and developers should be “contractually obligated” to restore environments and land after a renewable project is decommissioned or in the case of a “system failure event.”
Programs establishing net metering systems “must” include collaboration between developers, landowners, local government and the public; and there should be improved public engagement to “encourage compromise between grid capacity restrictions limiting site options, and host site objections,” the OFA said.
Community consultation ran from Nov. 2 to Dec. 17, 2023, with the proposed start date for the amendment change slated for May 1, 2024.
The amendment follows the release of the government’s Powering Ontario’s Growth plan in 2023, which aims to procure 4 GW of new electricity, support new investments, electrify the economy and power 1.5 million new homes to house the province’s growing population. Planning the state’s next competitive electricity procurement process – focused on wind, solar, hydroelectric, batteries and biogas – is one of the policy prongs.
Meanwhile, the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA) last month welcomed the news that the Government of Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) would procure 5 GW of new wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy in a new tender exercise. The move will provide “long-term procurement certainty for the market,” according to CanREA.
“This announcement provides a clear signal to our members that Ontario is ready for new renewable projects,” said CanREA’s director for Ontario, Eric Muller. “This procurement will be a significant opportunity for our members to develop low-cost wind, solar and energy storage in Ontario to meet the province’s growing needs.”
Canada recorded 4.4 GW of solar installed capacity at the end of 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

“Robust domestic production” of distribution transformers “is essential to ensuring a reliable U.S. grid while reducing dependence on foreign products,” the letter says.
Distribution transformers step down the voltage of electricity on a distribution circuit so the power may be used by customers.
The trade groups say that ongoing supply chain challenges and “unprecedented demand” for grid components have resulted in a distribution transformer shortage.
About 80% of transformers of all types are manufactured abroad, the Niskanen Center reported last year.
A limited global supply of transformers for large-scale energy storage projects has become a bottleneck for those projects, a Wood Mackenzie analyst told pv magazine in October.
The seven trade groups calling for federal funding support for transformer manufacturing include four utility groups, two homebuilder groups, and an association of equipment manufacturers.
In their letter, the groups said that the Senate Appropriations Committee last July unanimously passed language specifying $1.2 billion in repurposed supplemental funding for the Department of Energy to “bolster the transformer and critical grid component supply chain.”
The groups called for this language to remain in the Senate’s final Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, and urged the inclusion of the Senate Appropriations Committee language in any forthcoming House-Senate conference negotiations.
The groups’ letter said that more manufacturing capacity “means home construction can be completed, communities can modernize their infrastructure to incorporate IIJA investments, and regions can bounce back quickly from natural disasters.” The IIJA, or Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, is also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act in 2022 to mobilize federal resources to support production of distribution transformers and other electric grid components, the Bloomberg Law news service has reported.
Yet last July, the news service said, Energy Department and Labor Department officials interviewed pointed to a systemic workforce shortage and supply chain issues that would be difficult to fix quickly, and a lack of funding from Congress that limited what the departments could do.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/08/vertical-agrivoltaic-plant-to-be-constructed-in-vermont/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RACKING,UNITED STATES,VERMONT",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JANUARY 8, 2024",Vertical agrivoltaic plant to be constructed in Vermont,"U.S. solar company iSun Inc. is partnering with German agrivoltaics manufacturer Next2Sun AG to construct a vertical agrivoltaic system in South Burlington, Vt., set to begin operation early this year. 
The 50.37 kW (ac) plant will sit on 3.7 acres and consist of 3 rows separated by 30 feet. There will be 138 monocrystalline bifacial solar modules placed on 69 ground-mounted Next2Sun racks. Next2Sun also states that vegetables and saffron can be planted between each row. 
Vertical solar plants are an alternative for landowners transitioning to renewable energy because their directional orientation and bi-facial design allow them to absorb more energy than other tilted models. One study published in the Office of Scientific and Technical Information database found that ground-mounted, vertical, east-west facing bifacial solar panels outperformed south-north-facing, optimally tilted modules by almost 15%, showing an albedo of 0.5 percent. 
Next2Sun reports that its vertical plants help to avoid the overbuilding of agricultural land because they take up less space. One Colorado farmer found that installing vertical, bi-facial solar panels offered a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative for renewable electricity generation. “Nestled between two greenhouses, the unique vertical bifacial solar panel system optimized land use while potentially capitalizing on the high albedo effect of the highly reflective greenhouse materials,” he said.
This most recent project is part of a more extensive portfolio of Next2Sun’s patented solar panel design. At the start of 2023, the company announced a partnership with international green energy infrastructure developer TEP Renewables Ltd to expand agrivoltaic systems in the U.K. 
The Next2Sun system also adds to iSun’s burgeoning clean energy technology portfolio. The organization has been exploring innovative solutions to help advance technology since the early seventies. “Of all the innovations we’ve enabled, none have been as important as the transition from dirty to clean energy,” the company states. 
The Renewable Energy Solutions Program of the German Energy Solutions Initiative supports the project. The program helps German companies in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industry enter new markets. The initiative is part of a government program intended to support suppliers of sustainable energy solutions start in foreign markets. 
The German Energy Solutions Initiative focuses on helping small and medium-sized businesses. It supports participants by giving them a good idea of what’s needed to enter a specific market in addition to sharing insights on what new markets to watch out for. 
Heiko Hildebrandt, the CEO of Next2Sun, said, “In iSun, we have found a partner who, like us, wants to accelerate the energy transition. With our vertical bifacial agrivoltaics system, we can contribute to this, especially in areas such as the north-east of the USA. The vertical Next2Sun system always produces electricity when conventional P.V. systems are producing less.”

Qcells agreed to supply Microsoft with 12 GW of solar modules and EPC services over an 8-year period. This expands the 2.5 GW module and EPC agreement reached a year ago.
Qcells, a global provider of complete clean energy solutions, announced an eight-year strategic alliance with Microsoft Corp., a global technology company. Microsoft has a goal of meeting all of its energy needs with renewable energy, and plans to be carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030.
Through what is Qcells’ largest module and EPC agreement to date, the two companies intend to bring an estimated 1.5 GW of solar panels a year to projects Microsoft has contracted through 2032. This is estimated to be enough to power more than 1.8 million homes a year.
“We are pleased to be a part of such a substantial commitment that will accelerate the global shift to renewable energy solutions. Qcells is uniquely positioned to ally with Microsoft towards creating a clean, sustainable future because of our investment in building an American-made solar supply chain,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Qcells.
The domestically produced solar modules will be supplied by Qcells’ factory in Cartersville, Georgia, which is part of Qcells’ announcement that it would invest more than $2.5 billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the U.S.. Considered the largest investment in U.S. solar history, it also made QCells, a subsidiary of Hanwha Solutions, the first company to establish a fully integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the U.S.  Qcells said it intends to manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells and finished modules in the Cartersville facility.
By 2024, between its Dalton and Cartersville facilities, Qcells anticipates its solar production capacity will reach 8.4 GW a year,
“Our expanded agreement with Qcells is designed to drive large-scale domestic production of solar modules essential to advancing a resilient U.S. supply chain and clean energy economy,” said Bobby Hollis, vice president, energy, Microsoft. “Through long-term agreements like this we are signaling Microsoft’s demand and bringing more renewable energy to the grid, faster.” 
The modules produced in the Cartersville facility will soon be manufactured with polysilicon produced by REC Silicon in Moses Lake, Washington. Qcells parent company, Hanwha Solutions, announced that it was investing more than $200 million to reopen the dormant polysilicon factory to serve the needs of the U.S. solar supply chain. The Moses Lake facility is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
