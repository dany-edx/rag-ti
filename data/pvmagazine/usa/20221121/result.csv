In a win for rooftop solar, the Michigan Public Service Commission announced it rejected the plan. The rejection came as part of a November 18 ruling that rejected the utility’s proposal for a $388 million rate increase, instead approving a $30.5 million increase. The full ruling can be found here.
Under the proposal, a fee based on the three highest-demand one-hour intervals over the last year would be leveraged on rooftop solar customers under the proposal. Ben Inskeep, principal energy policy analyst at EQ Research, said the proposed charge would amount to $100 a month or more. Inskeep said customers would have no way to predict what their charge is, as peak demand hours are not reported to customers by DTE. 
“I certainly can’t imagine any customer ever wanting to take service under this proposal. It would be too draconian and would completely erode any financial benefit one would receive from putting solar on their rooftops,” said Inskeep. 
The utility also proposed to slash bill credits for excess solar production sent back to the grid in half.
Rejecting the proposal, the Michigan Public Service Commission said, “The Commission is not convinced by the company’s argument that DG (distributed generation) customers create a cost shift onto non-DG customers and does not find that the company properly evaluated the benefits of DG…” 
A nationwide study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory of net metering found that a cost shift is negligible until solar reaches 10% of the grid mix. In its filing with the Commission, DTE said it would voluntarily increase the current 1% cap on the number of customers that can participate in its residential rooftop solar program to 3%, but only if its proposals are approved. 
The Commission flatly rejected the proposed mandatory rates, which Inskeep said “included confusing and egregiously high fixed charges.” 
Net metering policy battles are cropping up in most major solar markets across the nation. Recently, there have been rooftop solar policy failures in California and Indiana.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/21/uconn-receives-4-4-million-solar-plus-batteries-predictive-resilience-grant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,RESIDENTIAL PV,CONNECTICUT,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 21, 2022",UConn receives $4.4 million solar-plus-batteries predictive resilience grant,"As storms intensify and increase their frequency, the University of Connecticut (UConn) has partnered with investor-owned utility Eversource to develop clean energy solutions to prepare communities for power outages, aiming at shortening restoration times.
The two organizations partnered for Eversource Energy Center, the university’s resiliency center which recently received a $4.4 million grant from the Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), which is operated by the Department of Energy (DOE). The resilience funds are provided through SETO’s Renewables Advancing Community Energy Resilience program. DOE will provide $3 million to the program, while the Eversource Energy Center will bear $1.4 million of the cost.
The Eversource Energy Center will leverage its Outage Prediction Model to forecast the impact of storms, using meteorological data to proactively position power restoration crews in advance of inclement weather.
The funds will also support the development of distributed energy resources and predictive software to achieve the goal of faster response times. Dubbed PROACTIVE (predictive community outage preparedness and active last mile visibility feedback autonomous restoration), the project is aimed at developing and demonstrating a predictive community outage preparedness and restoration solution.
The project will also help ensure rapid power restoration to remote and rural areas that often experience the longest power outage times following extreme weather events.
“Due to the lack of proper outage prediction tools, stakeholders face challenges to forecast infrastructure damages and their severity ahead of time, thus significantly affecting outage preparedness,” said Junbo Zhao, associate director of the Eversource Energy Center. “After extreme events, there is also a lack of robust sensing and communication systems to allow quick estimation of infrastructure damage and availability of assets and energy resources to aid the rapid restoration.”
Zhao said PROACTIVE will leverage grid visibility for a more informed, safe, coordinated, and automated response. It will rely on granular data and sensors to more rapidly identify the localized source of the outage.
It will also depend on cooperation among communities, leaning on affluent communities who have more distributed solar and storage resources to assist those without distributed assets.  For example, an affluent town like West Hartford could provide surplus power to a neighboring municipality such as Hartford, said Zhao.
The PROACTIVE team is currently engaged with community leaders and stakeholders in West Hartford and Hartford to demonstrate the technologies and how they can benefit each city. The project is expected to take three years to develop and implement.
“Climate change is one of the greatest challenges that we face as a society, and the intensity and frequency of storms is only going to increase,” said Pamir Alpay, UConn’s interim Vice President for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship. “Working with our partners at Eversource, we are committed to developing technology and advancing research to enhance our ability to mitigate the impact of these storms and keep Connecticut residents safe.”
Energy resilience and affordability is a key focus on Connecticut’s capital city of Hartford. Hartford established a local agency called the Energy Improvement District (EID) to pursue sustainability and energy related goals for the city in the long-term. It released a comprehensive plan in 2019, which shared that the energy burden, or energy bill as percent of income, for households at the 50% poverty level is staggering at 33%. The average home energy affordability gap is $1,922 per household per year. And the state’s Home Energy Assistance Program covers only 33% of this gap. Federal programs like SETO’s RACER program and other provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 are aimed at tackling these kinds of problems.

The ADAS system is the first driver-assistance add-on system for Sono’s first EV model which is designed to ensure the Sion model meets newer and stricter European Union road safety regulations.
To date Continental has provided Sono with climate control systems, energy charge and thermal management powertrain systems.  Additional features under the expanded relationship include smart entry and passive access, as well as a crash sensor system.
Sono’s first Sion models are planned to be priced at $25,803, with production slated to begin in the second half of 2023.
The Sion is a consumer solar EV model whose outer shell consists of 456 PV cells to enable self sufficiency on short duration trips, or about 305 km (189.5 miles) of driving range.  The solar cells are expected to add 70 miles of additional driving range to the 54 kWh lithium phosphate battery cell which on its own provides 245 km (152 miles) of weekly driving range.
The battery system will allow for charging capacity of up to 75 kW DC fast charging or 11 kW of standard AC charging.
Sono Motors formed in January 2016 in Karben, Germany, and parent company Sonos Group went public on the Nasdaq exchange in November 2021 with $156.1 million in net proceeds.  The company has received about 20,000 reservations to date for the Sion model. The company also receives components in partnership with Valmet Automotive, Bosch, OPNV and Rhenus Group.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/21/longi-claims-worlds-highest-efficiency-for-silicon-solar-cells/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 21, 2022",Longi claims world’s highest efficiency for silicon solar cells,"Chinese PV module maker Longi has revealed that it has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.81% for an unspecified heterojunction (HJT) solar cell, based on a full-size silicon wafer, in mass production. The result has been confirmed by Germany’s ISFH.
“We cannot disclose if the cell is n-type or p-type at this stage,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
Martin Green, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia and the creator of the “solar cell efficiency tables,” said the result is the highest efficiency record for silicon solar cells to date.
“This outstanding achievement will be included in the next version of efficiency tables published in the progress in photovoltaics,” he said, noting that the previous record of 26.7% was achieved by an unspecified Japanese manufacturer in 2017. Longi likely refers to the result achieved by Japanese chemical company Kaneka. Its 180cm² crystalline silicon device, which featured heterojunction and back-contact technology, achieved 26.63% efficiency.
“Longi broke a new world record for silicon solar cell conversion efficiency with 26.74%, 26.78% and 26.81% respectively, which further affirmed Longi’s determination to continuously focus on R&D investment and promote industrial progress,” said the Chinese manufacturer.
In September, the company said it had achieved an efficiency of 26.12% for a gallium-doped, p-type heterojunction (HJT) solar cell based on an M6 wafer. The company also achieved an efficiency of 25.47% for the same solar cell in March.
In addition, the Chinese manufacturer recorded an efficiency of 26.5% for a n-type heterojunction solar cell in June and a 25.19% rating for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it achieved a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon PV cell.

BlackRock-owned Akaysha Energy is now developing the 1.9 GWh Waratah Super Battery Project north of Sydney.
The company was contracted to deliver a battery with a guaranteed continuous power capacity of at least 700 MW and a guaranteed useable energy storage capacity of at least 1,400 MWh. Powin has now announced that it will supply 909 MW of power equipment and 1,915 MWh of annual storage capacity.
Powin will provide 2,592 units of its modular Centipede BESS platform. Its EKS Energy subsidiary will deliver 288 power conversion systems. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with a targeted completion date in the middle of 2025. The BESS is expected to act as a “shock absorber” for Australia’s electricity grid, as part of a system integrity protection scheme (SIPS).
“This flagship SIPS project will unlock latent transfer capacity in the existing transmission system, help integrate renewable energy, and maintain grid reliability by acting as a ‘shock absorber’ if disruptions such as lightning strikes or bushfires interrupt the flow of electricity,” Powin said in a statement. “The proposed WSB Project will ensure Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong have access to more energy from existing generators while reducing the risk of power disruptions.”
Akaysha Energy won a bid to deliver the energy storage project in October. It will be built on the former grounds of the 1,400 MW Munmorah coal-fired power station.
