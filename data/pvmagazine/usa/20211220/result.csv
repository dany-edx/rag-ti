The move comes after the rural electric cooperative tried to modify its all-requirements contract with Tri-State for three years. United Power’s costs for power from Tri-State are “disproportionately high,” said the co-op’s website, as Tri-State continues to provide power from a “legacy framework” relying heavily on fossil fuels, instead of pursuing renewable power.
“Instead of working with us in the pursuit of lower-cost, cleaner options, Tri-State has resisted these developments,” said Mark Gabriel, United Power president and CEO. “Tri-State recently purchased additional coal generation, is limiting our members’ ability to add more carbon-free generation, and is penalizing additional storage on our system.”
Tri-State’s policies include penalties if a member co-op such as United Power procures more than 5% of its electricity from sources other than Tri-State.
United Power currently has 46 MW of utility scale solar, 38 MW of other renewables, and 4 MW of battery storage. Its customers have 6,800 rooftop PV systems. The co-op serves customers with 100,000 meters in Colorado’s northern front range.
FERC is expected to set an exit fee for United Power, which the co-op said should reflect its “fair share” of Tri-State’s long-term debt.
Two other co-ops, Kit Carson and Delta Montrose, have exited Tri-State in recent years. At least six other co-ops are considering a potential exit, says United Power.
United Power is a founding member of the NextGen Cooperative Alliance, which aims to expand power supply and procurement options for rural co-ops, and reform the business model for generation and transmission co-ops.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/20/sen-manchin-opposes-build-back-better-tanking-solar-stocks/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WEST VIRGINIA,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 20, 2021","Sen. Manchin opposes Build Back Better, tanking solar stocks","In a heavy blow to the roughly $2 trillion Build Back Better bill designed at overhauling U.S. infrastructure, health care, education, climate, immigration, and more, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) commented that he “cannot vote” for the legislation in its current form.
The holdout came as Manchin cited rising inflation, consumer prices, increasing federal debt, and the arrival of the COVID-19 virus’ Omicron variant as reasons he would not support the bill.

Democrats voiced their displeasure for Manchin’s decision, saying that his negotiations were not in good faith. The Biden bill had been scaled back from original ambitions to earn the senator’s vote. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the senator’s comments are “at odds with his discussion this week with the President, with White House staff, and with his own public utterances.”
Manchin’s step back represents a hurdle for Democrats looking to pass the legislation, as total support of Democrats would be needed to perform reconciliation, a process that allows for the bypass of the impending Republican filibuster. In recent weeks, Manchin has argued for a price tag under $1.75 trillion, down from the current design of $2 trillion, and less than half the original design of $3.5 trillion.
Psaki responded to Manchin’s and Republican concerns, arguing that the $2 trillion deal would not drive further inflation, but instead would offer relief. She reiterated that the spending initiated by the bill would be fully financed through tax policy changes, adding nothing to the federal deficit.
The Build Back Better Act would have included a record $550 billion for climate measures, including tax credits for the domestic manufacture of solar, upfront consumer rebates, and much more.
In a statement on the issue, Manchin’s office said, “In the last two years, as Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and with bipartisan support, we have invested billions of dollars into clean energy technologies so we can continue to lead the world in reducing emissions through innovation. But to do so at a rate that is faster than technology or the markets allow will have catastrophic consequences for the American people like we have seen in both Texas and California in the last two years.”
U.S. solar stocks were stung hard by the news on Monday morning. At the time of writing, First Solar has fallen 8%, Sunrun nearly 7%, SunPower roughly 7%. International solar stocks took the news hard as well, with SolarEdge down nearly 10%, and Enphase nearly 7%.
Senate budget committee Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said, “[Manchin]… is going to have to explain to the people of West Virginia why he’s rejecting what the scientists of the world are telling us: that we have to act boldly and transform our energy systems to protect future generations from the devastation of climate change.”
The White House commented that it will continue to negotiate to win Sen. Manchin’s vote at the $2 trillion proposal level.

The entire portfolio is comprised of 13 renewable projects in 15 counties spanning 5 states, including 1.8 GW of onshore wind and 0.5 GW of utility-scale solar projects. The portfolio is estimated to be producing enough renewable energy on the grid to provide power to the equivalent of over 500,000 homes in the U.S., and each project was constructed between the end of 2019 and the second half of 2021.
Each of the 13 projects has off-take agreements with customers, and their capacity represents a significant portion of Engie’s roughly 3 GW of renewable generation in the U.S. today. The company does also have a pipeline of 10 GW of renewable projects on the horizon.
The two companies targeted what they deemed to be key markets in the United States for the portfolio, including the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and PJM Interconnection (PJM).
The projects were financed using $2 billion in tax equity commitments, including $1.6 billion in tax equity that Engie was able to secure in April 2020.
Hannon Armstrong’s entrance into the portfolio was announced in July 2020, when the company took an immediate ownership of 49% of the 663 MW of wind projects that were already commissioned. The remaining 1.6 GW of projects were transferred into the partnership upon commissioning.

The $100 million tax equity investment for the project was secured from Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank. Debt for the project was provided by Banco Santander and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.
The project has a power contract in place with the Alabama Municipal Electric Authority (AMEA), a wholesale power provider for 11 public power utilities in Alabama. According to Lightsource BP,  the Black Bear Project is being constructed just 15 miles from AMEA’s headquarters in Montgomery. The project will consist of 350,000 solar panels installed across 800 acres of land and is expected to achieve commercial operation in late 2022.
Once completed, the Black Bear project will add significant capacity to Alabama’s installed solar portfolio, and will be among the largest projects completed in the state. After many years as a bottom-ranked state for solar capacity, Alabama made substantial additions in 2021, bringing the state’s total installed capacity to just under 580 MW.
Much of the recent capacity additions, however, are due to one incredibly large project. In September, the 227 MW Muscle Shoals solar PV project entered service in Colbert County, Alabama, along the border with Mississippi.
Muscle Shoals was developed by Ørsted and has a long-term Green Invest power purchase agreement (PPA) with TVA, which, in turn, will supply energy to a Meta (Facebook) data center in Huntsville, Alabama. Its 227 MW of capacity makes it the largest project in Alabama. Prior to Muscle Shoals, Alabama had a cumulative installed solar capacity of around 280 MW, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), meaning Muscle Shoals nearly doubled the state’s installed capacity.
SEIA projects that Alabama will install 1,350 MW over the next five years. That would place Alabama 27th in the country for solar installations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/20/paired-with-wonder-material-over-21-efficiency-demonstrated-in-perovskite-solar-cells/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 20, 2021","Paired with “wonder material,” over 21% efficiency demonstrated in perovskite solar cells","Breaking research published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society demonstrated the efficacy of what has been hailed a “wonder material”: phosphorene nanoribbons (PNR). 
The material, first produced in 2019, is comprised of ultra-thin “2D” layers that are one atom thick. Many theoretical use cases have been considered for the material, including enhancing batteries, biomedical sensors, and quantum computing. 
Now, a research team from the Imperial College of London and University College London have brought the theoretical to the actual, demonstrating the photovoltaic-boosting effect PNR brings to solar cells. When applied in tandem with a perovskite solar cell, PNR-boosted cells achieved an efficiency above 21%, putting them on par with traditional silicon cell output levels.
Perovskites are hailed for being earth-abundant, and highly alterable by scientists. Improvements in efficiency and stability are being evaluated worldwide in test laboratories to find a possible counterpart to silicon solar cells, which are tied to some supply-chain constraints and labor concerns.
PNRs directly aided the perovskite cells in “hole mobility.” In photovoltaics, the “hole” represents the partner of electrons in electric transport, so increasing hole mobility improves the speed and strength of the current between the layers of the device, improving overall efficiency.
The research team said that in addition to improving perovskite cells, the experimental validation of PNRs will also help create design rules for optoelectronics, which are devices that emit or detect light. Further experimentation will continue to modify the surface of the PNR, possibly improving the unique electronic properties of the material, said the team.

The expansion will also deliver at least 35% of the benefits with a goal of 40% from the investments to disadvantaged communities and low-to moderate- income New Yorkers.
The plan, which was submitted by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the New York State Department of Public Service (DPS) to the Public Service Commission for public comment and approval supports the State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate Act) mandate to generate 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030.
Read “New York state is going to need 23 GW more solar power“.
“In New York, we recognize the time to act on climate change is now — we simply cannot wait as we have seen the impacts of this crisis devastate our communities, our businesses, and our economy,” Governor Hochul said.
NYSERDA and DPS carefully evaluated multiple strategies to deploy 10 GW or more of distributed solar including projects that are under 5 MW in size, including rooftop installations and community solar projects. The groups determined that extending the State’s successful NY-Sun initiative provides the most efficient, familiar, and cost-effective path forward. Expanding the state’s solar goal is expected to have an average impact for New York customers’ bills of less than 1%, or approximately $0.71 per month for the average residence.
This announcement builds on the state’s success under NY-Sun whereby installed distributed solar projects, combined with the projects that are under development, bring the State to 95% of the current Climate Act goal to install 6 GW of distributed solar by 2025. In 2020, New York was ranked first in the nation in new community solar installations and second for total distributed solar installations.

The Saddlebrook Solar + Storage Project will consist of a 102.5 MW solar facility using bifacial modules, paired with a GridStar Flow battery energy storage system, that will be up to 6.5 MW/52 MWh in capacity. This pilot project is expected to be the largest flow battery energy storage facility in Alberta and will aid the region’s sustainability and decarbonization efforts.
Flow batteries are electrochemical storage devices that use reusable, externally stored electrolytes, which generally leads to them being less expensive, safer, more flexible and adaptable when compared to lithium-ion, as well as being able to discharge their electricity over a longer duration, in this instance 8 hours.
Phase one of the project, which pertains to the solar installation is expected to begin construction in Q2 2022, and reach commercial operation in Q4 2022. The battery system is expected to follow just over a year later, commencing installation in Q2 2023 and achieving operation in Q1 2024.
The installation will also be the subject of research, conducted by the University of Calgary, Lockheed Martin, and TC Energy, to demonstrate the effectiveness of a large-scale solar plus storage generation facility and inform similar sustainable energy projects across Canada.
Alberta has, of late, become Canada’s solar hotbed. Westbridge Energy Corporation recently acquired a 75% controlling interest in Sunnynook Solar Energy, the company developing a 236 MW solar and 100 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) project in Alberta. Westbridge has also initiated two BESS projects in Alberta, set to total 200 MW in capacity, and the 230 MW Georgetown Solar Project, though that installation is being built in Calgary.
The Canadian Renewable Energy Association expects close to 2 GW of wind and solar projects to begin construction or complete installation before the end of the year.
Alongside the battery, Lockheed Martin is also investing $9 million (USD) toward the development and construction of the Saddlebrook Solar + Storage Project. The investment is associated with Canada’s purchase and in-service support of 17 CC-130J Super Hercules aircraft, delivered to the Royal Canadian Air Force from 2010 through 2012.
