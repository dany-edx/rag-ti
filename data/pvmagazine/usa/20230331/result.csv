The project is UGE’s largest community solar project to date and will be built on a vacant field on the outskirts of Bangor, Maine, owned by Grant Realty.
The NTP milestone indicates that financing for the project has closed, and all permits and interconnection approvals for the project are in place.
Subscriptions for the project will be managed by Energywell, an energy technology company offering clean electricity and community solar products under its ThinkEnergy retail platform. All energy produced by the facility will be used by local residents.
UGE had the project appraised by an third-party firm at a value of $3.24 per watt, giving the project a fair market value of $9.2 million. The project is expected to produce an average of approximately $626,402 in annual revenue, once operational, with a total facility lifetime of up to 35 years. The company currently expects average recurring revenue to carry gross margins at or around 85%.
The Bangor community solar project is among 18 MW of UGE solar projects  currently under development in Maine and follows two other recent NTPs announced earlier this month in Dover-Foxcroft, a 1 MW project to be deployed for the Foxcroft Academy, a private school, and Veazie, Maine, a 2.7 MW community solar project.
The Veazie project location is categorized as a low-to-moderate income (LMI) community, and is expected to receive the 10% LMI Investment Tax Credit adder as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, UGI stated, potentially bringing the total ITC on the $9.1 million project to a 50% ITC credit. 
Including the Bangor project, UGE has reached NTP on 10 MW of projects this year and commercial operation on 1.4 MW of projects. Construction on its latest project is set to begin this spring.
Maine was one of the early adopters of community solar in the U.S., with original legislation for community solar first passed in 2009.  Due to net metering caps and policy changes, in 2019 the Maine Legislature passed its current community solar framework, ‘An Act to Promote Solar Energy Projects and Distributed Generation Resources in Maine,’ to encourage the development of DG solar to both residential and commercial businesses.
Under its community solar program, participating customers receive kilowatt-hour (kWh) credits on their electric utility bill that reduce the amount of the payment owed to the utility, to the standard offer service provider, or, if applicable, to the customer’s competitive electricity provider.
According to the Department of Energy’s Community Solar Market Trends database, as of early 2022 the state of Maine had 12.49 MW of active community solar projects.
Over the last two years alone, Brookfield Renewable-owned Luminace, Nautilus Solar Energy, Nexamp, Renewable Properties, Standard Solar, Summit Ridge Energy, SunRaise and Syncarpha Capital have been involved in Maine community solar development through project financing, development or acquisition, according to pv magazine USA coverage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/31/doe-workforce-program-matches-recent-grads-with-energy-fellowship-opportunities/,"EMPLOYMENT,PUERTO RICO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 31, 2023",DOE workforce program matches recent grads with energy fellowship opportunities,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) launched the second round of the Clean Energy Innovator Fellowship, a workforce development program that matches recent graduates with energy organizations to support efforts to grow the clean energy workforce.
The program is now accepting applications for host institutions including state public utility commissions, grid operators, and cooperative and municipal utilities. Also identified in this second round as priority host institutions are tribal utilities, inter-tribal Councils or other tribal organizations, and essential energy organizations in Puerto Rico .
Through the program, hosts receive support to help them accelerate the transition to clean energy and to assist them in taking advantage of federal grid resilience and modernization funding opportunities. In September 2022, DOE announced the critical energy institutions that will host a fellow for the next year, renewable for a second year, shown on the map.
“We cannot transition to a 100% clean power system without a skilled, innovative, diverse workforce, and that is exactly what the Clean Energy Innovator Fellowship helps build,” said Alejandro Moreno, acting assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy, DOE. “This fellowship program expands the talent pool for careers that support the electric grid and, ultimately, the U.S. economy.”
The fellowship is open to recent graduates with bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degrees, as well as mid-career professionals in fields relevant to electricity generation, transmission and distribution. For those seeking placement in Puerto Rico, Spanish language proficiency is recommended, but not required.
Innovator Fellows will spend up to two years supporting projects that the host institutions identify as critical to enhancing grid resilience and/or advancing decarbonization. These can include state engagement in electrification, accelerated electric vehicle deployment, essential grid services on the distribution system, development of tribal energy expertise, and more.
“As we implement the historic investments of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, a strong workforce is needed to ensure all communities have access to affordable, reliable, and resilient power,” said Maria Robinson, director, Grid Deployment Office.
The Clean Energy Innovator Fellowship is supported by DOE’s Grid Deployment Office and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Innovator Fellows will receive a stipend to support their participation in the program and an allowance for education and professional development opportunities.
Applications for host institutions are due by April 27, 2023, and are available here. Applications should include a project scope and describe their institution’s needs.
Host Institution projects will be posted on the Clean Energy Innovator Fellowship website by May 19, 2023, and applications for Innovator Fellows will open on May 22, 2023 and due on June 8, 2023. Fellowship candidates will be asked to describe their interest in the opportunity and their relevant skills and experience. Candidates should indicate their top host projects of interest in their applications.  The Clean Energy Innovator Fellowship is administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE).

The one-hour discharge battery system will operate in conjunction with an adjacent 13 MW (AC) ground-mounted solar facility located on a leased site within Camp Lejeune, a U.S. Marine Corps base.
The project’s physical footprint is about 1 acre of land. Duke Energy partnered with Black & Veatch affiliate Overland Contracting, Inc., which served as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor for construction of the project.
The Camp Lejeune solar facility, which includes 55,000 SolarWorld modules, was commissioned in 2015.
“Battery storage is an important resource for our transition to cleaner energy,” said Kendal Bowman, president of Duke Energy’s North Carolina regulated utility business. “Pairing the energy storage system with our existing solar facility at Camp Lejeune helps strengthen the reliability of our energy grid and makes better use of our existing solar generation.”
Both projects are connected to a Duke Energy substation and will be used to serve all Duke Energy Progress customers. The utility said that with further work, the plant could enable the solar and battery systems to improve the resiliency of MCB Camp Lejeune against outages.
The Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune has an enhanced use lease and strategic partnership with Duke Energy Progress, which, according to U.S. Navy Cmdr. Ross Campbell, director, Public Works at MCB Camp Lejeune, has helped make an investment in “the pursuit of energy security inside the fence-line.”
“Integration of the solar plant with a battery energy storage system, unthinkable a decade ago, presents the installation with a number of opportunities to achieve energy resilience objectives,” Campbell said. “These systems are part of the ongoing collaboration with the Department of Defense and its utility providers to ensure energy security at federal facilities.”
In recent years, Duke Energy has been expanding battery storage in North Carolina. A lithium-ion battery system is operating next to a Duke Energy substation in the Shiloh community of Asheville. In  the town of Hot Springs, the company has a lithium-ion battery system that is part of a microgrid in the town.
The utility plans to continue investing in battery technology over the next few years. Duke Energy expects to have more than 1,600 MW of battery storage in service by 2029. Currently, the company’s regulated utilities have about 90 MW of battery energy storage projects in operation in three states. Currently, Duke’s regulated utilities have about 90 MW of battery energy storage projects in operation in three states, with plans to have more than 1.6 GW of battery storage in service by 2029.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/31/top-five-battery-energy-storage-system-design-essentials/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 31, 2023",Top five battery energy storage system design essentials,"Demand for energy storage is on the rise. The increase in extreme weather and power outages also continue to contribute to growing demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS). As a result, there are many questions about sizing and optimizing BESS to provide either energy, grid ancillary services, and/or site backup and blackstart capability. Before beginning BESS design, it’s important to understand auxiliary power design, site layout, cable sizing, grounding system and site communications design.
Auxiliary power is electric power that is needed for HVAC for the battery stacks as well as control and communications. This sounds deceptively simple for equipment that has no moving parts, yet it is often a moving target, as BESS vendors continue to morph their designs after an order is placed. Therefore, when it comes to auxiliary design, you must be able to answer the following questions:
These are just a few examples of the many questions that must be answered prior to embarking on the auxiliary design. 
BESS site layout can be easy or complicated, depending on the site location, the site owner’s preferences or requirements, and the BESS itself. Some of the main questions to consider for the site layout are:
BESS systems usually involve short, high ampacity underground runs from the battery rack containers to the inverters or DC/DC converters. In order to avoid excessive cable derates and resulting in larger cables and costs for short underground runs, you will need to consider:
Many BESS sites are relatively small, and substation grounding design methods don’t really apply. So you need to ask, what is the design goal? Depending on how the design is approached, a site can either end up with an expensive mesh grid or a reasonable design to connect all of the equipment, and both will be equally safe.
Additionally, are you concerned about possible Radio Frequency Interference being generated by the BESS? Some vendors require additional methods, such as six additional grounding connections per inverter. Is the BESS located at a 911 Call Center or in a remote area? Answering questions like this will help your design and installation process go as smoothly as possible.
Communications are an integral part of BESS design, as it allows for remote data monitoring and/or management, and for the BESS system to communicate with the power grid as well as connect to peripheral components. The following site communications design questions should be answered in order to properly design this aspect of a BESS:
