Chikao and other researchers at Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology first created an optical absorption layer utilizing a perovskite crystal structure in 1999. Nearly twenty five years later, researchers are still working to stabilize solar degradation.
This time around, researchers from multiple universities across the Mediterranean built and deployed a perovskite solar panel that lasted about nine months. The panels degraded approximately 25% from their original output, before experiencing a catastrophic encapsulation failure. This led to a mechanical panel failure, as the elements rapidly wore down the perovskites.
The paper, Integration of two-dimensional materials-based perovskite solar panels into a stand-alone solar farm, goes into detail on how the collaboration went about fully constructing nine 0.5 m2 perovskite solar panels. The panels were composed of 40 individual ‘modules’ (the authors use the term modules, we will use the term ‘cell’), with the array peaking at 261 watts of output, while individual cells ranged in output from 25 to 35 watts. The authors reported that the 360 solar cells, measured at 1 sun irradiation, were 12.5%±1.6 efficient.
The authors also provided a supplemental document that broke down all of the ingredients that go into making one of their solar panels, even including the electricity consumed in manufacturing, (approximately 11.25 kWh). The panels were named “GRAPE” because the “PE”rovskite was complemented by “GRA”phene.
After being deployed in June, the panel peaked above 250 watts of output – as can be seen in the lower right, image C. The panel saw an immediate drop in output, followed by a stable month, and then a slow, but fairly steady decrease in peak output – down 20% – going into January/February. At that point, output degradation sharply accelerated, and was followed by a total lamination failure, allowing for the ingress of oxygen and water.

The team suggests that the lamination failure was due to their use of the low temperature laminate (85 °C) chosen to seal solar cells within the panel frame. A low temperature laminate was chosen as a way to avoid damaging the temperature-sensitive perovskites in the lamination process, since the degradation of perovskites is accelerated at higher temperatures.
One very interesting observation is that output losses were roughly zero as temperatures increased to 50°C, and beyond. The author’s state, “contrary to many semiconductors, in which the optical band gap (EG) decreases almost linearly with the temperature increase associated with solar cell operation, halide perovskites have a positive correlation between the optical band gap and the temperature.” 
The authors explain that gains resulting from the increased optical band gap were likely offset by a number of uncertain factors, which should be examined in future research. Generally, at 50°C, one would expect the efficiency of a silicon solar panel to be down 7.5-15% from its peak output.
The nine solar panels were deployed in Heraklion, Crete.

Toshiba has developed a grid-forming (GFM) inverter for applications in microgrids.
The Japanese industrial group said the new inverter can maintain the grid frequency of distribution systems by providing pseudo-inertia through power output from the inverter when the grid frequency rapidly fluctuates.
“Toshiba has implemented a control algorithm of the grid-forming inverter in battery energy storage systems instead of conventional control algorithm without inertia, and when there are rapid fluctuations in renewable energy output or power demands, the inverter outputs power and generates a synthetic inertia to maintain the grid frequency,” the company said in a statement. “This instantly suppresses sudden drops in frequency, realizing a stable power supply.”
Toshiba tested the inverter in a simulated microgrid with a grid frequency of 50 Hz, a 40% renewable energy rate, and five 20 kW/14.9 kWh batteries. The system also featured a diesel synchronous generator with a capacity of 125 kVA, and two load banks to vary the power load.
“It was demonstrated that under load fluctuations of 50 kW, grid frequency reductions were suppressed by 70%, from 2.4 Hz (50.0 to 47.6 Hz) to 0.6 Hz (50.0 Hz to 49.4 Hz),” the company said, in reference to the test results. “The frequency threshold for power supply interruptions due to grid frequency fluctuations in East Japan is set at 48.5 Hz, and verifications using actual equipment ensured that the frequency did not fall below this threshold, demonstrating the realization of a stable power supply that avoids power outages.”
The company conducted a second test on a 20 kW PV system without batteries, and found that the grid frequency was suppressed by approximately 30%, from 1 Hz (50.0 to 49.0 Hz) to 0.7 Hz (50.0 to 49.3 Hz).
“Toshiba also verified that instantaneous load on the GFM inverter can be reduced by 30%, from 22 to 16 kW, by selecting an inertia suitable for parallel operation of synchronous generators with internal combustion engines, like those expected to be used in a microgrid,” it said.
The company said it plans to reveal the results at the Annual Conference of the Power and Energy Society of the Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan in September. It will also discuss its findings at the 2022 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE2022) in October.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/29/solar-on-canals-moves-closer-to-reality/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 29, 2022",Solar on canals moves closer to reality,"In February pv magazine reported on Project Nexus, which planned to install solar panels over California canals. Now that project is about to move forward with groundbreaking planned for the fall.
The Turlock Irrigation District (TID) is partnering with the Department of Water Resource (DWR), Solar AquaGrid, and the University of California, Merced in the project funded by the State of California. The project will include energy storage to study how storage facilities can support the local electric grid when solar generation is lowered due to cloud cover.
The concept of solar on California canals grew out of a 2021 study conducted at the University of California, Merced and University, Santa Cruz, which showed that covering the approximately 4,000 miles of public water delivery system infrastructure in California with solar panels can generate 13 GW of energy annually, equal to about one sixth of the state’s current installed capacity and about half the projected new capacity needed to meet the state’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030.
“Solar canals are an example of an energy-water nexus that offer multiple sustainability benefits. Using water canals for solar infrastructure conserves water while producing renewable electricity and avoids converting large tracts of land to solar development,” said Dr. Brandi L. McKuin, lead author of the study.
The study suggests that 63 billion gallons of water could be saved annually by covering canals, which is enough to irrigate 50,000 acres of farmland or meet the water needs of more than 2 million residents. The Project will show how covering canals reduces evaporation as well as possibly improve water quality and reduce vegetative growth.
“Research and common sense tell us that in an age of intensifying drought, it’s time to put a lid on evaporation,” said Jordan Harris, CEO of Solar AquaGrid. “Our initial study revealed mounting solar panels over open canals can result in significant water, energy, and cost savings when compared to ground-mounted solar systems, including added efficiency resulting from an exponential shading/cooling effect. Now is the chance to put that learning to the test.”
In addition to studying energy generation on canals as well as benefits to water levels and quality, the project offers an opportunity to study a variety of solar panels and inverters to see how they work when installed over or near the water. Various forms of energy storage will also be studied.
Project Nexus is expected to be complete in 2024 at multiple locations throughout the TID service territory.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/29/houston-area-113-mw-160-million-solar-project-achieves-financing/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 29, 2022","Houston area 113 MW, $160 million solar project achieves financing","The Longbow Solar project has achieved financing, as Monarch Private Capital announced the closing of a tax equity investment in the Brazoria County, Texas solar site. The 113 MW facility is valued at $160 million.
Monarch is a national environmental and social governance investment firm that develops, finances, and manages a diverse portfolio of projects that generate federal and state tax credits. The company engages tax equity financing in pursuit of sustainability-focused projects.
The Longbow Solar project is expected to reach commercial operations this year. It will bring Monarch’s total clean energy generation capacity to 1.6 GW, equivalent to abating 17 million megatons of CO2 over a 35-year lifespan or removing 3.6 million passenger cars from the road for one year.
“The closing of Longbow Solar marks yet another significant milestone for Monarch and the continued growth of our renewable energy division,” said Jonathan Gross, director of renewable energy at Monarch. “Solar power is quickly becoming an integral part of the Nation’s energy mix and a powerful tool in our quest to fight climate change and foster a better future for our planet and the next generations to inherit it.”
Since the launch of its energy division in 2012, the firm has supported $2 billion in renewable energy development across 221 projects in 23 states. This July, Monarch announced it joined the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), along with CEP Renewables, Kiewit Energy Group, and Moss & Associates.
“The 113 megawatts of clean power generated by the Brazoria County project help diversify the local energy infrastructure, enabling emissions reduction and preserving resource reliability,” said Marsha Harrington, director of renewable energy at Monarch Private Capital.
The Longbow Solar project was previously co-developed by Clean Capital Partners and Aspen Creek, and Twain Financial Partners closed a $42 million commitment to the project this past April. The solar site is being developed on former rice fields.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/29/panasonic-plans-second-4-billion-u-s-ev-battery-plant/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,CALIFORNIA,KANSAS,OKLAHOMA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 29, 2022",Panasonic plans second $4 billion U.S. EV battery plant,"Panasonic, which supplies its electric vehicle (EV) batteries to companies like Tesla, announced it plans another $4 billion factory, which is expected to be located in Oklahoma, reports sources close to the Wall Street Journal. The factory joins a Kansas City area facility that was announced last month.
The Kansas factory is expected to create up to 4,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, and this location would effectively double the total. When complete, the Kansas plant would be the largest economic development in the state’s history and would be larger than the Nevada gigafactory Panasonic currently operates with Tesla.
The two new factories, representing $8 billion in investment, will be built to serve the sharply increasing demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. Automotive manufacturers and suppliers have publicly announced more than $38 billion in investment through 2026 to boost battery production in the U.S., said AlixPartners.
The factories are expected to produce Panasonic’s lithium-ion 4680 cells, of which the properties and exact chemistry has not yet been revealed. Elon Musk has described the Panasonic product as, “the world’s most advanced cell.”
“With the increased electrification of the automotive market, expanding battery production in the US is critical to help meet demand,” said Kazuo Tadanobu, president, CEO of Panasonic Energy. “Given our leading technology and depth of experience, we aim to continue driving growth of the lithium-ion battery industry and accelerating towards a net-zero emissions future.”
Demand is set to be supercharged by recent legislation at state and federal levels. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains a $4,000 consumer tax credit for low/middle income individuals to buy used clean vehicles, and up to $7500 for new clean vehicles, which includes electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.
The IRA also provides incentives on the production side, with $40 billion in tax credits dedicated to domestic electric vehicle production. The incentives come as part of an effort to onshore and shorten supply chains, thereby lessening dependence on foreign nations to power the U.S. energy transition.
EVs will also be boosted by the recent California ruling to ban all new sales of gas-powered cars by 2035. Under the law, Californians can continue to drive gas-fueled vehicles and purchase used ones after 2035. The plan also allows for 20% of sales after 2035 to be plug-in hybrids that can run on batteries and gas.
The new law is set to spur demand for infrastructure to support an electric-powered transportation sector, including solar and electric vehicle charging stations. Currently, there are about 80,000 charging stations in California, well short of the goal of 250,000 by 2025.
Other states legislatures, including in Washington, New York, and Massachusetts, have publicly stated that the passage of the California combustion engine ban opens the door for similar laws to be enacted in their respective states soon.
“The climate crisis is solvable if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to stem the tide of carbon pollution,” said Governor Gavin Newsom.
More than 1 billion customers use Panasonic products every day, generating 86 million tons of CO2 emissions based on electricity consumption figures. This amounts to approximately 110 million tons of CO2 emissions across our entire value chain, a number that is equivalent to about 1% of total emissions from global electricity consumption. The company has entered an initiative to become net-zero in its business operations by 2030 and sets further goals for its sustainability by 2050.
LG Energy Solutions and Honda also announced an agreement to establish a joint venture company to produce lithium-ion EV batteries in the U.S. Under the agreement, the two will invest $4.4 billion to build and operate a plant with an annual production capacity of 40 GWh. Construction is slated for early 2023, with plans to begin mass production of the pouch-based battery cells by the end of 2025.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/29/gaf-energy-breaks-ground-on-solar-roofing-plant/,"EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 29, 2022",GAF Energy breaks ground on Texas solar roofing plant," A groundbreaking ceremony was held recently for GAF Energy’s new 450,000-square foot manufacturing center in Georgetown, Texas. This will be GAF Energy’s second manufacturing facility in the U.S., and reportedly the largest solar roofing manufacturing facility in the world. It is expected to bring hundreds of jobs to the Georgetown area.
“One of the reasons I was drawn to work at our parent company, Standard Industries, was their commitment to U.S.-based jobs and manufacturing. We’re thrilled to be building the future of solar here in Georgetown, Texas. The community has welcomed us with open arms—and made the decision of where to build our second facility easy,” said Martin DeBono, President of GAF Energy. “We’re producing our technologically cutting edge Timberline Solar roof here in the U.S. because we believe it allows us to make the best product for our customers.”
GAF Energy manufactures Timberline Solar, a nailable solar shingle that the company says is the only roof system to directly integrate solar technology into traditional roofing processes and materials. Construction expected to be completed by the summer of 2023, with full-operation by the end of 2023.
GAF Energy introduced Timberline Solar in January of this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where it won three awards, including its highest honor, the Best of Innovation award, for ‘Smart Cities.’ The product was also named an Innovation Award honoree in both the ‘Smart Cities’ and ‘Smart Home’ categories. What sets the Timberline Solar roof apart from competing products (Tesla’s, for example) is that the roof system directly integrates solar technology into traditional roofing processes and materials.
Congressman John Carter, Georgetown Mayor Josh Schroeder, and other community leaders were on hand to celebrate the groundbreaking.
“Texas’ 31st district continues to grow because it’s a great place to live and work, and today we see more of that growth,” said Congressman Carter. “I’m proud that GAF Energy has chosen our great community to call home and create hundreds of new manufacturing jobs right here in Georgetown. GAF Energy is a shining example of the American spirit of innovation to meet the needs of today, while focusing on the future. I welcome them to my district and look forward to their continued success in their new home.”
Timberline Solar is currently manufactured at GAF Energy’s facility in San Jose, California, which was constructed last year after the company moved manufacturing out of South Korea. At the time the facility was expected to be able to produce 50 MW of solar panels annually, and provide jobs to about 400 people in manufacturing, engineering, and R&D.
