Bluebonnet is expected to be complete in Q2 2024.
Messer is a manufacturer of industrial gases, such as argon, helium and oxygen, serving the medical, electronic and other industries. The solar installation is expected to provide energy to the company’s new air separation unit.
This is the fourth acquisition between Standard Solar and EDF Renewables, including Lawsbrook, Knox and Lehigh University, according to Eric Partyka, director of business development at Standard Solar.
EDF Renewables’ Distribution-Scale Power team developed the project and will continue as EPC contractor throughout the construction phase. EDF Renewables is among the largest developers of renewable energy in North America, with 24 GW of solar, storage, and wind projects across the continent. About 70% of the company’s project pipeline is solar.
“This project represents a significant milestone for Standard Solar as we expand our footprint into the Texas renewable energy market,” said Partyka.
The Bluebonnet project is being developed on a greenfield site and features bifacial modules on single-axis trackers. The project is expected to yield approximately 25,000 MWh of renewable energy annually. The energy produced is expected to provide a significant portion of Messer’s energy consumption.
“The Messer McGregor facility marks the first time an air separation unit has had a significant portion of its electricity demand met through a direct connect solar energy scheme,” said Chris Ebeling, EVP, sales and marketing US Bulk, Messer Americas. “The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market structure and abundance of open space and sunlight make this project a win from an environmental and economic perspective.”
Standard Solar specializes in developing, funding and long-term ownership and operation of commercial and community solar assets. Based in Rockville, Maryland, Standard Solar currently  more than 300 MW of solar in 23 states across the U.S. In September 2022 Brookfield Renewable acquired Standard Solar for consideration of $540 million with the potential to invest an additional $160 million to support the company’s growth initiatives.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/15/bayotech-to-launch-u-s-hydrogen-hubs-in-2024/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"DECEMBER 15, 2023",BayoTech to launch U.S. hydrogen hubs in 2024,"From pv magazine Global: The Hydrogen Stream
BayoTech has completed its first hydrogen hub in the United States. The first hub in Wentzville, Missouri, should be followed by two other inaugurations in 2024. “These upcoming hubs are strategically planned to be located in Northern California and Southern California,” the company told pv magazine. The company is also working on developing 12 other sites across the country. “The selection of these sites is driven by the company’s keen attention to market demand, ensuring that we can effectively meet the growing needs of our customers.” The company said it wants to produce hydrogen close to the point of demand. BayoTech’s proprietary hydrogen production technology is Steam Methane Reforming (SMR). “We use a blend of natural gas and renewable natural gas to produce carbon-neutral hydrogen.”
Versogen said it has achieved membrane production capacity to support 1 GW of AEM electrolyzers per year. “From the company’s roots in a research lab at the University of Delaware, Versogen has scaled up the production capabilities of its proprietary PiperION polymer by a factor greater than 2,000 times,” said the Delaware-based startup.
Lhyfe has inaugurated its renewable hydrogen production site in Buléon, France – the first of its kind to be built in Brittany. “Lhyfe Bretagne will mainly supply the region’s mobility and the industrial processes of regional companies,” said the French company in an emailed note. Lhyfe will produce up to 2 tons of green hydrogen per day, or up to 575 tons per year, banking on 5 MW of installed electrolysis capacity.
The UK government has announced backing for 11 green hydrogen projects and confirmed suppliers will receive a guaranteed price for the clean energy they supply. In return for this government support, the projects should invest over GBP 400 million in the next three years, delivering 125 MW of new hydrogen. The government mentioned a project in South Wales, one in Scotland and one in England. The first will lead Port Talbot paper mill to replace 50% of the current gas boiler consumption with hydrogen, the second plans to run a boiler on 100% hydrogen for use in InchDairnie Distillery’s distilling process, the third will allow PD Ports in Teesside to use hydrogen to replace diesel in their vehicle fleet, decarbonizing port operations from 2026. “Today’s announcement represents the largest number of commercial-scale green hydrogen production projects announced at once anywhere in Europe,” said UK Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho.
The British government has also decided not to proceed with the proposed trial in Redcar as designed. It said that the decision was “due to issues in obtaining a robust, local hydrogen supply.” The authorities will decide in 2026 how hydrogen will contribute to decarbonizing household heat.
Jan Rosenow, director of non-governmental organization RAP, has published a summary of 54 independent studies assessing the scientific evidence for using hydrogen for heating buildings. “The analysis concludes that the scientific evidence does not support a major role for hydrogen in cost-optimal decarbonization pathways being associated with higher energy system and consumer costs,” he said in “A meta-review of 54 studies on hydrogen heating,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Sustainability. Rosenow concluded that electrification and district heating are deemed preferable due to higher efficiency and lower costs in the majority of analyzed studies. “Roughly speaking, you could say that heat pumps and distract heating are between three to five times more efficient,” Rosenow told pv magazine. “In terms of costs to consumers, the median of all estimates would suggest that hydrogen would be almost twice as expensive as the other alternatives.”

The projects are located in Illinois and Arkansas and were acquired from TED Renewables.
Once operational, the projects will more than double Adapture Renewables’ portfolio of operating assets to a total of about 800 MWdc. Together these projects are expected to generate enough electricity to power over 72,000 homes annually and avoid the equivalent emissions of 121,432 gas-powered cars driven for a year.
Illinois and Arkansas are high-growth states for solar, ranking in the top third of U.S. states for deployment growth projections over the next five years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The MISO projects will employ local contractors and businesses during construction phases and will continue to support operations and maintenance jobs once activated. All three projects acquired are in the pre-Notice to Proceed stage, with commercial operations dates anticipated for 2025 and 2026.
Adapture Renewables is owned by Kirkbi, the private holding and investment company of the Kirk Kristiansen family, creators of the Lego brand. Adapture is based in Oakland, California.
MISO development
MISO, or the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, is a grid-operator region spanning from Louisiana through Michigan and the Dakotas.
In 2022 the grid operator approved a plan to build six transmission lines across nine states to support the influx of new renewable energy capacity like the Adapture projects. The lines are expected to enter service near the end of the decade.
The lines will support interconnection of 53 GW of renewables, and although they will cost $10.3 billion, they will reduce other costs by $37 to $68 billion, said Johannes Pfeifenberger, a principal with The Brattle Group.
Given that the first stage of MISO’s new transmission won’t be completed for six to eight years, the Clean Grid Alliance called for “stopgap measures” such as grid enhancing technologies, which can increase the utilization of existing transmission lines, “to be able to continue to deploy renewables and storage.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/15/nova-scotias-largest-utility-scale-solar-facility-is-complete/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 15, 2023",One of Nova Scotia’s largest utility-scale solar facilities is complete,"Nova Scotia has the strongest greenhouse gas reductions target in all of Canada, aiming for 53% below 2005 levels by 2030, 80% renewables by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. With the completion of its largest utility-scale solar facility to date, Nova Scotia moves a step further toward these goals.
The 1.9 MW Mahone Bay is one of  the largest operating solar plant in Nova Scotia, with the 2.4 MW Berwick plant also making a significant contribution to cutting greenhouse gases. Both are community solar projects, with the clean energy available to local residents.
The projects are named for and owned by the towns in which they are located, with Mahone Bay being on the south shore of the province and Berwick not far from the north shore. The two projects were developed by AREA, a municipally owned clean energy project developer, along with Goldbeck Solar, an EPC company that specializes in the construction of large-scale solar. In 2022 the Goldbeck Solar Group acquired the North American PV-EPC business unit of GP Joule and is now the sole shareholder of the two North American companies: GP Joule PV Canada Corp. and GP Joule PV USA Inc.
The projects include LG solar modules, SMA Sunny Highpower Peak 3 inverters, and Goldbeck’s own Solar Phlegon fixed tracking system. Goldbeck reports that the Phlegon is designed for “arduous” terrain, as they feature up to 12% slope tolerance in the east-west direction and a 200 km/h wind resistance level.
AREA is owned by the towns of Berwick, Mahone Bay and Antigonish (where a third solar plant is currently under construction). Goldbeck Solar specializes in the construction of commercial rooftop and ground-mounted solar, and has 200 MW installed in Canada and the United States, with a goal to double that in 2024.
“The completion of Mahone Bay and Berwick aligns with our dedication to advancing sustainable energy solutions,” said Aaron Long, general manager from AREA.
The combined energy production of the two plants is enough to power approximately 803 homes annually. The Berwick Solar Garden is estimated to eliminate approximately 3859 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, equivalent to removing 893 gas-powered cars from the roads.
“These projects, along with the Antigonish solar garden that is still under construction, represent our commitment to the Nova Scotia Renewable Electricity Standard of 80% by 2030,” adds Laurie Boucher, chair of AREA. “AREA, and the municipal electric utilities that it supports, are entirely aligned with the Federal and Provincial ambitions to accelerate the decarbonization of Nova Scotia at least possible cost to ratepayers while simultaneously delivering rural economic development.”
This article was amended to change the stated 4.8 MW size of Mahone Bay facility to 1.9 MW, making it not the largest, but one of the largest in Nova Scotia.

The technologies are:
DOE announced the four priority technologies in a webinar and slide deck giving a “sneak peek” at the content of a forthcoming report on pathways to commercial liftoff for those and other grid technologies.
DOE is now accepting concept papers through January 12 for a share of $10.5 billion in funding support through the department’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program, prioritizing in this funding round projects that “significantly increase transmission capacity,” said Maria Robinson, director of DOE’s Grid Deployment Office. She gave as examples projects using advanced conductors, HVDC, or grid enhancing technologies, as well as substation projects and upgrades that support distributed energy resources and renewables integration.
“In general, we’re always supporting projects that are leveraging advanced transmission technologies, to enhance the flexibility and reliability of the grid,” she said.
Advanced conductors face three deployment challenges, said Isabel Sepulveda, a DOE project manager for smart grid grants. Because their upfront costs are higher than the costs of conventional conductors, this limits their competitiveness in the least-cost investment models “typically used by state regulators to approve transmission plans.” Utility models also “tend to undervalue” the efficiency gains provided by advanced conductors, she said, while training installation crews and greater technical standardization are also needed.
The four priority technologies “are here right now” and can be “deployed today,” said Lucia Tian, senior advisor to DOE’s chief commercialization officer. She said that DOE is hearing a “growing interest” from industry and regulators in such technologies, but “we need to ramp the momentum.”
Tian said the four technologies have “high priority for rapid scaling” and “can have significant impacts on rapidly expanding grid capacity in the near term. But we’re seeing a mismatch between the high system value these solutions can bring and the level of industry interest in these technologies.”
DOE funding programs, including the GRIP program, are available to accelerate more early deployments and catalyze broader uptake of these types of solutions, Tian said. Utilities, regulators, policymakers, solution providers, and other key stakeholders “can start acting today, taking advantage of unprecedented federal investment and policy incentives to accelerate deployment of innovative solutions that can unlock meaningful near-term value.”
The full liftoff report, including an analysis of the remaining technologies that DOE considered, is set for release in early 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/15/unprecedented-solar-and-storage-growth-on-horizon-with-record-installations-and-investments/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 15, 2023",Unprecedented solar and storage growth on horizon with record installations and investments,"In recent years, the United States has made substantial progress in embracing a renewable energy revolution, positioning itself on a path toward a more sustainable future. This transition is being propelled by a convergence of factors, including environmental concerns, economic opportunities and advancements in technology.
With the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), the U.S. is accelerating its move toward clean energy solutions.
To illustrate the extent of this progress, consider the following key statistics: In 2022, the share of renewable energy sources (RES), including hydroelectric power, in the nation’s electricity generation had reached approximately 22%; furthermore, the share of RES in the total electricity generation capacity had increased to approximately 30%.
Notably, in the transportation sector, there is also a growing awareness among consumers, who are increasingly opting for zero-emission fuels, such as electric vehicles. In 2022, the battery electric vehicles (BEVs) share in new vehicle registrations stood at 5.6%, and by the first half of 2023, the share had surged to 7.1%, according to EUPD Research estimates.
The U.S. has set ambitious targets, including achieving 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and aiming for economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050. These targets are expected to provide a significant boost to the clean energy sector in the country, further reinforcing its commitment to a sustainable and environmentally responsible future.
IRA and BIL fueling the boom
The IRA and BIL mark an epochal shift in the landscape of clean energy policy, heralding a new era for the solar and energy storage sectors in the U.S. The IRA allocates substantial resources toward addressing the climate crisis, bolstering domestic clean energy production, and solidifying the U.S. role as a global leader in clean energy manufacturing.
According to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a substantial investment exceeding $120 billion in the U.S. battery manufacturing and supply chain sector has been announced since the introduction of IRA and BIL. Furthermore, plans have been announced for the establishment of more than 200 new or expanded facilities dedicated to minerals, materials processing and manufacturing. This is anticipated to create over 75,000 potential job opportunities, strengthening the country’s workforce.
After the introduction of IRA and BIL, solar PV manufacturing in the U.S. has also seen a substantial surge in planned investments, amounting to nearly $13 billion, according to the DOE. Furthermore, a total of 94 new and expanded PV manufacturing plants have been announced, which could potentially create over 25,000 jobs in the country.
Surging solar sector
In recent years, the solar sector in the U.S. has outpaced other energy sources, including wind and natural gas, in terms of capacity growth. EUPD Research estimates reveal a noteworthy upward trajectory in the contribution of solar capacity to annual power capacity additions. This trend has seen a rise from 37% in 2019 to 38% in 2020, further increasing to 44% in 2021, and reaching an impressive 45% in 2022.
Annual PV capacity in the U.S. has been steadily rising in the past years, albeit with a temporary setback in 2022 caused by pandemic-related delays, enforcement of trade laws, disruptions in the supply chain, and increasing costs. (The country installed 21.1 GWdc of PV capacity in 2022, as compared to 23.1 GWdc in 2021.)

The U.S. now is on track to make an historic addition to its PV capacity in 2023. According to EUPD Research’s 2023 forecast, the U.S. is poised to achieve its largest-ever expansion in PV capacity, with an estimated 32 to 35 GWdc, if all the planned utility-scale capacity gets installed. Moreover, in the period from 2023 to 2028, the U.S. is estimated to add approximately 233 GWdc of PV capacity.
To learn more about how EUPD collects historical installed PV and storage data and make projections for future installed capacity, see EUPD Research’s Global Energy Transition (GET) Matrix.
In terms of cumulative installed PV capacity (utility-scale + C&I + residential) on a state-by-state basis, California holds the top position followed by Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona. Notably, Texas is rapidly expanding its utility-scale PV capacity, and it is poised to potentially surpass California within the next two years.
Rapid expansion of battery storage
Battery energy storage has emerged as the dominant and rapidly expanding source of energy storage in the U.S. in recent years. The proportion of battery storage in the country’s energy storage capacity has surged dramatically, climbing from a mere 3% in 2017 to a substantial 36% in the first half of 2023.

In the U.S., battery storage capacity additions have been dominated by utility-scale installations. The rise of intermittent energy sources like solar and wind has made utility-scale batteries increasingly important. According to the DOE, the majority of planned utility-scale battery storage capacity is being installed alongside solar and wind facilities in the U.S.
At the end of 2022, around 9 GW/23.24 GWh of utility-scale battery storage capacity was installed in the U.S., as per EUPD Research estimates. Our projections show that in the year 2023, the U.S. is estimated to install a substantial 9.6 GW/26.4 GWh of utility-scale battery storage capacity, surpassing the cumulative installed capacity up to 2022.
In terms of total installed battery storage capacity (utility-scale + small-scale), California at present holds the top position followed by Texas, Florida, Hawaii and Arizona.
Unveiling the top installers
Crucial to the flourishing solar and storage industry in the U.S. are the downstream players, specifically installers. These entities play a pivotal role in driving sector expansion and shaping its trajectory. To ensure continued growth and success, understanding the landscape of the top installers in the country is imperative.
Against this context, EUPD Research in its recently published report “Market Leadership Study: The United States 2023” came out with a ranking of the top installers in the U.S. distributed generation market. We also conducted a comprehensive evaluation of top installers, creating a data-driven snapshot of their competitive positioning. The installers were ranked using a rigorous methodology that considers various critical factors, such as installed capacity, sector coupling, vertical integration, financing options, and more. Each of these factors was assigned a specific weighting to determine the final rankings.
EUPD Research is pleased to reveal the names of the top 10 distributed installers in the U.S., according to our report. Topping the list are industry giants Sunrun, Sunpower, and Tesla Energy, in positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The remaining companies in the top 10 are: Sunnova, ADT Solar, Palmetto Solar, Freedom Forever, Trinity Solar, Titan Solar Power, and Momentum Solar.
In conclusion, the U.S. stands at the cusp of an energy revolution, propelled by ambitious targets and landmark legislation. The solar PV and energy storage sectors are witnessing unprecedented growth, guided by substantial investments and a surge in installations. With industry leaders driving innovation and sustainability, the nation is poised to achieve its clean energy goals, reaffirming its commitment to a greener future.
