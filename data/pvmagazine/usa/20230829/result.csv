UK car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover says it is partnering with Wykes Engineering to build large-scale stationary energy systems based on second-life lithium-ion batteries from its I-PACE electric vehicles.
The system will store renewable energy coming from unspecified wind and solar plants, the company said, noting that it will have a storage capacity of 2.5 MWh.
“The batteries supplied have been taken from prototype and engineering test vehicles, and JLR aims to supply enough batteries to store a total of 7.5 MWh of energy – enough to power 750 homes for a day – by the end of 2023,” the company said.  “After this point, more containers can be created to house additional second-life batteries removed from used production vehicles in the future.”
The I-PACE battery, developed in collaboration with Switzerland-based Pramac, has a storage capacity of 90.2 kWh. Weighing 610 kg and measuring 2,280 mm x 1474 mm x 300 mm, the battery has retained 70% to 80% of its original capacity, according to Jaguar Land Rover. The company emphasized that no extra manufacturing processes or battery module removal is necessary.
The company said that that every battery is linked to an inverter to optimize energy production.
“Its advanced engineering makes the I-PACE battery perfect for second-life, and even third-life, applications in low-energy situations once battery health falls below the stringent requirements of an electric vehicle,” Jaguar Land Rover stated. “Once the battery does finally come to the end of its usable life, it is 95% recyclable.”

The HelioWing is available in two base models, HelioWing 5 with 7.38 kWp and the HelioWing 7 with 9.84 kWp. The canopy design can be customized with features like storage capacity or a carport with a built-in EV charger. The modular energy systems come preassembled and preconfigured.
World4Solar noted that when set up by a certified installer on a prepared foundation, the canopy should take about six hours to install.
“We are excited about the trend for self-sustaining and energy efficient power for multi-unit residential and commercial installations,” says Marc Hofer, CEO of World4Solar. “Our contemporary décor design fits in with all environments, and its weatherproof solar covered roof provides lighting, shade and rain protection where needed.”

The HelioWing can be used grid-tied or off-grid. When connected to the power grid, in certain utility markets the system owner may be able to earn credits for the clean energy generated and exported. To operate off-grid, or to store electricity for later use, battery packs are available that can store energy up to 25 kWh or up to 100 kWh with an external battery module.
Two available Level 2 chargers per unit work with all electric vehicles and add 25 miles average of range per hour of charging.
HelioWing is waterproof rated and has an average 20-year life span. The system comes with a 10-year warranty.
World4Solar will be exhibiting at RE+ 2023 Expo, September 11 to 14, 2023 in Las Vegas in the Kern Solar Structures booth #4161.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/29/google-to-sell-rooftop-solar-mapping-data/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 29, 2023",Google to sell rooftop solar mapping data,"Google announced it will sell application programming interfaces (API) datasets for the solar industry, empowering business operations with large, interactable data for understanding rooftop solar potential.
The Solar API contains key building, rooftop, shading, and panel configuration data covering over 320 million buildings in 40 countries, with the goal of helping accelerate the transition to clean, renewable, solar energy. The company said it expects to drive up to $100 million in revenues from sales of its API in the first year alone.
“By using the Solar API, solar businesses can improve the customer experience for interested property owners, create reliable project proposals without requiring an on-site visit, and expedite the overall installation process,” said Google.
Google is known in the solar industry for its Project Sunroof, a free application that helps homeowners understand their estimated bill savings potential for installing rooftop solar. The new Solar API builds on years of collaboration with industry leaders to develop datasets that fit their business needs.
The Solar API includes 3D dataset access for individual building data as well as for aggregated data for all buildings in a particular city or county.
Included in the Solar API is a Buildings Insights endpoint, which provides details of a building’s location, dimensions, and solar potential. It contains information like the size and slope of the roof and the modeled energy production of a rooftop array.
The API also contains a Data Layers endpoint, which produces granular details on raw solar information for the area surrounding a building. Data layers include shading and obstructions and the roof layout to assist detailed system placement and layout. The data can be used to create custom solar proposals and by software-as-a-service developers to automate the design of more efficient arrays.
A pilot project user and Solar API customer Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) used the API to create Suncle, an online rooftop solar energy simulation.
“By inputting an address, homeowners can locate their residence on the map, and adjust their electricity bill and solar installation size as they wish. They can find out installation costs, local subsidies available, cost savings, break even point, and how much impact their solar installation could have on reducing CO2, all in a few seconds. To get these figures without Suncle, they would need to have installers visit their house,” says Masami Jenkins, director, environment & social business design lab, TEPCO.
More information can be found on Google’s Solar API webpage and the related documentation page. A demo of the product can be found here.

In Utah, Mountain Regional Water, a water treatment plant, has taken advantage of this flexibility of design, tapping Ameresco to design and install a 589.7 kWDC floating solar array on its Signal Hill facility.
The project is expected to offset 92% of the energy consumed from the grid and reduce the district’s energy costs by 80%. The new floating solar array system is designed to produce 887,712 kilowatt-hours of solar energy annually.
“Traditional ground or rooftop solar wasn’t an option for us at this facility, but this innovative floating solar installation makes use of an untapped resource,” said Chris Braun, Mountain Regional chief technology officer. “This is one more piece of the puzzle for us get to a ‘Net-Zero’ energy goal as we strive to be responsible stewards for the community and the environment.”
The array will be owned by the district and will float upon the treatment plant’s holding pond to provide electricity to power the plant. Once operational, the floating solar array system is designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 384 metric tons annually, which is equivalent to saving 43,211 gallons of gasoline per year or preventing the burning of 430,160 pounds of coal.
Construction is planned for June 2024, with the project reaching commercial operations in September 2024.
Mountain Regional Water’s district received a $400,000 grant from utility Rocky Mountain Power’s Blue Sky program to support the project. Blue Sky is an opt-in program that gives Rocky Mountain Power customers the option to match all or part of their energy use with renewable energy, reducing their carbon footprints and driving demand for new renewable energy in the West. Since 2006, Blue Sky’s 56,000 participants have helped fund over 200 new, community-based renewable energy projects in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming.
“We are thrilled to demonstrate how providing the right mix of solutions can help our customers meet their decarbonization and energy savings goals in an economically viable manner,” said Bob Georgeoff, executive vice president, Ameresco.
Floating PV is expected to establish a sizeable new global market by 2026, said Global Industry Analysts (GIA), which has projected a 4.8 GW deployment by that year. Generally, 1 MW of FPV plant covers water bodies of about 17 acres to 25 acres and can generate electricity of 1500 MWh, said GIA.
(Read: “Floating PV plant operators may achieve additional revenue through non-evaporated water”)
The market is currently sized at about 1.6 GW globally, and GIA predicts it will move at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.7% by 2026, reaching 4.8 GW. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the largest market share at around 60%, with China the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 59.4%. Floating PV’s cost is much higher than that of stationary solar panels, the key hinderance in its growth, said GIA.
GIA said the U.S. has over 24,000 human-made water bodies that are anticipated to be suitable for floating PV development.

“We’re bringing to the U.S. market ultralight modules that go where traditional solar panels can’t go,” said Mick McDaniel, VP and U.S general manager, Bila. “In Indianapolis, we found a central urban location, a diverse workforce and an entrepreneurial spirit – ideal for our out-of-the-box approach to making clean energy attainable for all.”
The technology behind the modules was developed in collaboration with the advanced materials industry. McDaniel told pv magazine USA that replacing glass with specially formulated composites was inspired by the windows in airplanes, which are not made from glass, and are lightweight, transparent, strong, flexible, durable and UV resistant. “These same characteristics are excellent for solar panels, so why haven’t we used them yet?  The aerospace industry has figured out how and so our task was how to apply that to the PV industry in a cost effective way that met the needs of solar customers.” said McDaniel.
Bila plans to produce 520 W 144 half-cell monocrystalline modules, with an efficiency of 19.3%. The modules measure 88.4 inches by 47.1 inches by 0.08 inches. Made of an aerospace polymer composite, the module reportedly weighs 17 pounds, which Bila says is nearly 70% lighter than conventional glass-framed modules.

The light weight and thinness of the modules enable them to be deployed in various applications, including low load-bearing commercial and industrial roofs, waterproof membrane roofs, integration into vehicles for solar power, off-grid use and even on curved surfaces, the company reports.
McDaniel said the Bila Solar modules pass the same durability tests as conventional glass panels, including IEC 61215:2016, IEC61730:2016, UL61730 (USA), PID, and salt mist level 8 tests. He added that the modules have also undergone wind tunnel testing, damp heat, adhesion pull tests, flexibility stress tests and more. The modules come with a 12-year  product warranty and a 25-year linear power warranty.
Bila is far from alone in setting up solar manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Earlier this month the Solar Energy Industries Association reported that an additional 85 GW of module manufacturing was coming to the U.S., following passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes onshoring manufacturing across the solar supply chain. Site Selection Group assisted Bila Solar with procuring state and local incentives for this exciting project.
“Indiana’s entrepreneurial ecosystem is strong, and we’re excited to welcome Bila Solar to our growing network of innovators advancing products that power the world,” said Governor Eric J. Holcomb. “With Bila’s new Indianapolis manufacturing operation, Indiana’s skilled workforce will be making solar energy more accessible and powering our growing clean energy sector to new heights.”
With its factory planned for Indianapolis, Bila has also designated the city as the location for its U.S. headquarters.
