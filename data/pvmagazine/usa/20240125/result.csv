The company said it will remain focused on cash flow generation from its core security business and will increase its dividend payments by 57% and add a new share repurchase program as part of the move to exit solar.
“The decision to exit solar operations was made after careful deliberation, and we expect this strategic action to drive substantial operational and financial benefits to ADT,” said ADT chairman, president and chief executive officer, Jim DeVries.
ADT’s Board of Directors has approved the exit of this segment, which may include the sale of components of the business to other parties.
Through the first nine months of 2023, the company’s solar business cited macroeconomic headwinds and deteriorating conditions industry wide, posting an adjusted EBITDA loss of $89 million.
The company expects to incur certain one-time exit charges and cash expenditures with potential offsets from asset sales or reduced tax expenses. As previously disclosed, as of September 30, 2023, the goodwill balance for the solar reporting unit was zero.
ADT entered the solar business in 2021 by acquiring installer Sunpro. The company spent $160 million in cash and 77 million shares of ADT to purchase the company, suggesting an enterprise value of $825 million. It announced the closure of several installation branches in November 2023, and now the company is exiting residential solar altogether.
ADT exits a battered residential solar industry that is reeling from policy changes and high interest rates.
Solar Insure, which backs many installation companies in California, which represents nearly half of the U.S. rooftop solar market, told pv magazine USA in December 2023 that its data shows 75% of solar installers are now in the “high risk” category following CPUC’s decision to implement NEM 3.0.
“We have seen a wave of recent solar installer bankruptcies and believe another wave will come in Q1 2024,” said Ara Agopian, chief executive officer, Solar Insure.

This represents a 59% year-over-year increase. In 2023, 86 deals led to $9.2 billion, up from 2022 totals of 96 deals and $5.8 billion raised.
“Energy storage companies saw their highest VC funding in 2023, largely thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act’s Investment Tax Credit and other incentives like manufacturing credits for battery components,” said Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer, Mercom Capital.
Despite the positive trend, Mercom said merger and acquisition activity lagged due to high asset valuations, elevated interest rates, and investor caution.
Corporate funding in the energy storage sector, including venture capital and private equity funding, decreased 28% year-over-year, with $19 billion raised as opposed to $26.4 billion in 2022. LG Energy Solution’s $10.7 billion initial public offering in 2022 significantly inflated the 2022 total.
Quarter-over-quarter, corporate funding in energy storage decreased 55% from Q3 2023 to Q4 2023. In a year-over-year comparison, funding was down in Q4 by 14%.
Lithium-ion based battery technology companies remained the top VC-funded business in the energy storage sector. Other top businesses included battery recycling, nickel-based battery technology, energy storage downstream, and materials and components companies.
The top five VC funding deals in 2023 were: Zenobe, which raised $1.1 billion; Redwood Materials, which raised $1 billion; SK On, which brought in $944 million; Verkor, which raised $905 million; and Hithium, which raised $622 million.
Announced debt and public market financing for energy storage companies in 2023 decreased 52% year-over-year, totaling $9.8 billion.
Meanwhile, corporate funding for smart grid companies was 30% lower year-over-year, with $3.3 billion in deals in 2023, compared with $4.7 billion in 2022. The top five smart grid venture capital deals were Driveco with $273 million, Jolt Energy with $162 million, SPAN with $96 million, Virta with $93 million, and EO Charging with $80 million.

Their idea is to build a self-healing grid through various algorithms coded into grid relays. These detectors would quickly restore power for critical infrastructure, including hospitals, grocery stores, assisted living facilities, and water treatment plants, before operators can implement repairs or provide direction on moving forward. 
Researchers at Sandia imagine these grid relays embedded in microgrids of renewable energy supplies and their local energy storage systems. The Sandia project is focused on ensuring these small islands of power around critical infrastructure can automatically heal themselves and connect to share electricity, powering as many users as possible. 
Sandia researchers plan to build this resilience by ensuring microgrids can automate functions like balancing energy production with consumption and reconfiguring if part of the system is impaired. The algorithm must also prevent microgrids from forming an unintentional loop in the circuit. All while leveraging device-specific local measurements to avoid the costs of having to depend on power inverters that currently offer the high-speed communications necessary.

When it comes to automating energy production and consumption regulation, the Sandia-led team developed an algorithm based on the process inverters designed to power microgrids use when overloaded. However, instead of stopping to regulate the voltage of the power supply during surcharge, the new system uses the decrease in voltage to signal relays to disconnect power to less vital customers like those in individual homes. 
Regarding reconfiguration, the automated process is based on computer-aided design software. The proposed algorithms of three small interconnected microgrids were able to isolate issues, including tree-downed lines or a damaged power plant, and then restore electricity to essential infrastructure. 
Researchers state that the current grid is not designed to be stable when operated in a loop, as much of North America’s original infrastructure is compatible with single power lines with a one-way power flow to customers. As the development of microgrids and rooftop solar increases, so does the opportunity for the grid to assemble into an unstable loop. For now, researchers are exploring how local measurements can clarify which sides of a line are already connected, thus forming a loop if the switch were closed.  
Researchers have developed a morse-code-like method to troubleshoot unintentional loops. It allows an overloaded line relay to modulate voltage by opening and closing in a particular pattern. The tool also provides relays for lower-priority customers to detect the pattern and disconnect themselves from the line until it isn’t overloaded. Researchers state the method doesn’t need a separate communication system, which adds a level of protection against cyberattacks as it uses the actual power line to transmit a signal. 
As researchers streamline each method’s performance, they hope to collaborate with line and load relay manufacturers to test how the algorithms fare when integrated into their products. Preliminary demos would occur in a hardware-in-the-loop testbed, then at test facilities like Sandia’s Distributed Energy Technologies Laboratory.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/25/radiative-cooling-tech-for-vertical-solar-panels/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"JANUARY 25, 2024",Radiative cooling tech for vertical solar panels,"From pv magazine global
An international research team has developed a novel radiative cooling method for vertical solar panels that uses V-shaped mirrors tailored for the thermal management on both sides of the PV panels.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
“Radiative cooling facilitates the dissipation of heat from a terrestrial body to outer space and the ambient environment through thermal radiation,” the academics explained. “This cooling strategy is particularly suitable for hot PV panels as they can fully utilize the atmospheric transparency window within the 8–13 mm range, and even beyond, due to their operating temperatures being significantly higher than the ambient temperature.”
The novel cooling approach is dubbed v-PV and employs two 45-degree inclined mirrors on the two sides of a PV module. In the front size, an aluminum mirror was used, letting incident sunlight reflect on the module, while the thermal radiation from the front side can be directed to the sky. On the back side of the panel, a spectral selective reflector was installed, enabling the thermal radiation to be directed to the sky while preventing the back of a module from heating up by the scattered sunlight.
To test the proposed method, the scientists conducted three experiments – one in laboratory conditions, another in Buffalo, New York and a third in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.
In the lab experiment, they used the v-PV with an 18 V polycrystalline module under one sun illumination and in a 1,000 Ω resistor to simulate a realistic operational scenario.
“Double-sided radiative cooling can significantly reduce the operating temperature of a PV module by as much as 51.08 F (10.6 C), leading to an increase in the output voltage by 0.80 V,” they found.
Then, they conducted a field test in New York using the same system configuration. They compared the performance of a cooled module with that of a panel without the spectral selective mirror on the rear side (sv-PV) and that of a horizontal reference panel with no mirrors (h-PV).
“At 12:40, when solar irradiance peaked, v-PV recorded a temperature of 59.6 C, which was still 9 C lower than the h-PV system (68.6 C) and 4.7 C lower than the sv-PV module (64.3 C),” they explained. “These different operating temperatures affected the output. The v-PV achieved a Voc of 18.49 V, surpassing h-PV by 0.59 V (17.9 V) and sv-PV system by 0.20 V (18.29 V).”
The group emphasized that due to its vertical orientation and V-shaped beaming mirror, v-PV receives higher solar irradiance than h-PV at latitudes above 46 degrees. “The v-PV design can achieve significantly higher output in high latitude regions such as Europe and Canada,” they said.
In the Saudi testing field, the researchers tested a modified version of the system. They adjusted the installation angles of the solar panels to 22 degrees and the selective reflectors on the rear side to 0 degrees. The front mirror stayed unchanged at 45 degrees.
The test showed that the surface temperature of the v-PV was 54.5 C, compared to 54.7 C of the h-PV and 55.7 C of the sv-PV. That also translated to improved power, as the different setups reached maximum power of 5.77 W, 4.94 W, and 5.67 W, respectively. Conversion efficiency was 10.53% for v-PV, 10.31% for h-PV, and 10.41% for the s-PV.
“When solar irradiance collection efficiency of the solar panel was enhanced by 15% compared to an aligned, horizontal PV module, the proposed v-PV system maintained a slightly lowered operating temperature of 0.2 C, corresponding to an increase in the maximum power output by 16.8%,” the scientists asserted.
The novel cooling tech was presented in the study “Radiative cooling for vertical solar panels,” published in iScience by academics from Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), as well as the State University of New York at Buffalo and the University of Texas at Dallas in the United States.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/25/agriculturally-integrated-solar-takes-flight/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 25, 2024",Agriculturally integrated solar takes flight,"It’s becoming increasingly evident that the integration of local grasses and flowers into solar power facilities, whether within the rows of modules or in the spaces between extensive solar panels arrays, enhances the value of neighboring agricultural operations. This growing body of knowledge empowers civil engineers and land management professionals to design solar facilities that not only coexist with but also complement the landscapes – often farmlands – they are situated in.
Consider this: By replacing corn-based energy with solar agrivoltaic systems, the U.S. could meet its entire electricity demand, as solar panels generate about 200 times more energy per acre than corn.
As we dive into this subject, it’s worth noting that solar panels can cultivate microclimates, boosting the grasses consumed by cows and sheep by up to 90%. Adding to this, a recent study of solar facilities managed by Enel revealed a tripling of insect life over five years, with bee populations soaring twentyfold. These solar adjacent insect populations have also been observed significantly contributing to pollination in nearby soybean farms.

The study documented 509 observations of pollinators and beneficial insects across 52 unique observation periods between 2019 and 2022, aligned with the soybean bloom period. Among these, 23 were bees, including 14 native bees and 9 honeybees. Dominating the insect population in soybean fields, syrphid flies accounted for 70% of observed insects, providing natural pest control through their larvae, which voraciously consume soft-bodied pests like aphids, and the adults contribute as excellent pollinators.
In Minnesota, solar power facilities were purposefully designed to support insect populations, ultimately benefiting adjacent agricultural crops, such as soybeans; the nation’s second-largest crop.
In California’s almond orchards, sprawling over 1.3 million acres, retrofitting solar farms with pollinator habitats could yield up to $264 million in annual benefits to farmers. This technique can offset significant costs, like the hefty $400 per acre fee farmers incur for bee pollination services during the bloom season.
Still, the benefits extend beyond financial gains. An analysis of thirty-two solar facilities in Slovakia found a statistically significant increase in the richness, abundance, and diversity of various bird species. The study suggests that solar facilities might offer unique wintertime habitats for birds, thanks to the shelter provided by solar panels.

As the integration of solar power facilities into rural and agricultural landscapes progresses, the potential for these installations to become integral, beneficial components of the landscape becomes increasingly apparent.

In Woodland, California, Bayer enlisted Enel North America as developer of the 2.7 MW solar and 1 MW / 2 MWh energy storage system at its vegetable research and development site. Enel is the owner and operator and 100% offtaker, having signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Bayer.
The Woodland solar installation occupies approximately 10 of the 210 acres of the company’s property. The ground-mount system is expected to provide 70% of the site’s electrical energy demand, and avoid approximately 44,732 metric tons of carbon dioxide over the project’s lifetime. In addition, the battery bank will store excess energy for use when the system is not generating power, such as nighttime or in the event of a power outage.
Bayer also plans to have eight electric vehicle chargers installed for employee use later this year. And between the rows of solar panels, flowering cover crops, such as wildflowers, will be planted for pollinator habitat, soil remediation and aesthetic purposes.
“With this new installation, the Woodland site is the most onsite solar-powered operation within Bayer globally,” says Enrique Wehlen, head of sustainability, safety, health & environments (SSHE) North America at Bayer.
The second recently completed project is at Bayer’s main U.S. offices in Whippany, New Jersey. For this project Bayer partnered with DSD Renewables to complete a 1.7 MW ground mount solar installation that is expected to offset approximately 25% of the Whippany site’s total annual usage. The tracker-based installation is comprised of 3,600 modules.
The installation was designed to preserve the surrounding landscape, which involved shifting a fence line, limiting tree removal, adding river rock to match the site’s aesthetic, and coordinating closely with the team at Bayer to ensure its on-site bee colony at Whippany, which is used for tree pollination, was not disrupted.
“This installation is the perfect example of our approach to solar development, engineering, construction, and financing,” says Dan O’Brien, vice president of Commercial Origination at DSD.
Both projects align with Bayer’s sustainability commitments to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 and to achieve net-zero waste across its entire value chain by 2050. A key strategy is to purchase 100% sustainable renewable electricity by 2030. Bayer is embracing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
“These solar installations are a strong signal to our employees, customers and communities where we live and operate of our commitment to GHG emission reduction,” says Delf Bintakies, global head of sustainability, safety, health & environments (SSHE) at Bayer. “Bayer sets specific criteria for its own procurement of green energy. This includes the proximity of energy production facilities to Bayer sites, the use of new sources of generation and a focus on wind and solar power.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/25/plug-power-launches-largest-u-s-liquid-green-hydrogen-plant-in-georgia/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,GEORGIA",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"JANUARY 25, 2024",Plug Power launches largest U.S. liquid green hydrogen plant in Georgia,"Hydrogen company Plug Power launched operations at the largest liquid green hydrogen plant in the U.S., located in Woodbine, Georgia.
The facility has the capacity to produce 15 tons of green hydrogen per day; enough, the company says, to power some 15,000 forklifts daily. It includes eight, 5 MW electrolyzers; the largest such electrolyzer deployment in the U.S., which produce hydrogen. This hydrogen gas is then condensed into a liquid, by dropping its temperature to -423F, at which point it can be routed to hydrogen fueling stations. The facility is located a mile away from highway I-95 and 20 miles away from I-10, giving it easy access to commercial and industrial centers across the country, the company said. 
The hydrogen produced by the new facility will add to the liquid hydrogen deliveries that Plug Power currently makes to its customers for fuel cell electric vehicle fleets, stationary power applications, and other such uses. Liquid and gaseous hydrogen are both expected to positively impact the company’s bottom line, Plug Power said. 
The move comes as interest in green hydrogen grows as a tool to decarbonize specific industries, including heavy-duty transportation, heavy manufacturing and aviation.  
“The hydrogen market in the U.S. is at an inflection point. We expect hydrogen infrastructure and product offerings to vastly expand in the next five years, including increasing commercial uses in hard-to-abate sectors like concrete, steel, glass manufacturing, and more,” Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power, told pv magazine USA. 
The company is committed to driving that continued market expansion with the buildout of its North American hydrogen production plant network, strong partners, and expanded electrolyzer production, Marsh added. 
The role of the hydrogen sector in the clean energy transition has been backed by recent legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act – and specifically, the clean hydrogen production tax credit (PTC), which Marsh said has the potential to catalyze the domestic hydrogen sector, and drive down costs, allowing the industry to scale in a meaningful way. At the same time, “there are still a lot of outstanding questions on the implementation of the PTC based on the draft guidance the U.S. Treasury Department released at the end of 2023,” he added. 
Now that the Georgia facility is online, the company is looking at building out a green hydrogen network of production plants across the U.S. and has made substantial progress on other U.S.-based plants, including plants in Louisiana, New York, and Texas, Marsh said. 
“All these plants in development will benefit from our experience building the plant in Georgia,” he said. 
At the same time, Marsh noted, government policy support is essential for the hydrogen industry to scale and achieve cost parity with other energy sources. 
“Policymaker guidance on incentives aimed at fostering the clean hydrogen industry must be clear and pragmatic in achieving these aims,” he said.
