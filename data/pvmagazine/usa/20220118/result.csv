According to LevelTen’s Q4 2021 PPA Price Index, a quarterly analysis of actual PPA price offers on LevelTen’s Energy Marketplace, the prices for wind and solar combined rose by 5.9% from Q3 to Q4 2021, up to $36.30/MWh, and 15.7% year-over-year. For solar specifically, PPA offers increased 5.7% to $34.25/MWh
These numbers are representative of the P25 Index for PPA price offers, with that index representing the  most competitive 25th percentile offer prices.
This trend, which has existed steadily since the beginning of 2020, is expected to continue well into 2022, with LevelTen estimating that inflation will continue to drive commodities prices higher, which may increase the cost of project development, ultimately driving up PPA prices as companies look to recover costs.
Despite these inhibitors, PPAs are still getting done and customers are still procuring renewable energy projects, as corporate policy and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns are both driving demand.
That being said, LevelTen also saw PPA offer volume decrease in all independent system operator regions (ISOs) except for ERCOT, where the number of offers increased by more than 20% quarter over quarter, and where PPA prices remain among the most competitive in all of North America.
As for the why, that’s a little more unclear.
“ERCOT solar’s growth in offer volume during Q4 is anomalous in the context of decreases in all other markets,” said VP of Developer Solutions at LevelTen, Rob Collier. “It’s possible that after a year of battling significant regulatory uncertainty after a tense, anti-renewables political response to last February’s Winter Storm Uri, developers in the region are feeling more comfortable putting forth new offers and/or re-marketing offers they had previously withdrawn.”
Looking across all ISO’s, the average P25 solar price in NYISO for Q4 was $75.7/MWh, by far the highest in the nation, followed by PJM at $43.1/MWh, SPP at $36.7/MWh, MISO at $36.1/MWh, and ERCOT and CAISO tied for the lowest price at $28.3/MWh.
Looking forward
As the industry enters a new and unpredictable year, Senior Director of Developer Services at LevelTen Energy, Gia Clark, offered five predictions for how the renewable energy landscape will continue to evolve in 2022.
1. Global and regional Headwinds will continue narrowing the renewable project pipeline, reducing available supply.
Potentially the least bold of Clark’s predictions, the same struggles that the industry has faced since early-2020 are still present, and are still contributing to lower overall project supply. Supply chain disruptions, spiking commodities costs, land use permitting uncertainties, and overwhelmed interconnection queues are pushing back projects’ commercial operation dates and are making project financial models much harder to predict. Until these avenues clear up, the PPA market is expected to continue operating in a considerable supply shortage.
2. 2022 will be a seller’s market for renewable PPAs
Considering the first prediction, this is a pretty natural assumption that, when supply is tight and demand is high, those who can sell will be able to do so at a premium, even as commodity prices increase. According to Clark, the current environment favors experienced buyers and load-serving entities, which, she explains, can offer sellers the decisiveness and credit-worthiness needed to quickly secure deals. Clark also outlines that buyers will need to be flexible in order to achieve success.
3. Novel solutions will emerge
With no clear-cut end to the supply shortage, developers and buyers will both look to test the status quo, in order to make deals happen, with Clark predicting innovation in PPA contracting structure, insurance, and credit solutions. This will be expedited as new entrants from a broad variety of sectors look to procure renewable supply contracts. She outlines that this could look like new PPA contract structures that mitigate risk, financial institutions acting as credit intermediaries, or technology companies delivering new analytics and software.
4. More retail electricity providers will create or expand green power programs
With their procurement expertise, often extensive renewable project pipelines, and sound credit, Clark has identified electricity retailers as an ideal intermediary party that can readily enter into PPAs and then pass on the renewable energy certificates from those PPAs to multiple offtakers through green retail power agreements. she supplements this prediction by looking to Constellation’s “CORe” program, which has already allowed buyers to help bring new renewable energy projects online by entering into PPAs through Constellation. Similar offerings will likely emerge from other retailers during 2022.
5. More buyers will take a holistic approach to project selection
ESG considerations are driving buyers to consider projects that do more than deliver clean energy, including hiring diverse local workforces and providing community benefits, and siting practices that minimize damages to nearby ecosystems and wildlife. Clark also expects offtakers to procure with an eye for building a PPA portfolio that can power their operations 24/7, and predicts that these buyers will likely be willing to pay more for the right offers that advance their ESG commitments or round-the-clock clean energy goals.

Standard Solar, Inc., a specialist in the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of commercial and community solar assets, acquired the 2.9 MW Klees Mill community solar project from developer partners Ogos Energy LLC and Earth and Air Technologies.
Maryland is currently receiving just under 4.5% of its electrical generation from solar and ranks 17th nationally. In May 2019, Maryland increased its renewable portfolio standard to requiring that 50% of the State’s energy come from renewable sources by 2030, with a minimum of 14.5% from solar power. Furthermore, it set a goal of 100% renewable energy by 2040 (Chapter 757, Acts of 2019).
The Klees Mill Community Solar project is a 2.9 MW ground-mount solar array in Sykesville, Maryland, featuring 7,344 solar modules. It is expected to produce 4,458,000 kilowatt-hours of solar energy annually, which is equivalent to offsetting the greenhouse gas emissions from 687 passenger vehicles driven for one year and the CO2 emissions of 355,000 gallons of gasoline consumed annually. In addition to providing subscribers with cost savings, the solar farm will provide electricity to power about 400 homes annually.
Earlier this month, Standard Solar acquired a 28.5 MW commercial solar project in Idaho. In December, the firm announced the acquisition of three community solar projects with a combined 10 MW capacity in Oregon. And earlier that month, Standard completed a 3.3 MW solar project for school systems in Virginia. The project leveraged the Virginia Clean Economy Act, and is planned to provide over 50% of electricity needs to the school system.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/18/cs-energy-deploys-over-150-mw-of-solar-trackers-in-northeast-us/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CONNECTICUT,MARYLAND,NEW YORK,PENNSYLVANIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 18, 2022",CS Energy deploys over 150 MW of solar trackers in Northeast US,"New Jersey-headquartered CS Energy announced a growth milestone of 150 MW of solar tracker projects across several projects in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Connecticut. The six most recent projects averaged 25 MW in size.
Roughly 70% of new utility-scale solar projects in the US come with trackers, but large-scale projects with single-axis trackers are relatively less common in the northeastern US. Site complexity and cold weather conditions pose development challenges, said CS Energy.
The company said its in-house engineering and construction teams have expertise in overcoming obstacles like the handling of large snow loads, onsite grading and grounding challenges, and the associated approval processes required for tracker projects in the region. The experience held by the team led to reduced challenges in project tolerances and has streamlined installation times. This helps reduce costs and de-risk projects in the long term, said CS Energy.
Four of the six projects are in New York, a state with goals of 70% renewables by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. One project will be participating in Maryland’s Community Solar Pilot Program, which aims to bring more affordable energy rates to local communities.
CS Energy has designed and installed over 1.5 GW of solar projects across the US, and is owned by American Securities, a private equity firm. The company has a 4 GW pipeline of large-scale solar tracker projects and anticipates further tracker project growth in the Northeast. “We’re looking forward to designing and building additional large-scale tracker projects in the region in the years to come in order to provide maximum environmental benefits and reduced electricity costs for local utilities, municipalities, and the communities they serve,” said Michael Garofalo, vice president of operations at CS Energy.
Last April, the firm partnered with Goldman Sachs and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to deliver eight solar projects totaling 216 MW. All projects had a planned commercial operation date of Q4 2021. Construction generated 500 jobs, and the $160 million in project investment was projected to bring more than $80 million in tax benefits. Contracts for the projects were awarded by NYSERDA as part of its Renewable Energy Standard Request for Proposals in 2017 and 2018.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/18/pulling-fertilizer-out-of-thin-air-with-solar-power/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 18, 2022",Pulling fertilizer out of thin air with solar power,"Nitricity is using solar electricity to extract nitrogen directly from our air to produce nitric acid, the most critical nutrient in fertilizer that plants use to grow everything we humans eat. The key features of the company’s product are the decarbonization, decentralization, and privatization of fertilizer manufacturing, made possible by affordable, off-grid, intermittent solar electricity.

The company installed its first commercial project in October of 2021. The off-grid solar power system is composed of 144 solar panels, though details describing the solar hardware were scant.
On their website, Nitricity shares an experimental report on their pilot project in Fresno, California. The initial installation’s solar system was a 16-panel ground-mount array that outputted 75-85 V with a maximum power of 2.4 kW.
The installation was coupled directly with a sub-surface irrigation system used to fertigate a tomato crop. The paper covers the apparent success of their hardware, which produced tomatoes in a volume and quality that were similar to the control tomatoes. (The control tomatoes received a standard, industrially produced nitrogen fertilizer.)
Nitricty believes that their product will fill several niches. Because the system is easily distributed, farmers located far from fertilizer manufacturing centers will have additional financial incentive to try out the new technology.
Nitricity’s process directly competes with industrial ammonia production – a process which directly creates more CO2 than any other human driven chemical process on earth. The primary feedstock for modern nitrogen fixation is natural gas. The processing of the gas into ammonia releases these emissions. The chemical process emissions are only part of the story, as the emissions released from the fossil fuels traditionally used to heat and sustain the reaction are also excessive.
In its favor, the Haber-Bosch process was largely responsible for the Green Revolution of the middle 1900s, which helped catapult the global population. It is estimated that nearly half of all nitrogen currently found in human tissue was produced using this process.
Additionally, Niticity’s distributed, localized nitrogen solution also avoids transportation emissions. The company points out that market inefficiencies related to the distribution process of fossil-sourced nitrogen fertilizers can increase a farmer’s fertilizer cost as much as two to five times above the costs at a factory. Fossil-based fertilizer production costs are also volatile due to their direct relationship with natural gas – which, as mentioned earlier, supplies the primary feedstock for industrial ammonia.

In December, the US Department of Energy’s ARPA Energy awarded the group $500,000 to advance their “non-thermal plasma reactor” process. ARPA notes that, “literature and modeling analysis suggest that an energy efficiency ten times better than present plasma values and equal to or better than that of the conventional Haber-Bosch process could be achieved”.
In an interview with Agrifood Conversations, the company noted that the intermittent nature of solar power is not only easily managed, but is actually a desired trait. According to one of Nitricity’s founders, Nicolas Pinkowski, the process “operates better intermittently. Because we manufacture nitrates (NO3-), there is a lot of oxygen to transport per lb of nitrogen”. Nitricity uses a 200 gallon tank to store the product prior to it being applied to the tomatoes.
In August of 2021, the company raised $5 million.  Recently, Nitricity announced that it signed a deal with a wheat producer by releasing some emissions-focused math:
Nitricity’s technology mitigates nearly 100% of these emissions.
It could be that these fertilization systems will integrate with solar powered greenhouses and other responsible land management techniques. In doing so, solar power will likely prove to be indispensable to our future food production.

FPV typically features solar panels mounted on a floating structure over a lake or reservoir, often with embedded trackers.
FPV removes the added costs of purchasing or leasing expensive land areas. It also frees up more land area for other uses. And, water bodies are often government-owned; a feature that makes permitting easier to obtain, said the report.
Generally, 1 MW of FPV plant covers water bodies of about 17 to 25 acres and can generate electricity of 1500 MWh, said GIA.

While FPV projects often don’t reach the same level power output of ground mounts, they serve land-restricted areas. The systems can offer environmental benefits like managing algal growth and reducing evaporation. Water offers system benefits like cooling the panels, which can reduce degradation and lower maintenance costs, said the report.
The market is currently about 1.6 GW globally, and GIA predicts it will move at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.7% by 2026, reaching 4.8 GW. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the largest market share at around 60%, with China the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 59.4%.  FPV’s cost is much higher that that of stationary solar panels, the key hinderance in its growth, said GIA.
GIA said the US has over 24,000 manmade water bodies that are anticipated to be useful in FPV development. Human-made water bodies are preferable for their ability to be managed, and most are located near existing infrastructure and roads.
