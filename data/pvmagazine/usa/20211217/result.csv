They have now achieved the industry’s highest standard of safety with UL 9540 and UL 9540A fire safety test results at the cell, battery module, and large unit level. Because of SimpliPhi Power’s UL 9540A large unit fire safety test results, these systems are permitted for use in New York City.
SimpliPhi Power recently announced that its full line of scalable UL 9540 Certified energy storage & management solutions – 15.2 kWh to 136 kWh with single, split and three-phase configurations – achieved UL 9540A fire-safety testing “performance criteria” for residential and commercial applications. The PHI batteries and the AccESS, BOSS.6 & BOSS.12 integrated systems can be used individually or in combination to achieve multiple, robust solutions across residential and commercial applications, both on & off grid, AC or DC coupled.
“As we continue to uphold SimpliPhi Power’s core values of protecting our planet and empowering people, it is critical that the energy storage solutions we provide to foster economic recovery and a sustainable future are 100% safe,” said Catherine Von Burg, CEO and President of SimpliPhi Power. “Although we attained UL 9540A PHI battery module fire-safety testing as of June 2021, we weren’t satisfied with only module level testing. We wanted to demonstrate that our larger, integrated solutions are both safe and reliable, which is important for customers, installers and project developers given that these test results are being used by fire departments and AHJs from a code, compliance, and permitting perspective.”
SimpliPhi Power’s performance during the UL 9540A testing, in which the Cell, Battery and Unit level equipment were forced into Thermal Runaway by heaters built into the batteries, demonstrated limited cell to cell propagation, decreasing temperatures, no ignition or fire and no explosive or deflagration events.  Thermal Runaway is an uncontrollable rise in temperature at the cell level, and is the most common failure mode of lithium-ion batteries, which can fires and explosions.
Von Burg reinforces, ” These test results are critical for deployments such as the energy storage project recently installed at the Brooklyn Public Library in Coney Island, NY, which would not have been possible without our large-scale UL 9540A unit level testing results.”

Construction of Prairie Wolf began in February of 2021. Now complete,the project will generate 200 MW of solar power. As announced in 2020, Prairie Wolf has a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Cargill, the privately held global food corporation.
First Solar’s next-generation Series 6 thin film solar modules are used in the project, which was constructed by SOLV Energy, formerly known as Swinerton Renewable Energy.
In addition to new onsite operations and maintenance jobs, the operation of Prairie Wolf will benefit local and statewide economies through the production of millions of dollars in new tax revenue and landowner income. At the peak of construction, Prairie Wolf employed approximately 300 onsite workers.
Announced earlier this year, Prairie Wolf will donate an estimated $720,000 to the Kansas, Illinois School District  via annual donations of approximately $36,000 over a twenty-year period.
“This development will benefit the county in many ways, including donations through grants to organizations and schools throughout the county,” commented Stan Metzger, Coles County Board Member.
Prairie Wolf is projected to offset carbon dioxide emissions by 285,000 metric tons annually during operations.

KSP has focused on energy transformation investments with strategic investments in companies that it believes are market disruptors. Recently, for example, KSP announced investments in the battery value chain and new sources of energy storage and infrastructure.
“KSP is excited to invest in GameChange Solar as they bring their advantaged solar energy solutions to market,” said Jeremy Bezdek, managing director of Koch Strategic Platforms.
GameChange Solar was founded in 2012 and has grown from being a regional provider of fixed tilt racking systems to a global provider of utility and commercial scale solar mounting solutions, trackers and software. The company was ranked as the 3rd largest solar tracker company domestically and the 6th largest vendor globally in 2020 by Wood Mackenzie.
GameChange’s Chief Financial Officer, Mark Gibbens, said, “We are excited to be able to launch this next phase of our growth with the validation of a major investor in the energy transformation space. Koch offers not just the capital to grow, but the opportunity to mutually leverage the capabilities of each organization.”
The $150 million preferred stock investment which, if converted, would represent a minority stake in GameChange Solar. The company plans to use net proceeds from the investment to continue to expand its market share in the U.S. and globally and to accelerate R&D including margin-enhancing balance of system solutions, a new 2P tracker technology, a new fixed tilt system, and advanced tracker software.

You could take a solar-charged electric bus,"Sage Energy Consulting announced that it is is helping the Anaheim Transportation Network (ATN) on a multi-stage plan to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, save on their electric costs and intelligently charge their new electric buses, including some charging locations with solar power and microgrid battery backup systems.
ATN bus routes include stops at Disneyland, meaning park attendees will be able to take a zero-emission ride to Splash Mountain. ATN has a stated goal of achieving 100% fleet electrification by 2025.
Sage has agreed to provide financial modeling and contract support for charge management services and solar and battery energy storage systems, and support ATN’s Self Generation Incentive Program rebate. The rebate is available to electric customers who install a microgrid system like ATN’s that will enable cost savings and battery electric bus charging capabilities during a power outage.
The Anaheim Transportation Network was awarded a Clean Transportation Grant from the California Energy Commission for the microgrid project, which will provide additional options for financing multiple projects.
In August, Sage was acquired by NV5 Global, in an effort to help expand in clean energy systems, electric vehicle fleets and infrastructure, and asset management.
Sage is also working with the Judicial Council of California (JCC) on an investment in solar power and energy storage. The JCC plans to install rooftop solar panels, solar carports, and batteries across 43 potential locations to enable its courthouses to generate enough solar power to cover a portion of their routine energy needs.
Sage was founded in 2009 and has managed over $2 billion in clean energy projects and power purchase agreements for clients in the public and private sectors.
Correction: The title was corrected to say Disneyland rather than Disney World.
