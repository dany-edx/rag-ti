The inverter warranty is solely for Enphase microinverters purchased from Panasonic, and the racking warranty applies to Unirac and IronRidge racking systems. 
EV battery factory 
Last month, Panasonic announced it plans a $4 billion U.S. electric vehicle battery factory in Kansas City. The Kansas Department of Commerce and the Kansas City Area Development Council and its partners shared that the company’s plans create a need for up to 4,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs. Panasonic has identified a site in De Soto, Kansas for the project, pending approval by Panasonic’s board of directors. 
“With the increased electrification of the automotive market, expanding battery production in the US is critical to help meet demand,” said Kazuo Tadanobu, president, CEO of Panasonic Energy. “Given our leading technology and depth of experience, we aim to continue driving growth of the lithium-ion battery industry and accelerating towards a net-zero emissions future.”  
More than 1 billion customers use Panasonic products every day, generating 86 million tons of CO2 emissions based on electricity consumption figures. This amounts to approximately 110 million tons of CO2 emissions across our entire value chain, a number that is equivalent to about 1% of total emissions from global electricity consumption. The company has entered an initiative to become net-zero in its business operations by 2030 and sets further goals for its sustainability by 2050.

A Dutch-Australian research team has developed a 1 cm3 luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) device, equipped with 20%-efficient bifacial silicon PV cells, which can be used and assembled in several mosaic configurations.
“These mosaic LSC PV devices could be applied to make solar energy ubiquitous in the urban setting where it requires making visually appealing devices that can function in the challenging lighting conditions found in cities,” researcher Mohammadreza Aghaei told pv magazine. “Thus, by developing such colorful, visually appealing mosaic LSC PV devices, one can accelerate the general acceptance of solar energy in the built environment, even with modest efficiency devices. The proposed LSC PV devices support colorful surfaces, transparency and provide for freedom, offering many design opportunities to enhance the overall functionality and experience of PV power generation within consumer products, the built environment and transportation.”
The LSCs are commonly used as photonic devices in the production of fine chemicals in photomicroreactors, in dynamic “smart” windows to control light entering spaces, and for distribution of color-tuned light to enhance plant growth in greenhouses. They can also be used to improve the efficiency of solar panels. The LSCs consist of luminescent materials that are also known as luminophores, which are groups of molecules that emit light when illuminated.
The materials, which can be coated on the surface of a polymer or glass plate, or used as a dopant of the polymer or glass plate acting as a light guide, can capture direct and indirect sunlight at one wavelength and re-emit it at a longer wavelength. If applied to PV, luminophores are able to capture high-energy photons that the photovoltaic panels cannot absorb and re-emit them as photons.
The scientists inserted the bifacial solar cells between individual LSC elements and created a pattern of cubical mosaic LSC elements. They said this design increases the available top surface area of solar cells per unit of aperture area and, as a result, the power conversion efficiency of the whole LSC PV device can be increased.
For the LSC devices, they used conventional materials such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) doped with commercial organic dyes and a Coumarin (Cou) compound. The researchers attached bifacial cells to the edges of the lightguides using an index-matching optical adhesive and monofacial c-Si PV cells to the backs of the lightguide cubes. They encapsulated the cells using polyolefin (PO) materials.
Under standard illumination conditions, the group found that the luminophores were able to absorb nearly all the high-energy photons and emitted photons with longer wavelengths more matched with the spectral response of the silicon solar cells. They also tested seveal mini-mosaics to determine the performance of arrays of LSCs.
“The greatest power conversion efficiency of 11.6% was obtained for the LSC PV device consisting of four cubical lightguides containing Cou with four edge- and four bottom-mounted bifacial and monofacial silicon solar cells, respectively,” they said. “The main source of the low fill factor values is related to the poor contacts between the tabs and the fingers of the PV cells, resulting in high series resistance.”
Aghaei said commercial production of the proposed devices could begin after their efficiency is further improved.
“In this phase, it is difficult to estimate production costs with great accuracy, however, a first guess would be that for these customizable LSC PV devices the production costs after commercialization will be $0.5 per watt or less,” he said.
The scientists presented the new technology in “Measured power conversion efficiencies of bifacial luminescent solar concentrator photovoltaic devices of the mosaic series,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The research group includes academics from the University of Melbourne and the University of New South Wales in Australia, as well as the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.
“In future studies, the coupling between the solar cells and the cubical lightguides could be further enhanced to improve electrical parameters as well the efficiency of the overall devices, and experimentation of thinner and/or larger mosaic elements and the effect of indirect light could both be explored,” they concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/23/global-study-finds-over-half-of-consumers-want-net-zero-homes/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 23, 2022",Global study finds over half of consumers want net-zero homes,"Schneider Electric, a sustainability-focused energy technology and cloud solutions provider, released results of a global survey, finding that nearly 86% consumers believe climate change will lead to rising energy bills should global temperatures rise above 1.5 °C.
The study also found that 72% of respondents consider reducing their carbon footprint as a personal priority. More than half of the respondents, or 55%, said they “place importance” on their homes becoming net-zero, but only 31% said they think this is a likely occurrence. Despite that pessimism, 55% of respondents believe it is the responsibility of individuals to tackle climate change.
With energy prices on the rise and the cost of living higher than ever, coupled with the growing number of devices and Electric Vehicles (EVs) on the road, home energy management is now one of the biggest areas of consideration for consumers, home builders, businesses and governments globally. While these numbers show many wanting to make changes but feeling pessimistic about the difference they can make – the future is truly in our hands as we make dwellings more sustainable with the help of modern home energy management (HEM) technologies. The biggest barrier to change right now is our mindset. We have created psychological roadblocks that result in us shirking the responsibility to take action. These findings show that as we adopt smart digital solutions to fight the invisible foe (energy management and consumption), replace fossil fuels with smart, clean electricity in our homes’ energy diets, we can see how we’re making a meaningful contribution to our global fight for the healthier planet. Moreover, we should be able to do good for the environment without compromising on our comfort. Jaap Ham, associate professor in the industrial engineering & innovation sciences at Eindhoven University of Technology
The study also revealed that consumers want to lead sustainable lifestyles, placing energy efficiency as a main priority. About 40% of respondents said smart home technology will help make their home more sustainable. Over half, or 54%, said they expect new homes or apartments to be equipped with such technology, a 13% boost over last year’s survey.
Smart thermostats and smart lighting devices ranked in the top three most purchased smart devices, said Schneider Electric. With rising costs of living, managing energy consumption and costs are the fundamental drivers pushing consumers to invest in smart energy management technologies.
Consumers in the current energy crisis need to feel they are in control over how energy is produced, stored and distributed in the home – in terms of sustainability and energy bills. The residential market is at a tipping point, and the good news is the technological solutions already exist, like Wiser, that help consumers lead more sustainable lifestyles and empower them to play a meaningful role in achieving our net zero goals. Our research shows there is a greater understanding amongst consumers about how they can improve their home energy management and that smart home technology can help them be more efficient. The next step is to implement this knowledge before it’s too late.” YiFu Qi, executive vice-president of global home and distribution at Schneider Electric

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/23/a-big-boost-to-wind-and-solar-is-coming-be-patient-says-rystad/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 23, 2022","A big boost to wind and solar is coming. Be patient, says Rystad","Data analyst Rystad Energy is projecting that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may increase the total deployments of wind and solar power by an additional 155 GW by 2030, over previous projections. In fact, Rystad’s most recent U.S. projections have been somewhat somber on solar, as they focused on polysilicon bans and investigations.
With the signing of the IRA, long term projections for solar are up. Of the 155 GW of new renewable capacity, 85 GW is expected to come from wind, and 70 GW from utility scale solar. The data analysis and consulting firm says though that the numbers will be a bit muted due to ongoing industry complexities.

The solar industry is currently digging itself out of the anti-dumping import tariff investigation that President Biden put on hold for two years while the various government departments worked through the details. However, shortly after that industry crisis was put on hold – the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act required 3 GW of solar modules to be held at port.
Additionally, some of the benefits that come from the IRA are based on domestic content requirements. It will take time for the United States to ramp up manufacturing of solar panels and its supply chain, and at this point it’s mostly speculative as to whether or not we will actually hit 40 to 50GW of capacity. However, Qcells and Meyer Burger have recently announced that they will be constructing substantial new manufacturing facilities.
Rystad says that it will take until 2024 for the solar industry to really begin to ramp up and take advantage of the IRA.
The analysis group has also said that offshore wind could greatly benefit from the new law, however it cautions that there is limited supply of wind turbine installation vessels that would meet U.S. standards.
The company noted that the IRA gives utility scale developers a chance to choose between the 30% tax credit (ITC) or a per kilowatt hour Production Tax Credit (PTC). The PTC starts at 3/10th of a cent per kWh, however, if prevailing wage is used, that rate increases to 1.5¢/kWh. That rate should increase going forward, depending on inflation. The PTC runs for ten years.
The group modeled that a 250 MW solar project would benefit more from the PTC versus the ITC right up until high interest rates – 7.5% discount rate – start to bite, due to the heavy up-front costs.

The ground-mount solar installation sits on 11 acres of company-owned land adjacent to the facility. TotalEnergies, which recently acquired SunPower Commercial and Industrial Solutions, oversaw design and installation of the 3.5 MW project, which includes 8,975 solar panels, along with a 770 kW/3,080 kilowatt-hour battery storage system. The installation will cover 98% of the electricity needs at the facility and is expected to help reduce the manufacturer’s energy costs by $1 million annually.
“The installation of these solar panels contributes to SEE’s overarching sustainability strategy and advances our transition to net-zero carbon emissions in our operations by 2040. Through these solar panels, we are advancing our use of renewable energy, lessening the energy intensity of operations and reducing the company’s greenhouse gas emissions,” said Emile Chammas, SEE’s chief operating officer. “We are on a journey to leave our world better than we find it and the completion of this project is an important milestone in the strategic investments we’re making to achieve that goal.”
SEE pledged to design or advance 100% its packaging materials to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, and has a goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions in its global operations by 2040.
Over the course of the first year, the solar project will help avoid 4,982 metric tons of carbon dioxide and 72,172 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 15 years, which is equivalent to greenhouse gas emissions from more than 15,000 passenger vehicles driven for one year, the carbon dioxide emission from annual electricity use for more than 14,000 homes, or the carbon sequestration of nearly 1,200,000 tree seedlings grown over the course of a decade.
“TotalEnergies is proud to be SEE’s energy transformation partner as they invest to achieve ambitious sustainability targets,” said Eric Potts, vice president of TotalEnergies Distributed Generation USA. “Renewable energy is a business priority for both of our companies, so we are thrilled that this project will deliver long-term benefits to SEE’s Madera facility while advancing global progress toward carbon neutrality.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/23/clean-energy-group-asks-ferc-to-re-do-tva-plan-that-would-replace-coal-with-gas/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 23, 2022",Clean energy group asks FERC to re-do TVA plan that would replace coal with gas,"The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not to rely on a Tennessee Valley Authority analysis that selected a new gas-fired generator to replace an existing coal-fired generator, in comments to the commission.
The group says the commission (FERC) should evaluate replacing the coal unit with solar, wind, energy efficiency and storage, rather than gas generation.
SACE made its comments as FERC evaluates a proposal from a pipeline company to build a new gas pipeline that would serve TVA’s proposed gas unit. Part of FERC’s review of any proposal for a new gas pipeline is “to verify there is a need for that pipeline,” said Maggie Shober, research director at SACE, in a post.
The group says that the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company proposes to construct a gas pipeline “based on the claim” by TVA that it needs a new gas unit to replace the coal unit that it plans to retire. TVA came to that conclusion in a 449-page draft environmental impact statement.
SACE argues that for “a multitude of reasons,” TVA’s draft environmental impact statement “should not be relied on to assume TVA has a need for a new gas [unit], and thus there is not a need” for the proposed pipeline.
According to SACE, TVA’s analysis “failed to accurately evaluate all options” to replace the coal unit and “skewed its analysis toward its desired outcome.” While TVA said that its “financial and system analysis” indicated that a gas unit was the “best overall solution,” SACE said that “the methods, assumptions, and results of those financial and system analyses are absent” from TVA’s statement.
Through formal inquiries known as NEPA and FOIA requests, SACE learned that TVA used in its analysis assumptions that it developed in 2017 for its 2019 integrated resource plan, including “the lowest price forecast” from 2017 for gas, “despite gas prices being currently high and volatile and forward markets indicating they will likely remain high or at least volatile.”
SACE said that TVA’s response to its FOIA request “again did not provide details on the assumptions used to analyze the costs of the alternatives” for replacing the coal unit.
TVA analyzed a large-scale solar and storage alternative, SACE said, and apparently identified, as one major cost, the cost to upgrade the transmission system to connect solar and storage.  “A combination of distributed and large-scale” solar resources “could easily mitigate the transmission costs,” SACE said, and FERC should encourage TVA through FERC’s Regional Transmission Planning rulemaking to “proactively plan and build out its transmission system” to integrate renewables.
TVA did not include wind power or energy efficiency in its analysis, SACE said.
SACE also argued that TVA leadership has a conflict of interest, in that adding a new combined-cycle gas unit would help TVA’s CEO earn a bonus as it would “shore up” the “combined cycle availability factor performance metric,” which is the basis for 10% of the CEO’s annual bonus potential of $3 million. Replacing the coal unit with solar and storage “does not have the same potential,” as there are no bonus metrics based on renewable or clean energy targets, SACE said.
FERC has new information to improve the analysis of alternatives to TVA’s retiring coal unit, SACE said, such as using assumptions that are more up to date. The new Inflation Reduction Act has the potential “to change assumptions on both the demand and supply side,” SACE said, including through expanded tax credits for clean energy sources, and a new fee on methane emissions.
With updated assumptions, “it is unlikely” that TVA’s proposed gas unit will be needed, and thus the pipeline company’s proposed gas unit “would not be needed either,” SACE said.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, SACE reported, similarly recommended that TVA “transparently disclose its modeling methodologies and assumptions to better enable a comparison between the alternatives,” and filed those comments with FERC.
