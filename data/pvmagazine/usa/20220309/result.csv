The roadmap offers a strategy for expanding the state’s NY-Sun initiative into one of the largest solar programs in the nation, expected to spur approximately $4.4 billion in private investment and create 6,000 additional solar jobs across the state. These groups support aspects of the plan, but are asking the PSC to do more for New York’s disadvantaged communities.
Currently New York’s landmark climate law, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) mandates that at a minimum 35 to 40% of the overall benefits of clean energy investments be directed to residents of disadvantaged communities. The commenters specifically call for additional funding for community-owned solar projects and safeguards to ensure that New York’s most historically underinvested communities are reaping the benefits of the clean energy transition.
While residents of ‘disadvantaged’ communities would certainly welcome the 10 percent discount on their utility bill offered in NYSERDA’s Roadmap, that hardly does justice to the CLCPA’s promise of 35-40 percent of the overall benefits of clean energy investments. Nor does it do justice for communities that have long borne the brunt of air pollution and the impacts of climate change resulting from fossil fuel power plants and other environmental hazards that have been forced upon their communities over the years, said Jasmine Graham, Energy Justice Policy Manager at WE ACT for Environmental Justice.
The changes that the three groups are asking for include:
“Rooftop and community solar provide huge opportunities for individuals and communities to directly benefit from the renewable energy transition, but only if the State ensures that the energy savings, pollution reductions, jobs, and ownership opportunities are fairly shared,” said Jessica Azulay, Executive Director of Alliance for a Green Economy.
In their comments the groups pointed out that it is the responsibility of NYSERDA to “ensure social equity as well as expediency in the execution of CLCPA”, and as such Vote Solar and AGREE look forward to working with the PSC and NYSERDA to “ensure that we deliver on the co-equal imperatives of speed, scale and justice reaching in our climate targets”. The roadmap will be considered for approval by New York’s Public Service Commission.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/09/solar-trackers-vs-wind-an-ongoing-struggle/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 9, 2022",Solar trackers vs. wind: An ongoing struggle,"While not as immediately captivating in damage potential as lacrosse ball-sized hail or sudden, destructive flooding, the threats that wind poses to solar installations, especially those that utilize single-axis trackers (SATs), is a paramount concern for solar developers, and one that is only growing in import as high-speed wind events become more common and projects expand into areas more prone to high winds.
In the pursuit of maximizing SAT resiliency, FTC Solar has co-authored a whitepaper with wind engineering experts RWDI and structural engineering firm Engineered Power Solutions (EPS) to highlight how the zero-degree wind stow position and proprietary dampening technology used in FTC’s Voyager SAT alleviates the effects of static and dynamic wind loading, preventing catastrophic failure and revenue loss.
Wind and trackers
The two types of wind effects on SATs outlined in the white paper are static and dynamic wind loads. Static loads are the result of constant wind against the SAT structure, while Dynamic loads involve the reaction of the SAT to varying oncoming wind and the interaction of wind with the site creating effects like turbulence.
The interaction between aerodynamic forces and nonrigid structures, the SATs in this example, is known as aeroelasticity. The paper outlines that the aeroelastic nature of SATs means that both static and dynamic behaviors are dependent on the twist of the tracker during operation and on each other. This interaction of static and dynamic wind forces, in a worst-case scenario, can create a snowball effect of aeroelastic instability that can lead to structural damage and even catastrophic failure.
Because of this, as the authors outline, both static and dynamic loads have to be considered when developing tracker hardware and optimal stow strategies.
Making the fix
Traditionally, dynamic and static load consideration has been tackled by using modest amounts of damping to raise the natural frequency that the unit can sustain above the level excited significantly by the wind by stiffening the structure known as underdamping, and to stow at a higher angles, typically 30 degrees. In an underdamped system adding more damping beyond a certain point does not have much impact on stability and the authors state that conventional wisdom has been that only a combination of stiffer structure and stowing at higher angles along with modest damping will ensure stability.
According to FTC, their own research has shown that much larger amounts of damping, overdamping, than traditionally considered create an unexpected result. This amount of damping essentially makes it impossible for practical tracker designs to become unstable even when stowed flat.
While extra damping measures increase overall structural stability, stowing modules in a flat or horizontal position during a wind event has the advantage of reducing normal static wind loads. With the solar panels held flat, the lateral forces acting on the foundation are much smaller than if that panel were vertical or at an angle tilted toward the wind. This means less force on the system overall and it substantially reduces the loads on the modules.
To prove the efficacy of FTC’s theory of overdamping and low-angle stow strategy, RWDI initially performed sensor-based testing by building models of a Voyager 2p system. The intent of this first test was to measure static wind loads. The authors outline that testing was performed with sensors attached to the models recording how these static wind loads affected the structures. They measured what pressures occurred at more than a thousand individual points throughout the array with pressure transducers. This solidified our baseline understanding of static wind forces on the structures.
From those results, FTC developed the highly damped system design utilized in the Voyager tracker systems. Next, RWDI conducted aeroelastic wind tunnel testing to further validate the previous findings.
In aeroelastic wind tunnel testing with wind speeds between 105 and 150 mph, RWDI found that FTC’s overdamping and zero-degree stow strategies led to no divergent dynamic oscillations, which are indicative of aerodynamic instabilities, and that the wind load used only led to normal static rotations of the system.
What FTC attempted in this study was a pretty novel approach in terms of wind mitigation, and the hope is that the efficacy of their solution will hep to give greater understanding into how to improve wind’s relationship with SATs.
“[FTC is the] only company I know of that has incorporated physical dampers into their to-scale wind tunnel models,” said Matt Gilliss of EPS. “It’s become more common to model locks and consider rotations due to aeroelastic effects in wind tunnel modeling, but to incorporate the resistance from dampers into the wind tunnel testing models is something new.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/09/smud-signs-its-largest-solar-and-storage-ppa-with-d-e-shaw/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 9, 2022",SMUD signs its largest solar and storage PPA with D.E. Shaw,"D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments announced a large northern California solar project with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD). SMUD signed a power purchase agreement sized at 200MW of solar PV and 400MWh of energy storage. The battery energy storage system is a planned 100MW, four-hour duration battery.
The project, to be located in east Sacramento County, is the largest co-located solar and storage facility in northern California under power purchase agreement contract, said D.E. Shaw. It is expected to reach commercial operation in 2024.
“Partnerships are a key component to SMUD reaching our 2030 Zero Carbon goals,” said Frankie McDermott, SMUD’s chief operating officer.  “We committed to using every tool in the toolbox, and innovative projects like this that combine solar and battery storage will enable us to provide the region with clean and reliable power as we transition away from natural gas resources.”
Construction of the project is expected to bring an estimated 400 jobs. The project runs parallel to an agricultural ranch, and special design considerations are being taken for environmental sustainability during construction and operations. Bona Terra Energy affiliates will co-develop the project with D.E. Shaw.
As part of the project, the Mark Gall Memorial Scholarship will be funded by D.E. Shaw. The scholarship is designed to cultivate local workforce talent and support renewable energy-interested students in greater Sacramento. “DESRI is thrilled to support emerging young leaders interested in becoming part of the clean energy economy in and around Sacramento as the renewable energy industry grows in the region and celebrate the public servants at SMUD for their commitment to renewable energy,” said Hy Martin, chief development officer of D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/09/in-2021-renewable-energy-use-reached-an-all-time-high-but-so-did-co2-emissions/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 9, 2022","In 2021 renewable energy use reached an all-time high, but so did CO2 emissions","As global economies rebounded from the Covid-19 crisis, the increase in coal use spiked CO2 emissions over 2 billion tonnes, the largest ever, according to the IEA report “Global Energy Review: CO2 emissions 2021”.
The increase in global CO2 emissions more than offset the previous year’s pandemic-induced decline, according to IEA analysis. Adverse weather conditions and increases in the price of natural gas are the reasons given for the spike in emissions, both of which led to more coal being burned despite renewable power generation registering its largest ever growth.
According to the report, over 40% of CO2 emissions came from coal, while natural gas accounted for emissions well above 2019 levels. Oil, on the other hand, saw more limited use due to transportation problems and the reduction in air travel.
The numbers indicate that the recovery process did not heed the advice of the IEA report “Sustainable Recovery” report, written in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund. The report was written to inform governments of the unique opportunities presented in the economic recovery to boost economic growth, create jobs, and reduce CO2 emissions in the quest to reach net zero emissions by 2050 globally.
The good news is that many advanced economies have set decarbonization goals, and according to the IEA’s Sustainable Recovery Tracker,  as of October 2021, $470 billion had been earmarked for sustainable measures within recovery packages through 2030. The bad news is that it’s not enough—representing only 40% of the investment needed according to Sustainable Recovery Plan,
Despite it not being enough, according to the IEA recommendations, renewables-based generation exceeded 8,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2021, a record 500TWh above its 2020 level. Output from wind and solar increased by 270TWh and 170TWh, respectively, while hydro generation declined due to the impacts of drought, notably in the US and Brazil.
China also saw its largest ever increase in renewable power output in 2021; however, China was also the greatest contributor to CO2 emissions, where they increased by 750 million tonnes between 2019 and 2021.
IEA
The emissions increases in those two years in China more than offset the aggregate decline in the rest of the world over the same period. In 2021 alone, China’s CO2 emissions rose above 11.9 billion tonnes, accounting for 33% of the global total.
The Global Energy review concludes that the world can still achieve net-zero by 2050, but only with sustainable investments combined with the accelerated deployment of clean energy technologies.
