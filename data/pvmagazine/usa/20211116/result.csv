It will be among the largest installations in the country to have a portion of its capacity dedicated to low and moderate-income (LMI) residents.
The array is set to be constructed on the capped Oaks Landfill in Gaithersburg, just northwest of Washington, D.C. Project construction is expected to begin in early 2022.
The 6 MW project will be divided into three 2 MW arrays, with Array 1 set to provide the county government with power. The remaining two arrays compose the community solar project with all of the generated electricity provided to low-to-moderate income residents.
The three arrays are expected to generate 11.7 million kilowatt hours of annual energy for government use and LMI residents.
The project will help the county reach its goal of eliminating greenhouse emissions in its operations by 2035, while also making progress toward the state of Maryland’s goal to generate 50% of its electricity from renewables by 2030.
The energy produced by the LMI-dedicated arrays will be equivalent to preventing 5,599 metric tons of CO2 from being released each year, the same as taking 1,218 cars off the road for one year and preventing 6,188,031 pounds of coal from being burned.
“This project blows away by an order of magnitude any other 100% LMI project in the state of Maryland, and is a testament to Neighborhood Sun’s leading role in bringing energy justice to the state,” said Gary Skulnik, CEO, Neighborhood Sun.
Helping to fund the project’s construction is $950,000 in grant funding through the Maryland Energy Administration’s Low-to-Moderate Income Community Solar Program. The program provides incentives to reduce the cost of electricity generated from clean energy to Marylander’s, with income limitations that result in energy costs being a disproportionate portion of their household expenses, according to Maryland Energy Administration Director, Mary Beth Tung.
Maryland is projected to be one of the top states in the nation for community solar development, and the state has committed to making that expectation a reality.
In September, regulators unanimously voted to expand the capacity of the state’s community solar program as well as improve access for LMI customer participation in the state’s Community Solar Pilot Program.
According to the Coalition for Community Solar Access, the expansion of the program will allow community solar to power the equivalent of an additional 6,840 Maryland homes, annually. The expansion also changed development regulations, allowing community solar projects to be built on clean-fill construction sites, transforming previously unusable industrial locations into clean solar energy generation sites.
“Community solar is an integral part of Maryland’s clean energy future and has already produced major benefits for residents,” said State Delegate Luke Clippinger of the expansion. “We cannot achieve our climate and renewable energy goals without community solar.”

Two companies said they successfully produced green hydrogen at a recent demonstration in California.
Heliogen supplied concentrated solar power (CSP) to power the operation, and Bloom Energy used its electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel. 
Heliogen said its AI-powered CSP technology is able to generate for longer periods of time than solar PV, operating on a near 24/7 basis by storing the solar energy. Heliogen said this results in more compact design and lower costs in production. The company said the demonstration is a step towards replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen in commercial and industrial applications.

Heliogen’s CSP creates heat, steam, and electricity from concentrated sunlight. It was paired with Bloom’s solid-oxide, high-temperature electrolyzer to make the fuel. The company said hydrogen can be made 45% more efficiently than low-temperature PEM and alkaline electrolyzers.
Electricity dictates nearly 80% of the cost of hydrogen from electrolysis. The CSP method reduces the need for electricity, using heat to aid its operations.
Hydrogen is expected to grow from an annual 115 million metric tons to 500-800 million metric tons by 2050, which would represent 15 to 20 percent of global energy demand. Over $300 billion has been invested in hydrogen up and down the value chain, and McKinsey & Company project about $150 billion of that investment has gone directly towards production.
The successful green hydrogen production is a step towards decarbonizing industrial processes, which account for more than one-third of the world’s energy consumption, and a quarter of global carbon emissions.
The companies said this demonstration is an important step towards making CSP-backed hydrogen production cost-competitive with solar PV.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/16/court-throws-out-trump-trade-action-on-bifacial-modules/,"LEGAL,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 16, 2021",Court throws out Trump trade action on bifacial modules,"The U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued a decision that re-instates an exclusion of bifacial solar modules from Section 201 tariffs. The exclusion originally was extended in 2019, but later was revoked by the Trump Administration in an October 2020 proclamation.
The court found that while the Trump’s proclamation complied with procedural requirements of the safeguard statute, the action was outside of the president’s delegated authority.
The court in its 32-page decision prohibited further enforcement of the proclamation, which was numbered 10101. The court order effectively reinstated an earlier exemption from tariffs for bifacial modules.
In addition, the court decision reduced the Section 201 tariff rate from 18% to 15% after it was raised as part of Proclamation 10101. Both actions will result in refunds of the tariffs that had been collected under the proclamation.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) called the decision a win for the solar industry.
Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO, said the decision to strike down the presidential proclamation “was clearly the right conclusion.” She said the proclamation’s actions amounted to an unlawful attempt to harshen the Section 201 tariffs.”
The Trump administration’s main argument was that bifacial modules were likely to account for a greater share of the market in the future and could substitute for monofacial products in a range of market segments. It continued that exempting imports of bifacial modules from the safeguard tariff would apply “significant downward pressure” on prices of domestically produced modules.
At the time, Trump also cited the impact of bifacial’s growing share of the U.S. market as his reason for putting a hold on the fourth year step-down of the solar tariffs from 20% to 15%. He opted, instead, to reset the rate for all imported solar panels at 18%. When first imposed in 2018 as part of Trump’s trade war with China, the tariffs were set at 30%, to be decreased 5% each year for four years.
In February, 17 U.S. clean energy CEOs  urged President Biden to repeal the solar tariff proclamation, which the leaders called “punitive” and “ill conceived.”
In a letter to Biden, the CEOs said that the proclamation increased the 2021 trade tariff rate for imported solar cells and modules and argued that the decision “arbitrarily” revoked the exclusion for bifacial solar panels.
Led by SEIA and supported by the American Clean Power Association, the letter called attention to the proclamation’s impact to existing solar contracts and discussed how harmful the Section 201 tariffs are to the U.S. economy and the industry’s ability to address climate change. The CEOs asked Biden to return the tariffs to status quo and restore business certainty.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/16/at-a-pivotal-moment-solar-industry-leaders-join-roundtables-usa-2021-to-share-insights/,"EVENTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 16, 2021","At a pivotal moment, solar industry leaders join Roundtables USA 2021 to share insights","Solar industry leaders from across the United States and the globe gathered in an informative and especially timely virtual event as the pv magazine Roundtables USA took place on November 9. 
As U.S. and global solar markets rapidly recover from disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a vision of optimal, resilient solar PV solutions to speed decarbonization and tackle the existential climate challenge was shared. Through a total of six hours of curated sessions that were moderated by Senior U.S. Editor David Wagman, U.S. Editor Tim Sylvia, global Editor in Chief Jonathan Gifford, and Associate Editor Ryan Kennedy, equipment manufacturers, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders shared their view of how to accelerate deployment in pursuit of national and global goals. 
Karla Loeb, a member of the board of directors and the distributed generation chair of the Solar Energy Industries Association got things started with a spotlight on solar PV resiliency in an age of extremes. Under a shifting climate, disasters like what was witnessed in the winter storms of Texas, and Hurricane Ida are expected to persist in the future. A redefined grid, one that not only cuts climate-fueling carbon emissions, but one that is resilient to the weather events of our future is paramount. 
Loeb shared, “We need energy where people live, not just in areas that support our industrial processes.” A distributed energy grid is less exposed to localized disasters, and is better able to store, deliver, and perform auxiliary grid services under extreme events, including weather events and national security emergencies. 
Her talk was followed by a panel featuring experts from Sandia National Laboratories, PV Evolution Labs, Enduans Solar, and VDE Americas. Under the moderation of Tim Sylvia, they shared strategies in bolstering PV’s defense from wind, hail, heat, fire threats and more. We learned about the evolution of system components in an environment of increased risk, and how shifting risks due to environmental change factor into project insurance assessment. 
An illuminating presentation was given by Claire Kearns-McCoy, senior project manager and solar engineer with Clean Energy Associates. Kearns-McCoy explained how electroluminescence (EL) imaging can be used to evaluate the quality of electrical contacts in solar cells.  
She advocated for the use of EL imaging early in the installation process for field-based quality assurance. EL can provide a visual check for damage, defective modules, and proper installation techniques. Multiple steps of EL checks throughout the process can allow for problem remediation before an issue is widespread. 
Next up was a deep-dive into module reliability from Hongbin Fang, director of product marketing with module-maker Longi. He reviewed the component ripple effect onset by the industry shift to larger-format modules. He shared that while adding thicker glass and sturdier frames to large-format modules would decrease microcracking, it would also increase cost, and that Longi is instead focused on increasing overall efficiency to make up for some losses in cracking-related degradation. 
Fang was joined by a panel that included Pedro Magalhães of Arctech Solar and Ben Damiani of Solar Inventions. With questions from Jonathan Gifford, the three dove deeper into how designs altered and adapted to the new large format. Balance of system issues are emerging, particularly in module’s electrical connectors, which many in the industry are calling for improved standards for safety and reliability.

A second fireside chat led by Tim Sylvia included software gurus Matt Campbell of Terabase and Aron Dobos of Nextracker. The three explored the factors the underly solar system underperformance, and how software tools can enhance performance. The cutting-edge of solar project software uses 3D modeling, GIS, and Sim City-like construction simulators to model real-world possibilities, cutting costs and de-risking projects. 
The first session wrapped up with a special presentation by Dana Redden, founder and CEO of Solar Stewards. She explained why diversity, inclusion, equity, and justice need to have a center-stage position in the energy transition. Energy as an industry has a history of injustice along economic and racial lines, and the re-building of our energy infrastructure means we are at an inflection point in which we have the opportunity to restructure the way it is built and managed in a more inclusive and equitable way. 
In between the main-stage events, our attendees shared ideas and approaches, made connections, and offered their suggestions for future discussions at our networking events. The networking was a blend of one-on-one “speed dating” style sessions, in which participants joined online video chat rooms to meet Roundtables partner companies.
Simultaneously, John Balfour founder of High-Performance PV, led a discussion moderated by Ryan Kennedy. After John kicked off the talk, participants asked questions through a live dialogue, and sent in questions via chat. 
Dr. Balfour explained his position on why solar needs to be designed, implemented, and managed as long-term infrastructure, and should not merely be focused on becoming the lowest-cost resource available in a short-term way. He shared how the current model of project development is one that creates a lot of early revenue for developers and investors, but long-term stakeholders may be handed a low-value, problem-laden facility in the future if resiliency is not in focus.
Garrett Nilsen, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office opened the second session, outlining the Biden Administration’s clean energy goals with a focus of solar energy, and the related initiatives DOE is pursuing.
Next, a panel of four led a talk titled “Lead, follow, or get out of the way: What solar needs to expand.” Panel members who were interviewed by David Wagman and Tim Sylvia included Suzanne Leta, head of policy and strategy for SunPower; Dean Solon
founder of Shoals Technologies Group; Elizabeth Sanderson, executive director of  Solar Energy International; and Paul Wormser, vice presiden of technology for Clean Energy Associates.
The group covered a range of subjects, including highlights of the DOE-backed SolarAPP+, an automated permitting app that is slashing residential solar permit wait times. A call for greater diversity in the solar workforce was shared, as only 30% of the workforce are women, and only 8% are Black.
And the group weighed in on how the U.S. may be able to expand its solar manufacturing base and over what period of time.
Michael Parr, director of the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance, spoke in a one-on-one interview with David Wagman and addressed the environmental footprint of solar. He shared that about 70-90% of global solar manufacturing is located in China, where solar has near double the carbon emission intensity in its production process. He advocated for a more dispersed and geographically diverse manufacturing supply chain. He said that market forces will continue to be the strongest driver in decarbonizing solar products, and that buyers must actively select low-carbon module sourcing.
Following this interview, heterojunction module maker Recom offered a video presentation featuring Hamlet Tunyan, CEO, and Vartan Oskanian, advisor to the CEO.
The company combines silicon and thin-film technologies in their modules, and offers extra levels of transparency in its supply chain origination. Recom module whitepapers trace the location the materials were sourced from and track the total carbon emission output for each component in the module.
Moving from modules to energy storage, the Roundtables covered the emergence of the alkaline battery as a low-cost, safe alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Joining Tim Sylvia in the discussion were Ann Marie Augustus, co-founder and VP of operations at Urban Electric Power, and George Schulz VP of clean energy at Ariel Re.
Schulz said that project insurance underwriting has come under pressure from issues like thermal runway of batteries, and new technologies are difficult to accurately underwrite. Safety of energy storage, in particular, will continue to be an important issue, and data transparency will be important in limiting risks for all.

The Roundtables then turned its attention to the future and solar cleantech innovations in the drive to a decarbonized future. Taking part in this panel were Massoud Amin of the University of Minnesota, solar energy leader Karl Rabago, Chris Gordon, project development manager at EDF Renewables North America, and Marlene Motyka, U.S. and global renewable energy leader at Deloitte.
As nations reach higher levels of renewable energy penetration on the grid, power distribution will become increasingly important. The panel pointed out that generation should be located near load centers for greater efficiency and reliability, but this comes with a set of high-land cost and zoning issues and NIMBYism. It was concluded that a blend of utility-scale projects and distributed solar would be both the lowest-cost and fastest way to deploy at scale, while keeping resiliency and flexibility in mind.
Our moderators closed the day thanking all who were involved in making this event a success. We’d again like to thank our presenters, viewers, and our partners for the Roundtables USA 2021 event. We look forward to seeing you next year, as well as at our many other pv magazine USA and international Roundtables and webinars.

This projected growth in stationary energy storage will require more than $262 billion of investment, BNEF said in its 2021 Global Energy Storage Outlook.
Yayoi Sekine, the firm’s head of decentralized energy, said, “This is the energy storage decade. We’ve been anticipating significant scale-up for many years and the industry is now more than ready to deliver.”
Salt River Project
The outlook estimated that 345 GW/999 GWh of new energy storage capacity will be added globally between 2021 and 2030. The U.S. and China are expected to be the two largest markets, representing more than half of the global storage installations by 2030.
Clean power ambitions of state governments and utilities propel storage deployment in the U.S., the outlook said. In China, the installation target of 30 GW of cumulative build by 2025 and stricter renewable integration rules boost expected storage installations.
Other top markets according to BNEF include India, Australia, Germany, the U.K., and Japan. Supportive policies, ambitious climate commitments, and the growing need for flexible resources are common drivers.
The forecast said that although Asia-Pacific (APAC) will lead the storage build on a megawatt basis by 2030, the Americas will build more on a megawatt-hour basis. BNEF said that is because storage plants in the U.S. usually have more hours of storage.
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) currently lags behind its counterparts due to the lack of targeted storage policies and incentives. Growth in the region could accelerate, however, as renewables penetration surges, more fossil-fuel generators close, and the battery supply chain becomes more localized.

BNEF said that falling battery costs and “surging” renewables penetration make energy storage a “compelling flexible resource in many power systems.” Energy storage projects are growing in scale, increasing in dispatch duration, and are increasingly paired with renewables, the analysis said.
BNEF’s forecast suggests that 55% of energy storage build by 2030 will be to provide energy shifting. Co-located renewable-plus-storage projects, solar-plus-storage in particular, are becoming commonplace globally.
Customer-sited batteries, both residential and commercial and industrial ones, will also grow at a steady pace, the outlook said. Germany and Japan are currently leading markets, with sizeable markets in Australia and California.
BNEF said it expects energy storage located at homes and businesses to make up about one quarter of global storage installations by 2030. The desire of electricity consumers to use more self-generated solar power and appetite for back-up power are major drivers.
Other applications, such as using energy storage to defer grid investment, may remain marginal in most markets to 2030. Build could pick up, the outlook said, if regulatory barriers are removed and incentives are aligned for network owners to consider storage as an alternative to traditional infrastructure investment.

Rapidly evolving battery technology is driving the energy storage market. The report found that the industry is adopting multiple lithium-ion battery chemistries. It said that in 2021, lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) will be used more than nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistries for stationary storage for the first time.
LFP is poised to become the major lithium-ion battery chemistry choice in the energy storage sector until at least 2030, driven by its dominant role in China and increasing penetration in the rest of the world. BNEF also updated its technology outlook to include sodium-ion batteries, a lithium-ion battery contender, which it said could play a “meaningful role” by 2030.
Besides batteries, many non-battery technologies are under development, such as compressed air and thermal energy storage. The report said that many of these can provide longer dispatch duration compared to batteries, looking to supply during prolonged periods of low renewable energy generation in future net-zero power systems.
However, BNEF said it expects batteries to dominate the market at least until the 2030s, in large part due to their price competitiveness, established supply chain, and track record. If new technologies successfully outcompete lithium-ion, then total uptake may well be larger.

And you wouldn’t be alone.
The global rooftop solar market size was valued at $62.4 billion in 2019 and is projected to progress at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9%from 2020 to 2025, according to one recent report.

The benefits of rooftop solar are enormous. With PV prices low enough to compete with grid prices, impacts from climate change on the rise, the energy and carbon savings easily calculated, and your rooftop likely unused real estate, there has never been a better time to incorporate solar.
However, due to inconsistent installation practices, intense manufacturer competition, and sometimes-conflicting motives between operations and maintenance (O&M) providers and end-owners, the risk of fires on rooftop installations is uncomfortably common.
Based on a sample of hundreds of commercial scale rooftop inspections performed by Clean Energy Associates (CEA) globally, more than 90% of inspected rooftops had significant safety and fire risks.
One need only perform a simple Google search to find examples of these risks turning into actual fires and causing costly damage, business disruptions, store closures, data center interruptions, and so on. Thankfully, despite the prevalence of the risks, the causes, identification, and the remediation and resolution are surprisingly straightforward.
Let’s start with the causes. The three most common gating issues (that is, issues that pose a potentially immediate fire risk) include:
Each of these issues pose potentially immediate fire risks. But many systems can operate fine for years without incident before causing a fire. Thankfully, these “ticking time bombs” can easily be identified by performing an in-depth system-off (de-energized) visual inspection, and typically are also easily fixed. So, how do these relatively trivial issues come about in the first place, and why are they so prevalent across the industry worldwide?
The answer to this question falls into three categories: inconsistent and widely varying installation practices, inaccurate or incomplete connector information, and conflicting motives between O&M providers and system-owners.
The first issue is fairly straightforward and self-explanatory. Typically, companies contract out the installation to one or more third-party installation groups. Commercial-grade rooftop solar is still a relatively new field with solar jobs outpacing the overall job growth rate in the U.S. by 5x over the past decade. Incomplete or inconsistent training is understandably associated with this type of rapid industry expansion and is one of the leading causes of fire risks on commercial rooftops.
The second, and more significant, cause of these fire risks is incomplete and sometimes inaccurate information regarding solar module connectors.
In brief, rooftop solar modules are typically installed in strings of modules connected in series (usually between 18 to 20 modules for commercial/industrial systems) before they ultimately are connected to an inverter at the end. The distance from one module to the next on a string is standard. As a result, the module-to-module wire harness connections on the string are factory-made.
However, because the distance from the end of the string to the inverter varies, those connections (module to inverter and inverter to panel board) are typically “field-made” connectors that are assembled on site instead of in the factory.
If the field-made connections use different hardware than the module-to-module connectors on the string, or if they are not assembled and installed per the manufacturer’s specifications, then there a significant risk exists of a hotspot developing. This, in turn, may lead to a fire. Mismatched or improperly made connectors are a common cause of rooftop solar fires; in some cases they account for 100% of an installation’s connectors.
There’s always a risk of an installer creating field-made connectors without realizing that they’re mismatched. But the larger industry issue contributing to improperly made connectors is the inconsistent and inaccurate information from manufacturers regarding which connectors are compatible with each other.
An important resource is the update to the National Electrical Code (NEC) on this issue, which states, “Where mating connectors are not of the identical type and brand, they shall be listed and identified for intermateability, as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.”
However, without proper training, the problem of improper field-made connections is likely to persist.
With the rise of connector manufacturers, companies may list their connector as “X-connector compatible” in their marketing literature but without the UL listing or documentation to support such a claim. This leads installers to think the mismatched connectors are compatible, when in fact they are not. In terms of seriousness, this is a global issue and the leading cause of fire risks found from our inspectors.
The third common cause of fire risks not being promptly identified and resolved is the complicated nature of agreements between an O&M company and a system end-owner. As these agreements typically are written, an O&M is required to fix known issues as well as perform yearly or bi-annual inspections. Here, too, the inspectors sent to conduct these inspections may have widely varying experience.
More importantly, however, they may be disincentivized to spend much amount of time looking for issues they would ultimately be liable to resolve.
Rather than performing a relatively time-intensive row-by-row inspection that could easily identify issues such as wires on sharp edges, heavy scoring, and mismatched connectors, O&M inspectors may instead opt to run system performance tests and only inspect a sample of the modules.
Understanding how we got to this point is important. But site owners need to understand how they can check their current installations for fire risks and resolve them as quickly as possible. The good news is that the identification and resolution of these issues is a relatively simple one.
Step 1: De-Energize a Site:  With a group of licensed professionals, follow proper de-energization procedures and ensure the system is in a safe system-off state.
Step 2: Perform an In-Depth Visual Inspection and System-Off Tests: Due to the seriousness and prevalence of these fire risks, qualified inspectors are recommended to perform an in-depth (system off) visual inspection. This inspection should examine things like mismatched or improperly made connectors, wires resting on or hanging near sharp edges, poor terminations at inverters, and heavy wire scoring or improperly landed and torqued terminations
The system-off test should also include DC Insulation Resistance Test (DC IRT) to check the current leakage on the AC cables, and a continuity test to ensure proper component grounding.
Step 3: Perform System-On Inspections: After resolving the safety issues found during the visual inspection and system-off tests and eliminating the safety risks posed by those, re-energize the site and perform system-on thermal imaging of the components (inverters, field made connectors, factory-made connectors, load centers, combiner boxes, central and string inverters, and so on).
In all thermal scans, look for a change in temperature (ΔT), with a large enough variance from a determined average temperature of other identical components onsite. Lastly, confirm that the inverters are running properly without irregularities or faulting, and the monitoring capabilities are hooked up and running properly.
According to a Yale University study, about 70% percent of commercial buildings in the U.S. — or 600,000 sites — are potential targets for solar projects. At best, only a few tens of thousands of those commercial rooftops are currently equipped with solar. With rising demand and the expected growth of the rooftop solar industry, the issue of fire and other safety risks is likely to only get worse without remediation, so it is imperative to ensure that your system is installed properly and not operating with risks.
