That was alongside a 40% increase in new wind capacity compared with the first three months of 2020, according to the most recent Clean Power Quarterly Market Report, released by the American Clean Power Association (ACP).
The U.S. clean energy industry installed a record-breaking 3,859 MW of clean power capacity in the first quarter. That was a 10% bump over the first quarter of 2020, supplanting it as the highest quarter on record.
The 38 new projects were constructed across 17 states. Texas led the pack with 791 MW installed, followed by Oklahoma (555 MW), California (519 MW), South Dakota (462 MW), and North Dakota (299 MW).
With this record quarter, more than 173 GW of clean power capacity is in service in the U.S.
Solar represented the largest share in the clean power pipeline (44,442 MW), accounting for 53%.

Solar represented the largest share in the clean power pipeline (44,442 MW), accounting for 53%. There were 651 solar projects in advanced development in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Texas hosted more activity than any other state with 19% of the total solar pipeline, followed by California with 13%, North Carolina with 8%, and Indiana with 7%.
Q1 also marked the entrance of a truly massive solar project into the development pipeline: the 700 MW Dunn’s Bridge solar-plus-storage project in Indiana. Once operational, the project will be the largest solar facility in the state by a wide margin.
On the storage side, there was 7,174 MW of battery storage capacity in the project pipeline, including 3,533 MW in advanced development and 3,641 MW under construction, representing 8% of total development activity.
Storage activity was spread across 137 project phases in 15 states. California leads with more battery storage activity than any other state, representing 39% of combined storage pipeline activity. Texas came in second with 15%, followed by Nevada with 14%, and Florida with 6%.
Just as a behemoth solar project began development in Q1, an equally impressive storage installation began construction: the 409 MW Manatee Solar Energy Center in Florida. It would rank as one of the world’s largest solar powered energy storage projects. Once operational, the storage project would be able to power Walt Disney World for an estimated seven hours.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/13/biden-signs-executive-order-addressing-cyber-vulnerabilities-in-energy-and-other-sectors/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 13, 2021",Biden signs Executive Order addressing cyber vulnerabilities in energy and other sectors,"President Biden signed an Executive Order May 12 that is intended to improve the nation’s cybersecurity and protect federal government networks.
In releasing the order, the White House said that recent cybersecurity incidents such as SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange, and the Colonial Pipeline incident are a “sobering reminder” that U.S. public and private sector entities increasingly face “sophisticated malicious cyber activity from both nation-state actors and cyber criminals.” It said these incidents share commonalities, including “insufficient cybersecurity defenses that leave public and private sector entities more vulnerable to incidents.”
The order aims to protect federal networks, improve information-sharing between the U.S. government and the private sector on cyber issues, and strengthen the United States’ ability to respond to incidents when they occur.

Advocacy group Protect Our Power renewed its call for the Biden administration and Congress to make the security and resilience of the U.S. electric grid a top priority in pending infrastructure legislation.
“We’ve been warned repeatedly during the last several years by major U.S intelligence agencies that a crippling cyberattack on our critical infrastructure was not a question of if, but when,” said Jim Cunningham, executive director of the grid advocacy group. The group said that the Colonial pipeline cyberattack and last year’s SolarWinds attack “makes it clear that our electric infrastructure is vulnerable” and in need of “significant” security upgrades.
The group pointed to the weather-related outages in Texas in February as an example of the financial and social costs that could result by losing power “even for a short period of time.”
pv magazine reported earlier this year that Biden said the government had elevated the status of cyber issues and was launching an “urgent initiative” to improve U.S. capability, readiness, and resilience in cyberspace. The earlier reporting said that solar energy systems of all sizes could pose a risk to the grid in much the same way that an attack on a conventional power plant could result in widespread blackouts.
The Executive Order that President Biden signed is intended to:
Remove Barriers to Threat Information Sharing Between Government and the Private Sector. The Executive Order aims to ensure that IT service providers are able to share information with the government and requires them to share certain breach information. Removing contractual barriers and requiring providers to share breach information that could impact government networks is necessary to enable more effective defenses of Federal departments, and to improve the nation’s cybersecurity as a whole.
Modernize and Implement Stronger Cybersecurity Standards in the Federal Government. The Executive Order also intends to move the federal government to secure cloud services and a zero-trust architecture, and mandates deployment of multifactor authentication and encryption with a specific time period. It said that outdated security models and unencrypted data have led to compromises of systems in the public and private sectors.
Improve Software Supply Chain Security. The Executive Order also aims to improve the security of software by establishing baseline security standards for development of software sold to the government, including requiring developers to maintain greater visibility into their software and making security data publicly available. It creates a public-private process to develop new and innovative approaches to secure software development and uses the power of federal procurement to incentivize the market. And, it creates a pilot program to create an “energy star” type of label so the government – and the public at large – can determine whether software was developed securely.
Establish a Cybersecurity Safety Review Board. The Executive Order establishes a Cybersecurity Safety Review Board, co-chaired by government and private-sector leads, that may convene following a significant cyber incident to analyze what happened and make concrete recommendations for improving cybersecurity. This board is modeled after the National Transportation Safety Board, which is used after airplane crashes and other incidents.
Create a Standard Playbook for Responding to Cyber Incidents. The Executive Order aims to create a standardized playbook and set of definitions for cyber incident response by federal departments and agencies. The playbook is intended to ensure all federal agencies meet a certain threshold and are prepared to take uniform steps to identify and mitigate a threat. The playbook will also provide the private sector with a template for its response efforts.
Improve Detection of Cybersecurity Incidents on Federal Government Networks. The Executive Order intends to improve the ability to detect malicious cyber activity on federal networks by enabling a government-wide endpoint detection and response system and improved information sharing within the Federal government.
Improve Investigative and Remediation Capabilities. The Executive Order also creates cybersecurity event log requirements for federal departments and agencies. Poor logging hampers an organization’s ability to detect intrusions, mitigate those in progress, and determine the extent of an incident after the fact. Robust and consistent logging practices will solve much of this problem.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/13/acore-report-makes-a-case-for-a-transmission-itc-to-boost-solar-and-wind/,"POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 13, 2021",ACORE report makes a case for a transmission ITC to boost solar and wind,"A report from the American Council on Renewable Energy outlines the potential benefits of a transmission Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which has been proposed in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and is also included in the Biden administration’s American Jobs Plan.
The report argues that a targeted tax credit is necessary to incentivize construction of “regionally significant” high-voltage transmission infrastructure. It also explores the job creation, clean energy deployment, and private investment these projects could generate.
According to the analysis, a transmission ITC could enable an additional 30,000 MW of renewable energy capacity, spur more than $15 billion in private capital investment in the near term, and provide $2.3 billion in energy cost savings for the lower 80% of income brackets.
It says that that around 220 million MWh of additional domestic solar and wind generation would be enabled by 22 transmission projects that the report considered. This would equate to a nearly 50% increase in solar and wind generation from current levels, allowing wind and solar to grow from 11.6% to 17% of total U.S. electricity supply.
The report presents a policy rationale for a transmission ITC, arguing that no other functioning means currently exists of funding large-scale regional and interregional transmission in the United States.

The report, Investment Tax Credit for Regionally Significant Electricity Transmission Lines: A Description and Analysis, was commissioned by ACORE in collaboration with Grid Strategies LLC.
A transmission Investment Tax Credit (ITC) bill was first introduced by U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) in December 2019. In June 2020 Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) introduced H.R. 7172 as companion legislation to Senator Heinrich’s bill. In March, Heinrich introduced an updated version of his Transmission ITC bill, and the Biden administration’s American Jobs Plan proposed a Transmission ITC.
The report found 22 projects that would likely be eligible for a targeted tax credit, making a total possible investment of $33.3 billion. Of these 22 projects, the report said that a little less than half would to start construction and qualify for the tax credit, mostly due to remaining permitting risks and the challenge of finding buyers and sellers to buy capacity on the transmission lines.
The report said that a tax credit would stimulate both of the main types of transmission projects, regulated rate-based projects and “merchant” lines whose costs are recovered through negotiated or market-based capacity reservations.
In the case of regulated lines, a utility or Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) would allocate the costs through a state or federal (FERC) regulatory process across a set of wholesale or retail customers. In that case, the tax credit would reduce the costs paid by those customers and make the cost allocation and approval process easier so more projects can move forward.

In the case of merchant projects, the transmission capacity reservation costs that developers need to recover from wholesale customers would be reduced by the tax credit. This would allow the transmission developer to offer a more attractive price to customers, increasing the odds of success.
The report said that with few exceptions, the U.S. has not developed large-scale interregional transmission since a DC Pacific Intertie between California and the Pacific Northwest was completed 50 years ago. It said that although FERC tried to encourage interregional transmission in Order No. 1000 a decade ago, that has resulted in no large-scale projects.
FERC’s previous major Orders No. 888 in 1996, No. 2000 in 1999, and No. 890 in 2007 all attempted to promote large scale regional and interregional planning, but with what the report said was limited success.
The report aid that tax policy is a primary tool that Congress uses to provide federal incentives for investments in energy development, particularly renewable technologies.50 Tax incentives can reduce the cost of a technology and stimulate development of new or under-utilized resources.
It said that tax policy was instrumental in promoting fossil fuels and in driving the development of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and the shale gas revolution, and are currently available to incentivize carbon capture and storage and new nuclear generation. Tax credits also have driven large growth in wind and solar energy over the last decade.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/13/sunrise-brief-hawaiian-electric-calls-for-maximum-customer-owned-solar-to-hit-decarbonization-goals/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 13, 2021",Sunrise brief: Hawaiian Electric calls for maximum customer-owned solar to hit decarbonization goals,"Hawaiian Electric is seeking public input on its strategy to boost rooftop solar and similar customer energy resources to a scale large enough to hit the state’s clean energy benchmarks.
The company filed “Customer Energy Resources for Hawaii; A Customer-First CER Strategy for a 100% Clean Energy Future” with the Public Utilities Commission.
The utility said it needs to maximize customer-sited resources like rooftop solar and batteries, electric vehicles, and emerging electricity management technologies to decarbonize its energy systems by 2045. The utility said the state lacks enough open land to “sustainably balance renewable energy with other vital needs such as housing and local food supply.”
The CER strategy follows a year of work with the rooftop solar industry to smooth and speed the interconnection process. The utility said that in 2020 nearly 6,000 new rooftop solar systems were installed across Hawaiian Electric’s service territory, a 55% increase from 2019.
The CER strategy lays out what the utility calls the “Equity Principle,” namely that expanded CERs must benefit all customers, including those with moderate or fixed incomes, and must “fairly allocate utility costs” among customers based on benefits they receive or provide the grid.
The strategy envisions a grid with about half of all customers’ electricity needs coming from customers rather than large power plants.
Customers would be paid through a variety of mechanisms including:
The strategy noted that energy efficiency and conservation are essential to customer involvement. The state’s Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard targets a continuing 30% electricity sales reduction by 2030.
The U.S. Department of Energy said that eight university-led projects will receive nearly $6.2 million for research and development projects aimed at advancing hydrogen as a fuel for turbine-based electricity generation.
The projects will study fundamental scientific challenges and applied engineering issues associated with advancing the performance and efficiency of combustion turbines fueled with pure hydrogen, hydrogen and natural gas mixtures, and other carbon-free hydrogen containing fuels.
The universities receiving awards include:
Canadian Solar entered a strategic partnership and investment with Habitat Energy Limited, a UK-based provider of power trading and asset optimization services for battery storage assets that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The partnership will allow Canadian Solar to offer the technology to developers and owners of battery storage assets to capture additional revenue from trading optimization.
Habitat Energy services include a trading platform with route-to-market capabilities for wholesale and balancing markets.
The partnership will leverage Canadian Solar’s global scale and reach to build on Habitat Energy platform’s current global rollout and on their existing presence in the UK and Australia.
Mitsubishi Power Americas and Texas Brine Co. agreed to develop large-scale long-duration hydrogen storage to support decarbonization efforts across the eastern United States.
This collaboration expands Mitsubishi Power’s capability to store hydrogen in salt caverns across North America. As one of the nation’s largest brine producers, Texas Brine and its affiliates have salt positions in New York, Virginia, Texas, and Louisiana that will enable access to major load centers in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and the Gulf Coast.
Expanding the use of salt caverns for hydrogen energy storage offers an opportunity to create an infrastructure for clean energy resources throughout the U.S. to benefit industries such as power, transportation, and manufacturing that are targeting net zero carbon emissions.
Canadian companies Suncor Energy and ATCO Ltd. are collaborating on early stage design and engineering for a potential hydrogen production project near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. The project would produce more than 300,000 tonnes per year of “blue” hydrogen.
An estimated 85% of the hydrogen would be used to supply existing energy demand. Around 65% of the output would be used in refining processes and cogeneration of steam and electricity at the Suncor Edmonton Refinery, reducing refinery emissions by an estimated 60%. Another 20% of the output could be used in the Alberta natural gas distribution system.
The project would use conventional fossil fuel methods to produce the hydrogen, known as “gray” hydrogen, but would earn its “blue” hydrogen moniker by capturing more than 90% of the emissions generated in the production process.
Several hurdles need to be removed for the project to move forward, the partners said. They called for further regulatory certainty and fiscal support for the project to move forward. They said the availability of carbon sequestration rights, emissions reduction compliance credits, regulations to allow hydrogen blending into natural gas, and investment tax credits for carbon capture and storage “are all critical” to the project’s economic viability. The companies said they are working with the Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada to address these issues.
