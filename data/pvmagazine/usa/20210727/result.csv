With home solar, EV owners can power their car for as little as $415 annually, according to a new consumer report run by SolarReviews.
Over a 25-year span, a typical warranty period for home solar, SolarReviews estimated that charging an EV with home solar could lead to average savings of $16,250.
The DOE also reports that scheduled maintenance for light-duty vehicles costs at about ten cents per mile, while battery electric vehicles only cost about six cents per mile to maintain.

A battery electric vehicle lacks engine oil, timing belts, oxygen sensors, spark plugs, and many more components and the maintenance costs associated with them. This means, over their lifetime, EV’s cost 40% less in scheduled maintenance costs than traditional gas-powered vehicles.
SolarReviews compared a gas-powered Hyundai Kona, and an all-electric Hyundai Kona, and found that in a 13,500-mile year, the gas-powered Kona would spend $1,260 on gas, while the EV charged at home would spend $662 per year in California, and as little as $450 per year in a state like Florida.
Plus, home solar energy is cheaper and greener than pulling your EV’s power from the grid. Grid-sourced energy can range from $.10 to $.40 per kWh, and averages about $.13 per kWh, while the levelized cost of energy for home solar across the country landed at $.11 per kWh, according to SolarReviews. Both of these options are significantly cheaper than a public charger, which ranges from $.28 to $.69 per kWh.
From a carbon standpoint, home solar performs the best as well, reported SolarReviews. Home solar has an implied emission of 368 lbs. of carbon dioxide per 3,780 kWh, while grid power and EV chargers stand at 1,531 lbs., and 450 gallons of gasoline (an equivalent to 3,780 kWh) would emit a whopping 8,830 lbs. of CO2.

Curiosity for EVs and their integration with home solar is on the rise, as SolarReviews reported a 1000% year over year increase in requests to estimate the solar requirements of charging a Tesla on their website. They suggest that an average of five additional solar panels would be sufficient for the average driver to meet the needs of a Tesla Model 3 charged on a level 2 charger.
“Home solar is the key to unlocking the most value from an EV investment, representing the cheapest charging method with the lowest carbon footprint when compared to public EV chargers, grid power and gasoline,” said Andy Sendy, Founder and President of SolarReviews. “Home solar is the clear solution for consumers looking to get the most out of their electric vehicles and realize consistent and sustainable cost savings.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/27/solar-101-how-to-calculate-your-solar-systems-payback-period/,"FINANCE,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 27, 2021",Solar 101: How to calculate your solar system’s payback period,"Let’s get down to brass tacks: Exactly how long will it take your solar system to pay for itself?
There’s a decent chance your contractor will have a spreadsheet-style document with all the details you need to understand your payback period. That document will typically pull information from multiple resources and tools generally available to solar contractors.
For instance, when we worked the angles on our roof, we used a tool called PVWatts. This free government tool takes into account panel efficiency, location, angle, and regional weather averages to accurately predict how much electricity a particular solar system will generate. The local price of electricity is also built in, meaning you can find an estimated annual savings in less than a minute.
The simplest way to model the payback period is to divide the project’s costs by the expected annual production number offered by the calculator. That’s a good start, but it probably won’t tell us the whole story. Your actual payback period will need to consider tax credits, net metering, and state incentives.
Let’s start with the federal Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit. Currently, the tax credit is 26% of the solar power project’s total cost. In the case of a 4,000W system (which, when priced at around $3/watt represents a $12,000 purchase), the 26% credit would reduce the solar project’s cost by $3,120.

The next piece of the calculation – net metering – can get complex in some states. If you happen to live in a state where your net metered solar electricity is 100% compensated, then that’s an easy calculation. All of the electricity your solar panels export will be worth exactly the same as what you use immediately.
If you live in a state where net metered electricity exports are priced lower than the electricity that you buy from the grid, then you’ll need to estimate the difference. This isn’t easy to pin down without specialized hardware in place (like a solar inverter).
Historical averages have shown that close to half of solar generation will be used instantly, while the other half will likely be credited to your account, offsetting future use. Multiply the 50% that is used instantly by your full electricity rate, and the other 50% by the net metered rate offered in your state.
The sum of those two numbers represents the amount of money that you will save on your electricity bill over the next few decades, assuming that your state’s net metering agreement remains in place.
Keep in mind that your solar power system will degrade over time, lowering its electricity output. On average, solar degradation rates are 1-3% in the first year, and 0.5% in later years. That means that by year 25, your solar system will probably be operating at 85% of its original output.
The solar panel you buy will have a warranty that specifically references its degradation rate and expected lifespan.
Now, for our last calculation, state incentives. Each state is different. In Massachusetts, you get paid a bonus for each kilowatt-hour generated. In Rhode Island, you’re paid a fixed dollar amount, based on system size, that is disbursed immediately after the system connects to the power grid.
If you’re lucky enough to live in a state with incentives, you’re going to have to do a little homework to know the exact method to calculate the dollar amount. Our guide to state incentives is a good starting place to research these differences.
Most contractors will provide something like the chart below, which combines all the variables likely to affect your solar system’s prospective payback period. But now that you understand the math, you may want to create your own spreadsheet. After all, trust, but verify.
 
Here’s how it works. Start with the total cost of the system, then subtract the one-off items like the federal tax credit and state incentive. Next, divide by the estimated annual net-metered savings (plus any potential state incentives that we sorted out earlier), and voila! – that’s your payback period.
Your calculations should look a little less complicated than the payback table for a Massachusetts farmer (above). But with a little luck, the column on the far right – which adds up all savings, incentives, and revenue – will shift from red to black sooner than you may have expected.

The proposal is for a 250 MW installation set to be constructed in Riverton, which is located on the Wind River Reservation in the central/western part of the state.
The project would cost $250 million, according to the proposal from Legend, which would include the wages for the 300 full-time construction, 25 technician, five full-time electrical engineer, and five security personnel jobs that the project would create. According to the developer, the positions are all intended to be filled by the local workforce.
Legend has begun working with the Department of Environmental Quality to secure the permits necessary to initiate the project and, if approved, project completion is scheduled to take two years.
Legend also shares that it is working on other solar projects in different areas of Wyoming, with a company representative telling local press that “The country is developing, and I think we need to develop with it and bring green power to the state.”
If bringing green power to the state is the goal, then this project is certainly a significant start, as its 250 MW of proposed capacity is nearly double the state’s entire installed solar capacity to date, which sits at just under 140 MW. SEIA projects the state to add just over 150 MW of capacity in the next five years, so the approval of this project would dramatically shift the outlook for the state’s solar deployment.
Edit 7/28/21: This article has been updated to correct the name of the project’s developer. We apologize for the error.

The company said in its quarterly earnings statement, issued July 26, that it is “focused on ramping production” of energy storage products, improving its Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems.
During the three and six months ended June 30, Tesla recorded total revenues of $11.96 billion and $22.35 billion. That represented increases of $5.92 billion and $10.33 billion, respectively, over the same periods ended June 30, 2020.
The company said that its energy generation and storage revenue rose by $431 million, or 116%, in the second quarter compared to the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue rose by $632 million, or 95%, through the first half.
Tesla said the increases were primarily due to increases in deployments of solar cash and loan jobs, Megapack and Powerwall. The increases were partially were offset by reduced average selling prices on its solar cash and loan jobs as a result of a “low cost solar” strategy the company introduced partway through 2020.
Tesla reported that its cost of energy generation and storage revenue rose by $432 million, or 124%, in the second quarter compared against the same period in 2020. For the first half of the year, the same cost measure rose by $745 million, or 118%.
The company said the increases were primarily due to increases in deployments of solar cash and loan jobs, Solar Roof, Megapack and Powerwall, and increased service maintenance costs on solar energy systems where it was the lessor. The increases were partially offset by reductions in average costs per unit of Solar Roof and solar cash and loan jobs as deployments increased.
The company said that although its average cost per unit of Solar Roof improved, “they still remain significant and contribute disproportionately” to its cost of energy generation and storage revenue.
Gross margin for energy generation and storage fell from 6% to 2% in second quarter, compared to the same three months of 2020. And gross margin fell from 5% to -6% in the first half of the year. It said the decreases were primarily due to a higher proportion of Solar Roof in its overall energy business, which operated at lower gross margins as a result of temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp, increased service maintenance costs on solar energy systems where Tesla was the lessor, and lower gross margins in its energy storage business as it ramps its Megapack storage product.
The company said that while it continues to increase production of its energy storage products, production is “sensitive to global component constraints.” It said that for its Megapack product, energy storage deployments can “vary meaningfully” quarter to quarter depending on the timing of project milestones.
For its Powerwall product, better availability and growing grid stability concerns are driving customer interest. The company said it is “emphasizing cross-selling” with its residential solar energy products.
The company said it is working to improve its Solar Roof installation capabilities by hiring and training a “large number” of installers and reducing the installation time “dramatically.” Tesla said that as these product lines grow, it will have to maintain “adequate” battery cell supply for its energy storage products and “hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians,” to support the ramp of Solar Roof.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/27/sunnova-and-solaredge-partner-to-provide-grid-support-services-in-new-england/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 27, 2021",Sunnova and SolarEdge partner to provide grid support services in New England,"Sunnova Energy will partner with National Grid and SolarEdge Technologies to use its solar and storage assets in New England to help improve power quality in the utility’s service area.
Sunnova and SolarEdge will provide voltage support across Massachusetts and Rhode Island. It said the move would show that distributed resources can unlock additional value to ratepayers. Sunnova’s aggregated residential solar and storage portfolio produces more than 150 GWh of energy each year.
Over the last decade, the industry has built around 838 MW of residential distributed energy assets in Massachusetts and 58 MW in Rhode Island, according to Wood Mackenzie. The partnership is intended to help National Grid reduce distribution system losses and allow for more efficient power delivery.
In February, Sunnova won a bid to provide 85 MW of aggregated rooftop solar energy into the capacity market auction run by the Independent System Operator-New England. The company bundled thousands of rooftop solar systems to arrive at its bid.
Its commitment priced at nearly $3/kW-mo across the region, and Sunnova estimated the first-year value to be around $2 million, and the gross value across the delivery term to be roughly $38 million.
As an ISO-NE market participant, Sunnova’s residential solar portfolio will offer renewable energy capacity to the regional grid that serves New England. The company will begin participating in June 2024.
Sunnova’s work in New England is part of a growing trend to use distributed energy resources to support the grid and function as a virtual power plant. Comprised entirely of distributed residential energy storage, these plants stabilize the grid, and often eliminate the need for new fossil peaker plants.
Starting in July, Tesla Powerwall owners in California can “opt in” to a virtual power plant program that is being used as a public service during the state’s current power grid challenges. As many as 50,000 Powerwalls are available to create what Tesla claims to be one of the largest distributed battery systems in the world. Most of the Tesla Powerwalls that are installed are 5 kW/13.5 kWh, suggesting a maximum potential capacity of 250 MW/675 MWh.
