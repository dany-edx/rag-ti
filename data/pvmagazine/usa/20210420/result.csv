The initiative involves DOE, the electricity industry, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). It aims to advance actions to confront cyber threats from adversaries that seek to compromise critical systems that are essential to U.S. national and economic security.
“The United States faces a well-documented and increasing cyber threat from malicious actors seeking to disrupt the electricity Americans rely on to power our homes and businesses,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm.
DOE also said that following a 90-day suspension, EO 13920 resumes effect. The Executive Order was signed in May 2020 by President Trump and restricted the import of certain pieces of bulk power system electrical equipment.

The initiative encourages owners and operators to implement measures or technology that enhance their detection, mitigation, and forensic capabilities. It includes milestones over the next 100 days for owners and operators to identify and deploy technologies and systems that enable near real-time situational awareness and response capabilities in critical ICS and operational technology (OT) networks.
It also is intended to reinforce and enhance the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure information technology  networks; and includes a voluntary industry effort to deploy technologies to increase visibility of threats in ICS and OT systems.
DOE also released a new Request for Information (RFI) to seek input from electric utilities, energy companies, academia, research laboratories, government agencies, and other stakeholders to inform future recommendations for supply chain security in U.S. energy systems.
DOE said that comments received in response to the RFI will enable it to “evaluate new executive actions to further secure the nation’s critical infrastructure against malicious cyber activity” and strengthen the domestic manufacturing base. DOE said that it expects utilities to “continue to act in a way that minimizes the risk of installing electric equipment and programmable components that are subject to foreign adversaries’ ownership, control, or influence.”

The pair will keep the candy maker on track to achieve its goal of reducing emissions by more than 50% by 2030.
For the first 20 MW project, set to be constructed in eastern North Carolina, Hershey signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that will enable financing and construction of what will be the company’s first utility-scale solar farm.
The project is being developed by BayWa r.e. and will cut Hersey’s CO2 emission by more than 32,000 metric tons per year. Construction is expected to be completed in late July.
Hershey also signed a PPA with National Grid Renewables for 50 MW at the previously announced Noble Project, currently under construction in Denton County, Texas, north of Dallas. Hershey’s contract will account for around 118,000 MWh per year, creating a reduction of more than 83,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/20/koch-units-sign-on-to-green-hydrogen-project-slated-for-louisiana/,"HYDROGEN,LOUISIANA",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 20, 2021",Koch units sign on to green hydrogen project slated for Louisiana,"Koch Engineered Solutions said that two of its companies, Optimized Process Designs and Koch Project Solutions, will partner with Fidelis Infrastructure to develop the Grön Fuels renewable energy complex in Louisiana.
The $9.2 billion multi-year program will produce green hydrogen, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuels, and bio-plastic feedstocks. The project also includes biogenic carbon capture and sequestration.
The project is expected to produce the equivalent of 1,000 MW of green hydrogen produced by electrolysis, with a pathway to net negative CO2 carbon footprint through the use of biogenic carbon capture and sequestration.
The Koch business units will provide engineering, procurement, and construction expertise, as well as project management services.
A final investment decision is expected in 2021, and will determine the final cost of the project’s first phase.
The project would be built in stages over nine years at a site leased from the deepwater port of Baton Rouge on the Mississippi River. The first phase would involve a capital investment of over $1.25 billion and would produce up to 60,000 barrels per day of low-carbon renewable diesel. Once completed in 2030, the site would be one of the largest renewable fuel complexes in the world., with access to markets in North America and Europe.
Houston-based Fidelis Infrastructure is an asset management firm specializing in renewable energy, low-carbon transportation fuels, sustainable and circular economy infrastructure, and digital infrastructure.
State economic development officials began formal project discussions with Fidelis about the Grön Fuels project in March 2020. The state offered an incentive package that includes a performance-based grant of up to $15 million, payable at up to $2.5 million per year for six years, for project development and infrastructure. The company also is expected to use the state’s Quality Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption programs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/20/gm-and-lg-energy-plan-a-2-3-billion-electric-vehicle-battery-plant/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,TENNESSEE",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 20, 2021",GM and LG Energy plan a $2.3 billion electric vehicle battery plant,"Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture of LG Energy Solution and General Motors, is planning a more than $2.3 billion investment to build a second battery cell manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee.
Ultium Cells will build the new plant on land leased from GM. Construction on the 2.8 million-square-foot facility will begin immediately, and the plant is slated to open in late 2023. Once in service, the plant will supply battery cells to a nearby GM assembly plant.
In March, LG Energy Solution said it planned to invest more than $4.5 billion over the next four years to expand its battery production capacity in the U.S. by 70 GWh. The expansion will give the company a total production capacity of more than 110 GWh in the U.S.
GM’s Ultium battery technology use a large-format, pouch-style cell that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack. This allows engineers to optimize battery energy storage and layout for each vehicle design. Energy options range from 50 to 200 kilowatt hours, which could enable a GM-estimated range up to 450 miles or more on a full charge.
GM’s future Ultium-powered EVs are designed for Level 2 and DC fast charging. Most will have 400V battery packs and up to 200 kW fast charging capability; GM’s truck platform will have 800V battery packs and 350 kW fast charging capability.
In late January, GM said that it planned to become carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040. The company worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop what GM called “a vision of an all-electric future” as well as “an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.”
To reach its goals, GM plans to transition to battery electric vehicles or other zero-emissions vehicle technology, source renewable energy, and leverage “minimal offsets or credits.”
The automaker said at the time that it believes the energy sector is “well on its way to a decarbonized grid” and that an all-electric future will be supported by renewable infrastructure and technology.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/20/sunrise-brief-capital-power-signs-solar-vppa-for-budweiser-brewery/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 20, 2021",Sunrise brief: Capital Power signs solar VPPA for Budweiser brewery,"Alberta-based Capital Power said it signed a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Labatt Breweries of Canada for 51% of the electricity generated by a planned 75 MW solar facility. The Enchant solar project has an estimated development cost of between C$90-$105 million ($72-$84 million).
Around one-quarter of the commitment will be bundled with project-generated renewable energy credits (RECs) directly from the solar facility; the remaining three-quarters will be bundled with RECs sourced elsewhere in Canada.
The solar energy will be used at a Labatt facility that brews Budweiser beer. Construction work on the Enchant solar project is expected to start in the second quarter of 2022 with commercial operations expected by the fourth quarter of 2022.
The deal marks AB InBev’s (Labatt’s parent company’s) 12th VPPA around the world and its first in Canada.
CleanCapital announced a $300 million corporate investment from Manulife Investment Management to grow its portfolio of clean energy assets. The commitment was sourced for the John Hancock Life Insurance balance sheet as well as third party managed accounts.
CleanCapital said it will use the investment to operate solar, new-build solar, and energy storage projects, beginning with two portfolios totaling 63 MW. CleanCapital is buying two solar portfolios and a pipeline of assets that will start construction this year. The first portfolio is a 16 MW operating portfolio comprising 30 solar assets in 10 states.
Additionally, CleanCapital is now sole owner of a second 46.9 MW operating solar portfolio after originally acquiring it through an equity partnership with BlackRock Renewable Power Group in 2018. Made up of of 60 projects, the portfolio has 26 off-takers under long-term power purchase agreements.
CleanCapital’s acquisitions now total more than $775 million. The company manages 200 MW across 152 projects in 18 states.
Mobile energy storage provider Power Edison said it signed a contract with a U.S. utility to deliver a 3 MW, 12 MWh battery energy storage system. Power Edison supplies barge-based batteries to locations where land is at a premium or no available. An initial development pipeline of 500 MWh of capacity is going through final permitting and about to start construction, the company said.
The Grant Cottage State Historic Site in New York is getting all its power from an array of solar panels and is off the commercial power grid.
The $400,000 project included installation of 90 solar panels with a rated output of 34.2 kW, as well as 48 energy storage batteries.
State Parks staff who are trained solar technicians installed the system, which includes a generator for emergency use. Training assistance was provided by staff from nearby Hudson Valley Community College.
Since 2012, 33 solar array projects have been installed at park facilities across New York State. By the end of this year solar is expected to meet about 15% of the department’s total energy consumption. By 2027, the department has a goal of covering half of its electricity needs through renewable energy.
The mountaintop cottage and 43 surrounding acres are the location where President Ulysses S. Grant completed his memoirs shortly before his death in 1885. Published with support from Grant’s friend Mark Twain, the work assured the financial security of his widow, Julia, and their children, and is recognized as an important 19th century work of literature. The memoirs have never been out of print since their original publication.
