Rooftop residential solar can offer homeowners bill savings or price predictability in the long run, and when paired with a battery, offers a value-add of backup power and extreme weather resilience.
Environment America modeled the viable technical potential for rooftop solar in the United States, finding that it can serve 45% of U.S. electricity demand based on 2022 levels. In 2022, rooftop solar generated about 1.5% of the total electricity consumed.
Solar is also now the most cost-effective new generation source in most markets and most conditions in the United States. On average, new-build solar costs 29% less than the next-cheapest fossil fuel alternative, said a report from Ernst and Young.
For homeowners, rooftop solar can represent long-term bill savings and predictability. Environment America said though the initial investment can be substantial, most buyers can expect to break even in about eight to nine years and can expect to save between $20,000 to $96,000 on bills over the 25-year-plus life of the system.
Rooftop solar “has myriad benefits for the environment and consumers,” said Environment America. This includes reducing the need for dirty power plants and expensive transmission lines, providing lower costs, and can help to increase the grid’s resilience to extreme weather and other shocks.
Policy recommendations
Environment America made a series of policy recommendations for states and local governments to help tap the massive potential of U.S. rooftops in a recent report.
First, it recommends that states update their grid interconnection policies to align with best practices. It recommended referencing the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) Model Interconnection Procedures, 2023 edition, to support beneficial interconnection procedures.
For permitting, it recommends cities and counties to establish online automated permitting systems for small onsite solar project. SolarAPP+, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is a free online automated permitting software for local governments. Furthermore, states can support automated permitting by funding technical backup programs for local governments implementing the software, said the report.
Environment America said states can provide support for installation of solar on community buildings, like schools, libraries, and community centers. Nearly one in ten K-12 schools in the U.S. have rooftop solar. Working against its stated climate goals, California enacted a rulemaking decision in 2023 that made it more difficult for schools, renters, and other multi-meter properties to adopt solar.
It also recommended that states adopt policies that enable the creation of virtual power plants (VPP), which lets customers sell electricity from their solar-attached batteries to the grid during times of peak demand. VPPs help customers get a return on their solar investment, and they help squeeze out peak demand reserve natural gas plants, known as peaker plants, that are highly inefficient.
Some states, even ones with massive rooftop solar potential like Florida, do not enable customers to use power purchase agreements (PPA) or other third-party financed solar projects. This shrinks the potential market size, as PPA often offer a no-upfront cost installation, securing a predictable cost of electricity for the long run. PPAs work similarly to leases in their financial structure. Environment America recommends legislating PPA access state law to open a larger market.
A major recommendation from Environment America is the support of clear, long-term rules for net energy metering (NEM). NEM involves customers exporting solar production to the grid in exchange for credit on their utility bill. In California, NEM rates were cut in April 2023 by about 80%. The market has since cratered, with nearly 20,000 jobs lost and numerous installers declaring bankruptcy.
“States should take into account the full benefits of rooftop solar, including present and future climate benefits, land conservation and community resilience benefits, and reduction in the need for new transmission and distribution lines, when determining how solar power owners should be compensated for the electricity they supply to the grid,” said Environment America.
The organization said states sure ensure consistent and predictable compensation for the lifetime of a solar investment. Overly complex metering and compensation systems that change frequently lower consumer confidence and adoption. It also suggested utilities should not assess discriminatory fees on rooftop solar customers.
“Utilities must honor commitments they made to customers who installed solar panels in past years regarding how much they would be paid for solar energy they supply to the grid,” said the report.
Finally, Environment America suggests states should ensure access to rooftop solar for renters and in low-income communities. This would include supporting virtual net metering programs and community solar programs.
California has recently worked in direct contrast to these recommendations, damaging both virtual net metering and community solar efforts in its state, despite claims from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that it is concerned about equity in solar adoption.

Researching the complex financial and technical aspects of solar projects for numerous multi-unit buildings can be a heavy lift for an already stretched housing agency staff. The program seeks to address this issue by acting as a guiding force through the decision-making process.
The program, administered by Boston branch of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), Resonant Energy, and the Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations (MACDC), has analyzed the portfolios of 44 affordable housing providers, encompassing more than 1,700 buildings.
Through its first three phases, affordable housing providers have installed or committed to a cumulative 7.9 MW of solar across nearly 200 rooftops. The projects represent more than $30 million in lifetime savings for the housing owners and reduce carbon emissions equivalent to taking 1,400 cars off the road.
One of the major hurdles in developing solar for housing authorities is the review and consent process with leaders and investors. STAR organizers worked directly with these parties, providing staff time and guidance to streamline the process.
“Without the expert assistance and flexible financing options through the STAR program, a shift of this magnitude would have been extremely difficult for us,” said Rafael Mares, executive director of The Neighborhood Developers (TND).
The STAR program supports housing providers in filing for tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act. Last fall, Resonant Energy helped clients submit 102 applications to the Department of Energy, representing $7.4 million in tax credit support if all are approved. Resonant Energy report that thus far, 68 of the 102 applications have been approved.
“2024 stands to be a watershed moment for solar and affordable housing,” said Isaac Baker, co-chief executive officer of Resonant Energy. “New state and federal resources are being rolled out that prioritize solar for affordable housing, making it easier for housing organizations to afford the upfront cost of solar and unlock meaningful savings for both the buildings’ and residents’ budgets.”
Statewide, Massachusetts applied for $250 million in funding from the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar For All program. About $65 million of the total is earmarked for affordable housing communities.
The EPA is expected to announce award decisions in March 2024. If the state is awarded, agencies will implement the funds in the following months.
The STAR program is financially supported from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s (MassCEC) EmPower Massachusetts Program, the Jampart Charitable Trust, and the Lauenstein Family Fund.
Phase four participating organizations included:
● Cambridge Housing Authority (CHA)
● Commonwealth Land Trust (CLT)
● HallKeen Management
● Harborlight Homes
● Mission Hill Neighborhood Housing Services (MHNHS)
● Peabody Properties
● Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH)
● Rural Development, Inc. (RDI)

The ground-mount, tracker-based project is built on 12 acres adjacent to the Vitesco Technologies’ manufacturing facility, where the company makes drive systems and electrification solutions for sustainable mobility.
Through the power purchase agreement, Big Sun Solar is the developer, owner and operator and Vitesco Technologies purchases the electricity from GVEC.
The 2.6 MW project is expected to generate roughly 4,800 MW/h per year with 4,800 Jinko Eagle 545 W solar modules mounted on Array Technologies DuraTrack HZ v3 trackers. The site will use 16 SMA Sunny Highpower Peak3 125kW inverters.
Now operational, the solar plant is expected to produce enough electricity to cover about 13% of the company’s annual energy consumption at the Seguin facility, or the equivalent of powering 330 Texas homes.
“Powering clean mobility is our mission, and that certainly includes taking responsible actions supporting our manufacturing processes to reduce the environmental effects of the automotive industry,” said Dr. Hans-Juergen Braun, global head of operations for Vitesco Technologies.
“This solar energy project owes its success to the dedication and vision of our team in Seguin as well as our partners with Big Sun and the GVEC,” said Hans-Juergen Braun. “These initiatives and opportunities are driving our global footprint toward success and growth not only benefitting our company, but also our employees, shareholders, business partners and world as a whole.”
Vitesco Technologies and Big Sun Solar report that they are currently discussing opportunities to implement additional sustainable energy projects at the facility.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/07/a-look-at-the-great-transformer-shortage-affecting-u-s-utilities/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-03-07,A look at the great transformer shortage affecting U.S. utilities,"As the clean energy buildout continues to grow, one of the challenges looming over the industry is shortages and price increases in the global transformer market. National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) researchers produced the report, Major Drivers of Long-Term Distribution Transformer Demand, in order to quantify the long-term demand for distribution transformers.
“Distribution transformers are a bedrock component of our energy infrastructure,” National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researcher Killian McKenna said. “But utilities needing to add or replace them are currently facing high prices and long wait times due to supply chain shortages. This has the potential to affect energy accessibility, reliability, affordability—everything.”
Reasons given for the shortages and price spikes include increased raw material demand, pandemic-related shortages and backlogs, labor constraints, shipping issues, and geopolitical tensions. In some parts of the world, the shortages are acute.
Transformers are a necessary piece of the energy puzzle, as they manage the flow of electricity along the power grid by changing high-voltage electricity from transmission lines into low-voltage electricity before it reaches consumers.
“A lot of factors can drive the demand for transformers, which makes long-term forecasting especially challenging,” McKenna said. “For instance, load growth from electrification of buildings and transportation, increased frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events, and the need to modernize aging electrical infrastructure can all impact the future demand for transformers.”
The NREL team is the first to quantify the number, capacity, age, and use of the nation’s current transformer stock. This was no small feat, as the nation’s transformers are owned by over 3,000 municipal, cooperative, and investor-owned utilities. About 20% of transformer capacity is privately owned by large commercial and industrial customers, according to the report authors.
The study found that utilities are experiencing extended lead times for transformers of up to two years (a fourfold increase on pre-2022 lead times) and reporting price increases by as much as four to nine times in the past 3 years.
According to the researchers, the increased demand is due to increased electrification, increased clean energy going to the grid as well as an aging electric infrastructure that needs replacement. Preliminary analysis estimates that overall stock capacity needs to grow 160% to 260% by 2050, compared to 2021 levels to meet increasing energy demands across residential, commercial, industrial and transportation sectors.
The Code of Federal Regulations defines distribution transformers as those that have an input voltage of 34.5 kV or less, an output voltage of 600 V or less, and a capacity of 10–2,500 kVA. For this study the researchers examined transformers up to 5,000 kVA because of the trend of increasing capacities due to electrification and also because of pending revisions in proposed rules. The authors state that they “loosely interpret input and output voltages, given the trend of bidirectional power flow due to distributed energy resources (in particular, solar photovoltaics).”
They also consider step-up transformers, used for renewable energy resources and most battery chains, and manufacturers as distribution transformers. Step-up transformers are used to convert low-voltage electrical generation into high-voltage electricity for long-distance transmission. The demand for these will grow as they are needed to integrate wind and solar farms onto the power grid by adjusting voltages, improving efficiency, and enhancing grid reliability.
Overall, they expect the type of transformers utilities will require is expected to change. Larger transformer sizes will be needed and pad-mount, dry-type, and submersible transformer demand will also increase demand for larger transformer sizes is expected to increase due to electrification. Enhanced reliability and resilience will increase the demand for pad-mount, dry-type, and submersible transformers. As previously mentioned, step-up transformer demand will also increase—all of which will put increased pressure on transformer manufacturing.
The analysis is based on estimating the peak demand that would need to be met by distribution transformers, which considers the increased electricity demand across the economy from scenarios outlined in NREL’s Electrification Futures Study.

The insights gained from this work will help stakeholders better understand load metrics, including how an increased electrification scenario affects peak electricity demand, which will enable better distribution planning.
Seven trade groups, for example, have called for $1.2 billion in federal funding to help manufacturers of distribution transformers boost their production capacity, in a letter to U.S. Senate leadership. The letter states that “robust” domestic production of distribution transformers will help ensure a reliable U.S. grid, while also reducing dependence on importing products from overseas.
“The administration is focused on the importance of distribution transformers and other critical components to the reliability of our nation’s power grid,” said Gil Bindewald, principal deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Electricity. “We are grateful for the strong collaboration between all stakeholders that has occurred to-date and hopeful that this cutting-edge analysis will serve as a catalytical foundation to inform impactful solutions that ensure America can meet its emerging energy needs.”
The researchers concluded that demand modeling is critical to gaining a realistic understanding of future utility requirements. The NREL team said it will continue to work with the Office of Electricity and Office of Policy to refine their analysis to help the industry come to consensus on projected transformer demand.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/07/first-solar-unit-achieves-world-record-cigs-solar-efficiency-of-23-64/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-07,First Solar unit achieves world record CIGS solar efficiency of 23.64%,"From pv magazine Global
Swedish PV manufacturer First Solar European Technology Center AB, a unit of US-based thin-film solar module producer First Solar, and Uppsala University have presented a new solar cell based on copper, indium, gallium and diselenide (CIGS) technology.
The First Solar European Technology Center was formerly known as Evolar, a company founded in 2019 from now-insolvent CIGS thin-film manufacturer Solibro. It was then acquired by First Solar in May 2023. The company focuses on developing solutions, including manufacturing equipment, to commercialize tandem solar technology with perovskite thin films.
The new solar cell achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 23.75% and a certified efficiency of 23.64%, thus beating the previous world record of 23.35% achieved in 2019 by Japan’s Solar Frontier. Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) confirmed the result.
“We achieved this by combining four different approaches,” the research’s lead author, Jan Keller, told pv magazine. “We added a relatively high concentration of silver to the absorber and implemented a ‘hockey stick’-like gallium (Ga) depth profile. Furthermore, we tailored a rubidium fluoride (RbF) post-deposition treatment (PDT) to the absorber composition and subjected the absorber to extended illumination.”
These processes, according to the research team, were able to improve the microstructure, reduce the defect density and mitigate band gap fluctuations, passivate the absorber surface and increase the doping density. “Overall, this led to a reduced open-circuit voltage deficit, resulting in a high external radiative efficiency of 1.6%,” Keller added.
Presented in the study “High-concentration silver alloying and steep back-contact gallium grading enabling copper indium gallium selenide solar cell with 23.6% efficiency,” which was recently published in nature Energy, the cell was built with a glass substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo), sodium fluoride (NaF) layer, the CIGS absorber, the RbF layer, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO), an aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) film, and an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2).
The scientists explained that they used a relatively high amount of silver in the absorber and placed a ‘hockey stick ’-like gallium profile with a high Ga concentration close to the Mo back contact and a lower, constant concentration in the region closer to the CdS buffer layer. They also applied a standard RbF post-deposition treatment (PDT), which they said allowed to reduce the thickness of the CdS buffer layer to 25 nm.
“Our study demonstrates that CIGS thin-film technology is a competitive alternative as a stand-alone solar cell. The technology also has properties that can function in other contexts, such as the bottom cell of a tandem solar cell,” the research team said.
Looking forward, the scientists said they could raise the cell efficiency to over 25%. This should be achieved by avoiding parasitic absorption in the window and buffer layers, while maintaining the same open-circuit voltage and fill factor levels.  “To go beyond this level, the absorber quality has to be further improved and external radiative efficiency (ERE) values much higher than 1.6% need to be realized to further reduce the open-circuit voltage deficit and the ideality factor,” they concluded.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/07/bloom-energy-teams-up-with-shell-to-look-at-large-scale-hydrogen-projects/,"HYDROGEN,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,2024-03-07,Bloom Energy teams up with Shell to look at large-scale hydrogen projects,"Bloom Energy is going to be working with oil and gas company Shell to study how the former’s proprietary hydrogen electrolyzer technology could offer decarbonization solutions. 
The two companies are aiming to develop replicable, large-scale solid oxide electrolyzer systems to generate hydrogen that will then be used by Shell – a technology that “could represent a potentially transformative moment for opportunities to decarbonize several hard to abate industry sectors,” according to K. R. Sridhar, founder, chairman, and CEO of Bloom Energy.
“Green” hydrogen is generally defined as hydrogen produced using renewable energy and water electrolysis technology, as opposed to other forms of hydrogen that are derived from fossil fuels. 
Bloom’s electrolyzers are manufactured in California and Delaware, and can be used for many industrial applications, such as refineries, ammonia, steel processing and cement plants, Rick Beuttel, the company’s vice president, hydrogen business, told pv magazine USA. 
“Currently in the United States, the industrial sector contributes a significant amount of carbon emissions. They need innovative new technologies to help them decarbonize some of their processes, where electrification is not readily available or even feasible,” Beuttel said. 
That’s where green hydrogen could come in. The American green hydrogen industry has seen strong policy support this year, due to its role in providing long-duration energy storage capabilities as well as potentially decarbonizing industries that would be hard to electrify. A report from the Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress released last June took a closer look at the potential of green hydrogen to meet the demands of heavy industry, and found global market milestones of $642 billion by 2030 and $1.4 trillion by 2050.
However, green hydrogen production is expensive, said Beuttel, and government policies and  regulations help to enable the green hydrogen market and drive down production costs to provide solid business cases for companies to make investment decisions in green hydrogen projects.
In this context, Beuttel noted that Bloom Energy’s technology is 15% to 30% more efficient than competing, low-temperature technologies – and with electricity accounting for around 70% of the cost of producing green hydrogen, “solid oxide technology will make a meaningful improvement in driving down the cost of green hydrogen and helping to decarbonize heavy industry, transportation, and produce the liquid fuels of the future with no carbon footprint,” he said. 
Scaling up electrolyzer capacity will be a key part of growing the green hydrogen industry in the U.S.; a large chunk of electrolyzer production is currently outsourced to manufacturers overseas, experts say, and one of the key challenges to bringing more of that manufacturing capacity back to the U.S. is finding the capital needed to build infrastructure. 
Last May, Bloom Energy launched the world’s largest solid oxide electrolyzer installation at a research facility in California, a unit that the company says produces up to 25% more hydrogen per megawatt than other commercially demonstrated, lower temperature electrolyzers. The 4 MW electrolyzer system was installed and brought online in two months, and has the capability to produce over 2.4 metric tons per day of hydrogen.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/07/array-academy-offers-field-services-and-customized-training-for-utility-scale-solar-workforce/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES",,2024-03-07,Array Academy offers field services and customized training for utility-scale solar workforce,"The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts employment of solar photovoltaic installers will grow 22% between 2022 and 2032. With two-thirds of U.S. solar jobs at installation and project development firms, the industry’s success trajectory rests on the shoulders of this workforce.
A well-trained solar installation workforce is crucial to the health of the solar industry. Technical expertise and understanding are essential for this field, but in-depth training has been lacking.
The U.S. Department of Energy states, “Deploying safe, reliable solar energy systems requires a skilled workforce that is properly trained to design and install these technologies.”
In response to the growing need for industry workers, Array Technologies has announced that it now offers a dedicated training academy with both classroom and hands-on learning opportunities. Array Field Services and Customer Training courses cover field installation and commissioning, as well as operation and maintenance (O&M) best practices.
The company says solar installers can work more coherently when they understand how the entire utility-scale solar process flows. Sites that avoid stalled progress due to repeat work or repairs become profitable and sustainable quicker.
Solar developers, engineering, procurement, and construction contractors (EPCs), and O&M professionals stand to lose significantly when using unskilled installers.
For profitability and public perception, it’s essential for site developers, EPCs, and O&M partners to ensure their investments perform. Improper training puts installers at risk of poor professional reputation, loss of work, or even injury or death.
Proper training and certification ensure installers have crucial knowledge about complex electrical systems, massive component configurations, and an understanding of safety regulations.
Installers who go through Array Academy’s programs can earn up to eight credits toward certification from the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). A highly respected organization in renewable energy, NABCEP offers certification that boosts industry knowledge, validates technical skills, and increases earning potential for installers.
With both remote and in-person training options, installers can engage with Array’s training programs in a way that works best for them.
The company says that while many installers have traditionally learned on the job, the Array Academy is a way to learn essential skills and regulations in practice settings. According to the manufacturer, the hands-on training allows a real-world understanding of processes and safety regulations before any real-world investment dollars or human welfare is at stake.
