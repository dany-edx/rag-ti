The 3.1 MW installation was built by New Jersey developer Soltage, and will power up to 700 households with clean energy, dedicating 55% of its capacity to low- and moderate-income (LMI) subscribers.
The Community Solar Energy Pilot Program is administered by New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program. NJBPU is in the process of reviewing 410 applications submitted for Year 2 of the Pilot Program, with the expectation of awarding capacity later this year. Year 2 has allocated 150 MW of award capacity, including a 40% reservation for projects serving LMI households.
In the first year of the pilot, regulators awarded slightly more than the allocated 75 MW, with 78 MW across 45 projects being approved. The program also made strides in increasing community solar access to LMI customers: 100% of the approved projects reserved at least 51% of their capacity for those customers.
Changes to the program between years one and two mainly focus on easing enrollment; namely, simplifying the rules used to verify which customers qualify as low- and moderate-income residents. Developers no longer have to obtain potential subscribers’ two previous years of federal tax returns.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/14/solar-101-whats-my-solar-system-going-to-cost/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 14, 2021",Solar 101: What’s my solar system going to cost?,"Previous articles in this series examined how a roof’s age and physical characteristics, latitude, and local weather affect the design and payback of a solar system. And we discussed considerations in choosing a solar contractor. Whether you’re new to solar or simply looking to review the fundamentals, this series offers essential information and perspective to help you choose the best hardware and contractor.
Now we consider how much your prospective solar system will really cost. We’re not quite finished discussing hardware or construction, but since we just finished discussing how to find and evaluate your solar contractor, this is a good time to sojourn into pricing.
So, how much might your solar power system cost? Think of it this way: every solar system is actually a custom retrofit. The list of unique variables and components is quite long, and hardware requirements may result in a significant pricing variance.
However, we can offer you a solid guide based on averages collected from hundreds of thousands of installations across the United States. This cost data is provided via two government research lab reports.
The first report, by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) National Renewable Laboratory (NREL), describes the costs of a solar project from the bottom up. This means that researchers have found the cost of every component, all the engineering and applications, plus labor. And from this data they assembled this alluring chart, clearly illustrating the aforementioned prices.
As you can see, the solar module (panel) price typically represents the majority of hardware expenses. Solar panel choice is the one major item you ought to be conscious of, especially since some high-performance panels can cost twice the base price shown in this chart.
Recent increases in labor costs and many commodities around the world, including solar panels), have widened variances of component costs.
Second, this report from the Electricity Markets & Policy (EMP) team at DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory looks at third-party data, reporting the real costs of the solar they built.

While the first report by NREL shows a base price of exactly 41¢/watt for solar panels, we can be sure that many buyers are choosing premium residential solar panels that sometimes cost twice that base price.
Another nuance to consider is how pricing varies based upon the state you’re in. For instance, states like Massachusetts and Rhode Island have heavy electrical experience requirements for rooftop workers, pushing labor prices higher. Places like Texas and Florida, where contractor licensing laws are more lax, result in less costly installation teams.
Also, note that the pricing in the above chart is the median pricing, and that there are massive volumes of solar installations equally on either side of that.
One final note – plenty of research suggests that getting a few quotes is the best way to get a reasonable price. Make sure to read our prior article on finding and vetting a contractor to make sure you get those numbers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/14/minnesota-is-primed-to-turn-a-page-on-the-conflict-between-solar-growth-and-farmland-preservation/,"GUEST POST,LEGAL,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,MINNESOTA",,"MAY 14, 2021",Minnesota is primed to turn a page on the conflict between solar growth and farmland preservation,"Successfully building a solar facility on a given site is no small feat.
Even before confronting the complexities of off-take, equipment procurement, and financing, a solar developer needs to find a good site on buildable land that avoids adverse impacts to wetlands, critical species habitat, or archaeological or cultural resources. It needs to be able to interconnect to the transmission or distribution grid without budget-busting upgrades or queues fraught with lengthy delays (both of which are in increasingly short supply).
It needs the support of participating landowners, the local community, and the permitting regime. And, of course, it helps to have good solar insolation.
In addition, solar developers in the Midwest are also confronted by agricultural preservation goals.
We have in the past pondered if, how, and when midwestern states would reckon with the tension between renewable energy development and agricultural preservation rules and programs.
With the next wave of solar development on the near-term horizon based on the gigawatts of solar planned within the decade, it appears that Minnesota may be on the verge of encouraging the significant co-benefits of solar done well.
Legislation currently under consideration in the Minnesota legislature would, if passed into law, require the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to enter into expedited rulemaking to amend a long-standing state siting rule. That rule prohibits permitting a large electric power generating plant where more than 0.5 acres of prime farmland would be used per megawatt of capacity, unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative (Minnesota Administrative Rules 7850.4400, subp. 4, the “Prime Farmland Rule”).
The Prime Farmland Rule stems from a growing concern in the late-1970s and early-1980s over the permanent impacts to cropland from siting conventional generation facilities and their associated rail spurs, coal piles, waste storage, buildings, and transmission substations. Solar development, which has a relatively broad but low-intensity landscape footprint, was far from sight at the time and wouldn’t materialize in the state for several decades.
Fast forward to 2013 when the Solar Energy Jobs Act was passed into law setting solar standards and goals for the state, and a few larger solar projects began working their way through the Commission’s permitting process only to run immediately into the Prime Farmland Rule.
A developer proposing a 62.25 MW project on a site near Marshall, Minnesota, included nearly 400 acres of prime farmland (of different classifications), many times the Prime Farmland Rule of no more than 0.5 acres per MW of generation. Ultimately, the Commission permitted the facility via an exception to the rule by determining there was no feasible and prudent alternative.
In part, any similarly sized project within 50 miles of the proposed interconnecting substation would require the same use of prime farmland. Recognizing the inevitability that the expansion of solar development will continue to be in conflict with the Prime Farmland Rule, the Minnesota Department of Commerce issued guidance for developers in 2020 on how to make their case for a similar exception to the Prime Farmland Rule.
The reason solar needs to coexist with farmland in Minnesota is multifaceted and gets at the heart of how to put the state’s diverse land resources to their highest and best use.

Minnesota is bisected by a swath of tallgrass aspen or deciduous forest running from the northwest to the southeast, with coniferous forest to the northeast, and prairie grasslands to the south and west. The state’s best renewable resources and prime farmland resources largely follow similar outlines with little overlap with the coniferous forest in the northeast and significant overlap with the prairie and deciduous savannas of the south and west.
This region is also home to the vast majority of Xcel Energy’s service territory and the highest population density regions in the state, including the Twin Cities at the eastern most edge of the deciduous savanna. As a result, the bottom half of the state is designed to force a conversation about whether solar and farmland preservation can co-habitate in the south and west to serve the load to the east.
This also happens to be the region of the state that has been serving as the state’s growing laboratory for “agrivoltaics,” with approximately 800 MW worth of community solar generating capacity installed to date.
While solar developers and local communities have been experimenting with pollinator-friendly plantings at such solar sites for several years now (and notably since the voluntary pollinator pledge was signed into state law in 2016), as of this past April more than 50 solar sites were listed as meeting the standards of Minnesota’s Habitat Friendly Solar Program administered by the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has begun studying the array of co-benefits of pollinator-friendly plantings with solar projects in a handful of leading states like Minnesota. The research tracks the increases in pollinator populations, production benefits to surrounding farms due to such pollinator increases, the energy production boost due to the added efficiency from the cooling effect of the shade and evaporation from native vegetation, and benefits to water and soils. And, increasingly, solar developments in the state that have been thoughtfully planted are also paired with sheep grazing and/or honey production.
Legislation included in the Minnesota legislature in HF 1031, the omnibus commerce bill, recognizes the need for an update in recognizing the different impacts modern energy development practices can have on our natural and farmland resources. It aims to turn the conflict created by old rules that presume energy generation and farmland preservation cannot coexist on its head in favor of encouraging the co-benefits available to solar development, which, if done right, can facilitate long-term soil, water, agricultural, and ecosystem health.
The bill would require the Public Utilities Commission to amend the Prime Farmland Rule to allow the siting of a solar project on prime farmland as long as the project helps preserve sensitive groundwater; establishes perennial vegetation and foraging habitat beneficial to game birds, songbirds, and pollinators; or is co-located with and does not disrupt an agricultural use such as grazing or harvesting forage. If promulgated, such a rule would remove a significant hurdle to the development of utility scale solar projects in Minnesota and allow the state to turn a problem for renewable energy development into an opportunity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/14/sunrise-brief-starbucks-backed-community-solar-is-serving-up-energy-in-new-york-state/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 14, 2021",Sunrise brief: Starbucks-backed community solar is serving up energy in New York State,"The next skinny latte you order at a Starbucks in New York State may come with an extra helping of solar. That’s because the first six of up to 23 community solar projects entered service in the Empire State under a multi-year $97 million tax equity facility with the coffee retailer.
The projects are expected to supply solar energy for local Starbucks stores and up to 24,000 households, small businesses, nonprofits, churches, universities, and stores in multiple locations, including those designated as under-served communities. Program participants will receive a discount to their current electricity rates under the state’s Community Distributed Generation program.
The solar projects are intended to provide more than 119,885 MWh of energy to the coffee retailer. Starbucks provided financing in collaboration with community solar owner Generate and financial services company Churchill Stateside Group. The firm 38 Degrees North worked with Generate on both the projects and  the financing.
Starbucks made the investment through a fund established by Churchill Stateside. The retailer will receive renewable energy credits from the projects, which are expected to offset more than 70% of Starbucks electricity use within the state. The total portfolio will include 90 MW of capacity. About 24 MW is now in service.
Upcoming research from the Energy Department’s Berkeley Lab finds a growing logjam of solar energy projects in transmission interconnection queues managed by regional grid operators. The research found nearly 750 GW of generation and an estimated 200 GW of storage capacity in interconnection queues at the end of 2020.
Solar (462 GW) accounted for a large – and growing – share of generator capacity in the queues. Substantial wind (209 GW) capacity is also in development, 29% of which is for offshore projects (61 GW).
(Read “Interconnection is broken: Radical rethinking is needed to achieve clean energy goals.“)
In total, about 680 GW of zero-carbon capacity was seeking transmission access, as was 74 GW of natural gas capacity. The report said that hybrids now make up a large – and growing – share of proposed projects, particularly in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and the non-ISO West. The report said that 159 GW of solar hybrids (primarily solar+battery) and 13 GW of wind hybrids are currently waiting in the queues.
The report compiled and analyzed data from all seven ISOs/RTOs in concert with 35 non-ISO utilities, representing an estimated 85% of all U.S. electricity load. The report included all “active” projects in these generation interconnection queues through the end of 2020, as well as data on “completed” and “withdrawn” projects for five of the ISOs (CAISO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO, and PJM).
The repot said that much of this proposed capacity ultimately may not be built. It said that only 24% of the projects seeking connection from 2000 to 2015 have been built. Completion percentages appear to be declining, and are “even lower” for solar and wind than other resources. Additionally, wait times are on the rise. In four ISOs, the typical wait time from connection request to commercial operation grew from around 1.9 years for projects built in 2000-2009 to 3.5 years for those built in 2010-2020.
EnergySage released its semi-annual Solar Marketplace Intel Report, which found that solar prices in the second half of 2020 experienced their largest drop since 2017. Quoted solar prices tracked by EnergySage fell by 3.5% between H1 2020 and H2 2020. It said the percent of quotes below $2.50 per watt nearly doubled between the first and second half of the year.
Installers also are quoting the newest equipment, the report said. While two-thirds of quotes included sub-330-watt panels in H2 2019, the same 330 W–and larger–panels accounted for 69% of all quotes in H2 2020.
In addition, LG Energy Solutions overtook Tesla as the most quoted storage brand during the fourth quarter. The report said that nearly 40% of quotes on EnergySage included LG Energy Solutions, making it the most quoted storage brand. Tesla remained the least expensive storage option quoted. Batteries that use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry were quoted at much higher prices than batteries with nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) chemistry.
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is putting the final touches on its 12.3 MW Solar Farm 2.0, as planting is underway for the farm’s pollinator habitat. The project is the second solar farm constructed at the U of I and achieves clean energy sustainability goals outlined in the university’s Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) nearly four years ahead of schedule. Clean energy production will now support around 12% of the school’s annual electricity demand.

Solar Farm 2.0 was developed by national solar energy firm Sol Systems and includes bifacial solar modules, single-axis trackers, and zero-waste construction practices. Sol Systems will manage the asset through the 20-year term of the fixed-price power purchase agreement with the university.
The array was first energized in late January, and has since produced over 4,000 MWh. On May 1, the solar farm provided its largest output of 102 MWh. Along with other solar arrays on campus, the Urbana campus is now generating around 27,000 MWh/year, ranking the university third among U.S. universities in onsite clean power production.
Sol Systems partnered with South Bend, Indiana-based Inovateus Solar, which constructed the solar arrays. Inovateus used reduced-waste construction practices that prevented as much as 45 tons of materials from reaching landfills. Inovateus worked with F&S Waste Management to recycle nearly 94% of the project’s construction packaging, plastics, wood pallets, and other refuse.
