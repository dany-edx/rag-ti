Now that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been passed, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie have lifted the forecast for solar deployment by 40% above prior projections through 2027.
According to the two organizations in the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 2022, installed and operational solar capacity may increase threefold in five short years, skyrocketing from 129 GW today to 335 GW by 2027.
Despite this rapid growth, projections for this year have been trimmed to 15.7 GW due to lingering effects of the Department of Commerce’s investigation into antidumping violations by major international solar panel providers. Ongoing international trade and labor concerns, including the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) may continue to challenge supply and limit deployment in 2023. Full benefits of the IRA may not be reflected in deployment until 2024 at earliest, said the report.
Solar accounted for 39% of all new electric generating capacity additions in the first half of 2022. The U.S. solar market now represents about 4.5% of the nation’s electricity mix. Perhaps the most significant development in the Inflation Reduction Act for the solar industry was the long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) at 30%.
“The Inflation Reduction Act has given the solar industry the most long-term certainty it has ever had,” said Michelle Davis, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “Ten years of investment tax credits stands in stark contrast to the one-, two-, or five-year extensions that the industry has experienced in the last decade. It’s not an overstatement to say that the IRA will lead to a new era for the U.S. solar industry.”
For the fifth quarter in a row, residential solar had record deployment with 1.36 GW installed, a 37% increase over Q2 2021. This represents nearly 180,000 residential customers installing solar in one quarter. The report said customer demand was strong due in part to power outages and to power price increases. Residential solar installations may drop slightly next year as California’s NEM 3.0 policy takes effect.
Commercial solar installed 336 MW in Q2, down 7% year-over-year, while 2.7 GW of utility-scale solar was deployed in Q2, a 25% decrease from Q2 2021. The extension and expansion of the ITC and other provisions in the IRA boosted Wood Mackenzie’s five-year outlook by 52 GW (47%) over previous projections.
Community solar deployment projects were lifted by 18% compared to the previous outlook. President Biden’s Executive Order has brought relief to the industry, but most of the additions come from Maine and New York. The two states accounted for 72% of the community solar capacity additions in the first half of 2022. In Maine, Net Energy Billing (NEB) projects that are not wrapped up in the state’s interconnection studies are coming online at a fast pace. In New York, Community Adder projects continue to come online, with a healthy pipeline remaining.
System prices continued to climb in Q2 2022 across market segments, mostly due to module price increases. System pricing increased year-over-year by 9% for residential, 8% for commercial, 8% for utility fixed-tilt, and 13% for utility single-axis tracking solar projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/09/yaskawa-solectria-solar-inverters-to-be-optimized-for-first-solar-thin-film-modules/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",Yaskawa Solectria Solar inverters to be optimized for First Solar thin film modules,"Lawrence, Massachusetts’ Yaskawa Solectria Solar (Solectria) is among the few US-based manufacturers of solar inverters. Only Chilicon Power, which builds microinverters, Alencon, which provides power optimizers, and Generac, which acquired Pika Energy to deliver hybrid inverters, can claim the Made-in-USA designation.
Solectria has formed a partnership with a prominent player in the U.S. manufacturing market: First Solar. The two are working together to optimize the Solectria XGI 1500-250 utility-scale string inverter for First Solar’s thin film cadmium telluride solar modules.
The goal of the partnership is to create a version of the new XGI 1500-250 utility-scale string inverter that allows a grounded DC input, and thereby ensures optimal integration with First Solar’s Series 6 and Series 7 modules. 
“We expect that Solectria’s new inverter design in combination with First Solar’s module technology will help asset owners and operators further enhance the LCOE of their solar installations,” said Alex Kamerer, Manager, Product Management, First Solar. “This effort represents the best of American solar, bringing together leading US-developed photovoltaic technology with US-developed inverter technology to deliver an optimized solution for US solar assets.”
First Solar said its modules are lower-carbon alternatives to traditional crystalline silicon panels. The company also has a robust end-of-life and recycling program it developed in-house.
The SOLECTRIA XGI 1500 inverters are Made in the USA with global components at the Yaskawa America factory in Buffalo Grove, Illinois and are the only PV inverters designed and manufactured in the USA and are Buy America Act (BAA) compliant 
The partnership may prove attractive to developers who are looking to make the most of the incentives within the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition to the 30% investment tax credit, there is a 10% credit adder for projects that use domestically produced hardware. 
To qualify for the 10% credit adder, 100% of steel and iron must be manufactured in the United States. For manufactured goods – like solar panels, inverters, and electrical gear – the goods must initially be 40% U.S. manufactured, though this percentage will increase in the future. 
Historically, for goods to be classified as Made in the USA, they must be composed of at least 55% domestic content. The bill lists some exceptions to these requirements. Items that are not of satisfactory quality, or are not produced in sufficient quantities, may be imported. Items that would increase the project cost by greater than 25% may be sourced outside the US as well. These requirements, and exceptions, will apply to all project sizes. 
Yaskawa Solectria Solar is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yaskawa America, Inc. and the largest inverter manufacturer based in the USA, with headquarters in Lawrence, MA, and world-class production facilities in Buffalo Grove, IL and Oak Creek, WI. Solectria’s products include inverters ranging from 25kW to 250kW, string combiners and web-based monitoring for all size solar systems. 
“At Yaskawa Solectria Solar we aim to strengthen our position as leaders in technology and to build on the proven technology of our XGI 1500 inverters. Both companies have US-based design and manufacturing, and this partnership brings together our engineering teams and industry-leading technology at just the right time. We have very exciting opportunities ahead working closely with First Solar” said Miles C. Russell, Director of Product Management at Yaskawa Solectria Solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/09/transparent-solar-glass-to-debut-at-re-in-anaheim/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,OHIO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",Transparent solar glass to debut at RE+ in Anaheim,"Toledo Solar’s new see-through solar glass will be on display in booth #3674 at RE+ in Anaheim, Calif. from Sept. 19 through Sept. 22.
 “This is a pivotal moment for renewable energy as urgent climate change realities, unpredictable energy prices, and long-term sustainability are all on the line, ” said Aaron Bates, the founder of Toledo Solar. “We are excited to showcase our sustainable, accessible solar technology to the world’s largest, most influential solar audience.”
The solar glass is not the first unique innovation to come out of Toledo’s factory. The company is the first residential thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar panel manufacturer in the United States. It’s also currently developing solar modules with a glass-enameled steel back, rather than the traditional glass sheet. The company received a $200,000 Phase I federal Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the Department of Energy for the research and development of these lighter, steel-backed solar panels
Toledo Solar has been instrumental in the development of the Cadmium Telluride Accelerator Consortium, which was formed to work toward making continued cost and efficiency improvements that will make CdTe more competitive on the global market. Toledo, Ohio is a hub of CdTe manufacturing due to the CdTe research taking place at the University of Toledo’s Wright Center for Photovoltaic Innovation and Commercialization.
Aaron Bates, the founder of Toledo Solar, told pv magazine USA that the technology has grown from a small fraction of solar projects to the dominant source of modules in utility-scale projects. And with the utility-scale sector making up 55% of solar installs in the US, CdTe is well established in the clean energy industry. According to Bates, there are many reasons to support CdTe and US-made solar, including technological advantages, bankability, recyclability, supply chain stability, improved labor practices, and more.
CdTe solar cells were first developed in the United States and make up about 20% of the market for solar modules. The Consortium intends to spur technological advancements in CdTe manufacturing that will help increase America’s competitiveness, bolster domestic innovation, and support clean electricity deployment supporting President Biden’s goal of achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/09/ameresco-solar-plus-storage-installation-increases-resiliency-on-u-s-military-base/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,NEW JERSEY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",Ameresco solar-plus-storage installation increases resiliency on U.S. military base,"Ameresco, a cleantech integrator, is partnering with Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) in New Jersey on a $140 million infrastructure and energy resilience project. As part of the federal government’s Climate Smart Building Initiative, the energy project will include a 32 MW solar facility with a 2 MW/ 4 MWh battery energy storage system. Energy savings steps are also being taken, including the installation of 90,000 smart LED light fixture retrofits.
Ameresco has served as an energy services provider to JBMDL for more than a decade, completing an initial project in 2012 and supporting operations and maintenance (O&M) on the systems since their completion. This latest installation and upgrades are Phase 2 of the project. The 32 MW solar installation is the largest that Ameresco has installed at a federal site. It is paired with a battery energy storage system (BESS), which will be integrated with backup generation assets within the microgrid. The goal of the project is to ensure that the base has access to uninterrupted power to support its critical missions.
“We are incredibly excited to expand our already robust partnership with the team at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst,” said Nicole Bulgarino, executive vice president of Federal Solutions at Ameresco. “We’re eager to get started on the integration of advanced clean technologies to create a more resilient and sustainable energy future for the base and deliver a project that meets the installation’s mission requirements while also advancing the Climate Smart Building Initiative.”
In addition to LED fixture retrofits, other energy demand reduction measures include wireless streetlighting controls, and advanced interior lighting controls. Overall, the upgrades are expected to generate more than $4.7 million in annual energy savings for JBMDL, a total energy usage reduction of 22%.
The Phase 2 construction is scheduled to begin shortly and reach completion in early 2025. 
The Joint Base project is a part of the Climate Smart Buildings Initiative that the Biden administration announced last month. This initiative intends to modernize Federal buildings to better meet agencies’ missions, create good-paying jobs, and cut greenhouse gas emissions. The initiative is expected to catalyze over $8 billion of private sector investment by 2030 to modernize facilities through energy savings performance contracts. It is also anticipated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 2.8 million metric tons annually by 2030, which is the equivalent of removing 600,000 gas-powered cars from the road.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/09/with-solar-deployment-poised-for-growth-metal-roofing-can-streamline-solar-installations/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022","With solar deployment poised for growth, metal roofing can streamline solar installations","With recent news of the Inflation Reduction Act passing, the U.S. solar market is now poised to reach 30% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030. The new legislation includes a 10-year extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), significant incentives to boost domestic manufacturing throughout the solar production supply chain, tax credits for energy storage, workforce development provisions and additional policies that promote a clean energy economy.
Solar projects eligible for the 30% ITC can increase their tax credit by an additional 10% (that’s up to 40% in total) by purchasing domestically produced hardware. This is important to note because in the wake of the pandemic, U.S. companies quickly realized the need to limit their reliance on foreign goods and services and increase domestic manufacturing to meet the demand. Ongoing supply chain issues also underscore the importance of domestic production.
An increase in domestic production of solar components should offset potential price increases, reduce shipping and import costs, and likely increase the level of support for solar photovoltaics (PV) and other renewables in the United States—triggering an avalanche of solar development throughout the country.
Globally, the costs of oil and natural gas continue to skyrocket. Many countries are rolling out plans to increase solar deployment to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels. According to the World Energy Transitions Outlook 2022 by the International Renewable Energy Agency, the world will need to achieve 65% of total electricity supply from renewables in 2030, up from 26% in 2019, and solar PV will need to account for more than 5,200 GW by 2030, up from 580 GW in 2019.
So, how do metal roofs play into the equation?
Metal roofing provides an ideal platform for mounting rooftop solar as it is the only roof type with a service life (in the range of 50 to 70 years) that actually exceeds the service life of a solar PV system (an average of 32.5 years and growing year-over-year). It is also the most sustainable roofing type and is conducive to lower solar installation costs. Most alternative roofing types will expire long before the life of the PV system, leading to costly disassembly of the PV array, re-roofing and re-assembly.
These re-roofing and re-assembly expenses erode the otherwise attractive financial metrics of roof-mounted PV. High-end tile may be the only exception to the need for re-roofing, but its price tag is the same as standing seam metal roofing. But mounting solar to tile is invasive and very tricky to do without breaking tiles, so the cost is also much higher than mounting to metal. Simply put, when all the facts are known, the standing seam metal roof is the only roof type worthy of consideration for solar PV with face-attached metal profiles at a close second place.
How do national and/or local energy policies and building/electrical codes play into the use of solar?
The role of codes and regulations is a double-edged sword. Some are very positive for solar, such as the residential solar mandates for new buildings enacted in California two years ago, while others may increase hurdles, making it more complex and difficult to install solar. As the use of solar increases, so do the number and revisions of codes and standards. This is inevitable and the right thing to do but may  inadvertently increase the hurdles to deploying solar. Some energy conservation policies are focused on energy efficiency first, which may reduce the demand for solar.
That said, various municipalities and even states have enacted regulations and building codes mandating the installation of solar PV or solar-ready design on new building construction. This is a major shift from the past when there was no consideration for accommodating solar with new construction design, and then retroactively fitting solar to the roof as well as possible. New mandates will result in the accelerated growth of rooftop solar, with the intent also to reduce costs and maximize the energy output of solar installations – leading to higher ROIs with fewer hurdles in deploying solar PV.
The key to complying with these mandates is in the upfront planning and design of new buildings with respect to factors not traditionally considered – factors focused on the anticipation of a solar installation on a new building.
For example, according to St. Louis’s solar-ready regulation passed in December 2019, the area of a new commercial building’s roof, which is functional for solar must be at least 40% of the total roof area, often referred to as the “solar-ready zone.” For new residential homes, the solar-ready zone must be at least 600 square feet and oriented between 110 and 270 degrees from true north to the southernmost point as possible ─ to produce more energy.
As more buildings are constructed with solar installed or solar-ready, the demand for better solutions will foster greater innovation of products and technology to allow a building, its roof and solar PV to work as a single system. This could be new products performing multiple functions, such as building-integrated PV (BIPV), which has been in the industry for years but is relatively unsuccessful due to economics and technical difficulty.
Return-on-investment
Often, when the decision is made to install solar, a new roof is required. Metal roofing has become a driver for roof type selection in these cases because not only can a metal/solar roof system have lower initial cost than other roof system combinations, but it also leads to improvements in the lifetime return on investment (ROI) of the system. Therefore, the PV array and the roof should be regarded as a single asset.
When computing ROI within the solar pro forma, inverter replacement is usually factored in at about year 15 – but what about the cost of roof replacement? The solar array must be totally dismantled and then re-installed on the replacement roof. Factor in the inevitable cost of roof replacement and the advantages of a metal roof become clearly obvious. The metal roof avoids replacement due to its long service life. The roof will still be going strong long after the service life of the solar array has expired.
The Metal Construction Association recently published a three-part white paper series on solar PV and metal roofing. Part 1 focuses on solar/roof service life comparisons. Part 2 explains the common types of mounting systems for metal roofs, associated risks and the pros/cons of each. Part 3 digs into more detail and the critical technical factors for solar PV systems specific to mounting on metal roofs.
Rob Haddock is CEO and Founder of S-5! is a former contractor, award-winning roof-forensics expert, author, lecturer and building envelope scientist who has worked in various aspects of metal roofing for five decades. He began ground-breaking innovation of penetration-free ancillary attachment solutions in 1991 and holds 60+ US and foreign patents. Together with his son, Dustin, they co-invented, a rail-less direct-attach solar solution that provides a simple, secure method to “lay & play” PV modules with tested, engineered, cost-saving, attachment to the only roof type that outlasts the solar—the metal roof.
