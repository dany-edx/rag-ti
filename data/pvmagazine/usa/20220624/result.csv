https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/24/infiniti-energy-raises-117-million-for-commercial-solar-development/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW JERSEY",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 24, 2022",Infiniti Energy raises $117 million for commercial solar development,"New Jersey-based Infiniti Energy announced that it has closed an up to $87 million tax equity facility and $30 million construction revolver earmarked to support a growing portfolio of commercial solar projects.
The company said the financing will be used to support the development of 34 MW of commercial and industrial (C&I) solar located across New Jersey. The portfolio will be comprised entirely of power purchase agreements (PPAs) for all sites, though purchasers of the electricity have not yet been named. Infiniti Energy will build, own, and operate all sites working with a diverse group of solar offtakers, including retail, large multi-family residential, commercial, and industrial clients.
Construction is underway on the 34 MW portfolio, with completion expected by the end of 2022.
“The Infiniti Energy team is excited about the opportunity this financing represents,” said Michael Kushner, Infiniti Energy CEO. “It is an important step to expand Infiniti Energy’s owned solar portfolio while positively impacting our clients, the environment, and our investors.”
This most recent round of funding builds on the $60 million that was committed to Infiniti Energy Services by Upper Bay Infrastructure Partners to form Infiniti Energy, back in April 2021. Infiniti Energy is a platform for the development and acquisition of Commercial and Industrial solar assets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, while Infiniti Energy Services is a C&I solar developer. Upper Bay initially committed $60 million to accelerate Infiniti’s development and acquisition of solar assets and expects a total project pipeline investment opportunity in excess of $200 million by 2024.
One of Infiniti Energy Services’ most notable C&I installations is a nearly 1 MW rooftop solar array at a PepsiCo bottling warehouse in Piscataway, New Jersey, about an hour north of Trenton. The project is part of PepsiCo’s U.S. and global corporate sustainability initiatives.
Totaling 992.8 kW, the project includes 2,482 Trina 400 W modules with Tigo rapid shutdown units, PanelClaw FR10D racking, and 12 Chint 60 kW inverters.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/24/pacific-gas-electric-calls-for-participation-in-tesla-virtual-power-plant-pilot/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 24, 2022",Pacific Gas & Electric calls for participation in Tesla virtual power plant pilot,"Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) is  looking for Powerwall owners to opt into Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP) pilot, allowing Powerwalls to be dispatched when the grid needs emergency support.
Eligible participants own a Powerwall with or without solar, must be PG&E customers, and must have a valid Rule 21 interconnection agreement. They also must not be enrolled in a conflicting program that may include another Virtual Power Plant (VPP) or a demand response program run by PG&E, a Community Choice Aggregator or another program.
One of the benefits of participation is the simple satisfaction of  being part of a pilot program that may help stabilize California’s grid. PG&E estimates that there are potentially 50,000 Powerwall users in its territory, and by combining them, this pilot could form the largest distributed battery resource in the world. For Powerwall users concerned about whether they will have the backup they need while participating in an emergency event, PG&E noted that the owner’s Powerwall will discharge during VPP events but won’t discharge below the owner’s backup reserve.
Virtual Power Plants are an essential part of California’s clean energy future and a valuable resource for supporting grid reliability. PG&E has had VPPs in some form for the past 15 years and we continue actively integrating VPP resources (such as smart thermostats and batteries) into our energy supply portfolio. With Tesla’s participation in PG&E’s Emergency Load Reduction Program, we are further integrating behind-the-meter battery energy storage based VPPs on the largest scale yet, said Paul Doherty, marketing and communications, PG&E.
Under the pilot, Tesla and PG&E will call upon the Virtual Power Plant when the California grid operator, CAISO, declares an alert, warning or emergency in response to challenging grid conditions. To meet the minimum of 20 hours of events needed to run the pilot, Tesla and PG&E may also call events at other times.
Participants will be notified when an event is scheduled. Sometimes the notification will be sent 24 hours in advance, but some circumstances may not allow for much notice. A participant may choose to opt out of any individual event. When the event begins, the owner receives a push notification reminding them of the event end time, and their Powerwall will begin discharging to support the grid. It will continue to discharge until the event ends, or when it discharges to the owner’s selected Backup Reserve level. After the event the owner’s Powerwall will resume normal operation.
The Tesla and PG&E ELRP pilot will compensate Powerwall owners $2 for every additional kWh that the Powerwall delivers during an event beyond typical behavior. Compensation depends on the participating energy capacity of the owner’s system, which depends on the number of Powerwalls and their Backup Reserves.
PG&E provided an example compensation scenario: A one-Powerwall system with a backup reserve of 20% that is fully charged at the start of an event has 13.5 kWh * (100% to 20%) = 10.8 kWh to contribute during that event. If this system would typically serve 3 kWh of energy during the event hours, fully dispatching the Powerwall down to the Backup Reserve would deliver 7.8 kWh of additional kWh. At $2 per kWh, this could be worth $15.60 for this event.
For more information or to sign up, Powerwall owners can go to the Tesla app.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/24/500-million-invested-in-pine-gate-renewables-to-support-utility-scale-solar-buildout/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 24, 2022",$500 million invested in Pine Gate Renewables to support utility-scale solar buildout,"Sustainable infrastructure investment and operating platform Generate Capital announced it made a $500 million investment in Pine Gate Renewables, a developer of utility-scale solar and energy storage.
The investment includes $200 million in equity investment and $300 million in long-term asset partnership for project financing. It is expected to provide Pine Gate with additional funding to build projects and meet other general working capital needs. With the investment, Generate Capital will now join the developer’s board of directors.
Pine Gate owns and operates over 1 GW of renewable energy projects. Headquartered in Asheville, North Carolina, it has more than 20 GW of active development projects throughout the United States and has raised over $1 billion in corporate and project financing in the past six months alone.
“Generate is a collaborative, experienced partner and shares Pine Gates’ long-term vision of driving the energy transition and improving energy security by providing solar energy and battery storage to local communities across the country. Pine Gate is well-positioned as we continue to expand our national presence,” said Ben Catt, chief executive of Pine Gate Renewables.
“Solar is the world’s most affordable source of energy today and is a significant opportunity for Generate as utilities adapt to the strong demand from customers for more renewable resources,” said Scott Jacobs, chief executive and co-founder of Generate Capital.
Foley & Lardner LLP served as legal adviser for Generate Capital and DNV GL served as technical adviser. Lazard Ltd. served as financial adviser and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP served as legal adviser for Pine Gate Renewables.
Batteries included
In May, Pine Gate made two large supply deals for grid-scale energy storage, including a purchase of 2.4 GWh of EnerVenue batteries. EnerVenue is a nickel-hydrogen battery startup that launched at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in summer 2020.
That same month, Pine Gate entered a deal in which Urban Electric Power will supply the company with 4.6 GWh of its rechargeable zinc alkaline batteries over the next five years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/24/retc-releases-2022-module-index-report-2/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INTERVIEW,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 24, 2022",RETC releases 2022 Module Index Report,"Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC), a leading independent lab for testing photovoltaic (PV) and battery products has released its 2022 PV Module Index (PVMI) report, highlighting module performance across a variety of lab tests, as well as providing industry-cited clarifications into the real-world significance of the results.
The 2022 PVMI marks the first edition released since VDE acquired a 70% stake in RECT. President and CEO Cherif Kedir said the move will allow RETC to expand its testing services to a broader network of manufacturers, investors, insurers and developers, all in pursuit of minimizing risk and uncertainty in favor of long-term reliability, sustainability and profitability by designing better data-driven risk mitigation programs and service products.
Eyes on 2023 and beyond
RETC Vice President of Business Development Daniel Chang told pv magazine the 2022 PVMI takes a more forward-looking approach than previous editions, supplementing testing results and hardware performance with emerging industry trends that are going to guide the use of this hardware and investments in projects that utilize it into 2023 and beyond.
“We focus on what we think are going to be topics that are going to be relevant for the upcoming year, like the onset of N-Type modules, and field services,” explained Chang. “There are a lot of installations out there degrading at a faster pace than expected. These installations are investments in assets made by banks to yield some sort of financial benefit to them, right? If they have some sort of degradation, then that’s not performing the way that was expected and planned for.”
Specifically, RETC is interested in forensic analysis for PV systems; a detailed investigation that seeks to establish the root cause of PV system underperformance. This investigation is the culmination of different analyses to be done over the life of a project, starting with a baseline third-party module health assessment during project commissioning.
In instances of underperformance, RETC recommends Electroluminescence (EL) testing. EL testing uses a special camera system to document the light emissions that occur when an electrical current passes through PV cells. The technology has long been used in labs to detect a wide range of hidden module defects.
Another aspect of forensic analysis is predictive maintenance, wherein a third party inspects plants from periodically to detect issues that may not be visible at a base overview, but could develop into much larger issues if allowed to linger.
While Chang brought to light the ongoing issue of degradation and the developing need for advanced field services, Kedir focused more on the technology side, researching where the next wave of module innovation will come in a post-large-format world.
That innovation, he thinks, will come from heterojunction n-type modules (HJT).
“I think leading manufacturers are kind of a crossroad point right now, in terms of how to get more power out of modules without making the modules just unreasonably large, because they’re already pretty damn big,” Kedir said. “The other reason I think manufacturers may be hesitant to make their modules larger is that everybody is testing the waters with heterojunction cells, so that they can eke out more more watts per module, without having to increase the size. With the module technologies they currently have, I don’t think they’re able to get a lot more efficiency out of the cell, so they’re trying to figure out how to get more power without increasing the module size, and the next, the next logical thing is to go to different technologies, Topcon and heterojunction.”
In an op-ed for pv magazine in Nov. 2021, Nadeem Haque, chief technology officer at Heliene outlined some of the distinct technology advantages that HJT presents.
HJT cell manufacturing involves the deposition of an amorphous layer of silicon on both the top and bottom of the wafer followed by a transparent conducting oxide deposition and making of metal contacts.
HJT cell production lines are currently expensive, almost prohibitively so, and new lines need to be built. The cells require a more expensive metallization paste to manufacture. HJT cells are by nature bifacial, with bifaciality rates above 90%, the highest of any cell technology. The temperature coefficient of HJT cells is in the range of 0.25%/oC to 0.30%/oC.
Higher bifaciality and lower temperature coefficients result in higher energy output, and HJT cells in mass production are expected to reach about 27% efficiency.
“You can gauge where the industry is going based on where investment money is going, and we hear a lot about companies investing money in heterojunction cell lines in Asia, so I think that’s probably going to be a trend,” said Kedir.
The last industry trend examined by RETC is mitigating the effects of extreme weather on PV systems, a topic which pv magazine has reported on extensively with RETC and other partners, like VDE Americas.
Module index
The core of the report is a review of modules’ performance across a range of tests that are designed to go beyond the parameters of tests for certification and accurately project what each module’s strengths are, rather than compare and rank them against one another.
The tests are split up into three categories, each of which analyzes a different aspect of module excellence: quality indicators, performance indicators, and reliability indicators. In testing, the researchers at RETC noticed a new trend that some of the performance and reliability gaps from manufacturer to manufacturer have widened, as opposed to the narrowing they observed in recent years.
“Some of the issues that we saw over the last year have been related to manufacturers faced with their own supply chain issues and inability to get their raw materials,” explained Kedir. “They’ve had to go to other sources, secondary and tertiary sources of cells and backsheets, and then that triggered a few failures, we saw more of them last year. What’s been lingering is potential-induced degradation (PID) and some related performance stuff. On cells, PID, for all intents and purposes, had been completely solved a few years ago, but then it reappeared throughout the pandemic, with the supply chain issues, we see some of that leftover.”
This is a phenomenon that Kedir expects to see continue, at least in the short term. The issue may linger as a result of the recently-announced two year moratorium on the DOC’s anticircumvention case, he said.
“Demand is going to is going to pick up in the US,” he began. “The upcoming traceability requirements are going to put a constraint on the cell supply from forced labor regions, which means you’re not going to have enough cell supply for them for the market demands. This causes supply separation between manufacturers. Some larger manufacturers have already completely mitigated that issue, developed a new supply chain for polycrystal, and have new cell lines in Southeast Asia. Those guys are going to fare out much better than a manufacturer who hasn’t put in that infrastructure already. They’re going to have to try to source cells from other places or other manufacturers that may or may not be as good as their initial supply.”
While the gap between top-tier, established module manufacturers and some newer market entrants is widening, RETC still had a number of manufacturers perform well across their litany of tests.
Based on available testing data, RETC highlighted Hanwha Q CELLS, JA Solar, Jinko Solar, LONGi Solar, Trina Solar, and Yingli Solar as the overall top performers of the year. The recognition does not stop with the top performers, however, and RETC listed some of the manufacturers who scored the highest marks in individual tests, listed below.
Hail durability:
Thresher test:
LID resistance:
LeTID resistance:
Module efficiency:
Pan file performance:
PTC-to-STC ratio
Damp heat test
Dynamic mechanical load test:
PID resistance:
Thermal cycle test:
RETC said the rankings are comprehensive only to data that the company has collected, so modules from other manufacturers could perform similarly to the ones listed above, but the organization cannot make an overall determination regarding high achievement in manufacturing without module tests data across the three categories.
The report concludes with a look at a number of notable changes and revisions anticipated in the upcoming edition of IEC 61730, a two-part standard pertaining to PV module safety qualification, as well as upcoming updates to IEC TS 62915, a technical specification pertaining to PV module approval, design and safety qualification.
The standards analysis is expansive, and pv magazine will cover these pending changes in a follow-up to this article.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/24/california-ruling-simplifies-grid-connection-process-for-distributed-solar-and-storage/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 24, 2022",California ruling simplifies grid connection process for distributed solar and storage,"Project developers of distributed solar and energy storage will be provided with valuable transparency and time as the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) ruled it would dramatically simplify the process for grid interconnection.
The review of distributed energy resources (DER) projects seeking interconnection will now be based on a model of the current conditions of the grid, in a process called an Integration Capacity Analysis (ICA), which mirrors a process commonly known as a hosting capacity analysis.
The process will replace “rules of thumb” that are often imprecise and can lead to unnecessary project reviews that are costly and time-consuming. The CPUC also removed size limits for projects eligible for being reviewed under a “fast track.”
The screening process used to implement a “15% of peak load” rule-of-thumb to determine if a project requires grid upgrades to interconnect. Now, projects that do not exceed 90% of the available capacity as shown in the ICA will be able to pass the screening test.
Projects that do not pass the screen will be subject to a supplemental review, but this process has also been expedited to allow more distributed resources to be interconnected.
Soft costs, or costs unrelated to physical equipment installed, can exceed 65% in the United States, much higher than most major solar markets internationally. The Department of Energy said permitting, inspection, and interconnection costs can represent 8% of a solar project’s cost.
Delays can often lead to bad customer experiences and increased project cancellations, so this streamlined process represents a boon to solar and storage installation companies looking to boost their project pull through rate and customer satisfaction.
The rules come as a result of years of engagement in the CPUC rulemaking process by organizations like the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). IREC said these landmark changes could serve as a model for the rest of the country to boost distributed solar and energy storage project efficiency.
In 2014, IREC began work on the Integrated Capacity Analysis, a regularly updated model on current grid conditions at various locations along the grid. In September 2020, a ruling established the intention to use ICA in the state’s interconnection process. After two years of finalizing how the process would work, it will now be integrated 45 days from the ruling, taking effect on August 7, 2022.
“Today’s decision by the CPUC takes the first step toward a vastly improved interconnection process that better reflects the realities of the grid and makes it faster and easier to install the levels of clean energy that will be needed to reach California’s decarbonization goals,” said Sky Stanfield, Partner at law firm Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger and attorney for IREC. “We look forward to the Commission completing this process with a future decision on the implementation of limited generation profiles.”
Further improvements to the interconnection process are pending. A “limited generation profile” approach is being considered. That approach would allow distributed resources to design a system using a generation profile to avoid system constraints that arise seasonally.
Another benefit of the ruling is the use of hosting capacity data will arm clean energy developers with greater agency to avoid costly and time-consuming processes. Developers can explore a utility’s ICA map to identify preferable locations for distributed projects where additional capacity can be added without a grid upgrade. The data on the map available to developers will be the same data used to approve interconnection of a project, meaning developers will have greater transparency and less guesswork in planning projects.
“Today’s decision reflects the culmination of years of dogged engagement by IREC to enable the use of cutting-edge approaches that simplify the interconnection process so renewable energy can be deployed faster and more affordably,” said Larry Sherwood, IREC president and CEO.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/24/single-axis-trackers-on-a-commercial-rooftop-increase-generation-37/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 24, 2022",Single axis trackers on a commercial rooftop increase generation 37%,"Alion Energy’s single axis tracker racking product was originally designed to be deployed in regions where heavy installation equipment was more challenging to access, but labor might be more available. One aspect of this design philosophy is that the system is light and can be easily carried and assembled, and doesn’t require metal pilings to be driven deep into the ground.
Interestingly, this carries over to commercial rooftops.
Via a post on LinkedIn, Mark Kingsley, Alion CEO, shared that a commercial real estate group had installed a standard rooftop 10º fixed tilt mono-facial solar array, as well as a competing Alion system.

The results were as expected – 37.5% greater generation on a per watt basis from the single axis tracker, on a pristine white thermoplastic roof versus standard modules.
Of course, the real breakthrough is that they were able to get single axis trackers installed on a commercial rooftop at all!
There was no information shared about the total wattage that was able to be installed on the site, however, Alion did provide pv magazine USA with a technical powerpoint covering the deployment of their product on commercial rooftops (this data-driven document is available from Kingsley upon request).
Kingsley also commented on the aforementioned LinkedIn thread with the following image showing a hypothetical rooftop situation. This project is also reviewed in greater depth in the powerpoint presentation.

Looking closely, Alion is suggesting that they can actually fit *more* modules on the rooftop – and have a higher production rate from those modules due to common nuances of rooftop installation.
The rooftop in their example has a lot of skylights, and the overall structure is not facing due south. In this configuration, Alion suggests that they can fit 4.55 MW of modules on the Maryland structure with a standard 10º installation. This system is projected to generate 1.34 kWh per watt each year.
Alion has designed a system that is 5.4 MW – a full 18% increase in wattage due to systems ability to be installed directly over skylights without needing the standard setback! Additionally, this hardware is projected to generate 1.54 kWh per watt installed per year.
In this case, that works out to 37% more electricity from the same rooftop. And when the trackers are directly attached to the roof – a 2.15 pounds per square foot dead load.

Add in one Alion’s customized robotic cleaners, and the company says the levelized cost of electricity from the system falls to 4.67¢/kWh and generates 40% more electricity than a standard rooftop solar install.
And while this rooftop was selected to show off their hardware, it’s still an interesting best case scenario for us to consider.
