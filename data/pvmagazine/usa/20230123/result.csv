Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.
The paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland. At a global scale, it is estimated that 1% of all farmland could produce the world’s energy needs if converted to solar PV.
There are many different ways to install agrivoltaic arrays. One common method is to raise the array to leave space for farming equipment or livestock to move freely below. Another trending design is to orient the PV arrays vertically, leaving wide open spaces in between the array rows.
USA
In Somerset, California, German-designed Sunzaun vertical solar arrays were installed at a vineyard. Installer Sunstall developed the facility, which was composed of 43 450 W modules connected to a microinverter and two batteries.
The minimalistic design used holes in the module frames to make a simple attachment to two piles, negating the need for a heavy racking system. The bifacial solar modules produce energy on both sides of the vertically oriented array.

In traditional systems designed with a landscape orientation, the rails used to mount panels onto the racking system are often cut to fit the expected panel size. If the size of the panel changes after all other component procurement has been completed, the project may face delays while the rails are reengineered to fit the updated panel size. Sunzaun’s design allows for easy adaptation to a change in panel size by adjusting the distance between each pile. It is also possible to adjust the height of the panels from the ground if needed.
Germany
Scientists from the Leipzig University of Applied Sciences have looked at the potential impact of deploying vertical west-east oriented PV systems on a massive scale in the German energy market. They have found that such installations could have a beneficial effect in stabilizing the country’s grid, while allowing greater integration with agricultural activities than with conventional ground-mounted PV plants.
The scientists found that vertical PV systems can shift solar yield into hours of higher electricity demand and more electricity supply in the winter months, thus reducing solar curtailment.
“If electricity storage of 1 TW charging and discharging power and 1  TWh capacity is integrated into the energy system model, the effect is reduced to CO2 savings of up to 2.1 Mt/a with 70% vertical east-west and 30% inclined south facing modules,” they said. “Finally, while it might seem unrealistic for some to achieve a rate of 70% vertical power plants, even a lower rate has a beneficial impact.” 
Japan
In Japan, Luxor Solar KK, a subsidiary of German module manufacturer Luxor Solar, built an 8.3 kW vertical PV system in the parking area of a rice processing factory owned by Eco Rice Niigata.
“The cars will be parked between the vertical rack systems,” Luxor Solar KK CEO Uwe Liebscher told pv magazine. “The goal of this system is to show the durability during winter, and the additional energy yield due to the reflection of the snow. Niigata, on the other hand, is known for being a high snow load area, with up to 2-3m of snow in winter.”
The south-oriented system features Luxor Solar’s own heterojunction solar modules, as well as mounting systems from German vertical PV specialist Next2Sun and inverters from Japan’s Omron. The vertical array will supply electricity to a rice processing factory next to the system. The city of Nagaoka supported the project with JPY 2 million ($14,390).
“A vertical installation uses only a minimum space of the farmland while maintaining more than 85% of the light reaching the crops, ensuring an optimal balance of solar and farming, which is crucial in Japan,” he said. “This allows us to build agrivoltaic systems on utility crops farmland, like for wheat, potatoes or rice, on a big scale.”
France
In France, TotalEnergies and agrivoltaics specialist InVivo commissioned a 111 kW vertical agrivoltaic demonstrator. TotalEnergies said the pilot facility will investigate the impact of solar panels on agricultural yield, as well as the biodiversity, carbon storage, and water quality of the site.
“We are convinced that the synergies developed between the production of green electricity, biogas and agriculture are one of the answers to guarantee our energy independence and our food independence,” said Thierry Muller, managing director of TotalEnergies Renouvelables France.
Sweden
Scientists at Mälardalen University in Sweden have developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that facilitates the analysis of microclimates in vertical PV projects. CFD simulations are used to solve complex equations about the flow of solids and gases through and around bodies, which can be used to analyze microclimates within agrivoltaic systems.

“Models of agrivoltaic (AV) systems will become frequently used for new AV system designs as well as decision-making as you can analyze/predict the microclimatic changes dependent on location and AV system solution,” researcher Sebastian Zainalli told pv magazine.
The study observed a 38% decrease in solar radiation intensity in the ground areas shaded by the vertical PV modules.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/23/home-depot-to-install-13-mw-rooftop-solar-portfolio-across-california-stores/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 23, 2023",Home Depot to install 13 MW rooftop solar portfolio across California stores,"DSD Renewables, a commercial and industrial solar developer,  partnered with the Home Depot to install 13 MW of rooftop solar across a 25-store portfolio in California.
The project portfolio represents a continued commitment to leverage roof space for solar generation as part of the national retailer’s renewable energy program. The installations contribute to the company’s goal to generate 100% renewable energy by 2030, the equivalent to the electricity needs for all its facilities.
The rooftop portfolio will begin construction in early 2023, and upon completion is expected to generate more than 17 million kWh of clean energy annually, the equivalent of removing 2,648 gasoline-powered cars from the road each year.
“Reducing The Home Depot’s environmental impact is essential to our efforts to build a better business, workplace and world,” said Ron Jarvis, vice president and chief sustainability officer, Home Depot. “Harnessing power from the sun is essential to our renewable electricity aims, and we’re happy to work with DSD as we expand our solar program and continue to invest in alternative energy solutions.”
DSD, or Distributed Solar Development, is continuing to work on projects with the retailer to broaden its solar energy usage in additional states such as New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland and Massachusetts, with additional projects planned in Arizona, California, Illinois and New York.
“This project marks 98 stores that will have deployed solar rooftops with DSD,” said Dan O’Brien, vice president of direct origination at DSD. “The Home Depot shares our commitment to reduce its carbon footprint and we applaud the expansion of its renewable energy program.”
According to Home Depot’s 2022 ESG Report, at year end 2021 the retailer had 141.7 MW of installed solar capacity across its U.S. store locations, a 125% increase from 62.9 MW of installed solar capacity in 2020.  The company also procured 62 MW of wind power and 41.3 MW of fuel cell assets.
As a result of new distributed generation projects, in 2021 Home Depot purchased less power from the grid, at 2.935 million MWh, compared to 3.1 million MWh in 2020, while the retailer produced 300,600 MWh of self-generated electricity, a decrease from 302,200 MWh generated in 2020.
Home Depot stores have cut electricity consumption 50% since 2010, providing customers a lower energy intensive shopping environment, Jarvis said in the 2022 ESG report.
Schenectady, N.Y.-based DSD Renewables has installed commercial, industrial and municipal solar projects for customers including IKEA (22 MW solar plus 15 MWh storage), T-Mobile (30.3 MW), Schenectady County, N.Y. (25 MW) and the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU) system (11.5 MW).
Formerly GE Solar, DSD was spun off of General Electric in mid-2019 with backing from BlackRock Real Assets. Since then, DSD has expanded into community solar and asset acquisition in 2020, and launched a developer network and DSD Connect platform in 2021. After raising $785 million from BlackRock and investors, the company secured a $200 million equity investment from Ares Management in March 2022.  As of December 2021, DSD operated a portfolio of more than 240 GWh of distributed generation assets.

Researchers at the University of Toledo in the United States have developed a flexible CdTe solar cell through a water-assisted lift-off approach, including an additional cadmium chloride treatment for the cell’s cadmium sulfide (CdS) film.
“These are lightweight and flexible solar cells that can especially install on any curve surface or electric device and, most importantly, they are good for space applications,” researcher Sandip Singh told pv magazine.
The scientists described the water-assisted lift-off method as a low-cost fabrication process to offer advantages such as lower stress in CdTe films and ambient operation temperature. The lift-off approach consists of different photolithography techniques for creating a photoresist profile that ensures separation between the thin film coating in desired and undesired areas of a give pattern. It includes washing away the photoresist to leave behind the film in the patterned area.
They used cleaved mica sheets as a mediator substrate for the solar cell and a CdS buffer layer with thickness of 100 nm. They also applied a cadmium chloride (CdCl2) vapor treatment to the cadmium sulfide (CdS) film before CdTe deposition and a second CdCl2 treatment after CdTe deposition.
“A 3.5 μm CdTe absorber layer was deposited by the closed space sublimation method with a source temperature of 580 C and a substrate temperature of 520 C in a 1% oxygen and 99% argon environment,” they explained.
The academics dried the peeled film with a nitrogen jet and deposited a transparent conduction oxide indium zinc oxide (IZO) layer as a front contact.
“In this process, the mica sheet serves only to grow CdS and CdTe films, after the delamination mica sheet is not a part of the solar cell,” they said.
They said the process results in a higher cristallinity of the films. They found that the average grain size of the CdS film without additional CdCl2 treatment is much smaller than that with additional CdCl2 treatment. This means that the CdS film has a higher conductivity.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 12.60%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.829 V, a short-circuit current density of 23.64 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 64.30%. The group described this efficiency value as highest reported among all flexible CdTe solar cells fabricated by the lift-off technique.
“The additional CdCl2 treatment on the CdS layer significantly improves the open-circuit voltage and fill while the improvement of short-circuit current density is negligible,” the researchers said. They described the novel cell technology in “Water-Assisted Lift-Off Process for Flexible CdTe Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/23/solar-total-installed-capacity-to-grow-84-in-two-years/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 23, 2023",Solar total installed capacity to grow 84% in two years,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) shared that renewable energy in the U.S. is continuing its march towards being the dominant source of electricity, as solar and wind power are expected to represent 16% of all generation this year. This doubles the 2018 contribution of 8%.
The U.S. grid operated about 74 GW of solar photovoltaic capacity at the end of 2022, which is about three times the installed capacity at the end of 2017. Wind power has grown by more than 60% since 2017 to about 143 GW of capacity.
Solar capacity is expected to add another 63 GW by the end of 2024, an impressive growth of 84% in a two-year span. By 2024, solar may reach 6% of generation, while wind is expected to add 12 GW of capacity in two years, reaching about 12% of the total generation mix.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if the percentage of solar- and wind-generated electricity exceeds the EIA’s projections over the next two years, as the hundreds of billions of dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act pour into clean energy initiatives,” said Alex Formuzis, spokesperson for the Environmental Working Group.
Meanwhile, solar and wind are pushing fossil fuels off the grid. The EIA forecast for coal this year has fallen from a 20% contribution to 18%, and natural gas is expected to decline by a percentage point to 38% of the energy mix.
Coal is forecast to decline to 17% of U.S. electricity generation in 2024, meaning next year may be a monumental year for classic renewables (solar and wind), to push coal further down the ranking list of contributors. When including hydroelectric power, U.S. renewable energy is expected to reach 26% of electricity generation by 2024.
Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) energy expert Kingsmill Bond said fossil fuel demand in the electricity sector has already reached its peak in demand. Driven by lowered costs, clean energy goals, and a gravitational shift in global capital toward renewables, solar and wind energy are expected to carry the torch left behind by coal, oil, and gas.
According to RMI research, fossil fuel demand for electricity has peaked in 95 % of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and 31% of the non-OECD countries excluding China.
“Putin’s War, the desire for domestic energy sources, and high fossil fuel prices only add to the pressure to change,” said Bond. “When we add up deployments in solar, wind, EVs, heat pumps, and hydrogen, we expect clean technology deployment over the course of this decade to replace four times as much fossil fuel demand as it did in the past decade.”
Investments in the U.S. renewable energy market are expected to hit $114 billion by 2031, a 78% increase from $64 billion in total investments at year end 2021, buoyed by decarbonization momentum from the landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Much of this investment will go towards establishing a domestic supply chain of solar components.
“The IRA will completely reshape the renewables supply chain in the U.S., incentivizing the reopening of shuttered facilities as well as provide opportunities to build entire equipment supply chains from scratch,” said Daniel Liu, head of asset commercial performance at Wood Mackenzie.

The program will make loans and grants for rural electric cooperatives to purchase renewable energy, renewable energy systems, zero-emission systems and carbon capture and storage systems, with grants covering no more than 25% of the project cost, under IRA section 22004.
The program’s $9.7 billion of financial support will be available through 2031, to support the long-term resiliency, reliability and affordability of rural electric systems, and to “achieve the greatest reduction” in carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions.
The Rural Power Coalition said in a statement that the program will allow for rural electric cooperatives to replace coal plants, through investments in renewable energy, battery storage, and improvements to generation and transmission efficiency. While the program allows for carbon capture and nuclear generation projects, the coalition said “these are less desirable options for member-owners to obtain an affordable clean energy future.”
The USDA’s Rural Utility Service, which will implement the program, is now holding listening sessions. The Rural Power Coalition expects USDA to announce a rulemaking process in the coming months, which it said “will require public input from rural communities across the country.”
$1 billion more from USDA
The Rural Utility Service will also administer a $1 billion loan program through 2031 for renewable energy and associated energy storage projects.
Loan recipients will be eligible for loan forgiveness of up to 50% of the loan, based on how the borrower and project meet the terms for loan forgiveness, under IRA section 22001.
The Rural Power Coalition said the program will aid rural electric cooperatives that are “minimally taxed,” and thus cannot directly receive tax credits for wind and solar developments. Under the IRA, these cooperatives may now receive a direct payment from the federal government rather than a tax credit, the coalition said, which thus “opens the door for new clean energy investments.”
The coalition expects USDA to announce its rulemaking process for the program in the coming months.
$1 billion from DOE
A third program, to provide $1 billion to “improve energy systems” in areas with fewer than 10,000 people, will be administered by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).
The program, known as “Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas,” will help energy systems in these areas become more resilient to the effects of climate change, while achieving public health benefits and lower costs from “cleaner, more efficient energy,” said a DOE statement.
The program is funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and will provide support for projects including new or upgraded transmission and distribution lines, new or modernized electric generation, microgrids, and energy efficiency. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), DOE is interested in demonstration projects.
DOE issued a request for information seeking public input for the program in October, and expects to announce a funding opportunity to solicit project proposals this year.
SEIA is offering a webinar on the program on February 2.

Researchers from the Sunlab laboratory at the University of Ottawa have devised a new way to measure the energy yield of bifacial PV systems. The innovation is intended to complement the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) measuring standard introduced in 2019.
The new scaled rear irradiance (SRI) method purportedly improves IEC measurements by accommodating the effects of different ground covers’ spectral albedo in its calculation of the bifacial system’s rear-side irradiance.
To prove the concept, the scientists modeled the performance of a bifacial silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar module under the IEC bifacial illumination technique and the SRI method. They mounted the system on a horizontal single-axis tracker 1.22 meters from the ground in Boulder, Colorado, United States. The ground covers considered were soil, red brick, green grass, roof shingle, concrete, sand, dry grass, and snow.
Results show that for a rear irradiance of 200 W/square meters, the IEC measurement does not distinguish between the different ground covers, overestimating bifacial gain by between 14% and 1.4% for all ground covers except snow. The SRI method, on the other hand, shows a clear differentiation between the range of operating conditions.
“Implementation of this method into international standards for such panels can enable predictions of outdoor bifacial panel performance to within 2% absolute,” said researcher Erin Tonita.
The new method can also predict energy yield gains in locations other than Boulder with an error of less than 7%, according to the academics.
The innovation could be used to compare different bifacial technologies and enhance system performance via ground cover-specific design optimization, the authors said. They shared their findings in “A general illumination method to predict bifacial photovoltaic system performance,” which was recently published in Joule.

The new system installed by Novitium Energy will produce 1.295 million kWh of clean power per year and allow the industrial facility to self generate 58% of its electricity from solar panels.
Over the 25-year lifespan of the C&I solar system, the kilowatt hours avoided via solar produced at Sonoco will eliminate greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 10,235 metric tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of 1.15 million gallons of gasoline burned.
The rooftop system uses 2,469 JinkoSolar Eagle JKM-405 watt mono facial modules to power the warehouse facility.  The system is connected to eight SolarEdge SE100K-US inverters, at 100 kW AC each providing a total of 800 kW AC paired with SolarEdge P960 optimizers. The rooftop system is mounted using Aerocompact’s CompactFlat S05 ballasted racking hardware, while the system’s power is monitored via AlsoEnergy’s data acquisition software, Jeremy Conner, chief executive officer of Novitium Energy, told pv magazine USA.
“We are thankful to Novitium, our local team, and engineers who have been engaged in making this effort a success. This will bring Sonoco one step closer to meeting our emissions reduction goals,” said Elizabeth Rhue, VP of global environmental, sustainability and centralized technology, Sonoco.
New York Stock Exchange-listed Sonoco has 22,000 employees and in August 2022 filed its 2021-2022 Corporate Sustainability Report titled, “Better Packaging. Better Life. Building a Better World.” Aligned with the Science Based Targets framework of the Paris Climate Agreement, Sonoco’s sustainability report calls for reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions at least 25% by 2030, and reducing energy consumption by 8% at its manufacturing facilities.  At its 300 global manufacturing operations the company has undertaken a review to include energy efficiency and renewable energy resources such as the Dayton, N.J. rooftop solar system. Founded in 1899, Sonoco produces consumer food and beverage packaging as well as industrial packaging products, and has placed on Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for the past four years.
Formerly known as National Energy Partners, Vorhees, N.J.-based Novitium is a commercial and industrial solar developer that has developed a $100 million portfolio consisting of rooftop, carport and ground-mounted systems for corporations, educational facilities and non-profit organizations across New Jersey.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, New Jersey is ranked the eighth largest solar state in the U.S., producing 4.27 GW of solar energy at about 170 facilities, with solar accounting for 6.7% of the Garden State’s energy mix through September 30.
Unlike other states, where capacity figures can be driven by one specific type of solar installation, New Jersey has a healthy mix of residential, commercial and industrial (C&I), utility-scale.  Over the next five years, the state is expected to bring online an additional 2 GW of new solar projects.
Besides Sonoco, a number of corporations procure solar energy in New Jersey, including Prologis, Amazon and Hartz Mountain Industries. Hartz’s 8.5 MW solar project in Hamilton, N.J. is currently the largest C&I solar project in the state.
The Garden State is home to a number of active solar developers and independent power producers such as Soltage, Nautilus Solar Energy, CS Energy and Core Development Group.
