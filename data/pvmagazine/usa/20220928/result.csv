The act is expected to lead to shortened project times and lower permit costs for residential solar. 
The law is a welcome change to rooftop solar installers and customers, who rely on short project timelines for a positive customer experience. Projects with a nameplate capacity of 38.4 kW and below are eligible for automated permitting.
The bill states that to reach its clean energy goals, California may need to deploy up to 6 GW of new renewable energy and storage resources annually.
“This bill will help cities and counties go big on solar by cutting permitting costs and wait times. With solar permitting legislation passed, it’s exciting that more Californians can now tap into this abundant energy source,” said Steven King, clean energy advocate, Environment California.
“California’s substantial network of rooftop solar and battery storage helped avoid rolling blackouts during the latest heat wave’s peak. Now these technologies will be even easier for consumers to get their hands on. We need to do all we can to eliminate barriers to further adoption of solar and storage,” said King.
The law is also aimed at reducing permitting costs, which represent part of the acute problem of soft costs in the U.S. rooftop solar market.
A soft cost is anything not directly related to the construction of the system, and includes such items as design, fees, sales costs, taxes, and insurance. Shawn Rumery, senior director of research at SEIA, said soft costs represent 60-70% of total residential solar costs, and 50 to 60% of total commercial solar costs. Since 2014, residential system costs have come down roughly 25%, but soft costs have dropped only 15%, said SEIA.
The Department of Energy has been working to tackle this issue nationwide by developing and testing the SolarAPP+ automated permitting tool. SolarApp+ can handle about 90% of solar permits in most jurisdictions, tackling simpler projects, and freeing up time for jurisdictions to focus on more complex building permits that are already clogging their pipelines.
The California law states, “Because the 2021 budget included a $20 million appropriation to the Energy Commission for grants to all jurisdictions that adopt the SolarAPP+ or a similar program in order to expedite permitting, local permitting jurisdictions can and should be required to adopt SolarAPP+ or a similar program for automated permitting in order to promote the development of solar and storage to help meet the state’s clean energy needs.”
The law exempts cities with populations of fewer than 5,000 and counties with populations of fewer than 150,000, including each city within that county. Cities with a population of 50,000 or fewer must satisfy the law’s requirements by September 30, 2024, while cities, counties, and cities and counties with populations greater than 50,000 are required to satisfy the requirements by September 30, 2023.
This July, California launched an incentive program for cities to adopt SolarAPP+. The program, called CalAPP, provides grants and assistance to cover the staff time and other resources spent on adoption. The maximum grant sizes range between $40,000 and $100,000 depending on population. The grants are non-competitive and the application is simple.
“CalAPP is a quadruple win,” said Jeanine Cotter, president and CEO of Luminalt, a solar installation company in the Bay Area. “Everyday, we devote a ton of resources to obtaining permits for our clients to go solar. By encouraging cities to adopt the best practice of automating permitting, CalAPP will slash costs for building departments, installers, and customers, leading to solar on more roofs, which in turn will reduce global warming emissions.”
SB 379 was co-sponsored by Environment California and SPUR, introduced by Sen. Scott Wiener and co-authored by Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi. It was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. Full text of the law can be found here.
“As record-breaking heat waves tax the state’s electric grid, transitioning away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy has never been more urgent,” said King. “Signing SB 379 into law marks an important step in expanding access to clean, renewable solar energy throughout California.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/28/strategies-to-maximize-clean-energy-development-while-being-good-land-stewards/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022",Strategies to maximize clean energy development while being good land stewards,"With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and solar contracts setting records, development of utility-scale solar farms is expected to accelerate. As a result, large-scale project siting will become a challenge. The Solar and Storage Industries Institute (SI2) took a look at the issue of siting and released a whitepaper on strategies that maximize clean energy development while preserving natural ecosystems and community character.
The whitepaper, Large-Scale Solar Siting: Encouraging Ecosystem Enhancement and Conservation While Producing Much Needed Zero-Carbon Electricity, makes recommendations for actions that companies can take to engage with communities and minimize impacts to surrounding lands and communities, in an effort to improve the siting and permitting process.
“Solar development and environmental conservation are not at odds — there is more common ground than many people realize,” said David Gahl, executive director of SI2 and lead author of the paper. “SI2 also found that the conservation benefits of solar power go far beyond the clean electricity pumped into the grid. Regulators and federal agencies can go a step further and take these benefits into account when approving large-scale solar projects.”
The paper defines major projects as anything greater than 1 MW in capacity consistent with the projects in the Solar Energy Industries Association “Major Solar Projects List.” One only has to look at recent installations to see the extent of the land needed for future growth. Last year, for example, 17 GW direct current (dc) capacity was installed, and those in development totaled 80.2 GWdc of capacity, roughly equivalent to 40 significantly-sized nuclear generating stations.
With significantly more projects coming online by 2050, the issue of land use is also significant. The DOE estimates that the acreage required for the expected build-out by 2050 would be approximately equivalent to the size of the state of Maryland.
The white paper recommends that decision makers rely on existing law for project development, which requires environmental impact assessments and early engagement with the local community. It advises against new restrictions for renewable energy projects are unnecessary and may cause confusion, which could lengthen the permitting and siting process.
The study points out that demand could be met by using less than 10% of already disturbed lands, such as landfills, brownfields and parking lots, yet not all of these sites are within close proximity to infrastructure or may not be suitable to development.
Solar siting can run into opposition by community members, often based on false information. But to reach an emissions-free grid, the amount of land used for solar needs to grow, and therefore the public perceptions need to be addressed. Solar can be pitched as a tool to preserving land because, unlike putting in a shopping mall, at the end of its useful life the racking system and panels can be removed.
Solar facilities on farmland can retain crop production, with many examples of agrivoltaic installations proving the benefits of dual-use solar. Touting the conservation benefits is a good place to start, and potential benefits should be factored into the permitting process.
States can also help by developing clean energy project development tools for local governments.
“When it comes to new development or infrastructure projects, community engagement is key,” Gahl said. “There is no replacement for talking to community members early and often, and developers must carefully listen to community members and act on any local concerns. If solar companies don’t turn their attention to thoughtful community engagement, we are going to have a difficult time deploying the amount of solar and storage we need to rapidly decarbonize the grid.”

The paper outlines steps to local permitting. With over 90,000 local governments across the U.S., there is significant variation as well as overlap in the permitting process. The report provides three foundational principles of local permits, a framework for development, and more guidance for local governments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/28/virtual-power-plants-vpp-to-unlock-energy-savings-backup-power-for-renters/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022","Virtual Power Plants (VPP) to unlock energy savings, backup power for renters","California multifamily renters will soon have access to a variety of services classified as virtual power plants (VPPs), which connect an underserved market with clean energy, bill savings, backup power, and more. 
Jigar Shah, director of the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, wrote about VPPs in a recent issue of pv magazine: 
“A VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources like PV, energy storage, EV chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances). VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants.” 
Shah said that the growth of VPP is held back not by technological innovation, but lack of debt financing for unfamiliar technologies, and the ability of innovative grid-scale solutions to tap into viable business models.
One such company that has demonstrated a viable model, PearlX, self-described as a flexible energy provider, recently announced the launch of a multi-family virtual power plant (VPP) service in California.
“Project Flexifornia” is a solar and storage VPP for California renters, initially targeted for a set of 1,400 apartments across five communities in Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) territories. The new VPP service follows the company’s implementation of a VPP multi-family project in Texas earlier this year.
Under the program, tenants will gain access to solar, storage, and electrification services on-site, including smart thermostats and EV charging. PearlX said renters will receive a 5% to 10% discount on electricity bills at no cost. Renters will also have the benefit of backup power via battery energy storage during grid blackouts.
The company said the platform addresses multi-family renters of all incomes. Low-income with past credit issues can access the service via a custom “non-credit” underwriting process. Property owners who participate will hold a cash-yielding asset at their housing community at no cost to them, actualized through annual lease payments from PearlX.
PearlX raised $67.2 million in a Series B funding round to scale this service. The company is now valued at $115 million.
The round was led by Lombard Odier Asset Management (USA) Corp., using funds under its management. These funds include the LOIM Sustainable Private Credit Strategy managed by Peter Pulkkinen and Rhys Marsh, which was recently backed by the Environment Agency Pension Fund (UK).
“Multi-family remains the largest unaddressed real estate segment in the U.S. for electrification and decarbonization. At 45% of the nation’s housing stock, single family renters have serious bargaining power. We are unlocking that power through participation from renters, including low-income communities, giving them what they want: energy choice, lower prices and protection from extreme weather and grid failures,” said Michael Huerta, PearlX co-founder and CEO.
Taking a different approach to VPP, Sunnova Energy International (Sunnova), an energy as a service provider, announced it plans to deploy energy from aggregated “Adaptive Homes” to alleviate grid capacity needs in a predominantly low-income area in PG&E territory in northern California.
The company said its existing portfolio of aggregated customers with solar and storage systems defers the need for PG&E to upgrade the energy distribution infrastructure at local substations. This will cost effectively extend the useful life of the existing infrastructure while accommodating customer energy demand.
PG&E said targeted areas of the distribution system will require increased capacity for only a handful of hours per year, and Sunnova’s distributed assets are well positioned to efficiently meet that need while supporting clean energy and homeowner resiliency needs. 
The California Public Utilities Commission established this type of VPP program with the creation of the Distribution Investment Deferral Framework (DIDF) in 2018.  Since then, CPUC has approved over 34 MW of battery storage contracts for investor-owned utilities, with 16 MW awarded in PG&E’s service area. In the past five years, the California residential market has deployed over 530 MW of battery storage systems, half of which are in PG&E’s service area.
“In September 2020, FERC Order 2222 opened the door for VPPs in the United States. Nearly two years later, VPPs are just beginning to compete in organized capacity, energy, and ancillary services markets at a meaningful scale at the regional level. To truly unlock VPP’s potential, wide reaching deployment at the national scale is needed,” said Shah.
A case study on the potential of homes with solar-plus-storage as VPP participants can be found here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/28/residential-solar-pricing-up-an-inch-2021-up-a-foot-in-2022/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022","Residential solar pricing up an inch 2021, up a foot in 2022","Over the past two years, much of the United States has experienced double digit inflation. Some industries, like lumber, have now returned to their pre-Covid baseline. Others – like residential electricity prices – may have a little more price growth coming. Residential solar power has certainly experienced some price bumps, but when we account for inflation, it looks like prices actually declined in 2021, and flattened in 2022.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) released its annual Tracking the Sun report, which documents the installed pricing of over 2.5 million solar power projects smaller than 5 MWac.

LBNL has found that since the year 2000, the median installed price of residential solar has averaged a price decline of 40¢/W/year. Starting in 2013, that price drop decreased to 10 to 20¢/W/year.
As we can see from the chart above, these pricing trends were heavily dependent on the price of solar panels. LBNL reports that module pricing increased slightly in 2021-2022.
The report says that from 2020 to 2021, accounting for inflation, prices fell between 10 to 20¢/Wdc. In 2022, again accounting for inflation, pricing was flat relative to the prior year.

Of course, in nominal terms – the actual dollar amount written on the check – pricing has increased. In the second half of 2021, pricing increased by a dime prior to inflation adjustment – an increase of approximately 2.6%. In the first half of 2022, pricing inflation increased by 20¢/Wdc – an additional 5.1% increase.
The Energy Information Administration projects that residential electricity pricing will increase by 2.6% for the whole of 2022. If residential solar pricing is flat in the second half of 2022, then solar and electricity pricing will see a similar annual increase.
This relatively flat pricing increase is more complex when we look at it on a state level.

While average prices in all states have decreased over the past five years, more than half of U.S. states showed price increases year over year from 2020 into 2021. The researchers noted that we would have seen a much higher national price increase if it were not for the strong price decreases found in the largest U.S. market: California.
The pricing increases were found in solar modules, solar racking, balance of system hardware like copper and other electrical components, as well as labor costs.
On a per system basis, installed pricing varies greatly across the pool of approximately 1.2 million projects analyzed. There are more than 3.2 million installations in the USA.

The largest variable was the addition of a 5 kW/10-15 kWh battery to a residential storage project, which increased system pricing by $1.90/Wdc. The second largest variable was the state ‘fixed-effects’, which saw a range of plus $1/W to minus 50¢/Wdc. Adding a microinverter increased pricing by about 50¢/Wdc, and optimizers added 40¢/Wdc.
Additional nuance that ties together the state effect and microinverters/optimizers is that states with more progressive pro-solar policies tend to have a more recent iteration of the National Electric Code (NEC), which has a tendency to increase system pricing. Some of these pro-solar states also have stronger labor costs and pro-union structures.
For example, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are among the states with higher prices. They have more recent NEC code requirements, relatively high electricity pricing, and pro-labor policies. All of these factors contribute to system pricing.
One point about LBNL pricing is that it is a bit higher than the pricing put forth by other national groups.
 

Researchers noted that LBNL pricing is higher than average costs by SunPower and EnergySage, but lower than Sunrun. One explanation for Tracking the Sun’s higher list prices is that they include dealer fees for loan-financed systems, which can increase pricing by 10 to 25% – a consequence of instant finance, no money down deals. Sunrun pricing has remained high primarily due to their customer acquisition costs, which are still the highest in the industry.
The pricing for LBNL exceeds that of modeled pricing from NREL and Wood Mackenzie, which look at what solar could cost, assuming there are no adders, or unique project level variables.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/28/utility-scale-solar-contract-capacity-sees-record-growth-in-q2/,"INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022",Utility-scale solar contract capacity sees record growth in Q2,"When the the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in August, the future looked bright for solar in the United States due to the $370 billion earmarked for supporting renewable energy buildout and boosting climate resilience. Just a month later, Wood Mackenzie reports the largest quarter-over-quarter growth on record with 10 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity contracts in Q2, up 201% from Q1.
This activity accounted for the largest quarterly contracted capacity since 2019 and brought the contracted pipeline to the all-time high of 88 GW.
 “We are seeing a lot of optimism right now in renewables with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act,” said Sylvia Leyva Martinez, senior research analyst with Wood Mackenzie. “The utility-scale solar segment is seeing a real boost of interest and investment. There are still some short-term challenges for installations, as we continue to grapple with supply chain challenges, but the future looks very bright.”
The IRA has created an optimistic outlook, with a high rate of contracts being signed. But Wood Mac analysts estimate that it will take until 2025 when project timetables catch up, supply chains cease, and projects are in the ground. Wood Mackenzie is projecting that the U.S. utility-scale PV market will add 437 GW between 2022 and 2032.
The U.S. registered 2.7 GW of utility-scale solar installations in Q2, up 24% from the previous quarter. More than half of the activity (53%) was driven by Texas. The Southeast was also active, with Florida and Georgia recording strong gains as well at 12% and 11%, respectively.
Despite the increase, the aforementioned supply chain constraints continue to hamper the industry. This quarter was the lowest Q2 for installations since 2019 and the fifth lowest quarter in that timeframe.
“We are seeing diversification in the pipeline, with New York and Florida both with more than 5 GW of projects in development,” said Matthew Sahd, research associate at Wood Mackenzie.
“Utilities continue to be the strongest driver, but their share of the pipeline continues to decrease. The increase of corporate-driven procurement has made up for this – which should continue to drive more activity in the future,” said Sahd.
