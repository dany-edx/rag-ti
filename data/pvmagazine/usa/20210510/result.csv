Among the measures, Duke agreed not to disconnect power due to nonpayment on days when the heat index is forecasted at 105 degrees or when a dangerous hurricane or tropical storm threatens. Unlike many other states, Florida currently has no protections for residents from power shut-offs during extreme temperature days, unless utilities voluntarily adopt them.
Due to Covid-19-related economic impacts, more than 20,000 customers in Duke Energy’s service territory are behind on their electric bills. According to Vote Solar, targeting low-income customers who are in arrears will mobilize clean energy options to help the most vulnerable Floridians get back on their feet and keep future bills down.
Duke also agreed to expand access to clean energy technologies that help lower electric bills for low-income customers. This includes expanding its weatherization program for low-income residences, increasing incentives for low-income customers to take part in demand-response programs, and providing free energy-saving tools like LED bulbs and energy-saving power strips to low-income customers.
The agreement requires regulatory approval, and has been filed with the Florida Public Service Commission as part of Duke Energy’s 2021 rate case.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/10/guzman-energy-plans-80-mw-of-solar-to-serve-a-colorado-electric-co-op/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,COLORADO",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 10, 2021",Guzman Energy plans 80 MW of solar to serve a Colorado electric co-op,"Guzman Energy said it plans to develop an 80 MW solar energy project in west central Colorado to produce more than 194,000 MWh of electricity a year for Delta-Montrose Electric Association. The association will buy part of the energy produced by the plant and Guzman Energy will offtake the rest.
This is the first local renewable energy project developed in partnership with Guzman Energy since the association ended its power supply agreement with Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association in July 2020.
The Garnet Mesa solar project represents a commitment that Guzman made to Delta-Montrose to build solar capacity. The project would help the association reach roughly 20% local power generation.
The project is in the study phase for interconnection and local permitting processes have begun. Once permits are issued, construction is expected to last 11 months, with a commercial operation date targeted for early 2023.
New Mexico’s Kit Carson Electric Cooperative provided an early model for solar-for-coal swaps in 2016 with its $37-million buyout of a contract with Tri-State. In that instance, Guzman Energy helped with the initial financing and later partnered with Kit Carson to build a solar portfolio.
Guzman also backed similar swaps for Holy Cross Energy and Delta-Montrose. For Colorado-based Holy Cross, the swap involved Guzman buying out the co-op’s 8% interest in Public Service Company of Colorado’s Comanche 3 coal plant. Replacement power came from a 100 MW wind project.
Delta-Montrose completed its buyout from Tri-State last July. Guzman financed the $62.5-million exit fee and provided the co-op with an initial power mix of 40% clean energy, while also beginning development on a solar project.

The initial project includes six solar arrays combined into a 6.1 MW ground-mounted solar system, located in Stonington in far southeastern Connecticut.
The project will provide energy to four CSCU campuses through Connecticut’s virtual net metering (VNM) program: Capital Community College in Hartford, Naugatuck Valley Community College in Waterbury, Middlesex Community College in Middletown, and Norwalk Community College in Norwalk. Greenskies also is working with a local beekeeper to establish a 10-hive apiary.
Outside of the completed project, two other projects ready for construction represent $19.5 million in potential savings. The other offer another $35.9 million in savings.
The projects and their associated savings, however, may be in jeopardy, as Connecticut’s current VNM program has reached its capacity cap, and no further projects can be funded and built without increasing the VNM caps. If the cap is raised and the eight remaining projects are built, CSCU is poised to reap $64.3 million in savings. That dollar amount could fall if the cap is not raised by the end of the year.

The Laskin, Sylvan, and Duluth city solar arrays will generate 21 MW of power.
The projects include a 9.6 MW array at Minnesota Power’s Laskin Energy Center, a 10 MW array near the company’s Sylvan Hydro Station, and a 1.6 MW array in the city of Duluth.
The projects will use solar panels manufactured in Mountain Iron, Minnesota, by Heliene Inc., and make use of existing electrical infrastructure. Construction will get underway this summer with the arrays expected to be generating electricity in 2022.
Last year, regulators asked utilities to consider accelerating planned investments to support the state’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/10/ercot-sees-adequate-resources-to-meet-record-setting-summer-electricity-demand/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 10, 2021",ERCOT sees adequate resources to meet record-setting summer electricity demand,"The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) said it expects record-breaking electric demand this summer due to hot and dry conditions and continued economic and population growth.
As part of its forecasting effort, ERCOT identified in its summer assessment low-probability, high-impact situations similar to the February winter event. The grid, which serves about 90% of the state’s electricity load, nearly collapsed when a winter storm knocked thousands of megawatts of generating capacity off line for days.
The grid operator also announced plans to visit selected power plants to review summer weatherization plans. It said that plant visits have occurred in the past for winter weatherization, but this is the first time officials will visit plants for summer.
ERCOT said it anticipates a summer 2021 peak demand of 77,144 MW. The total includes load reductions based on rooftop solar capacity forecast. Even with the help of rooftop solar, this would be a new system-wide peak demand record for the region, ERCOT said. The outlook includes a high peak demand forecast of 80,178 MW based on 2011 summer weather conditions.
Solar is on track to make up the largest share of new capacity additions in Texas between 2020 and 2022. Almost 50% of the additions during this time period will be solar, surpassing wind (35%) and natural gas (13%) additions, according to the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA).
In April, EIA said that California currently has the most installed utility-scale solar capacity of any state. But Texas is expected to add 10 GW of utility-scale solar capacity by the end of 2022, compared with 3.2 GW in California. One-third of the utility-scale solar capacity planned to come online in the United States in the next two years (30 GW) will be in the Lone Star State.

ERCOT said it anticipates 86,862 MW of resource capacity to be available during summer peak demand hours. The mix which includes 4,808 MW of planned utility-scale solar, gas-fired, and wind capacity. ERCOT also said it expects to have 853 MW of operational battery storage resources, including 618 MW of planned additions.
ERCOT counted 4,325.5 MW of operational solar capacity that it expects to be available this summer. It gave those resources a peak average capacity factor of 80%. It also counted 234.6 MW of currently available storage capacity.
It also counted more than 25,000 MW of wind capacity. It pegged average capacity percentages at 61% for wind turbines sited in coastal counties, 29% for capacity in West Texas Panhandle counties, and 19% for other locations.
More evidence of the severity of the February winter storm came from the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA), which said that U.S. natural gas production averaged 104.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), an 8.1 Bcf/d (7%) drop from January, and the largest monthly decline on record.

A drop natural gas production in Texas accounted for most of the overall decline, EIA said. Texas natural gas production fell by a record 4.3 Bcf/d (15%) to 21.5 Bcf/d during February.
Meanwhile, NRG Energy reported a first quarter loss of $967 million due to effects of the storm. The company said that over time that loss could be trimmed to between $500 to $700 million. It said offsets could include customer bad debt mitigation, counter-party default recovery, ERCOT default and uplift regulatory securitization, and one-time cost savings.
The ERCOT summer outlook included a thermal and hydro outage forecast of 3,642 MW based on historical outage data from the past three summer seasons (starting with 2018). The high outage forecast assumes a 2,601 MW increase in forced outages, resulting in total outages of 6,243 MW.
Including load reduction resources that can be deployed during Energy Emergency events, the 2021 summer planning reserve margin is 15.7%.
ERCOT said that tight grid conditions have historically been limited to the hours of highest electric consumption. The grid operator said that it now sees the potential for tight conditions during low wind conditions, or during the early evening hours when solar resources come offline. It said that as the capacity of battery storage increases, these resources are expected to help mitigate some of the risk.
ERCOT said it is also monitoring current drought conditions across the state. After consulting with generators on their risk mitigation plans, the grid operator said it “does not believe the drought poses a significant risk at this time.”
Between mid-May and the end of June ERCOT officials will visit power plants to assess their readiness for the summer demand season. ERCOT said it will generally give priority to those sites that had one or more thermal generation resources experience some form of outage during summer conditions within the past few years. It said is will also randomly select a number of other thermal generation sites for inspection.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/10/sunrise-brief-tesla-shifts-battery-chem-for-its-megapack-energy-storage-system/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 10, 2021",Sunrise brief: Tesla shifts battery chem for its Megapack energy storage system,"Tesla watchers report that the company has shifted to cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for its 3 MWh Megapack energy storage product. The shift to LFP cathode batteries could cut costs and ease demand for supply-constrained nickel-based battery production capacity.
LFP batteries are typically less expensive to produce, but they also are less energy-dense than the nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells used by Tesla in its electric vehicles.
The Megapack has a maximum energy capacity of 3 MWh per unit, and is designed to require 40% less space and fewer parts than other systems on the market. Reports said that with LFP batteries, the Megapack could see lower production costs, which could be passed on to customers of grid-scale storage technology.
Ameren Missouri installed solar panels at a Habitat for Humanity ReStore in St. Louis as part of the utility’s Neighborhood Solar program. Solar panel canopies are under construction at the retail outlet’s parking lot. The array is scheduled to enter service in August.
Aschinger Electric and IBEW Local 1 hired a pre-apprentice electrician from a pool of candidates recommended by Habitat for Humanity. Azimuth Energy also took part in the project.A second Neighborhood Solar installation at Southeast Missouri State University is in the design stages. That location is expected to be in service by early next year.
A local planning board approved a site plan for a proposed 22.9 MW commercial solar energy facility to be built on around 200 acres in Calverton, New York on far eastern Long Island.
The Calverton Solar Center facility was proposed by LI Solar Generation LLC, a joint venture of NextEra Energy Resources and National Grid. It is the fourth commercial solar energy production facility approved by the Town of Riverhead. A fifth is pending before the state. Together they encompass approximately 660 acres of land located near a Long Island Power Authority substation.
The approval is valid for one year covers revised plans and drawings dated that reconfigure the solar array to allow for a greater setback of the on-site collector substation. The proposed collector substation includes structures that are 22 feet tall, as well as 45-foot-tall masts. The height of the proposed structures, proposed to be located just off a roadway, led to push-back from community members and the local planning board.
Call it a bid to win more baa-in for sheep to be paired with solar arrays. The American Solar Grazing Association said it will collect and analyze data on the economic, agricultural, and environmental impacts of co-locating commercial sheep grazing and beekeeping on photovoltaic sites.

The project is being funded by a $198,000 research grant from the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA) through its Environmental Research. Data collection and analysis will focus on solar planting mixes, economics of co-location, solar equipment risk, and soil health from 30 existing, ground-mounted solar sites in New York and neighboring states.
Photovoltaic sites owned and operated by Nexamp will be included in the study. The company said it is quadrupling the number of sites that are open to grazing this season. A spokesperson said that compared to conventional vegetation management, sheep are less likely to cause damage to photovoltaic equipment. For the 2021 season, a local farm will graze sheep on two Nexamp solar sites for a combined 40 acres, replacing herbicides and gas-powered mowers. No word on whether Bach will serenade the grazing sheep.
