The installation in question is the 345 MW Ventress Solar project, set to start construction by the end of this year and slated for completion in 2023. Lightsource bp is developing the project and acting as owner-operator. The project’s 15-18 month construction window is expected to create around 400 jobs, while Ventress’ lifetime operations are estimated to generate a $30 million dollar boost to Pointe Coupee Parish and $200 million in indirect economic impact.
Beyond being a boon for the local community, Ventress is an installation entirely unprecedented in scope for the state of Louisiana. Once completed, project would represent a nearly 200% increase in the state’s total installed solar capacity, which currently sits at roughly 190 MW, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Successfully building a project of this capacity in a state with relatively little historical development could prove monumental in spurring Louisiana’s solar market, as SEIA expects the state to install just 507 MW over the next 5 years, less capacity than all but 12 states in that timespan.
As for McDonald’s and eBay, the project is expected to help both companies make significant progress toward their emission reduction goals. McDonald’s aims for a 31% reduction in emissions intensity per metric ton of food and packaging across its supply chain by 2030 from 2015 levels. eBay, on the other hand, is working towards achieving 100% renewable energy-powered operations by 2025.
The project is also expected to be dual-use in nature, with plans underway to include habitat creation and co-located agriculture at the project’s site.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/23/illinois-q2-residential-solar-installations-are-down-nearly-90-compared-to-2020/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,COVID-19,EMPLOYMENT,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESIDENTIAL PV,ILLINOIS",TIM SYLVIA,"AUGUST 23, 2021",Illinois Q2 residential solar installations are down nearly 90% compared to 2020,"The Illinois Power Agency has given a tangible glimpse into the solar energy incentive purgatory that the state has existed in since the final incentives from the state’s 2017 Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) were awarded in December 2019. It reported that just 313 small rooftop solar projects, defined as those under 10 kW, were completed statewide in the three-month period ending June 30, compared with 2,908 a year earlier.
The nearly 90% decrease in project completions shows just how much the state’s residential solar industry is suffering, while lawmakers still sit deadlocked over what legislation and incentives will replace FEJA.
Between the evaporation of the state’s residential solar incentive program and the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, solar workers in the state have been hit especially hard. Once the funding ran out at the end of 2020, businesses could no longer take on new projects and, as a result, the state’s solar industry has lost roughly 3,500 jobs to date, according to the Solar Energy industries Association. This incentive-related employment loss was piling on the tens of thousands of solar jobs that were lost nationally due to the pandemic.
And while the health of the state’s solar industry deteriorates by the day, a successor program to lift the state out of this incentive purgatory does not appear to be on the horizon. Earlier this month, the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition (ICJC) and Climate Jobs Illinois (CJI), two politically powerful groups representing environmental and organized labor interests, were tasked with leading the campaign to compromise and finalize a new incentive program, but informed the state that an impasse had been reached.
While Gov. Pritzker and legislators slammed the two groups for failing to compromise, the burden of finding that middle ground has since shifted to the state.
Of all the bills that have been proposed to follow in FEJA’s footsteps, the one considered most likely to pass is the governor’s own Consumers and Climate First Act.
This bill calls for the phasing out of both coal- and gas-fired power, with coal set to be gone by 2030 and natural gas by 2045. Within these phase-out targets, the bill also includes plant-specific declining caps on emissions that would lead to plant closures and a carbon tax starting at $8/ton and escalating 3% each year.
The bill is not the most aggressive piece of legislation that has been introduced, as the Clean Energy Jobs Act calls for decarbonizing the power sector by 2030. However, many of the Clean Energy Jobs Act’s advocates, and supporters of the proposed Path to 100, have shifted their alliances to Pritzker and the Consumers and Climate First Act.
Until compromise is reached and new legislation and incentives are instituted, the state’s residential solar industry will continue to flounder, workers will continue to lose their jobs, and the state will fall further and further away from it’s goal of achieving 25% renewable energy across each of its utilities by 2025.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/23/3d-printers-produce-solid-state-batteries-for-evs-and-other-uses/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,CALIFORNIA,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 23, 2021",3D printers produce solid-state battery technology for EVs and other uses,"Work is under way on a pilot production line to demonstrate a 3D-printed solid-state battery technology.
Sakuú Corp. said the battery will be up to 50% smaller and 30% lighter than lithium-ion batteries, and would be less expensive to produce at scale. Currently, the battery has a capacity of 3 Amp hours.
Sakuú’s first-generation batteries use an MIT-developed binder jet printing process, which allows thin layers of ceramic and metal to be deposited in one build. The 3D printing process is relatively slow, but enables the batteries to be smaller and lighter, something that the company said could make them optimal for electric vehicles.
Sakuú is also testing high-voltage cathodes, which it said could achieve up to a 25% boost in energy density in its KeraCel solid-state battery.
The company said the 3D printing platform is able to print batteries for many different applications, including drones, vehicles, and cell phones, to name a few.
Solid-state batteries are still relatively unproven in terms of their longevity and stability, but some researchers have deemed the technology the “holy grail” of battery chemistry due to its high capacity and energy density.
The “raw materials in, finished product out” nature of the printer platform can help product developers reduce their dependency on other companies by streamlining their supply chains, said the company.
The facility is expected to be completed and operational by the end of the year. It will serve as both a pilot production line and customer learning center for Sakuú’s additive manufacturing platform.
The San Jose, California-based company is working with Relevant Industrial and Honeywell Process Solutions on the product line. The two will help Sakuú scale-up the facility in a second phase scheduled for 2022, when production may be up to 1 GWh per year.
