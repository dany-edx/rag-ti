The mission will send shoebox-sized mobile robots to study unexplored regions of the Moon, difficult to reach locations in Mars, and other distant plants.
The PV panels will use Rocket Labs inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cells. The cells are more efficient and lighter-weight than standard multi-junction space solar cells, said Rocket Labs. IMM solar cells are a space-grade technology with class-leading efficiency and 40% lower mass than typical space-grade solar cells.
The shoebox-sized mobile robots used for the CADRE mission are a new generation of NASA’s  Pop-Up Flat Folding Explorer Robots (A-PUFFER) technology. CADRE is targeted to fly as a technology demonstration on a commercial robotic lander within the next five years through NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services Initiative.
“We’re incredibly proud to be supporting innovative new means of space exploration,” said Brad Clevenger, Rocket Lab’s vice president of space systems. “The CADRE program could help map unexplored regions on the Moon and access hard to reach parts of Mars, expanding our understanding of distant planets and Moon.”
SolAero Technologies developed the IMM cells, and the company was acquired by Rocket Labs earlier this year. The cells are also being used in the GAzelle spacecraft developed by General Atomics, which launched its 31st mission recently.
Over 4 MW of SolAero cells have been developed to-date, with over 1,000 satellites in orbit currently using their PV to operate, and another 415 satellites planned to launch with SolAero technology. The company’s cells can achieve up to 33.3% efficiency.
Solar in space
Last December, NASA launched the James Webb Space Telescope, the most powerful telescope ever operated. The telescope was launched on Christmas day, and thirty minutes later, Webb’s fold-out solar array deployed and activated.
Webb is set to study phenomena like the formation of planets, and the age and extent of the universe, and it uses less power than one might think. In fact, only one kilowatt, equivalent to the power use of microwaving your lunch, is needed to power the device. Webb will stay energy-efficient more than 1 million miles from Earth, said NASA.
The 20-foot solar array is attached to the main observatory of the craft. It will act as the ‘powerhouse’ for the telescope, supplying energy to all its scientific instruments, communications, and propulsion systems. Though the telescope only needs 1 kW to perform, the array generates twice that much to factor in the degradation caused by the harsh conditions of space.
This August, NASA launched a tennis-court sized craft, sending it on a 1.5-billion-mile journey to the asteroid Psyche, which the craft shares its name with. The Psyche craft is winged with two large cross-shaped solar arrays, which power the craft’s measurement devices as well as its propulsion system.
Each array is 37.1 feet long and 24 feet wide when fully deployed. About an hour after launch, the arrays deployed sequentially, first with the center column unfolding, and then the two cross-panels unfurling and latching into place. One wing at a time, the total deployment takes about seven and a half minutes.
This is the largest solar array deployed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said NASA. So large, in fact, that the entire craft could not be unfolded during the test at Arizona State University’s lab in Tempe. ASU has partnered with NASA on this mission, which will observe the suspected unusually high amount of metals in the thickest band of the asteroid.
On Earth, the solar array can generate about 21kW of electricity, but far away from the sun alongside Psyche, they will only produce 2kW, about the same energy demand as a hair dryer. Despite this low amount of energy, it will be sufficient to power the planned three-and-a-half-year journey to the asteroid, and the two years of orbiting and observation of the body. Psyche spacecraft may make first contact with the Psyche asteroid in 2026.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/14/ontario-confirms-1-5-gw-plus-tender-for-battery-storage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA",MAX HALL,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",Ontario confirms 1.5 GW-plus tender for battery storage,"From pv magazine Global
The government of Ontario has said that its plan to commission at least 1.5 GW of grid-scale storage is part of its efforts to attract electric vehicle and battery manufacturing jobs and to establish a supply chain for the critical materials needed for the energy transition.
The Canadian province confirmed last week that the 4 GW of new power capacity required from 2025 will consist of at least 1.5 GW of storage plants, the same volume of natural gas electricity generation, and 1 GW from “other sources.” Last year, the province estimated its immediate future energy needs ran to 5 GW.
“Our government is building the electricity generation and storage needed to support our success in driving electrification and attracting new jobs to the province, including unprecedented investments from electric vehicles and battery manufacturing to clean steelmaking,” said Minister of Energy Todd Smith. “Saying no to jobs and investment is a non-starter for our government. An unreliable system with brownouts and blackouts is a non-starter for our government. With today’s actions we are ensuring that the electricity will continue to be there for families and businesses when they flip the switch.”
The government notice, which described the planned tenders as “the largest battery procurement in Canada’s history,” also noted that public utility Ontario Power Generation is developing Canada’s first small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear plant. It is not clear whether the SMR facility will form part of the “other” 1 GW of power capacity to be tendered by the provincial government.
The Canadian Renewable Energy Association presented the policy, which was first announced last year, as up to 2,500 MW of new energy storage and other non-emitting resources.
“Our government is building an integrated supply chain for critical minerals in Ontario as we become a leader in battery manufacturing,” said Ontario Minister of Mines George Pirie. “Energy system reliability and affordability is essential so that Ontario mines can continue to competitively produce the critical minerals we need for battery manufacturing and other technologies that support the transition to a clean economy.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/14/rooftop-wind-energy-innovation-claims-50-more-energy-than-solar-at-same-cost/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",Rooftop wind energy innovation claims 50% more energy than solar at same cost,"A new bladeless wind energy unit, patented by Aeromine Technologies, is tackling the challenge of competing with rooftop solar as a local source of clean energy that can be integrated with the built environment. The scalable, “motionless” wind energy unit can produce 50% more energy than rooftop solar at the same cost, said the company.
The technology leverages aerodynamics similar to airfoils in a race car to capture and amplify each building’s airflow. The unit requires about 10% of the space required by solar panels and generates round-the-clock energy. Aeromine said unlike conventional wind turbines that are noisy, visually intrusive, and dangerous to migratory birds, the patented system is motionless and virtually silent.
An Aeromine system typically consists of 20 to 40 units installed on the edge of a building facing the predominant wind direction. The company said the unit can minimize energy storage capacity needed to meet a building’s energy needs, producing energy in all weather conditions. With a small footprint on the roof, the unit can be combined with rooftop solar, providing a new tool in the toolkit for decarbonization and energy independence.
Buildings and the built environment account for nearly 50% of all carbon emissions globally, according to Architecture 2030. Building operations contributes about 27% of emissions, while buildings materials and construction, and other construction industry energy use are estimated to account for another 20%. This represents an opportunity for buildings to be made more efficiently, and to adopt innovative technologies to generate emissions-free electricity.
“This is a game-changer adding new value to the fast-growing rooftop power generation market, helping corporations meet their resilience and sustainability goals with an untapped distributed renewable energy source,” said Aeromine CEO David Asarnow. “Aeromine’s proprietary technology brings the performance of wind energy to the onsite generation market, mitigating legacy constraints posed by spinning wind turbines and less efficient solar panels.”
BASF Corporation is currently testing the Aeromine system at a manufacturing plant in Wyandotte, Michigan. The patented technology was validated through joint research with Sandia National Laboratories and Texas Tech University.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/14/user-guide-to-the-inflation-reduction-act/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BATTERY,EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",User guide to the Inflation Reduction Act,"BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of some of the nation’s largest labor unions and environmental organizations, announced its release of a User Guide to the Inflation Reduction Act—a resource to guide the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act in a way that will deliver good jobs, climate action, and health benefits.
“As these once-in-a-generation funds begin to make their way to communities across the nation, this one-stop shop resource hub provides an easy reference for policymakers, union leaders, and community leaders working to realize the laws’ impact,” said BlueGreen Alliance executive director Jason Walsh. “Our hope is that this resource will help ensure that these laws are implemented in the most efficient and effective manner—maximizing benefits for workers and communities. We look forward to working with our partners across the country as the implementation of the landmark legislation continues.”
The purpose of this user guide is to act as an easy reference for a number of policies and programs included in the law in eight broad areas:
Charts of the programs and policies provide goals, timelines, and implementation mechanisms for each policy area, making it easier to locate funding sources and to know how to use them to their maximum benefit.
The Guide also explores how the law addresses job quality and equity. An analysis from the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst commissioned by the BlueGreen Alliance found the more than 100 climate, energy, and environmental investments in the Inflation Reduction Act will create more than 9 million jobs over the next decade—an average of nearly 1 million jobs each year. The Guide explores how the law addresses job quality and equity and breaks down the implementation mechanisms included in the legislation and explain how they operate.
In addition to the Guide, the Alliance has set up the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Resource Center—a hub that houses BlueGreen Alliance resources exploring the goals, timelines, and implementation mechanisms for investments included in the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/14/could-we-see-u-s-solar-electricity-for-0-per-kwh/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",Could we see U.S. solar electricity for $0 per kWh?,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may become a transformative document, enabling a grand experiment in energy generation at a national level. A report from Credit Suisse suggests as much. The organization believes that the United States has an opportunity to become a global leader in clean energy, much like it is already in the fossil industry.
Among the many ideas discussed in the document is a striking prediction – there may be solar power projects whose levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) drops below a penny per kilowatt hour, bottoming around 0.4¢/kWh ($4/MWh) in 2029. We could see these prices as soon as 2025, and they could persist beyond 2030.

If we combine a few data points, we can see how this number is possible – and might even have room to go lower. 
First, the IRA will pay solar panel manufacturers up to 18¢/W when manufacturing modules. Each item along the module supply chain gets a piece – polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules.
Consider that it has only been a few years since First Solar told Bloomberg that their manufacturing costs were around 20¢/W – with the IRA, they’re on a pathway to a 2¢/W product. Since First Solar has nearly sold out for the upcoming few years, and may not feel enough pressure to reach pricing that low, this author doesn’t expect the most extreme lows to materialize. But according to this report, there are plenty of other solar module manufacturers that could get to an essential cost of 6-10¢/W.
The lowest number could be pushed upward by demand, as some market projections suggest that we could see 100 GW of solar demand by the end of the decade.

The report also suggests that the United States might become a net exporter of solar modules to the global market, while pushing our natural cost of manufacturing modules toward 20¢/W near the end of the 2030s. That is still 33% greater than estimates for China’s estimated costs (per the chart, above).
Second, we have to layer on the Production Tax Credit (PTC). Adjusted for inflation, the PTC is valued at 2.6¢/kWh. For ten years after a project is constructed, the project will receive an inflation adjusted tax credit for every kWh generated. Larger projects tend to take the PTC in lieu of the Investment Tax Credit, mostly due to project scale and capacity factor.
Last year, Lazard suggested that the unsubsidized LCOE of large-scale PV was 3-4.2¢/kWh for crystalline silicon, and 2.8-3.7¢/kWh for thin-film. If subtract out the PTC value, we get an LCOE 0.4-1.6¢/kWh for standard modules, and 0.2-1.1¢/kWh for thin film.

Additionally – we can increase the PTC two times, by about a third (0.87¢/kWh) each time. The first increase will come from modules manufactured with domestic content, and second will come from building solar in energy communities. That hikes the 2.6¢/kWh all the way up to a total of 4.34¢/kWh in PTC for qualifying projects.
When we combine the cheap IRA solar panels with the PTC, we’ll start to see domestic solar power PPAs at 0¢/kWh, sometime in the second half of the decade. PPAs below zero have happened before.
If we take a few minutes to digest that, it becomes clear why Credit Suisse spent over a hundred pages going far beyond just wind and solar in the document. That includes a lot of discussion about cheaply manufactured green hydrogen as well. (Will the hydrogen be produced with $0/kWh solar?) Hydrogen will have its own additional incentive of $3/kg.
