The Port Authority was the first US transportation agency to adopt the Biden administration’s ambitious climate goals, which set new net-zero targets for all emissions by 2050. The agency also committed to cutting direct greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 through facility-wide sustainability initiatives.
The LaGuardia installation is the largest of seven New York and New Jersey Port Authority solar projects that now total more than 1,381 kilowatts of installed solar. Other projects in the works include a 4 MW solar canopy at Newark Liberty and a 12 MW solar parking canopy project at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
“The Port Authority continues to look for ways to bring innovative technology to its facilities and here at LaGuardia Airport we are moving toward a greener future with the addition of thousands of new solar panels ready to power parts of the airport,” said Kevin O’Toole, Chairman at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The LaGuardia solar installation, completed in partnership with ForeFront Power, is expected to reduce energy consumption by 5% and generate more than 1.7 million kilowatt-hours of solar energy per year. That is enough to power 164 homes annually, offsetting nearly 400 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually, equivalent to 434,000 pounds of coal burned in one year.
“The visually stunning Terminal B is an inspiration. Seeing this beautiful new iteration of the airport helps one reimagine what is possible when combining modern, thoughtful architecture with a strong commitment to sustainability, including the 1.5-megawatt rooftop solar array that our team is proud to have built,” said Michael Smith, CEO of ForeFront Power.  Traveling through LaGuardia as a LEED-certified airport now powered by the sun does indeed feel like stepping the future.”
A power purchase agreement enabled the Port Authority to develop its project at no upfront cost and without using bond funds. In exchange, ForeFront Power will operate and maintain the system. The airport is the offtaker, and will pay a fixed, below-market rate for electricity, which is locked in for the 20-year duration of the agreement.

In more digestible terms, FERC has begun the process of instituting reforms intended to remedy deficiencies in existing regional transmission planning and cost allocation requirements, like the realities that our current grid is currently dealing with much more load than was ever intended and was not designed to accommodate the levels of renewable generation being connected. Within the decision, FERC shares that it will require public utility transmission providers to conduct Long-Term Regional Transmission Planning on a sufficiently forward-looking basis to meet transmission needs driven by changes in the resource mix and demand.
Public utility transmission providers will be required to:
FERC originally issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on regional transmission planning, cost allocation and generator interconnection in July 2021, and today’s decision provides the first step for the rules to become finalized, action that has been well-met by renewable energy advocates, including American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) President and CEO, Gregory Wetstone.
“A 21st century economy needs a 21st century grid, and FERC’s new rulemaking on transmission is a long-overdue step in the right direction,” he said. “This proposed rule addresses the need for long-term transmission planning that accounts for the grid of the future, which is vital for improving system resilience, keeping costs low for consumers, and delivering the clean power that Americans deserve. ACORE also strongly supports the inclusion of grid-enhancing technologies within such planning efforts.”
Wetstone went on to urge the Commission to finalize the rule “expeditiously” and begin on additional rulemaking procedures to help upgrade Nationl transmission infrastructure that will allow the US to embrace a clean energy future.
In July 2021, more than two dozen organizations, including ACORE, sent a letter to FERC Commissioners expressing their support for large-scale transmission reform.

Jadex Inc., a manufacturing company headquartered in Greer, South Carolina, announced that the company has signed on with Dynamic Energy, and will purchase the electricity generated by the Norridgewock Solar Project to power operations at its LifeMade manufacturing facility in East Wilton, Maine. Through the solar project’s generated utility bill credits, Jadex will recognize a significant reduction in its annual electricity spend and benefit from the renewable generation.
The Norridgewock project is part of an 11-project, 75 MW solar portfolio that Dynamic Energy is developing and constructing throughout Central Maine Power and Versant’s utility territories in Maine, all of which are expected to be operational by the end of 2023. In December 2021, Dynamic Energy finalized definitive asset sale agreements with the Renewable Power Group of Goldman Sachs Asset Management for the projects included in the Maine portfolio. All of the projects within the portfolio were developed under Maine’s net energy bill credit program.
During the development phase, which began in early 2019, Dynamic worked primarily with Maine-based companies to provide services and expertise in such areas as permit acquisition, geotechnical and environmental, land title and legal matters, and civil and electrical engineering.
While the company is headquartered in Pennsylvania, Dynamic Energy’s development footprint spans the East Coast, with projects in Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and as far west as Illinois. LifeMade’s East Wilton manufacturing facility produces disposable cutlery, temperature-controlled packaging, and single-use consumer goods.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/21/salient-energy-develops-zinc-ion-battery-for-residential-applications/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 21, 2022",Salient Energy develops Zinc-ion battery for residential applications,"From pv magazine global.
Canada-based Salient Energy has developed a zinc-ion battery for stationary energy storage in residential applications.
“The batteries are currently manufactured at our facility in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, with a capacity of 100 batteries per month,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Currently, we are in the process of ramping up production at this same facility to the pilot scale to support pilot projects in the residential space. We are also developing our first gigafactory plant design, which will be located in the USA or Canada.”
According to the manufacturer, its zinc-ion battery acts the same way as existing lithium-ion storage systems. “The battery can respond almost instantaneously to store or deliver clean power as needed. Since it has similar power capabilities to Li-ion, it is also well-suited for short-duration storage, which is a term for energy storage systems that can completely charge or discharge in just a few hours,” the spokesperson explained.
“Generally, zinc-ion energy storage systems function the same as lithium-ion, with the important differences between the two being in cost, safety, and supply chain abundance as opposed to performance. Additionally, its water-based chemistry eliminates the risk of fire, making it a safe alternative to existing systems.”
The battery measures 26 cm x 24 cm x 1.2 cm and weighs in at 1.3 kg. Its rated capacity is 60 Ah and the nominal voltage is 1.3 V. The volumetric energy density is 100 Wh/L and the gravimetric energy density is 60 Wh/kg. The shelf life for two weeks is 100% and that for six months is 95%.
“Our initial focus is on the residential market, specifically starting with targeting homebuilders who are developing net-zero homes and communities,” the spokesperson continued. “We are starting with residential because of how important safety is to this market – we know that our zero fire-risk systems will greatly simplify installation and peace of mind to homeowners. We plan on expanding from residential into industrial energy storage and utility scale systems built for the grid.”
Zinc-ion has lagged behind other storage technologies due to challenges in controlling side reactions that both limit reversible charging at the anode and cause the cathode to fall apart. Zinc-ion, however, still has the potential for good energy storage performance out of cheap, abundant materials.
According to a recent study from the University of Bremen in Germany, the two main hurdles that must be overcome for zinc-ion batteries in future research are the increase of the specific energy of the full Zn-ion cell and the prevention of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction occurring during the Zn electrodeposition step.

As the number of electric vehicles (EVs) grows (including larger trucks and buses), their batteries can be used to add support the grid.
A bidirectional EV fleet could serve as both a clean transportation as well as an energy storage asset that sends power back to everything from critical loads and homes to the grid. A bidirectional fleet could also create new revenue opportunities for EV owners or fleets.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) conservatively estimates that 130 million electric vehicles (EVs) will be on the road globally by 2030.  Bidirectional plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) offer an opportunity to support the grid, enhancing security, resilience, and economic vitality.
“The MOU signed today represents a collaborative approach to researching and developing novel technologies that will help unify the clean energy and transportation sectors while getting more American consumers into electric vehicles,” said Deputy Secretary of Energy Dave Turk. “Integrating charging technology that powers vehicles and simultaneously pushes energy back into the electrical grid is a win-win for the future of clean transportation and our energy resilience overall.”
To tackle the technical challenges of Vehicle Grid Integration (VGI), the DOE is the EVs@scale lab consortium, which brings together six DOE national laboratories to conduct RD&D in the areas of Smart Charge Management, High Power Charging and Facilities, dynamic Wireless Charging, Codes and Standards, and Cyber Physical Security.
The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 11 and the National Electric Contractors Association Los Angeles have both signed on, demonstrating a commitment to building a skilled and qualified workforce needed to install bidirectional PEV charging infrastructure.
Participants in the V2X MOU include the United States Department of Energy’s Offices of Vehicle Technologies, Electricity, Technology Transitions, and Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, as well as The California Energy Commission, The California Public Utilities Commission, The City of Lancaster and City of Lancaster Community Choice Aggregator, The City of Los Angeles, Fermata Energy, First Student, Ford Motor Company, General Motors LLC, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers– Chapter 11, Lion Electric Inc., Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Lucid Group, Inc. (Lucid Motors), the National Electrical Contractors Association – Los Angeles, Nissan, Nuvve Holding Corp., Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Rhombus, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, San Diego Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and Zeem Solutions.
“This groundbreaking agreement couldn’t come at better time as the EV market is taking off and the grid is moving towards 100 percent clean electricity in California and beyond,” said California Energy Commission (CEC) Commissioner Patty Monahan. “Unlocking vehicle-to-everything integration is critical to fully realizing our clean energy future and this new collaborative is a significant step in the right direction bringing all the players involved together to move the market forward.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/21/texas-solar-is-booming-but-batteries-are-not-included-2/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 21, 2022","Texas solar is booming, but batteries are not included","California has been the unquestioned leader in the energy transition, and it has matured to a solar plus battery market. Looking ahead, the state has 16 GW of projects with signed interconnection agreements in hand and a projected commercial operation date (COD) through the end of 2024. Almost 99% of these projects are solar plus energy storage hybrid projects.
Meanwhile, under those same parameters, Texas has a whopping 28 GW of solar on the way, or 50% more than California in a three-year horizon.
But Texas solar projects often come with a “batteries not included” designation. In the Lone Star State, among Interconnection Agreement-signed projects expected to reach COD through 2024, only 28% of the 120 solar projects with completed are solar + battery projects. Again, this compares to nearly 99% of solar projects in California.
These insights were gleaned by PV intel, which took a deep dive into the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) interconnection queues to see what may lie ahead for projects designated as utility scale.
PV intel found that when viewing the ERCOT and CAISO queues, in Texas PV plus battery hybrid projects meeting the above description total 9.1 GW in solar capacity, and just under 1.5 GW in storage. This compares to California, which has a solar capacity of 16.4 GW of projects under those criteria, and has matched a vast portion of it with 13 GW of storage.

There are vast differences in the profile of sector distribution between the states, as well. California represents nearly 50% of the US residential solar market, and residential’s share in the state’s PV electric generation is significant. Texas has yet to mature its rooftop solar market as fully as California.
The Energy Information Administration reports that through 2021, residential solar generated 12,383 GWh of energy in California, out of a total PV generation across all sectors of 52,057 GWh, which means residential solar provided 23.79% of solar’s share. Compare this to Texas, where 16,364 GWh of solar electricity was generated, and residential solar provided 1,848 GWh, or about 11.29%.
Two philosophies
California, now with an increasingly higher penetration of solar in its generation mix, is known for encountering issues with the “duck curve,” where solar energy floods the grid mid-day and forces other sources of power to ramp up quickly in the evening to meet demand when the sun goes down. This has led to demand-response programs, natural gas peaker plants, and a huge boom in batteries.
“Energy is not just technological, it’s also social. I think it’s fair to say that Texas is a very Libertarian state while California is more Communitarian – which is not the same thing as Communism. Simply put, the focus is more on the individual in Texas and more on community in California. Policies and regulations (or deregulation) that reflect these different world views have emerged in each state over time. These policies contribute greatly to the trends we now see in how solar and battery technologies are deployed very differently in each state,” said Jason O’Leary, principal analyst at PV intel.
In California, the energy transition is largely dictated by an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) that is administered by the Public Utilities Commission. IRPs require utilities to present 10-year forward-looking plans that address the grid’s system reliability needs, local transmission and distribution needs, and needs for flexibility. The IRP requires that the “loading order” of projects approved by the Commission must first serve energy efficiency and demand response, then renewable energy, and lastly “clean” fossil generation.
The IRP process makes it evident why so much battery capacity is being commissioned and deployed, as storage serves the baseload reliability and demand needs of the system. It also explains why California is investing in large-scale, long duration energy storage projects, as it has a mandate to reliably supply 100% emissions-free power by 2045.
Texas’ ERCOT does not have Integrated Resource Planning, but some municipal utilities and electric cooperatives operating within ERCOT territory do have publicly stated forward-looking plans. There are five major electric utility providers in Texas, and thousands of retail energy delivery companies working within (and sometimes across) their respective territories. This fractured nature of energy delivery in Texas may be supportive of the state’s pro-competition philosophy, but it may also cause problems with clarity and oversight into what the needs of the grid will be in a long-term view.
In Texas, the market is deregulated, and market participants, including battery deployers participate in a pure-play wholesale market. The projects that are deployed are dictated by supply and demand, and batteries are often deployed with shorter durations, often operating in demand-response market programs in a role similar to natural gas peaker plants.
ERCOT does release a Long-Term System Assessment, which does not create mandates, but provides informational guidelines to its utilities. In its 2020 assessment, it said the scale and location of solar generation additions are dependent upon sufficient transmission capacity between resource-rich regions (mostly in the western part of the state) and demand centers (large cities in the east). 
ERCOT estimated if current transmission constraints do not improve, the state could see 7 GW less of solar and wind generation through 2035.
Energy storage is seen as an essential way to reduce the need for increasing large-scale transmission and providing greater grid flexibility and resilience. In 2019, a Battery Energy Storage Task Force was formed. The task force’s guidance for how energy storage is integrated with ERCOT’s wholesale market, as well as technical requirements for grid-scale storage, can be found here.

In recent months, the village has paid $8.25 or more to keep its smelly, loud diesel power plants running.
However, a solar plus battery energy storage project funded by the US Department of Agriculture and the Northwest Arctic Borough is set to fundamentally change how the village sources its electricity. With equipment developed by Blue Planet Energy, the solar and battery project forms a microgrid that is designed to meet the numerous challenges of operating in an extreme climate.
A 225 kW solar array offsets much of the village’s energy needs, which generally ranges between 200kW and a peak of 300kW. LG 405 W NeON 2 Bifacial solar modules were selected for the array.
The microgrid is intelligently designed to operate and supply power in times where diesel generation would be most expensive. Diesel fuel transportation and maintenance costs are particularly high in remote, cold climates in freezing temperatures, and the microgrid can respond and dispatch power at those times of highest cost.
As much as 25,000 gallons of diesel burn will be avoided as a result and based on a $7-$8 cost per gallon, this equates to a savings of $200,000 a year.
“Producing power in rural Alaska is immensely difficult, between transporting fuel into town by plane or boat and battling temperatures that can freeze generator engines,” said Ava Gibson, head of sales for Blue Planet Energy. “Milestone projects such as this are an exciting promise to the people of both Alaska and rural communities around the world for an energy resilient future.”
It can also respond to power outages from the complex, and mostly autonomous diesel plant, which is a particularly dangerous problem, when temperatures reach as low as -20 degrees to -40 degrees F.
“Thanks to the energy storage system, we can turn the diesels off but keep the lights on in the community. It also gives the local utility the ability to run on 100% clean energy for hours at a time,” said Rob Roys, CIO, Launch Alaska.
The microgrid is also composed of 12 units of 32 kWh Blue Ion LX battery storage cabinets installed by Alaska Native Renewables Industries in cooperation with local utility Alaska Village Electric Cooperative and the nonprofit Launch Alaska.
Blue Planet’s Blue Ion LXHV commercial energy storage system
The Blue Ion LX battery is a particularly resilient system, with a 21-year life expectancy, and is ruggedized to be able to support energy where it is critical, like in emergency services or healthcare, or for businesses where energy uptime is essential. The batteries can operate in conjunction with the larger grid or operate as a completely independent microgrid.
The cabinet comes with a tunable cooling system that is adjustable for varied environmental conditions. The exterior is made of a corrosion resistant galvannealed and stainless-steel material, finished with a textured powder coat for harsh condition resistance. It has a low fire-risk lithium ferro-phosphate battery.
This was the local utility’s first foray into energy storage, which was met with resistance at first, due to the complexities of Shungnak’s mostly autonomous diesel plant. “We’ve been hesitant to jump into energy storage for a number of reasons, but Blue Planet Energy’s battery technology and chemistry is the best available for rural communities,” said Bill Stamm, president and CEO of Alaska Village Electric Cooperative.
