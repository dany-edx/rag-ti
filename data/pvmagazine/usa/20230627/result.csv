With about $9 billion in government funding needed to commercialize the LDES market, the U.S. government officially recognized the commercial viability of the non-lithium ion battery asset class.
Today the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) signed a memorandum of understanding with four agencies to accelerate the commercialization of LDES. Parties involved include DOE’s Office of Technology Transitions, the Edison Electric Institutes’ Institute for the Energy Transition, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and the Long Duration Energy Storage Council.
Long-duration energy storage is considered a key to addressing the intermittency of solar and wind energy by ensuring stored energy is available to balance seasonal and diurnal (day to night) fluctuations in electricity demand and supply, thus fortifying grid stability and reliability.
The signed federal agreement establishes three primary pillars for collaboration, which will support the development and domestic manufacturing of energy storage technologies that can meet all U.S. market demands by 2030.  This includes the DOE’s Long Duration Storage Shot, which establishes a target to reduce the cost of grid-scale energy storage by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of duration over the next the decade. The three main pillars include:
“This critically important memorandum and the partnership it represents will help to swiftly move the market towards the ambitious goals that DOE has established for long duration energy storage, and aligns key industry stakeholders around a set of goals and objectives that will certainly impact our clean energy trajectory,” said Anna J. Siefken, senior advisor, DOE.
“Long-duration energy storage is critical to meet local, regional and global net-zero decarbonization goals,” Julia Souder, chief executive officer of the Long Duration Energy Storage Council, told pv magazine USA. “LDES complements rapid renewable growth by offering flexibility, reliability, affordability and security. This partnership allows us to work together to accelerate the various markets and contracts even faster to deploy diverse LDES technologies.”
Over the coming months, the memorandum framework will result in several key actions the DOE and its partners plan to execute, including:
The report focuses on the two intermediate duration market segments, inter-day and multi-day / week LDES technologies. The federal agency recognizes the U.S. power grid may need 225 GW to 460 GW of LDES capacity for a net-zero economy by 2050, representing an investment opportunity of $330 billion over the coming decades.
The DOE’s LDES report organizes the market by duration of dispatch into four segments:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/27/solar-group-petitions-to-suspend-dominion-energy-interconnection-rules/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,VIRGINIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 27, 2023",Solar group petitions to suspend Dominion Energy interconnection rules,"A group of solar installers called the Distributed Solar Alliance have filed a petition with the Virginia State Corporation Commission against Dominion Energy for what the group deems unfair parameters for the grid interconnection of projects ranging from 250 kW to 1 MW in size.
The group said that new interconnection parameters imposed by investor-owned utility Dominion Energy have imposed “substantial and irreparable harm” to midsized nonresidential solar projects in the state of Virginia. The petition requests the courts suspend the parameters in an expedited fashion so that cost-sharing rules in-line with state law can be developed.
The parameters set by Dominion pose “unreasonable and unprecedented costs, delays, and barriers that are not necessary for behind-the-meter projects interconnecting with Dominion’s distribution system.”
Dominion’s interconnection policy requires that distributed solar developers conduct substation improvements like transformer upgrades. It also requires the developer to foot the bill for dedicated dark fiber transmission lines and a dedicated relay panel.
Dark fiber is excess optical fiber that was installed during the telecom boom and has gone unused. The group highlights that dark fiber upgrades cost $150,000 to $250,000 per mile to upgrade, and a relay panel can cost $250,000 plus as much as an additional $1.2 million for engineering, mobilization and construction management. The solar group argues that the costs, plus associated delays, have made many (if not most) projects of this mid-size infeasible in the state.
The group’s petition highlights the fact that Dominion is required under the Interconnection Law “to provide distribution within its service territory on a basis that is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory to suppliers of electric energy, including distributed generation, as the Commission may determine.”
Projects in the 250 kW to 1 MW range are often serving public schools, municipalities and other public and private entities, and often come with many environmental and energy efficiency benefits over the largest-scale centralized utility solar projects.
“One solar developer member of [the Virginia Distributed Solar Alliance] was dismayed to learn, just before work was scheduled to start on a 710 kW solar array in April of 2023, that the project would have to bear $276,000 of upgrades on the Dominion side of the meter as well as up to $320,000 of estimated costs for 1.6 miles of dark fiber,” said the petition.
A similar problem befell the solar project planned for the James River Juvenile Detention Center, where a 686 kW solar array was stuck with $2.25 million in preliminary costs, the majority of which are for running nine miles of fiber optic cable and other to-be-determined costs. Henrico County is paying for the project, which is now sidelined due to the utility’s heavy cost assessment.
“The project cannot absorb these costs, so it is on hold indefinitely,” said Carrie Webster, energy manager for Henrico County.
Another facet the distributed solar developer alliance is trying to change is the utility requirement known as the Small Generator Interconnection Agreement (SGIA), which shifts project risk onto the customer, rather than the project developer. The SGA essentially overrides the traditional contract structure of a power purchase agreement (PPA) where the developer is the one shouldering the project’s risk.
“The unacceptable requirement to sign an SGIA that would contradict our solar PPA contract, would impede an already tight budget with our school division,” said Jennifer Rokasky, a Virginia school division energy manager. “It is punitive and dissuades public entities from pursuing a Solar PPA, which can help save money on utility costs and work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to leave a more sustainable future for our students. Are these costs fair? Appropriate?”
Dominion Energy said it is willing to explore other options for the SGIA. As for the interconnection requirements, Dominion has not budged, arguing that the dark fiber and other upgrades are needed as safety measures during grid outages and emergency events.
The full petition filing to the Virginia Corporation Commission can be found here.
Virginia is not alone in its interconnection woes. The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and Vote Solar have graded each state on its policy governing interconnection of distributed solar and storage, and only one state, New Mexico, earned an A. Many states received failing grades. The two organizations published a guide to interconnection improvements state-by-state.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/27/a-review-of-functional-requirements-for-grid-forming-inverters/,"OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 27, 2023",A review of functional requirements for grid-forming inverters,"Gamesa Electric recently published a white paper titled, “What advanced grid functionalities should state-of-the-art inverters offer?” The focus is on the transition from a power grid sustained by large spinning turbine power plants that provide inertia services and stabilize frequency, to a power grid predominantly managed by grid-forming inverters, harnessing the power of wind, solar, and batteries.
The transition will be marked by a shift from generation stability to constant variation.

On June 8, 2023, pv magazine hosted a webinar discussing this white paper. The white paper and presentation located at the webinar link describe the major functionalities incorporated in the most advanced inverters, corroborated by real test results demonstrating these functionalities performed by Gamesa.
Modern inverters usually rely on the power grid’s voltage, in conjunction with the current generated by solar modules, for operation. However, in grid-forming mode, the inverter’s power converter also acts as a voltage source, meaning it can independently create an electrical grid. Moreover, it has the capability to alter its operation in response to changes on the larger power scale.

This technique of managing voltage and current by the inverter, while monitoring the grid and making adjustments to maintain stability within the power conditioning system (PCS), is known as a Virtual Synchronous Machine.
Standard ancillary functions provided by Gamesa inverters include the above noted ability to manage voltage regulation, power factor regulation (also known as active power), active ramp rate, fault and voltage ride-through, power oscillation damping, and the two stages of fast frequency response: synthetic inertia and primary frequency response (also referred to as frequency droop).

While all types of inverters are capable of voltage regulation, the PCS in a grid-forming unit possesses a unique ability to self-adjust and cope with the broader power grid’s voltage requirements. The importance of voltage regulation, and additional features like fault and voltage ride-through, is underscored by incidents like the Odessa event. Unpredictable generation events – like power plant failures during the Odessa event or forest fires in California, have consequences beyond the malfunctioning plant, triggering cascading effects across the interconnected power grid.
The complexity of inverters is set to increase in the future.
Inverters will need to be capable of reacting to a complete grid shutdown. This process involves a series of steps, beginning with detecting the blackout and appropriately shutting down all components. 

Subsequent steps involve initiating the ‘black start’ process. These processes enable the inverter’s software to establish an electrical environment, a crucial step that allows local hardware operation and generation of the unit’s standard voltage. Once this stage is completed, the unit syncs with the larger power grid, running independently in parallel operations mode.

“The ramifications of each fraction of a degree cannot be overstated – particularly for the world’s most vulnerable populations, who are already suffering the destructive impacts of climate change. The ubiquity of climate-induced disasters – be they floods, droughts or fires – demonstrates the pressing need for a course correction,” said the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in its World Energy Transitions Outlook report for 2023.
IRENA warned that the energy transition is “off-track,” noting that the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and ripple effects of the invasion of Ukraine have compounded the challenges faced by the energy transition.
“Every fraction of a degree in global temperature change can trigger significant and far-reaching consequences for natural systems, human societies and economies,” said IRENA.
IRENA offered threshold levels of technology deployments that will be needed to meet the Paris Agreement target. It said that roughly 1 TW of renewable energy deployments are needed each year through 2050 to stay on pace. In 2022, about 300 GW of renewables were added. Renewables accounted for 83% of new capacity added, yet the rate still lags what is needed to decarbonize.
Despite dominating the share of new energy projects worldwide, IRENA said both the volume and share of renewables need to grow substantially. IRENA said this is both technically feasible and economically viable, but without divestment from fossil fuel interests, it may not occur quickly enough to stave off the worst effects of climate change.
“While there were record renewable power capacity additions in 2022, the year also saw the highest levels of fossil fuel subsidies ever, as many governments sought to cushion the blow of high energy prices for consumers and businesses,” said IRENA. “The business case for renewables is strong, but deeply entrenched barriers stemming from the systems and structures created for the fossil-fuel era continue to hamper progress.”
IRENA noted that solar deployment is well behind what is needed to meet Paris targets. Solar has deployed 191 GW in recent years, but must reach 551 GW annually by 2030, and 615 GW annually by 2050. Solar would represent nearly 60% of capacity additions by mid-century.
IRENA also notes a need for nearly tripling investment in renewable energy generation. In 2022, annual investment is around $486 billion per year, and that must reach $1.3 trillion by 2030 to stay on pace. By 2050, the need for new generation investments flattens some, as IRENA projects a need for $1.38 trillion in annual investments by 2050.
Additionally, investments in power grids and flexibility, like energy storage and transmission, total $274 billion in 2022. IRENA said investment in the grid needs expand to $605 billion per year in 2030 and $800 billion per year in 2050 to remain on pace with climate goals.
IRENA notes that the world has made impressive progress in the march towards carbon-free energy. Since 2010, solar capacity has grown 26 times. Risk assessment firm DNV said that solar may have to perform the act of multiplying its contribution over 20 times again by mid-century.
“By mid-century, total installed capacity will be 9.5 TW for solar PV and 5 TW for solar and storage. The resulting 14.5 TW of solar capacity is 24 times greater than in 2020,” said DNV.
The firm said that solar is expected to represent 54% of installed capacity by 2050. By then, it will be in an “unassailable position as the cheapest source of new electricity globally,” said DNV.
“Moving forward, public investments in renewable energy need more capital,” said the IRENA report. “Similarly, lending to developing nations needs to be transformed, for example, with grants and concessional loans, like the loss and damage fund launched at COP27. Meanwhile, public finance and policy should continue to be used to crowd in private capital.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/27/doe-announces-over-192-million-for-battery-recycling/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JUNE 27, 2023",DOE announces over $192 million for battery recycling,"The U.S. The Department of Energy (DOE) announced it is releasing over $192 million in additional funding to help businesses streamline battery recycling processes from consumer products.
The decision extends the Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Prize contest, launches an advanced research and development (R&D) consortium for consumer-product batteries and builds on the nearly $3 billion invested in EV and battery technologies by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
As the U.S. looks to shore up a steady supply of raw materials for batteries, recycling is increasingly targeted as a pathway to resource stability. Recycling within the U.S. is being targeted by the DOE as China manages over half of the world’s lithium, cobalt, and nickel refining ability.
Since announcing the Phase III Battery Recycling contest winners last year, the DOE will award an additional $7.4 million to fund Phase IV: Demonstration of Impact. Successful candidates will exhibit effective transport of used batteries from consumers to Pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical recycling plants.
Part of the funding will finance a “Breakthrough Contest”. The competition is open to any entrepreneur offering solutions that meet the requirements of the Battery Recycling Prize goal: It’s meant to increase participation while supporting Phase III winning teams.
These incentives push the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda forward. Financing battery recycling and manufacturing projects can generate good-paying jobs and a clean energy economy. U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm projects such investments can help secure a domestic supply chain, offering social and economic benefits.
The Biden-Harris Administration targets half of all vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. This is great for reducing air pollution, but the boom of EV manufacturing and adoption in America will need new R&D to minimize risks including:
Wood Mackenzie research analyst Max Reid suggests current battery recycling and import methods won’t meet the growing demand for EVs.
“There needs to be a push in expanding virgin sourcing while maximizing the recycling sector to ease the deficit,” said Reid.
The Advanced Battery R&D Consortium aims to address this by providing up to $60 million in funding to convene local EV manufacturers, universities, National Laboratory partners, mineral and material suppliers, and other key battery stakeholders. They will identify and address requirements to successfully scale the next phase of EV commercialization in America.
The research will prioritize using alternative or cheaper and more abundant natural materials to strengthen a domestic supply chain instead of relying wholly on foreign oil to drive the transportation sector.
And with over $4 billion left to grow and secure America’s battery supply chain, the DOE just released a new funding opportunity.
The DOE has also allocated $125 million to Consumer Electronics Battery Recycling, Reprocessing, and Collection. The funds will assist local communities and state governments by:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/27/the-missing-ingredient-in-u-s-solar-policy/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 27, 2023",The missing ingredient in U.S. solar policy,"The enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) marks a significant turning point for solar energy in the United States, ushering in a new era of possibilities. Projections indicate that the IRA will fuel a remarkable 69% surge in solar deployment over the next decade compared to what would have been achieved without the transformative legislation. Within the next five years alone, the solar sector is poised to install a staggering 200 GW of solar capacity, surpassing the cumulative capacity installed to date.
In order to realize the IRA’s full potential, the solar industry needs well-defined and prompt guidance regarding the IRA’s implementation. Delays by federal agencies interpreting new concepts introduced by the IRA and the lack of clear guidance have hindered development.  Additionally, federal permitting reform is needed to address issues of congestion, interconnection and transmission (at all levels). Federal and state policies should focus on addressing these challenges and facilitating the adoption of solar across all market segments — particularly commercial-scale distributed solar.
The solar industry can be categorized into three distinct segments: residential, commercial and utility-scale. Each segment operates within its own unique set of development and business dynamics. Residential and Commercial solar projects connect to the distribution system at the local utility level. Utility-scale projects typically connect to the high-voltage transmission system, regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and operated by various Regional Transmission Organizations or Independent System Operations (RTOs/ISOs). The differences in interconnection requirements between these segments create varied regulatory and operational environments within the solar industry.
All solar is not alike
At first glance, focusing on utility-scale solar makes sense. Large projects benefit from economies of scale, making them cheaper to build per megawatt (MW). But they come with the significant hidden costs of delivering the energy they produce over long, expensive transmission lines, resulting in energy losses and degrading their impact in offsetting emissions.  
The transmission system plays a vital role in the efficient and reliable delivery of energy, supporting both renewable and fossil fuel sources. The expansion and modernization of this infrastructure can be a complex and time-consuming process, requiring significant investment and navigating numerous regulatory hurdles.
However, it is essential to sustaining a reliable electric grid. Utility-scale projects, which have the technical capability to connect to the transmission system, are among the primary beneficiaries of its expansion. In other words, the scale needed to connect to the transmission system is limited to larger projects that present significant challenges, including substantial land requirements and ecological disruptions, further exacerbating delays and creating a backlog of interconnection requests.
Commercial solar generation, in contrast, connects to the distribution system. These solar systems are frequently located in densely populated areas supporting the energy needs of surrounding communities. Commercial solar is more efficient to build in terms of project timelines. Building out commercial solar lowers the overall grid system peak, ultimately reducing peaking capacity requirements and the need for greater energy capacity to be delivered through the transmission system from distant generators.
Commercial solar provides a host of infrastructural and economic benefits for the public good. The process of connecting new sources of generation and/or battery storage to the distribution system is experiencing prolonged timelines and increased costs. When grid infrastructure needs to be upgraded to accommodate distributed generation projects, the developer of the commercial solar projects pays for such upgrades. Such developer-funded upgrades may defer or eliminate upgrades that ratepayers would have otherwise funded.
The addition of generation in the distribution system also reduces the demand for further upgrades to the transmission system. This further results in lower congestion costs arising when less power is generated locally than is demanded. This goes to illustrate that commercial solar has a very different path to completion compared to utility-scale solar. Both are equally important, but we must insist that decision-makers understand the difference between the two market segments.
Commercial solar provides unique benefits
Even dense urban areas can accommodate surprisingly large amounts of solar on rooftops, parking lots and parking structures. Commercial-scale projects can also be deployed on closed landfills and other brownfields, on farmland in a practice known as agrivoltaics, and on undeveloped or underutilized land.
What all of these deployments have in common is that they’re sited near where energy is consumed, directly benefiting communities with jobs that can’t be outsourced and local economic benefits – often lowering energy bills for homes and businesses. When paired with energy storage, they can store excess energy for use during periods of high demand or grid outages, improving grid reliability and reducing the need for peaker plants powered by fossil fuels.
Additionally, distributed solar provides the ability to economically quantify the savings it provides to ratepayers, particularly in terms of avoiding costly upgrades that utilities typically rate base. Traditional centralized power plants require expensive infrastructure to deliver power across long distances. Distributed solar is uniquely scalable and flexible, efficiently catering to diverse energy needs and empowering communities through a localized approach.
Ensuring stable growth
The solar industry is experiencing a big boost from recent legislation from the Biden Administration. The IRA, CHIPs, and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) are transformative for our industry and nation.
Despite the recent legislative successes, the industry is currently experiencing two challenges. First, a sluggish transition period, particularly with the rollout of IRA guidance. Second, a disconnect between policy and industry needs, particularly with recent legislation not addressing the core issues to solar growth: congestion, interconnection, inefficient permitting and delayed transmission projects.
The solar industry would benefit significantly from clear, timely and concise guidance that is both actionable and capable of unlocking our potential growth. Thus far, the Treasury has released guidance that has left the industry with more questions than answers or has set unattainable targets given the lack of U.S.-made solar products. Nonetheless, timelines for future guidance remain unknown, causing unintended consequences resulting in stalled decisions on investments and project decisions.
Up to this point, implementing IRA guidance has placed developers in a challenging position. To achieve certain ITC bonuses, developers are developing projects to source specific materials and locate projects in particular areas, all while lacking a comprehensive understanding of the rules governing these bonuses. The result is a reluctance to invest in shovel-ready projects. Unfortunately, the industry is seeing projects stalled given the incomplete set of guidance.
Domestic content
In the long run, the industry seeks to establish a domestic manufacturing base of critical solar components such as PV modules, batteries and inverters. Unfortunately, there is significant concern within the industry that it will take years before domestic manufacturers can meet the highly restrictive and complex requirements and produce at a capacity to support the domestic industry. So, in the short term of 2-5 years, this incentive may not be a meaningful section of the IRA bill.
Low to moderate income 
The newly established application process for the low-income bonus of the ITC is hindered by restrictive statutory requirements. The imposed cap of 1.8 Gigawatt (GW) fails to acknowledge the actual market demand. Furthermore, segmenting the 1.8 GW allotment into four categories significantly limits the bonus to a disproportionately small fraction of the industry. To provide some context, earlier this year, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission released a community solar request for proposal (RFP) that allowed up to 200 MW.
The RFP followed a similar application process as the IRA’s application queue for low-income economic benefit projects, rewarding projects based on specific geographic areas, ownership models and other criteria. Remarkably, the RFP received close to 450 applications, totaling approximately 1.7 GW of solar projects for consideration. In other words, there were nearly 1.8 GW worth of applications in just one state, while the IRA only allows 1.8 GW of ITC bonuses nationwide.
This stark contrast highlights the significant size of the community solar marketplace and the disconnect between policymakers and industry.
Interconnection process
While not explicitly covered in the IRA bill, the interconnection process for commercial solar projects is a significant bottleneck. The lack of adequate distribution-level interconnection processing resources combined with onerous local level permitting continues to plague the pace of commercial solar deployment. The complexity of interconnection studies regarding how each project influences the distribution circuit and substation operations drives the lengthy interconnection review periods. Many utilities lack the resources to properly process interconnection applications expeditiously.
Additionally, the public would be well served if the utilities adopted fewer conservative processes in order to utilize the benefits of smart inverters and wireless communication technologies. This is only possible with the support of state regulatory commissions who oversee the utilities and their state’s solar programs.
Policy certainty and support for all solar market segments are crucial for the growth of our industry. Achieving this requires a sharper focus on rules, regulations and implementation from a policy and rulemaking standpoint. Despite industry support of existing laws, there is a significant shortfall in implementation and a clear disconnect between the different segments of solar development. Moving forward, legislators, governing agencies and the solar industry must cohesively work together to understand the barriers to exponential growth.
Directives and reforms needed
For the U.S. to truly meet its climate goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and cultivating a robust domestic solar industry, it is essential for policymakers to have a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies within the solar sectors. This understanding should begin by recognizing the interplay between different market segments and the quasi-governmental entities responsible for managing interconnection and permitting processes necessary to facilitate the energy transition.
Recent legislation has provided a major foundational structure for the expansion of renewable energy; however, it is crucial for policymakers and governing agencies to reduce ambiguous regulations and establish clear deadlines for future guidance. To mitigate uncertainty for businesses, the solar industry requires concrete and achievable directives from the Treasury. Moreover, urgent policy reforms are needed to streamline the interconnection process and address deficiencies in transmission and distribution-level infrastructure.
Unlocking the full potential of the solar industry relies on close collaboration between policymakers, governing agencies and a nuanced understanding of the three distinct solar markets comprising the utility-scale, residential and commercial participants. It is vital for our leadership to grasp the sector-specific obstacles that hinder growth and work together to implement effective rules and regulations that will foster a flourishing solar industry throughout the US.

Industry stakeholders continue to see the pace of energy storage systems not keeping pace with rapid industry growth.
In a survey put out by global manufacturer Jabil and consulting group SIS International Research, 88% of respondents said they are struggling to scale up production of energy storage systems to keep pace with heightened demand in the energy transition.
Out of 204 industry stakeholders surveyed in commercial and industrial segments, the group found that 87% of the respondents are considering manufacturing their own battery systems, with an evenly distributed survey group of end users (33%), assembly companies (33%) and module producers (25%).
About two-thirds of the survey group reported interest in making C&I battery solutions of 200 kWh to 1 MWh in power dispatch, while a 62% percentile also favored a slightly smaller 20 kWh to 199 kWh product group.
In a regional survey, the group reported North America (70%) as its preferred market, with California (43%), the Northeast U.S. (42%) and the Midwest (41%) showing the highest distribution rates of deliveries for energy storage systems.
Technology preference
About 78% of the Jabil/SIS survey group manages operates their own battery systems internally, while a 63% demographic procures distributed energy from storage under an energy-as-a-service contract through third-party providers.
More than 90% of the survey group uses lithium-ion battery systems, and 75% of the group plans to continue using the same battery systems.
A stark contrast emerged in the survey group around safer battery systems, with a 45% percentile concerned to find a safer solution and 55% not concerned to use alternative solutions to lithium batteries.
Challenges
Nearly 90% of respondents cited an inability to manufacture at scale needed to meet global demand as their number one challenge in energy storage right now.
About 58% of respondents said they could see expansion opportunities into another energy storage market such as C&I, residential or utility solutions in the next three to five years.
Those who said they are not expanding generally noted that expansion does not align with the larger company strategy and focus, and the opportunity costs for doing so would outweigh the benefits. One respondent explained, “We are satisfied with our current energy storage solutions; the opportunity costs for changing them are very high.”
Respondents cited modularity of storage deployments as a common theme for an increased energy storage rate.
Battery reuse
Sustainability is a key issue for energy storage companies in the years ahead, particularly as lithium batteries reach the end of their lives. However, the useful lives of batteries can often be extended in new applications.
Three-quarters (75%) of respondents said they plan to reuse their batteries in new storage systems or other products. A smaller grouping of 64% of respondents said they plan to use a direct recycling or metallurgical process to recycle batteries.
A bit of a contradiction was revealed when respondents were asked how they would integrate second-life batteries in their value stack. Despite high numbers indicating they would like to reuse their batteries, only 39% of the survey group said they expect to integrate second-use batteries originally used for a different purpose in their energy storage systems over the next decade. Instead, an 84% majority said they plan to use batteries that use recycled materials.
Non-lithium alternatives
Despite respondents saying they plan to continue to use lithium-ion batteries for the next decade, the survey did show some margin for adding non-lithium battery alternatives.
Hydrogen fuel cells (20%) nearly replaced lead-acid batteries as the next generation alternative to lithium-ion batteries, while flow battery technologies (12%), thermal batteries (19%), compressed air storage (7%) and supercapacitors (13%) are some additional technologies over the next decade.
