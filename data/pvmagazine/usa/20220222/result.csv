There is much interest in green hydrogen, yet one its greatest barriers are high production costs, achieving scale over natural gas or blue hydrogen, and the abundance of renewable energy required for operation. This collaboration aims to help customers address these challenges by scaling up technologies and reducing production costs.
While many industries have been able to adopt wind and solar to help decarbonize operations, energy-intensive industries, such as petrochemical, cement and steel, require heat temperatures and combustion that cannot be achieved with these renewables. Green hydrogen can help address these distinct needs in a more scalable sustainable way. IBM’s collaboration with Worley and ABB aims to address those challenges by combining expertise and solutions from all three companies into a distinct ecosystem of industry leaders to help form a repeatable process to build, operate and manage green hydrogen facilities, said Zahid ‘Z’ Habib, Vice President, Global Energy & Resources Industry Leader, IBM Consulting.
IBM, an expert in hybrid cloud and AI services, will provide systems integration services, as well as data framework and management solutions. ABB, a leading global technology company, will provide offerings for electrical infrastructure, automation, operations digitalization and optimization, and energy management. Worley is an Australian firm that provides project and asset services in the energy, chemicals, and resources sectors. Under the collaboration, Worley will provide engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) throughout the project. Leveraging their combined digital expertise, the three parties will provide O&M services.
“This collaboration aims to help turn net-zero solutions into reality. It will build on the key learnings of our ground-breaking Ambition to Reality paper, written in collaboration with Princeton University, USA. By fast-tracking and standardizing how we engineer-design-operate, this collaboration is expected to reduce the levelized cost of green hydrogen and help our customers to decarbonize their operations further,” says Chris Gill, Senior Vice President of Low-carbon Hydrogen at Worley.
The paper Ambition to Reality draws on research and analysis from Princeton’s Net-Zero America study, and with the view that net-zero is achievable, it focuses on the practical shifts required to develop and deliver the energy infrastructure needed to achieve net-zero ambitions. This paper is intended to be read by decisionmakers in government, industry, and the broader community who are involved with supply-side energy infrastructure, and it explores five key shifts needed to transform project delivery to enable the necessary changes.
“Hydrogen is at the heart of the energy transition and is essential to decarbonizing a wide range of hard-to-abate industries,” said Bruno Roche, Vice President, Energy Transition at ABB Energy Industries.
The planned relationship is subject to the parties reaching definitive agreements.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/22/utilities-are-investing-in-renewables-more-than-ever-before-to-improve-their-esg-profiles/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA,NORTH AMERICA",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",Utilities are investing in renewables more than ever before to improve their ESG profiles,"Ernst & Young (EY) has released a report detailing transactions in power and utilities (P&U) for all of 2021, with data showing that increased utility interest in their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) profiles has led to an unprecedented appetite for renewable assets and other environmental and sustainability initiatives.
Specifically, the report outlines initiatives taken by seven of the US’s largest investor-owned utilities, including Duke Energy’s announced plans to double its portfolio of solar, wind and biomass generation by 2025; Dominion Energy’s $48 million in contributions to charitable and community causes, including a $2.5 million gift to the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina; and Xcel Energy’s 2030 Clean Energy Plan, which encompasses reductions in CO2 emission to 85% from 2005 levels by 2030.
This trend of a higher focus on ESG initiatives and renewable deals began its ramp up in the first half of 2020. EY strategy and transactions partner, Miles Huq, in previous conversations with pv magazine, said individual deals in renewable energy are typically lower in value, so the total value driven by these transactions shows continued investor confidence.
Overall, the Americas witnessed a total of 193 P&U deals in 2021, with a total deal value of US$72.9 billion, a strong 74% increase over 2020. Of these 193 deals, half of all volume (96 deals) were strictly in the renewables space, though those deals accounted for just $14 billion, while a lower volume deals in the integrated utility segment represented the majority of deal value.
In the integrated utility space, 2021 saw a rising trend of global and US-based utilities acquiring each others’ regulated business arms. For example, Algonquin Power & Utilities completed a multibillion-dollar deal for AEP’s regulated businesses, including Kentucky Power regulated utility and AEP Kentucky Transmission. In Q1, PPL Corporation sold off its UK business to National Grid for $19.8 billion and acquired The Narragansett Electric Company in exchange.
When complete company transaction deals weren’t on the table, minority stake sales were, and $10 billion was raised by US utilities selling minority stakes in their regulated subsidiaries in 2021.
In Q4, FirstEnergy raised $2.4 billion by selling a 19.9% minority stake in FirstEnergy Transmission. In Q1, Duke Energy raised $2 billion for a 20% minority stake sale in Duke Energy Indiana. Sempra Energy raised a total of roughly $5 billion through a 30% stake sale in Sempra’s new business platform to ADIA and KKR.
Energy services also became an attractive platform for investors, with the Americas bearing witness to 13 deals in the that segment, totaling $14.7 billion, an increase of a $11 billion in deal activity over 2020. The largest among these deals was Sweden-based private equity firm EQT Partners acquiring Covanta Holding Corporation, which is engaged in converting waste into energy, for $5.2 billion. The second largest deal came from IFM Investors and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan acquiring Enwave Energy Corp., a Canadian district energy service provider, while other investors focused their appetites on acquiring hydrogen fuel cells, artificial intelligence for solar energy technology, grid software, EV charging and battery storage.

The teams will explore underserved communities and strategies to encourage equitable access to residential and commercial solar. 
The median income for a household that has adopted solar is significantly higher than the average US household, leading to an increasing gap in access to savings and a cleaner energy mix. And, research published in Nature Sustainability found Black- and Hispanic-majority census areas installed significantly less rooftop solar than other census tracts. The needs and barriers to entry in these communities are unique, and differ greatly from established solar markets. With this in mind, the Solar Energy Innovation Network deployed eight teams across the nation to develop access and equity plans built to the needs of their communities. 
Over the next 15 months, the teams will receive direct funding and analytical support from the DOE and the national energy laboratories. The teams will collaborate with community stakeholders and other teams in workshops and develop reports on the results for other communities to use as a guide point for equitable solar access. 
Currently, teams are working on outreach and education programs, and are considering community workshops, solar ambassadors, workforce development programs and more. DOE and NREL will work closely with all the teams to help develop and report on successes and failures. This is the third round of the Solar Energy Innovation Network program. Round one consisted of nine teams focused on solar reliability, affordability, and operational strategies of distributed solar and energy resources. Round two focused on solar and distributed energy innovation in commercial-scale or rural settings.
Residential
The Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute in Austin and Carrizo Springs, Texas, is aiming to bring solar to properties owned or rented by families in underserved communities by leveraging utilities’ low-income energy efficiency programs and Weatherization Assistance Program funding. Another team in Austin led by Pecan Street, Inc. is working on developing fair solar lending platforms. It will use community-based research models and leverage peer-to-peer information exchange to define pathways for expanding low-to-zero percent interest solar loans.
In Tallahassee, Florida, ReThink Energy Florida, Inc. is examining solar deployment at a neighborhood scale, evaluating technical potential, economic feasibility, financial tools, and programs. The team’s goal is to provide a pathway for future low- to middle-income (LMI) neighborhoods to install solar, and to connect these communities and businesses with awareness of LMI funding opportunities.
In the Portland area, team of solar ambassadors are being built by the Energy Trust of Oregon, designed to increase solar awareness in Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities. The team will also be developing incentive programs for solar-related energy retrofits and home upgrades.
Commercial 
A Port Arthur, Texas project headed by the Houston Advanced Research Center plans to develop a replicable and scalable approach to implement solar-plus-storage microgrids for small businesses. The team aims to tackle barriers in affordability, available capital and knowledge for community businesses.
In Salt Lake City, Utah, a framework based on community and stakeholder engagement will be built by the city’s Department of Sustainability. The team will host local community listening sessions, develop culturally relevant outreach tools and resources, and will provide information on local incentives for solar and battery energy storage.
The Lake Street Council of the twin cities of Minnesota are co-creating solutions that increase business resilience, build solar capacity, and develop leadership to sustain ongoing community action.
And, RE-volv plans to bring solar to houses of worship that are attended by BIPOC community members. The team targets streamlining the solar project pipeline, and will perform site identification, present proposals, and finance projects. The company will partner with the Green The Church and Interfaith Power & Light organizations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/22/concentrated-solar-power-manufacturing-facility-planned-for-california/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",Concentrated solar power manufacturing facility planned for California,"AI-enabled concentrated solar energy provider Heliogen announced it commenced site preparation and setup at its first full-scale manufacturing facility in Long Beach, California.
The site will include assembly lines, a test facility, and a development center for heliostats and other related components in its concentrated solar power (CSP) system. The company plans for expects production to begin in the third quarter of 2022.
Heliogen leverages AI to direct its heliostats to generate higher temperatures than possible with traditional CSP, said the company. CSP creates heat, steam, and electricity from concentrated sunlight. Heliogen’s collection tower is capable of achieving temperatures in excess of 1,000 degrees Celsius. The available stored heat can reduce intermittency of renewable energy generation.
Heliostats from the Long Beach facility are expected to be used in Heliogen’s first planned commercial project in California. The facility will span 90,000 square feet and is expected to host 250 full-time local jobs by 2025.
“Our ability to manufacture Heliogen heliostats in the facility enables a significant cost advantage compared to earlier heliostat production, which was done in the construction field under less controlled conditions. Our modular plant design, together with our patented software control system, supports our mission to cost-effectively deliver near 24/7 carbon-free energy in the form of heat, power, or green hydrogen fuel at scale – for the first time in history,” said Bill Gross, Heliogen CEO.
Andy Lambert formerly of SpaceX and BMW, will run the plant as chief production and supply chain officer. He brings experience building large-scale automated production lines for outdoor products with high lifecycles and strong reliability. “With some of the country’s best and brightest talent, key suppliers, and access to an expansive infrastructure and logistics network, Heliogen is confident that Long Beach will emerge as a hub for green energy manufacturing solutions,” he said.

The technology has several use cases, especially in replacing fossil fuels in industrial processes. Last November, Heliogen partnered with Bloom Energy to demonstrate the use of its CSP in the development of hydrogen fuel. The high temperatures provided by the CSP allowed Bloom to make hydrogen 45% more efficiently than low-temperature methods, said the company. Electricity dictates nearly 80% of the cost of hydrogen from electrolysis, and the CSP-backed method dramatically reduces the need for electricity, using heat to aid operations.
In December, Heliogen announced the roll-out of AI-backed robots to deploy, position, and clean its heliostats. The ICARUS AI system uses GPS, ultrasonic rangefinders, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors to operate fully autonomously. ICARUS is expected to be deployed across Heliogen’s facilities by 2023.
This January, the company netted $188 million in cash in a business combination with Athena Technology Acquisition Corp. and was added to the New York Stock Exchange.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/22/lithium-beneath-the-salton-sea/,"RESEARCH,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",Lithium beneath the Salton Sea,"Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory is leading a research project to profile the concentration of lithium in the geothermal field beneath California’s Salton Sea, and to explore the most environmentally benign way to extract it.
Brine from the geothermal field is already pumped to the surface to generate geothermal power, and recirculated back underground. Lithium could be extracted from brine before it is pumped underground. Eleven geothermal plants are now operating in the Salton Sea, which Berkeley Lab describes as “pilot” operations.
With a back-of-the-envelope calculation, “you can convince yourself” that the geothermal field contains between 1 and 6 million metric tons of lithium, said UC Riverside geochemist Michael McKibben. McKibben is a researcher on the project who has studied the geothermal field since the 1970s.
The Salton Sea geothermal system is “a world-class resource,” agreed lead investigator Pat Dobson with Berkeley Lab. He pointed to several key unknowns: the size of the resource, the rate at which it would decline over time with the extraction of lithium, and whether it would be replenished by the remaining lithium in the host rocks.
The study aims to answer those questions, with a $1.2 million research grant from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technologies Office. The federal government is the largest owner of land under the Salton Sea.
“We need better data on the chemistry of the brines and their lithium content,” said McKibben, “and how it’s distributed in terms of position and depth in the geothermal field.” With that information, combined with existing field data, the research team aims to estimate how much lithium could be in brine in parts of the field that remain untapped, he said.
The researchers have asked geothermal companies operating in the region to share their brine data. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the owner of most of the geothermal plants in the region, has pledged to work with the research team.
Across the U.S., annual production of lithium from geothermal brine could reach 56,000 to 1.5 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), as estimated by Idaho National Laboratory researchers. That compares to global LCE production forecasts of 615,000 metric tons in 2022 and 821,000 metric tons in 2023 prepared by Australia’s Department of Industry.
“We think geothermal lithium is one of the least environmentally impactful ways of obtaining lithium,” said Dobson. The Berkeley Lab study will evaluate how to mitigate “environmental side effects to make it even more benign,” he said.
Almost all the land under the Salton Sea is owned by three entities: the federal government, California’s Imperial Irrigation District, and the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians.
Berkeley Lab will convene a National Energy Storage Summit in March, including a three-hour session on “building out a domestic lithium resource.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/22/missing-five-to-ten-gigawatts-of-utility-scale-solar-in-2022/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CHINA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",Missing: Five to ten gigawatts of utility scale solar in 2022,"At the end of January, Roth Capital suggested that five to ten gigawatts of utility scale solar power destined for the United States might not get installed in 2022 due to module supply challenges.
The analyst suggests that the world’s largest solar panel manufacturers – Jinko, LONGi, and Trina – may be unable to deliver their solar panels to the United States due to import restrictions. These companies represent 40-50% of all solar panels delivered to the country.
Roth points out that 100MW of LONGi solar panels were released from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for distribution into the United States only three days ago, on February 18th. The analyst suggests this is a positive development, but cautions that it is not a permanent solution, since the actions of the Department of Commerce and CBP are still too unpredictable for large project finance to move forward. They indicate that the implementation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act presents unknown risks.
This raises questions about who will supply the solar panels to meet the market demand, and whether or not Tier 2 module manufacturers should be considered. The concern is if these manufacturers would meet the bankability standards that investors require.
Other Tier 1 module manufacturers may potentially be available to supply the product, but they might not yet be positioned to deliver modules to the US market. For instance, Jollywood – the world’s leading TOPCon manufacturer – has put off plans to deliver US products from a new factory.
In some ways, this analysis parallels a report put out by Rystad Energy, which suggests that increases to supply chain prices and shipping costs could result in a postponement or cancellation of up to 50% of the world’s projected 90 gigawatts of utility scale solar power in 2022. The report recognizes that higher margin markets like the United States are likely to suffer less in these times – but that they will likely still feel some degree of a pinch.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Jenny Chase says “it would be very helpful to everyone if the United States could clarify the rules on what will be allowed to cross the border.”
She notes that there are 38GW/year of module manufacturing, and 29GW/year of crystalline silicon cell capacity located in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam that could serve the US market. Of course, nearly all wafers are manufactured in China, and most of the aforementioned manufacturing capacity for modules and cells are owned by Chinese firms.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/22/solar-tracker-manufacturers-can-expect-a-boom-in-the-us-through-2025/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",Solar tracker manufacturers can expect a boom in the US through 2025,"From pv magazine global
Over the next four years solar tracker makers can expect a boom in the Americas, Polish policymakers will continue to bask in the success of their household solar incentive scheme, and the Japanese PV market will center on business installations.
Those were among the findings of a survey of the prospects for a global solar market that will surpass 1TW of new generation capacity out to 2025, according to analyst IHS Markit.
The London-based market data company has extrapolated the performance of solar last year and recent policy changes to predict what the world market will look like over the next four years.
The expected dominance of China in most market segments will come as little surprise to industry observers, with the Asia-Pacific region set to account for 51% of installations over the four-year window, led by the solar superpower, which IHS Markit says will corner 36% of new capacity alone.
The region will trail Europe when it comes to residential solar though, according to an infographic released by the data company on Thursday, with Germany the leading nation in a region which it is expected will claim 43% of the global market, versus 30% in Asia-Pacific, 24% in the Americas, and just 3% in Africa and the Middle East.
The US will actually lead a residential market, which will offer more resilience than the large scale solar segment that is suffering from rising panel prices and logistics headaches, according to IHS Markit, which said the United States will account for 19% of all new home solar arrays through 2025. Australia will not lag far behind, with 18%, and Germany and Poland can both be expected to add more household systems than China, the data company predicted.
Those residential numbers will help the Americas claim 19% of the total solar market over the next four years, the analyst expects, with Europe amounting to 23%, and Africa and the Middle East 7%. The US will also be the nearest rival to China in whole-market terms, ahead of India, Germany and Brazil.
On the trackers front, IHS Markit has predicted 85% of ground-mounted solar panels added in the Americas through 2025 will be tracker mounted. That compares with just 22% of Asian projects and 43% in Europe. With ground-mounted arrays set to supply 66% of new solar over the next four years, the analyst said, an Asian-Pacific region led by China will claim 56% of the market during that time, with Europe amounting to 29%, the Americas 12% and Africa and the Middle East 4%, with the percentages offered by IHS Markit rounded off. In country terms, the US will be the second biggest ground-mount market through 2025, ahead of India, Germany and Spain.
Utility scale
Spain also figures among the leading nations in the analyst’s prediction for utility scale solar projects, a segment in which China and India, sandwiching second-largest market the US, will corner 45% of capacity between them, with Spain and Brazil set to be the fourth and fifth national markets. Asia-Pacific will host 47% of the utility scale solar generation capacity built over the next four years, the analyst said, ahead of the Americas (with a 24% market share), Europe (20%), and Africa and the Middle East (9%).
The latter region will supply 8% of the global rooftop solar market out to 2025 but only 5% of the commercial and industrial segment, according to IHS Markit. Commercial arrays from China will account for almost half the global total during that period, with Germany supplying 10%, ahead of Brazil, Japan, and Australia, as the Asia-Pacific region will claim 63%, Europe 23%, and the Americas 9%, the data company predicted.
The familiar figure of China will also dominate the next four years’ rooftop arrays, ahead of Germany, the US, Australia, and Brazil as Asia-Pacific accounts for half the global picture, the Americas 22%, Europe 20%, and Africa and the Middle East 8%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/22/standardization-turns-potential-to-reality/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",Standardization turns EV potential to reality,"Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a glimpse into a variety of next-generation technologies, like driver assist, automated parallel parking, and central entertainment interfaces that can double as video game consoles. And while these innovations represent a new era for the automobile industry, perhaps the biggest contribution to the energy transition from EVs will not be what they can do for the driver, but what they can do for the grid.
The potential for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications for EVs is immense. While residential and utility-scale batteries will play an important role in future energy systems, many experts predict that, if implemented effectively, EVs as grid assets could operate at a scale that eclipses the current and projected stationary storage market.
Unlocking the services that EVs can play on electricity participate in requires bi-directional charging – a device which can pull from both the grid and distributed energy resources like residential solar-plus-storage to charge the car, and can also send the car’s electricity back to the grid in instances of need.
The tech behind V2G
While bidirectional charging technology already exists, it does so in three forms and, as The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) explores in its new report; Paving the Way, Vehicle-to-Grid Standards for Electric Vehicles, the authors review the current status of V2G standards and identify gaps that need to be addressed to unlock the full capabilities of V2G-enabled equipment. 
To understand the potential and specific standardization needs across the V2G space, we need to first understand the three inverter configurations currently possible with EVs and their smart, bidirectional chargers.
Applicable standards
Each inverter configuration will require its own specific standards to cover it’s applicable functions and safe operations, including such as interconnection, EVSE safety, vehicle functionality, and communications. 
In this space, interconnection matters fall under the IEEE 1547 series of standards and documents; EVSE safety and functionality are covered by UL standards,specifically UL 1741; EV standards and vehicle functions are addressed by SAE; and testing can be done by third parties or manufacturers. Communications represent the area of least existing standards, meaning work must be done to develop them.
The report authors recommend that, in V2G-DC scenarios, EVSE are certified to UL 1741 to ensure grid conformance. In V2G-AC scenarios, the authors recommend EVSE and EVs are certified to UL 1741 SC, which is contained in SAE J3072.
UL 1741 is widely used for grid interconnection, providing guidance for evaluating inverters with specific grid compliance requirements, and has long been the standard for inverter certification. For V2G-DC, the EVSE can be considered a stationary inverter, meaning that interconnection requirements and conformance to grid integration can be met through UL 1741 certification.
The same is not true for V2G-AC, as the inverter is in the EV, and is not stationary. UL 1741 SC has been developed to address this issue and has been adopted in SAE J3072. This standard establishes many of the same grid support inverter system function requirements, accounting for the integration into an EV and connection to a power source through the EVSE. The standard also covers some aspects of hardware communication. 
In short, the authors recommend that the EV is certified to SAE J3072 and the EVSE is listed to UL 1741 SC, which is contained in SAE J3072.
While these requirements may sound like overly-technical jargon, establishing manufacturing, safety, and operations standards is critical for any industry to scale and reach its fullest potential. If each EV configuration operates in a standardized predictable way, it becomes monumentally easier for large-scale asset operators, like utilities, to harness the grid-assisting capabilities of this technology.
Making it easier for utilities to harness the benefits of V2G will present to the same utilities the value of these assets, meaning that steps will be made to increase their adoption, through means like rebates, discharge incentive programs, and expanded networks of public charging infrastructure.
