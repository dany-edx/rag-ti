The deal, combined with California’s new home solar mandate, means that nearly every home Toll Brothers builds in California will include a SunPower Equinox home solar system. And, while not required either by the mandate or the agreement, the move also increases homebuyers’ access to energy storage, via SunPower’s SunVaultä storage system.
The agreement could eventually encompass more than just California, as it provides a framework for expansion to additional states in which Toll Brothers and SunPower operate.
For now, however, the agreement includes only the Equinox system. It was unclear if the expansion terms are geographic in nature or if they include hardware. In 2020, KB Home, one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S., said that it was the first homebuilder to offer SunPower’s building integrated solar roof  product.
According to a release, the roofing product included interlocking metal roof trays with integrated panel clips to install SunPower solar panels directly to the roof deck. The design is intended to create a watertight, impermeable solar roof.  The release claimed that the design is  faster and easier to install than traditional rack-mounted PV systems.
Sunpower and KB had a decade worth of collaboration on solar homes prior to that announcement.
Sunpower is building on a strong Q2 in which the company added 13,000 customers and saw residential bookings increase 16% and 67% year over year. This agreement with Toll Brothers will help to bolster the company’s Q3 customer additions, which are expected to grow more than 40% over 2020.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/16/aging-solar-panels-present-an-opportunity-for-a-circular-economy/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2021",Aging solar panels present an opportunity for a circular economy,"Solar panel waste may reach the weight of 30 Empire State Buildings, or 10 million metric tons, by 2050, said the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
As a result, interest is growing in minimizing and maximizing the value of PV materials through the creation of a circular economy for energy materials.
NREL said most research thus far has been directed toward developing methods to technically and economically reuse solar materials, but does not consider how social behaviors fit into the picture. Analysts said the consideration of consumer behavior and awareness can allow consumers to become part of the solution, and can accelerate the adoption of circular economy approaches.
(Read “Partners turn to blockchain to expand solar module recycling.”)
The analysts applied agent-based modeling, which represents customer groups as “agents,” or independent decision-making entities that are trained based on data to simulate decisions made on behalf of the groups they represent.
Four agents were modeled: PV owners, installers, recyclers, and manufacturers. Agents selected from the options of repair, reuse, recycle, landfill, or store an aging PV module under different scenarios, like varying recycling policies or costs.
The model used agent decisions to calculate PV mass avoided, as well as the economic impact like costs for manufacturers or net revenue for recyclers and installers. It also factored in the learning effect for recycling, a decrease in costs due to scale and technology advancement.
The model found that in today’s conditions, few incentives exist to encourage recycling. Based on a projection of 500 GW installed in the U.S. by 2050, 9.1 million metric tons of waste would be produced. The analysts modeled a current average recycling cost of $28 per module, repairs at $65 per module, and landfills at only $1.38 per module. Used modules could be sold at 36% of new module prices. 
Based on those figures, the model estimated that over the next 30 years, 80% of modules will be landfilled, 1% reused, and 10% recycled.  
At today’s material recovery rate, the total recycled mass would be around 8%. The analysts said with today’s technology, PV modules aren’t easy to separate, and mostly low-value materials are extracted. As a result, there isn’t enough revenue to incentivize more recycling. 
The NREL model showed that a reduced recycling cost would add a significant boost in adoption. Lowering the cost per module from $28 to $18, for example, could potentially lead to an increase in the recycling rate by more than one-third by 2050. 
The study also said that social influence can have an impact on recycling. For example, early adopters who have a generally positive outlook on the practice can pave the way. This can cause a virtuous cycle, where consumers not only can influence those around them, but also drive down recycling costs by helping the recycling industry to grow. 
Higher material recovery rates also would drive adoption. New processes that recover high value materials like silver, copper, and silicon for reuse could create a recycler cumulative net income of $1.3 billion by 2050, said NREL.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/16/crossroads-solar-panels-made-by-former-prison-inmates/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIANA",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2021",Crossroads Solar: Panels made by former prison inmates,"Two-thirds of people leaving prison are jobless one year after their release. About 67% are reconvicted within three years, according to Indiana-based Crossroads Solar.
The company said it wants to help break this cycle by employing only formerly incarcerated people, offering what it said is a pathway for people to reintegrate into the workforce.
The company connects with the local prison population through lessons provided by founders Patrick Regan, president, and Martin Whalen, vice president. They have been teaching as part of the Westville Prison Moreau College initiative for several years, where Regan said about one quarter of his employees are recruited.
Regan told pv magazine the Crossroads culture is founded on mutual respect, and employees are offered good pay and benefits.
Crossroads Solar receives no government assistance to run its operations; in fact, Regan said that the government often creates barriers for Crossroads. For example, the company tries to source as much of its components locally in the U.S., but that can prove difficult.
Regan said that because it’s virtually impossible to find module frames that are extruded domestically, he has to import frames from China. And those imports comes with a greater than 100% tariff.
“For the most part, you are going to import something from China and pay a tax for doing so,” Regan said. “A little government support on the other side might be nice.”
Regan said this type of business model can be replicated and isn’t exclusive to solar, however, it is not for the faint-hearted. He had to borrow a considerable amount of money to get started, and it took commitment to follow through. Bringing Crossroads to fruition took the help of friends and supporters and a dedication to quality from its employees, said Regan.
While it is costly to pay a fair wage, Regan said customers understand that Crossroads panels will be a bit higher in price. He said customers get a lot in return for a couple of cents extra per watt, and they recognize the social value behind a Crossroads panel.
It was also expensive and time consuming for Crossroads to produce panels that would withstand the rigors of certification testing, but a critical step for the company, said Regan.

Produced by Crossroads Solar are two models of monocrystalline panels, a 325 W, 60 cell module, and 380 W, 72 cell module. Both are made with PERC technology and are UL and IEC certified.
The smaller panel, the 325 series, is designed for residential rooftop installations and features a more compact design. The 380 has applications in community, commercial, and industrial applications, as well as residential and agricultural uses for when ample space is available.
The panels are made with G1 cells, which Crossroads said provides about 4% more surface are to capture sunlight over other cell designs. Cell efficiencies are in the 22.1% range, said Crossroads.
Both panel types come with a 25-year performance warranty, and 10-year product warranties.

Electricity and gas prices are skyrocketing globally and the tipping point for this unprecedented trend is still not in sight. This situation is putting the entire world economy under strong pressure, and could also cause financial trouble for many energy-intensive companies over the short term.
According to Antonio Delgado Rigal, chief executive of Spanish energy forecasting service AleaSoft, large-scale renewables and the PPA market immediately offer a feasible solution for big energy consumers to get out of trouble, at least in part. And green hydrogen represents the best alternative to gas over the long term, as it is increasingly taking a leading role in the global electricity market.
“With increasing energy demand and with gas replacing coal in many countries where the latter is being phased out, we are heading toward a perfect storm. And it is not clear when we can get out of it,” Delgado Rigal tells pv magazine.

This trend has been in place for while, but we were still in a “normal” context up until July, as price decreases in the short term were still considered possible, he says.
“Since then, gas and electricity prices have been growing at an unprecedented speed and nobody can say at the moment when this will be over,” he explains. “Now, gas prices are increasing exponentially. And not only in European markets, but also in the Americas and Asia, which means that this is a global matter. This is not about Russia, Algeria or Iran anymore … because we are seeing more gas consumption than gas production and, as a consequence, future gas prices are also rising.”
Delgado Rigal says that the simultaneous increase in carbon prices, especially in Europe, could become another factor pushing big energy consumers closer to serious financial issues. “I believe that a one-year moratorium may be introduced for both generators and intensive-energy consumers and this would help provide some relief under these dramatic circumstances,” he says. “This situation may lead to dramatic implications and, eventually, a global economic crisis. However, this is also showing the importance of investing more in solar, renewables and green hydrogen.”
Delgado Rigal is convinced that from a long-term perspective, green hydrogen could significantly reduce dependence on gas. Read more.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/16/solar-on-new-build-homes-has-significantly-shorter-payback-period/,"MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",MAX HALL,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2021",Solar on new-build homes has significantly shorter payback period,"From pv magazine Global
The compelling economic case for global policymakers to follow the lead set by California in mandating solar on newly-built homes has been laid out in a report by U.S. analyst Bloomberg New Energy Finance and French electrical equipment company Schneider Electric.
The Realizing the Potential of Customer-sited Solar study claims the five-year payback period for solar arrays retrofitted onto buildings in the Golden State is halved for systems installed at the initial construction stage of buildings, because of reductions in marketing, sales, labor and construction costs. Thus, according to yesterday’s report, solar systems on new-builds in California can offer an internal rate of return (IRR) of 40% per year on their investment cost, rather than 20% IRR offered by retrofitted systems.
BloombergNEF and Schneider have calculated the 18.5% IRR for retrofitted solar systems in France could rise to as much as 28% if photovoltaics were to be made compulsory on new-build homes.
The thrust of the report is the need for legislators to introduce policies to unlock global rooftop solar potential which, the authors of the study claim, could drive 2 TW of household and commercial on-site solar by mid century, plus around 1 TWh of local energy storage.
France and California, together with Spain, Australia, and the U.S. state of New Jersey, were examined in the study, with the authors noting successful incentives had helped drive around 500 MW of rooftop PV in the former market by last year, with French businesses able to enjoy a nine-year payback for on-site commercial systems. The economics of home solar in Australia have prompted a wave of more than 2.5 GW of residential arrays.
The ability of residential and commercial energy storage systems to enable on-site solar to help balance the grid should also prompt politicians to encourage batteries, said BloombergNEF and Schneider, with policy nudges suggested including adjusted rates paid by utilities for excess power exported to the grid; time-of-use electricity prices, “aggregation” payments to homes and businesses for use of their storage systems; and demand charges levied on businesses for consuming electricity during peak hours.
In a nod to the initial feed-in tariffs offered for solar electricity in many markets as the technology first emerged – most of which were withdrawn at short notice, with some governments retroactively reneging upon contracts – the report cautioned legislators against laying down incentives which could fuel “an unsustainable boom,” given solar and storage technology appears set to get cheaper over time.

The twin complaints allege that the fire was sparked following several blown fuses and PG&E equipment malfunctions in Northern California. The lawsuit alleges that a power outage in the area was reported by PG&E’s outage system at 7 a.m. that day, and a PG&E troubleman arrived at the scene some time after 4 p.m. In the complaint, plaintiff’s attorney alleged that PG&E admitted its equipment malfunctions may have started the Dixie Fire.
The case is Fassbinder, et al. v. PG&E – Shasta Sup Court No. 198186.
The lawsuits claim that the fire was caused by a tree leaning into PG&E’s high-voltage distribution line, which the blown fuses were designed to protect. They allege that the fire happened because PG&E’s infrastructure was constructed to pass electricity through exposed power lines in vegetated areas, and because the company “negligently failed to maintain and operate” its electrical equipment and keep appropriate clearance between that equipment and nearby vegetation.

On September 13, a PG&E troubleshooter spent nearly two hours in federal court answering questions about whether the  utility could have turned off the electricity sooner to a power line now suspected of sparking the Dixie Fire.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup is overseeing the utility’s criminal probation for a felony conviction after the utility’s gas lines blew up part of a suburban neighborhood in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2010. He has scrutinized the utility for its role in igniting some of the state’s deadliest wildfires, and leading the company to negotiate more than $25 billion in settlements during a 17-month bankruptcy that ended in 2020.
The judge may act to impose more stringent conditions on PG&E before his authority expires when the company’s five-year probation ends in late January. He reportedly told lawyers for the utility that PG&E “is a convicted felon that poses a safety hazard to California.” He said his job is to “rehabilitate you and that is what I am going to do until the last minute.”
Days after the Dixie Fire began, the utility told state regulators that its equipment may have been involved. PG&E reported that its repairman responded to a circuit outage on July 13 and spotted blown fuses in a conductor atop a pole, a tree leaning into the conductor, and fire at the base of the tree.

The utility said its system showed that around 7 a.m. a circuit had lost power, but because of the steep, rough terrain, the worker sent to check it couldn’t reach the area until nearly 5 p.m.
The employee reported the fire to his supervisor who called 911. The dispatcher said they were aware of the fire and responding. Firefighters with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention began dropping water and fire retardant about 5:30 p.m., the utility said.
“It’s clear that PG&E started this fire,” said Gerald Singleton, a San Francisco-based attorney who is leading the litigation.  The plaintiffs in the case are homeowners, renters, and business owners. The case is not a class action; instead, the plaintiffs have elected to combine their individual lawsuits into a single action.
The lawsuit is seeking damages for repair, depreciation, and replacement costs for real and property, loss of use, lost wages, medical expenses, evacuation expenses, among other general damages, as well as punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.
The plaintiffs are represented by Gerald Singleton, J. Ross Peabody, and Tommy Vu of Singleton Schreiber McKenzie & Scott. The firm also represents victims of the 2020 Mountain View and Zogg Fires, the 2019 Kincade Fire, the 2018 Woolsey and Camp Fires, the 2017 Thomas and North Bay Fires, and the 2015 Butte Fire.
