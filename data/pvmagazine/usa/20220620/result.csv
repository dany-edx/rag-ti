https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/20/50-states-of-solar-incentives-new-york/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 20, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: New York,"The State of New York has been an early adopter of solar relative to the United States, and it has a healthy mix of residential, commercial, community, and utility-scale solar. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that through Q1 2022, New York has installed 3.6 GW of solar across nearly 163,000 projects.  
The solar industry has led to the creation of over 10,000 jobs and more than $8.2 billion in investment. The future appears to be bright for New York, which ranks 7th in SEIA’s growth projection, with a potential 4.7 GW to be installed over the next five years. 
The New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA) is one of the leading driving forces that promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption. It has operated in New York State since 1975, working with residents, business owners, developers, community leaders, local government officials, universities, utilities, investors, entrepreneurs, to help develop, invest, and foster conditions that boost the efficiency and clean energy goals of the state. 
NYSERDA works to attract private sector capital investment in renewable energy, works on tackling barriers to its adoption, and works to bring the benefits of these technologies directly to community members. 
Incentives 
New York has quite a few incentives for solar at its disposal, with the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) listing over 40 different incentives available across sectors. 
NYSERDA administers many of these incentives through the NY-Sun program. Incentives through the program are provided directly to the selected solar contractor and vary widely throughout the state. Only NYSERDA-approved participating contractors are eligible for NY-Sun incentives. Households earning less than 80% of the median income in the area are offered increased incentives. 
NY-Sun also offers on-bill recovery loans, which streamlines payments by allowing customers to add installation costs as a line item on the monthly utility bill. If the home is sold, the unpaid balance of the loan can be easily transferred to new homeowners. 
NY-Sun also offers residential “Smart Energy” loans, paid directly to the NYSERDA loan servicer. Rates vary, and those interested can use the interest rate estimator tool developed by NYSERDA. Projects that exceed $25,000 can access a “Companion Loan,” which places interest rates at 6.5%. 
Customers of Consolidated Edison, National Grid, PSE&G and other participating utilities are eligible for net metering. This process is the buyback of excess solar electricity, which is credited to the monthly utility bill. While net metering is under danger of being weakened or removed in many states, New York currently has a strong net metering program in which a full retail rate, (i.e., the rate paid to the utility), is paid for excess solar power sent back to the grid. 
New York also offers a generous state tax credit, which can reduce tax payments by up to $5,000 or 25% off your total solar energy expenses, whichever is lower. One great advantage of this incentive is you do not have to purchase a system to qualify, and even lease and power purchase agreement customers can take advantage of the benefit. Also, if tax liability is not high enough in the first year, the tax incentive can be rolled over year to year. 
New York’s Megawatt Block Incentive program provides an up-front dollars-per-watt rebate for both commercial and residential solar panel systems. The size of the payment depends on system size, the current capacity block and the region. As of January 2022, incentive values range from $0.20/W to $0.50/W. 
New York is one of the epicenters of community solar in the United States, hitting the milestone of 1 GW of cumulative installations earlier this year, and currently holding a pipeline of more than 700 potential projects on the way. It offers customers who do not have a suitable roof for solar to opt-in to source their energy usage from local off-premises solar facilities.  
It requires no upfront cost, savings on monthly utility bills, a lower carbon footprint, and minimal commitment with shorter-term options and pay-as-you-go payment terms. 
Policy goals 
New York has set ambitious goals for renewable energy procurement and buildout, including sourcing 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable and increasing solar deployment to 10 GW by 2030. 
SEIA has been active in fighting policy battles for New York, including, but not limited to; the preservation of net metering, important fixes to the state’s VDER tariff, pushing the 70% clean energy standard, and revising the taper-down of the Megawatt Block Incentive program so that it may align with previous Governor Andrew Cuomo’s goal of 10 GW of deployment. 
SEIA’s past policy actions include shaping the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth Act, which will streamline siting and permitting for large-scale solar projects in New York, extending an early, richer phase of net metering, expanding the NY-Sun program and boosting incentive values over initial proposed levels, and participating in the NYSERDA-led COVID restart task force, which ensured solar work was part of early re-opening guidelines.
Project spotlight 
One notable project is the 7.5 MW community solar project in Schenectady County that caused New York to reach the 1 GW community solar deployment milestone. Developed by DSD renewables, the project was a brownfield solar installation, located on a former landfill site in Glenville, NY.

The project was built with 10 MWh of energy storage, and is part of a larger 25 MW portfolio launched the Schenectady County Solar Energy Consortium, which provides $400,000 in annual energy savings to municipalities in the county.
At the project ribbon-cutting, Governor Kathy Hochul said, “Reaching this nation-leading milestone – with more than one gigawatt of community solar installed – is a testament to New York’s aggressive pursuit of clean-energy alternatives that will supercharge our economy and bring us one step closer to a carbon-neutral future.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/20/sesame-solar-mobile-nanogrids-powered-by-solar-and-green-hydrogen/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MICROGRID,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 20, 2022",Sesame Solar mobile nanogrids powered by solar and green hydrogen,"A new startup, Sesame Solar, unveiled its nanogrids that are designed for use in disaster torn areas. They range from 10 to 40 feet long, and not only are they rugged, but they can be moved into place using a forklift, crane, truck, train, ship, cargo plane, or even a helicopter.
To use the nanogrid, the retractable solar array is electronically unfolded, and the system can start generating power within fifteen minutes of setup, the company reports. The systems can be tailored to the community’s need, for example in medical centers, for water filtration, or to provide communication services.
Previous off-grid nanogrids were run on diesel fuel, which just increases pollution in communities already suffering from weather-related events. The Sesame solution uses solar and green hydrogen. The green hydrogen is produced inside the nanogrid with the retractable solar array providing the energy to charge the lithium ferro phosphate battery storage system and to produce green hydrogen via electrolyzers. The green hydrogen is then stored at low pressure (less than 300 psi) in onboard solid-state hydrogen tanks, which Sesame Solar says can be easily and safely transported, and which fuels the onboard hydrogen fuel cell that also charges the batteries. When the batteries are charged, the H2 Fuel cell shuts down. Small wind turbines can also be added.
“Our nanogrids are changing the trajectory of the effects of climate change while providing communities in distress with the power they need to access critical resources,” says Lauren Flanagan, CEO of Sesame Solar. “While we can’t stop hurricanes or wildfires from happening, we can create solutions that help communities recover efficiently without causing further damage to the environment.”
The solar and green hydrogen work together with the help of a built-in integrated energy management system that ensures the resources are optimizing the available energy. The solar array charges the batteries whose power is managed by the inverter and electronics. When the batteries are at 35% capacity, the hydrogen fuel cell provides power to the inverter. Electrolysis is engaged at the same time the hydrogen fuel cell powers up, so the solid-state hydrogen storage tanks are being refilled with hydrogen while hydrogen is being consumed by the fuel cell.
Then when the batteries have been recharged by the solar array, the hydrogen fuel cell shuts down. Electrolysis continues until the solid-state hydrogen storage tanks are refilled, and then it shuts off as well, making the nanogrid energy-independent and ready for the next extreme weather emergency with continuous,100% fossil fuel-free power generation.
The retractable solar array uses energy dense, thin-film solar panels that produce from 3 kW to 20kW of solar power, with total battery storage of 15 kWh to 150 kWh, although 40 kWh is most common. The nanogrids are engineered and sized to meet peak and average use and provide uninterrupted, sustainable power.
Sesame Solar reports that the US Air Force, major telecommunication companies, and emergency response organizations are using its nanogrids, which have helped to keep critical communications online at the site of infrastructure or by powering mobile Wi-Fi stations if infrastructure does go down. The nanogrids keep essential services operational in emergency response situation, and they can be used to charge last-mile mobility EVs like e-bikes and e-scooters–practical modes of transportation when roads are blocked. Sesame Solar reports that the nanogrids can be used and repurposed for 20 years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/20/power-factors-acquires-inaccess/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 20, 2022",Power Factors acquires Inaccess,"Power Factors, a renewable energy-enabling software solutions provider, announced that it is acquiring Inaccess, a provider of integrated mission critical software and hardware solutions for renewable energy projects, as well as battery energy storage systems (BESS), and virtual power plants (VPP), pending regulatory approval.
According to Power Factors, the acquisition was made to create a singular offering that could provide performance-based insights into asset controls, while also enabling easier integration of BESS systems into new and existing renewable energy projects. The acquisition of Inaccess also adds SCADA, power plant and battery control, and energy marketing offerings to Power Factors’ platform. Once finalized, the deal will expand Power Factors’ customer asset management portfolio to nearly 200 GW across more than 300 customers.
“The renewables business is no longer just about minimizing levelized cost of energy, it is also about maximizing revenue by making smart data-driven decisions in real-time, and by enabling income stacking from multiple services on existing or new operating assets,” said Christos Georgopoulos, co-founder and CEO of Inaccess. “To do this effectively requires a broad and deep technical stack along with the platform capacity and scale to serve the largest energy producers on the planet. Achieving global scale is one of the many reasons we are excited to join forces with Power Factors.”
In April, utility-scale renewable developer Vesper Energy selected Power Factors’ BluePoint, a commercial asset management solution, to manage a portfolio of Vesper projects located across the United States. Once all of the projects have been completed and energized, Vesper will then use the software to support financial and commercial management of its operational portfolio.
According to Vesper, the decision to use BluePoint is a preemptive one, as the company plans on adding a sizeable portfolio of assets, and by adopting the software at the start of development, the Vesper team will benefit from a full dataset on the history of each asset in the portfolio as each one moves into operation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/20/enivronmental-group-calls-on-pge-to-design-grid-around-distributed-rooftop-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 20, 2022",Environmental group calls on PG&E to design grid around distributed rooftop solar,"Environmental Working Group (EWG) is calling for major California utility Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) to change course, and begin supporting distributed rooftop solar and energy efficiency programs in pursuit of a safer, more resilient, more environmentally conscious, and cheaper electric grid.
EWG said that for nearly a decade, PG&E has funded lobbying group Edison Electric to quash energy efficiency and rooftop solar programs, instead preserving the utility’s ability to control the market and charge high rates for vast amounts of centralized power. Most recently, the utility, through its lobbyists, has supported the battle against net metering, a key structure that supports the value of customer-sited solar panels.
EWG suggested a few high-level changes that could help rein in PG&E’s practices, bringing the utility closer to its mandated goal of providing reasonably priced, reliable energy for years to come. The group calls for a more robust regulatory scheme over infrastructure investment, making least-cost, decentralized grid planning a priority, and providing working-class customers access to clean energy. It also calls for eliminating rate structures that sustain the centralized utility business model, which it said hinders clean energy development. EWG also said PG&E should be barred from shifting liability onto ratepayers related to negligent behavior, like the neglect of high-powered transmission lines that led to widespread wildfires in the state.
In contrast with PG&E’s claim that customer-owned rooftop solar is increasing electric bills, the argument conspicuously ignores the massive buildout of its transmission system that has cost $9 billion over the past decade, 70% of which had no regulatory approval. EWG said the nearly $3 billion electric utility transmission investment in 2020 will equate to $10 billion in ratepayer costs over the lifetime of the investment.
California electric utilities have among the highest profit margins in the country. The loosely regulated buildout of centralized transmission is a boon to monopoly utilities, which need to create capital expenditures to justify rate increases in the ratemaking process.
Despite numerous analyses showing massive cost savings by switching to a decentralized model, efforts to sustain the old grid remain. In 2018, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which oversees the state’s transmission system, estimated customer solar and energy efficiency investments avoided $2.6 billion in transmission and distribution system upgrades.
In addition, Vibrant Clean Energy released a study showing that, by 2050, a decentralized grid, with solar plus storage, energy efficiency and other measures to balance supply and demand, would save $120 billion, compared to a centralized, renewables-dominated electric grid.

EWG released a four-part investigative series into the history of PG&E and its failure to adequately serve Californians reliable, clean, and reasonably priced electricity. Part one focuses on the history of flawed energy investments, part two on PG&E’s profit-boosting efforts at the expense of ratepayers, part three on the billions in bailouts for misguided power planning, and part four on an equitable clean energy plan for overhauling PG&E.
EWG president and co-founder Ken Cook said, “PG&E is crushing Californians in their wallets, it’s killing Californians in devastating wildfires that are the direct result of its misguided energy planning, and it’s harming the planet by adding to the climate crisis with a rigid addiction to fossil fuels. We hope this investigation will finally spur the state to rein in the out-of-control utility and force real reform within the company. Long-suffering Californians, desperate for relief from ever-increasing energy bills, thanks to PG&E, deserve no less.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/20/27-million-in-land-lease-payments-for-two-solar-facilities-on-public-land/,"INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 20, 2022",$27 million in land lease payments for two solar facilities on public land,"The US Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has given Notice to Proceed to two solar power plants – the 200 MWac Victory Pass and 265 MWac Arica Solar Projects. Construction may have begun as early as this past Monday, June 13th.
The two projects are the first projects deployed in areas identified as suitable for development in California’s Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan. The plan has identified 10.8 million acres of public land that attempt to limit the effects on nature of developing large land using wind and solar power deployments.

These projects are surrounded by sensitive areas, and the development plans contain the standard considerable conservation policies. For instance, to manage weeds brought in from other areas undercarriages and tires are to be cleaned, project vehicles will stay onsite in designated areas, certified weed-free mulch and straw will be used, reestablishment of native vegetation need occur, and general monitoring of plant life to protect native species must be a practice. 
Specifically, the developer has been requested to pay special attention to cactus, nolina, and yucca. Any plants discovered in development areas, must be collected, and protected, to be replanted later.
It was noted that particular attention must be paid to micro-trash – plastics, bolts, nuts – that might be attractive to predators due to their higher visibility.
Regarding land lease rates, BLM told pv magazine USA that the project’s will pay the newly discounted rates:
As described in Section B.1 of MS-2806, Rent Chapter 6, the reduced rates will be applied to all wind and solar projects authorized by the BLM, beginning (retroactively) with calendar year 2021. The Arica Solar and Victory Pass Solar projects will be billed under the reduced rate schedule.
The Arica Solar facility is 1,355 acres and 265 MWac. If the facility comes online in 2024, this means their first two years of land rights rates are $143,326.45 and $276,056.80, before hitting $541,287.15 and slowly increasing over time. The fee is composed of a $2,000 per megawatt payment, plus a land lease rate that starts at $7.99/acre and increases by 2.1% annually. In total the facility will pay over $15.6 million in land rights fees.
The 200 MWac Victory facility, to be built atop 1,310 acres, will pay $100,466.90, $210,689.60 and $410,912.30, in its first three years and greater than $11.9 million over thirty years.
The facilities requested 50-year right of way (ROW) grants. The lifespan of the technology at Arica and Victory is expected to last 35 years and 30 years, respectively, before potentially being repowered. 

The facility was required to do multiple glare analysis to determine if there’d be an effect on four noted military training routes.
These two projects are also the first formally approved since the current administration has made renewables on public land a priority – aiming for 25 GW of capacity. There were hints of this plan as far back as 2014 – with the Biden administration reupping it after the prior administration sought to slow it.
Included in this push were the first pieces of land – located in Utah and viable for up to 600 MW of capacity – the BLM pre-approved for development and submitted to solar companies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/20/uflpa-implementation-strategy-could-be-best-case-scenario-for-solar-industry/,"BUSINESS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 20, 2022",UFLPA implementation strategy could be best-case scenario for solar industry,"The Department of Homeland Security Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans has released its strategy for preventing the importation of goods mined or produced using forced labor from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, as called for under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention act (UFLPA), as well as a list of companies known or believed to be using forced labor that prohibited from having their product enter the US market
Passed in Dec. 2021, UFLPA seeks to ban the imports of all products from Xinjiang unless the products are determined to not be connected to forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. Xinjiang is home to 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, an essential material in conventional solar modules, and there has been concern that implementation of UFLPA would severely disrupt what has already become a strained solar supply chain.
While roughly half of the world’s polysilicon does not come from Xinjiang, it is difficult to trace where every single manufacturer gets all of their polysilicon from, and there could be potential for entire factories to be “contaminated” by a relatively small mix of Chinese polysilicon in an otherwise non-Chinese mix.
However, within the released strategy, only three polysilicon suppliers in the region are listed: Xinjiang Daqo New Energy, Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals, and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material Technology. While these three companies do contribute to the global supply of polysilicon, Christian Roselund, senior policy analyst with Clean Energy associates shared the opinion with pv magazine USA that the outlined strategy can be seen as a best-case scenario for the solar industry, with other companies thought to be at-risk left off the list of banned imports.
“This shows that the entity list is being used in a surgical way, targeting only those suppliers who have already been identified in independent reports, instead of casting a broader net,” he said. “However, we will still have to see what implementation looks like on the ground.”
What still has yet to be seen is the actual action of implementation, as we don’t know how Homeland Security plans to handle the use of polysilicon ingots and wafers manufactured in China and then sent across the globe for use in cell and module production. The mixing of polysilicon from Xinjiang and elsewhere in China is widespread, as Chinese polysilicon factories process both together.
Detained shipments
On Friday, an industry note from Philip Shen, managing director with ROTH Capital Partners said that JA Solar had an import shipment seized under the Hoshine withhold-release order (WRO), in what Shen describes as “a negative surprise for the industry.”
The WRO applies to silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. and its subsidiaries, which was instituted after Customs and Border Patrol identified two indicators of forced labor during its investigation of Hoshine.
According to Shen, JA Solar was believed to have a supply line entirely removed from forced labor concerns, using polysilicon made in the US and Vietnamese wafers, cells, and ingots to manufacture its modules. 
The seizure itself does not mean JA is guilty of using forced labor, and Shen said that the outcome of the company’s review following the seizure could serve as an important test for proving a non-Chinese supply chain in light of the WRO.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/20/cold-climate-heat-pump-efficient-in-10-f-weathera/,"COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 20, 2022",Cold-climate heat pump efficient in -10 F weather,"Many Americans are giving heat pumps serious consideration as they try to reduce their dependence on oil and gas. Heat pumps, when combined with low-carbon electricity sources such as solar, can cut greenhouse emissions while saving families as much as $500 a year on their utility bills, according to the DOE. One drawback, however, has been the performance of heat pumps in cold climates.
In recent years, specialized cold-climate heat pumps have been designed that operate efficiently in temperatures below 32 F. Last year the US Department of Energy launched the residential Cold-Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge to stimulate domestic development of these cold-climate heat pumps (CCHP), which can help reduce energy costs and move the United State further along the path to achieving President Biden’s goal of a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. The Challenge has two categories: CCHPs that are efficient at 5 F and below; CCHPs optimized for -15 F. Product prototypes were due in early 2022, and the first results of lab testing are in.
The DOE announced that Lennox International is the first partner in DOE’s Challenge. Lennox, based in Richardson, Texas, developed the first prototype that achieved the Challenge’s standards about a year ahead of schedule, delivering 100% heating at 5 F at double the efficiency, and 70% to 80% heating at -5 F and -10 F. DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory validated the performance and efficiency of Lennox’s prototype.
“DOE’s Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge calls on American businesses to make heat pumps more effective at heating and cooling, more efficient in their energy use, and more attractive options for consumers—so more households can unlock $500 in savings each year on utility bills. With this newest prototype, Lennox has answered that call,” said  Jennifer M. Granholm, US Secretary of Energy. “Tapping into the emerging clean energy market is a huge economic opportunity that will bring a bolstered manufacturing sector, good paying jobs, and a brighter, cleaner future to Texas and communities across America.”
Lennox is one of nine manufacturers competing in the CCHP Technology Challenge. The next step for this product and others that meet the CCHP Technology Challenge is to put them through trials in cold climate regions over the next two years to demonstrate performance, efficiency, and comfort when applied in the field throughout a winter. Deployment and commercialization are planned for 2024. Utility partners will work with DOE to establish consumer incentives to encourage adoption, and state partners will also develop education and outreach campaigns. More than 20 utilities, cooperatives, and state agencies have committed to the Challenge.
The lifetime cost study by Carbon Switch found that the average cost of a heat pump is $14,000 after rebates. But there’s a huge difference in costs depending on rebates available, size of the home, location, whether the home needs ducts, and more. It also didn’t look at the rising cost of electricity, which is important in light of many utilities substantially hiking energy costs. In another study conducted in 2021, researchers found that heat pumps were cost competitive with propane in isolated areas in northern climates, regardless of whether a PV system is installed or not. The cost-optimal solution was found to be solar powered, especially if used for hot water production, assuming that solar module costs will further drop in the future.
