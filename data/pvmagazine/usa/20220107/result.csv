A public session was held yesterday, and because the Commission extended the written reply comments deadline to January 21, 2022, the Public Regulation Commission (PRC) is still gathering formal comments and information.
While most comments were submitted to the commission in writing, two people appeared in person yesterday. Ona Porter was one of the people who spoke in favor of the Act. She is president and CEO of Prosperity Works, an Albuquerque-based nonprofit that has worked with community groups to get the word out about existing energy efficiency programs. She said most families her group works with have annual incomes of $25,000 or less and can’t benefit from tax rebates or wait to get reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses. She suggested that a fund be developed so people could subscribe to community solar at no cost. Additionally, Porter suggested that training low-income residents would enable them to enter the renewable energy workforce.
The PRC is the state agency overseeing this Rulemaking process to establish the procedures and requirements for Community Solar projects to begin. Those rules are due to be completed by April 1, 2022. At this time the PRC is gathering input and best practices from developers, utilities, community organizations and other technical experts in the field to develop these rules.
New Mexico has historically ranked among one of the poorest states in the nation, with its economy based on the service sector, mining, and oil production.  A recent University of New Mexico study found that community solar can provide a major economic stimulus to New Mexico at a time when it is desperately needed. The study found that community solar will:
The study also concluded that each county in New Mexico would benefit from $15 million in economic output and 117 new jobs over a 20-year period.
“The Community Solar Act rulemaking is important work that will make a difference for the people of New Mexico, and those involved should be proud of their efforts,” said Commissioner Joseph Maestas, whose office headed up the rulemaking process within the agency’s Community Solar Action Team. The framework developed by the Commission stipulates that 30% of electricity produced from each community solar facility must be reserved for low-income customers and low-income service organizations.

This is all part of its long-range plan to meet the renewable energy targets established by the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).
The VCEA requires all utilities operating within the commonwealth to file an annual plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) outlining how it will meet key mandates as it reaches 100% carbon-free status by 2050. While the 500 MW mentioned above comprises Appalachian Power’s short-term plan, the utility also intends to add approximately 3,300 MW of solar, 2,600 MW of energy storage and nearly 3,000 MW of onshore wind to its current portfolio by 2040.
The first arm of Appalachian Power’s short-term procurement plan came to fruition earlier this week, when Canadian Solar announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Recurrent Energy,  completed a purchase and sale agreement with Appalachian Power for Recurrent’s Firefly Energy solar project located in Pittsylvania County, Virginia.
Expected to be operational in the 2nd quarter of 2024, Firefly Energy will have capacity of 150 MW, and is Appalachian Power’s largest solar energy acquisition to date. The project is being developed and constructed by Recurrent under a Build Transfer Agreement (BTA), and, pending local and state permits and other regulatory approvals, construction of the project is expected to start in early 2023.
In the short-term plan, Appalachian power has also asked for regulatory approval to recover the costs associated with purchase of two smaller solar installations: a 50 MW project in Berkeley County, West Virginia, right on the Maryland-West Virginia border, and a 4.9 MW solar facility in Amherst County, Virginia, just north of Lynchburg. The company is also seeking regulatory approval to enter into agreements to purchase capacity from three Virginia solar facilities via power purchase agreements (PPAs), with this portfolio adding approximatley 89 MW of power to the company’s energy supply, assuming approval is granted.
Independent of the 500 MWs marked for solicitation, the short-term plan includes 55 MW of separate solar projects that are or will be in service in the coming months. In this filing, the company is seeking to include in rates the costs associated with these projects and the Amherst project, as well as market REC purchases, also required under VCEA compliance.
All of these acquisitions and power contracts considered, residential customer bills are expected to increase approximately $2.37 monthly, for a home using 1,000 kWh a month, according to Appalachian Power.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/07/with-build-back-better-in-the-freezer-solar-may-struggle-to-heat-up-this-year/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON, D.C.",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 7, 2022","With Build Back Better in the freezer, solar may struggle to heat up this year","The solar industry continues to set records year-over-year, growing to a bankable, attractive investment, and set to be a major source of energy going forward. The prospect of solar growth looked rosier than ever with the proposed Build Back Better Act (BBBA) appearing to approach approval. The bill had a record-breaking $550 billion for climate measures, including tax credits for the domestic manufacture of solar, upfront consumer rebates, and much more.
Projections for the year looked fantastic, and publicly traded stocks rose sharply in anticipation. However, the excitement turned out to be a sugar-high, as in late December Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) harpooned the Act, saying he “cannot vote” for the measure, sending solar stocks and analyst projections tumbling.

At present, Manchin is arguing for a bill below $1.75 trillion, down from the $2 trillion proposal that only needed his vote to enter the filibuster-skipping process of reconciliation that would push the Act past the dissenting Republican party. This proposal was already a slashed version of the $3.5 trillion original plan. The White House has voiced that it will still fight for a $2 trillion proposal level.
What this means is that the BBBA may be locked up in legislative combat for a while. Brandon Conard, partner of solar investment firm and developer SolRiver Capital, told pv magazine that often major resolutions to PV-relevant law seem to take place in December, so the nation may be waiting quite some time before funds are set free. In the meantime, Conard sees some bumps on the road for solar.
Conard said that while many developers may not admit it, Build Back Better was priced into a lot of project bids that he was seeing for next year, something that he said SolRiver did not engage in. The prices were simply too low to not have included the discounts enabled by the Act. Now that the Act has suddenly been pulled from the table, these contracts are at risk of not being honored.
This will lead to project re-trading, stalled projects, and a general feeling of bad will and mistrust for investors looking to inject capital into the industry.
Unfortunately, cost relief is something the industry could really use right now, too. Shipping is up dramatically, in fact it has risen nearly fivefold over 12 months, according to Conard. A year ago, a container of panels cost roughly $5,000 to ship to site. Now, the price tag can be as high as $20,000. Conard said he sees relief on the way, but possibly not until the end of 2022.
Modules aren’t cheap right now, either. In 2020, bifacial panels could be shipped to site at $0.28/W. Now, the same panels may cost around $0.42.
Conard said that while other investors may pull out or slow down this year, SolRiver is pressing onward in 2022, dealing with the increased costs until relief comes. With costs up, and revenue essentially capped, the one last lever to push on is production and innovation. He said he sees value in technologies that can squeeze out more power, pointing to trackers over fixed-tilt mounts and bifacial over single-face modules. “Even a 1% increase in production can make a big difference right now,” said Conard.
Despite the wait for BBBA, the industry is expected to grow at large, and there are areas of opportunity in the United States that Conard said SolRiver is actively investigating. Markets that once had little interest in solar are opening and growing quickly. Kentucky, Alabama, and Georgia were some of the states that Conard highlighted.

Kentucky, which is located in the PJM grid control region, appears to be slated for long-duration energy storage installations, too. Conard said the grid controller is contracting for large amounts of 10-hour-plus duration storage devices. He said SolRiver has taken an interest in flow batteries due to this demand. While lithium is a common technology in the energy storage realm, he said there are some fire safety (and therefore financial risk) concerns, and there are technical limitations to the duration of lithium storage.
Conard sees the path to electrical decarbonization as a multi-pronged approach. Earlier drafts of BBBA had incentives for the production of green hydrogen, which as use cases in high-energy intensive industrial activities. The provision has since been yanked, and Conard would like to see it added back in.
The White House calls for 100% carbon free electricity by 2030, at least half of which would be locally supplied clean energy meeting 24/7 demand. The nation has eight years to get there, and without supporting policy, it would be a steep climb.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/07/new-yorkers-fund-4-gw-of-solar-for-less-than-a-cup-of-coffee-per-month/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 7, 2022",New Yorkers fund 4 GW of solar for less than a cup of coffee per month,"The State of New York has released a set of policy recommendations that will drive the next 4 GW/dc of distributed solar power. They’re aiming to reach 10 GW of installed capacity by 2030. The recommendations can be found in their long form report, New York’s 10 GW Distributed Solar Roadmap: Policy Options for Continued Growth in Distributed Solar, which describes their logic in the section ‘specific recommendations for (an) expanded NY-Sun MW Block program,’ as per the Governor’s Office.
The program will cost approximately $1.47 billion, which will be collected from electricity ratepayers at a cost of $0.00082 per kilowatt hour. It is expected that an additional $4.1 billion of private capital will be invested to build out the 4 GW capacity.
The NY-Sun program is administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).
Within the New York City Con Edison market, a target of 150 MW is sought from each of three sectors: residential, small commercial (specified as less than 1 MW of modules), and large (>1 MW) commercial projects. The rest of capacity – 2.94 GW – will be deployed upstate from the highly populated metropolitan area.
Interestingly, Long Island is expected to contribute an additional 560 MW towards the 4 GW target, despite running out of incentives in 2016. The policy recommendation for the region is to press on without incentives, since installations on Long Island appear robust without them.
According to NYSERDA, The state currently has 6 GW of solar capacity either installed or officially in the pipeline, as a result of the first round of this energy procurement program.
In total, the program’s budget will increase by $1.474 billion. The monies are to be spread across a series of programs:
Recommendations are based on each regions’ performance, needs, and project size, as well as environmental and labor justice. The Governor’s office states that the program will deliver at least “35 percent of the benefits, with a goal of 40 percent from the investments to statutorily-defined disadvantaged communities and low-to-moderate income New Yorkers”.

The aforementioned $0.00082/kWh fee, which is paid by all customers and based on the state’s current electricity usage, will be collected over an eleven year period, from 2022 through 2032. The document notes that the yearly price will vary depending upon the progression of the solar program. Average residential electricity accounts should expect an increase of $0.70 to $0.92 per month.
The state says that if the Build Back Better act is signed, it could save the program over $525 million. That’s because the New York program takes into account the money that solar investment groups will earn. The state has access to some of the world’s most talented financial professionals, who have likely been consulted to help predict just how much each incentive will move the program forward.
NYSERDA has said that if the Build Back Better legislation is signed, they will refile the proposed operating plan – lowering state incentives in response to increased federal incentives.
 

To reach the upstate goal of 2.9 GW of installed capacity, the state will extend and increase incentives of the existing MW Block program.
The program’s incentives will restart with Block 18, with 800 MW of capacity. Participants will receive a check for 17¢/watt of installed solar panel capacity. The increase from 11¢/watt to 17¢/watt is due to a lowered community solar adder and upcoming decreases to the investment tax credit.
The ConEdison program will pay out $1.30/watt for small projects and $0.75/Watt for large projects. The 150 MW block sizes will be cut into 30 MW segments, with each following segment paying out a lower amount per watt.
The 10 gigawatt roadmap requires all projects greater than 1 MW of capacity to pay a prevailing wage. NYSERDA predicts that this will cost approximately $0.125/watt for upstate projects, and $0.20/W for ConEdison projects. Consequently, NYSERDA has asked for an additional $239 million for the NY-Sun program to be paid to contractors to offset the cost of this new requirement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/07/safety-a-top-focus-for-major-solar-inverter-provider/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 7, 2022",Safety a top focus for major solar inverter provider,"Safety is of paramount importance when installing a solar array, especially in rooftop applications, where a home, business, school, or hospital could be topped with PV. With this in mind, the National Electric Code (NEC) keeps compliant solar arrays safer, protecting the equipment on the roof and everything important below it. 
pv magazine was joined by SolarEdge to talk safety, and how the firm is building capabilities that go beyond U.S. code requirements, reducing risks and increasing the stability of a solar installation. Jason Bobruk, director of code compliance, and Carolyn Humphreys, C&I sales manager, both with SolarEdge, said that most fires observed in buildings with solar systems do not result from the installations themselves. Malfunctions in heating systems, factory machinery, cooking equipment, or even lightning pose significantly higher fire risks than solar systems.
In the event of a PV system fire, one potential source is an electrical arc fault. They can be caused by faulty or improperly linked cables or connectors, corrosion, animal disruption, failed DC connectors, or PV system overheating, said Bobruk. Bobruk said 30% of the safety concerns found in the field were the result of incorrect wiring, an issue that can be prevented with improved training and standards.
One area of opportunity for enhancing safety will be workforce training, which SolarEdge is actively engaged in. As the industry grows rapidly, a large group of new workers with limited experience will join the workforce. With this comes the need for widespread learning of safety standards and the NEC. Bobruk said U.S. installers are some of the best that SE works with, which is due in part to the NEC. In countries that lack a comparable code and standards, there are much higher incidences of solar-related safety issues like fires or faults. 
Humphreys said SolarEdge has played an active role in the development of safety code for inverters and builds safety directly into the hardware and software of the devices. The company meets or exceeds code for its centralized inverter, a control hub, safety shutdown devices, and on-module power optimizers. 
Bobruk is currently working with other leading manufacturers and NEMA on the PV Council to develop a universal PV connector standard. He said it’s incredibly important that the industry comes together to work on standards development, to improve safety for everyone. In the meantime, Bobruk said it is crucial that installers are aware of the risks posed by inter-mating connectors. The bottom line is that it doesn’t matter what brand of connector they use, as long as they use the same brand in each installation, said Bobruk. 
SolarEdge uses power optimizer attached to solar modules to enable independent operation, which the company said increases energy production by overcoming limitations of traditional string inverter systems, such as module mismatch and shading / soiling. The monitoring platform provides module-level visibility, offering increased granularity in potential problem identification.

The equipment also has a built-in feature called SafeDC. As an example of how the feature works, imagine that a portion of the PV system heats to excess levels. Undetected, this small heat gain could develop into an arc fault in the future. However, using sensors placed on the inverter’s terminal blocks, the SafeDC system will detect the high temperature, identify the source immediately, and disconnect the power optimizers from the inverter using the built-in SafeDC function. It will also alert the installer or asset owner, enabling them to remedy the problem right away. This isn’t possible in a traditional string inverter with a separate rapid shutdown box. Neither the inverter, nor the rapid shut down box, is able to identify which modules are at fault, which may result in the whole string being shut down.
SafeDC also provides protection for maintenance personnel or firefighters who need to access the roof.  In traditional systems, even when the inverter is shut down, high voltage from the active DC modules remains present, which means older technologies could pose an electrocution risk. With SafeDC solutions, each module is reduced to a touch-safe 1V in less than one minute. This is important for any personnel who need to get on the roof quickly. SafeDC also enables firefighters to tackle fires more efficiently, safe in the knowledge that they can turn their hoses on a building without the risk that it could create further safety issues, or even a secondary fire.

By 2030, the cumulative renewable capacity is expected to rise to 884.6 GW, growing at a CAGR of 14% from 2020 to 2030. Despite an increase in prices of renewable equipment such as solar modules in 2021, the US renewable sector is expected to show strong growth during the 2021 to 2030 period as this increase in equipment prices is short term due to supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The expansion of renewable power capacity during the 2000-2020 period has been possible due to the introduction of federal schemes such as Production Tax Credits, Investment Tax Credits, and Manufacturing Tax Credits. These have massively aided renewable installations by bringing down the cost of renewable power generation and making it at par with power generated from conventional sources,” said Rohit Ravetkar, Power Analyst at GlobalData.
Over the last few years, the cost of solar PV and wind power installations has declined sharply. Since 2010, the cost of utility-scale solar PV projects decreased by around 82% while onshore wind installations decreased by around 39%. This has supported the rapid expansion of the renewable market. However, the price of solar equipment has risen due to an increase in raw material prices and supply shortages. This may slightly delay the financing of some solar projects that are already in the pipeline.
Ravetkar noted the significance of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed in November 2021 by President Biden, which designates $73 billion for renewable capacity building, strengthening the power grid, and laying new high-voltage transmission lines.  The bill also includes an extension to both the Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit, both of which are seen as necessary to meet President Biden’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. “The US will continue to add significant renewable capacity additions during the forecast period to meet its target of reaching 80% clean energy by 2030,” Ravetkar said.
