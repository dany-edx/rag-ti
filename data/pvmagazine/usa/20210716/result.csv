The smaller of the two projects is the 150 MW Powell Creek Solar project, which will occupy just under 1,000 acres within an approximately 2,0oo-acre site in Putnam County, south of Toledo.
The project is being developed by Avangrid Renewables, a developer with more than 7,000 MW of owned and controlled wind and solar power facilities in the U.S.
The larger project is the 577 MW Fox Squirrel Solar project, which will occupy approximately 3,444 acres within a 3,766-acre area located in Madison County, west of Columbus. As with Powell Creek, hardware specifics are not yet available, with the only information being that the modules will be ground-mounted.
Fox Squirrel Solar is being developed by EDF Renewables. It is part of a 4.5 GW development pipeline that EDF acquired last autumn from North Carolina-based Geenex Solar. The portfolio of project assets include 20 solar projects in various stages of development. The first projects expect commercial operation in 2023 with other projects to follow.
Fox Squirrel Solar’s capacity is 50 MW greater than the state’s entire installed solar capacity of around 527 MW.  That ties it with OCI’s multisite Alamo project in San Antonio as the 5th-largest American solar project known to pv magazine. Ahead of those are First Solar’s 668 MW Topaz Solar Farm in California; General Electric, NextEra Energy, and Sumitomo of America’s 673 MW Desert Sunlight project in California’s Mojave Desert; LAE American Energy’s 692 MW Misae 2 project under development in Texas; and Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners and Arevia Power’s 896 MW Gemini solar project near Las Vegas.

One segment, electric vehicle fleets, has taken some significant strides recently.
GM and EVgo form charging network agreement
Fast charging network developer EVgo and EV maker GM have deepened their partnership, with EVgo named the preferred fast charging provider for the Ultium Charge 360 fleet service.
The arrangement gives EVgo the responsibility of deploying charging infrastructure solutions specifically for the GM fleet and BrightDrop customers, and these customers can receive program discounts at EVgo’s nationwide network of more than 800 public fast charging stations.
GM’s Ultium Charge 360 fleet service will support electrification for rideshare, delivery, municipal, autonomous, government, and other market segments, and included a curated, comprehensive offering for fleet customers who are transitioning to EVs.
Reliability is a key in fleet charging, and EVgo was selected for its demonstrated uptime, which the company said is 98% across thousands of charging stations.
The end solution the companies are driving towards is a turnkey electric fleet, with the companies meeting the diverse needs of fleet transition planning, equipment provisioning, infrastructure deployment, dedicated depots, integrated software solutions, and ongoing operations and maintenance.
Schneider and GM’s software partnership
GM has selected Schneider Electric as their preferred provider for end-to-end infrastructure solutions for GM’s Ultium Charge 360 fleet service.
Services provided by Schneider include utility rate negotiation and modeling, software integration, charging station agnostic solutions, and cybersecurity architecture. Also provided will be end-point cloud integration connecting products, controls, software and services, and Energy-as-a-Service design and support for the infrastructure solution.
These services are packaged under Schneider’s EcoStruxure for Automotive and Mobility, which will now be optimized for a user-friendly interface with GM fleets and BrightDrop customers.
GM will facilitate and coordinate integration between fleet customers’ existing integrated software solutions and Schneider Electric programming interfaces as needed. This means, where available, Schneider’s new EV infrastructure technology will work seamlessly with existing GM solutions like Energy Assist, OnStar, and newer technologies going forward.

EV and fuel cell electric vehicle fleet maker Nikola has made significant strides in their sales presence, with the addition of five independent dealers across 51 locations to their network.
The new partnerships place Nikola trucks for sale in Texas, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Florida, Delaware, Virginia, and Maryland, and nearly double Nikola’s reach, bringing their total dealership network to 116 locations.
This April, Nikola announced a partnership with RIG360 Service Network, a provider of heavy-duty truck service and maintenance centers, to provide sales and service products for commercial customers at over 65 RIG360 dealer locations throughout the Southeast, Midwest, and Northeast.
It has been a difficult twelve months for Nikola, with fraud allegations causing their CEO to resign, and a cancelled plan to build trash trucks with Republic Services. This dealership move is sign of the inevitable momentum behind fleet electrification, despite hiccups along the way.

The performance featured the pop star and her band performing on reflective “panels,” actually circular mirrors in an array on the roof of the Ed Sullivan Theater in Midtown Manhattan.
And while solar panels absorb light rather than reflect it, we here at pv magazine appreciate the gesture, and the positive message Lorde is spreading. Besides, the mirrors might have been meant to symbolize concentrating solar technology.
Lorde’s inspiration for naming her third album “Solar Power” apparently came from a trip she made to Antarctica, where she wrote in an email to fans, “questions about how to change my personal and professional footprints on this earth occupied much of my time.”

Wafer producer Zhonghuan Semiconductor published the preliminary financial results for the first half of 2021. The company said it expects to achieve revenue of up to RMB 18 billion ($2.79 billion) during the period, with a year-on-year increase of 108%. Net profit is predicted to come in at up to RMB 1.55 billion, which would represent 188% growth over the first six months of 2020. Zhonghuan said the positive performance is due to the expansion of its capacity and strong market demand for 210 mm-sized products. At the end of June, the manufacturer had an annual production capacity of 70 GW.
Shanghai-listed panel maker GCL System Integration said it expects a net loss of up to RMB 270 million in the first half of 2021. The company explained the loss comes from several key factors, including the price hike for polysilicon, the suspension of several large-scale solar projects in China, and a non-recurring loss of around RMB 100 million coming from liabilities related to the sale of PV power plants.
Shanghai-listed silicon wafer manufacturer JYT Corporation reportedly posted a net profit of up to RMB 470 million in the first half of the year, an increase of up to 105% compared to the same period a year earlier. The company currently has an annual production capacity of 8 GW and plans to reach 20 GW by the end of the year.
Module manufacturer Solargiga reported an unaudited 12% rise in first-half revenue, from RMB 2.6 billion ($402 million) in January-to-June last year to RMB 2.91 billion ($450 million) this time around, with shipments of solar ingots, wafers and modules up 18% to 3.38 GW.
Chinese solar manufacturer Akcome Tech announced it may incur a net loss of around RMB 70 million for the first six months of 2021. According to its preliminary statement, the negative result was due to the cost rise of upstream components, including wafers and solar cells, and higher prices for supporting materials, such as copper, aluminum, steel and glass.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/16/solarapp-launches-can-cut-costs-and-timelines-for-residential-rooftop-permits/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 16, 2021","SolarAPP+ launches, can cut costs and timelines for residential rooftop permits","In a recent roundtable, U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and leaders from top solar companies introduced the official launch of SolarAPP+, an automated residential rooftop solar permit approval system. 
Secretary Granholm said the platform allows a user to fill out a permit application in as little as 15 minutes, and approvals come instantly. This is a big change from an average of roughly 20 business days for approval to zero, she said.

On the roundtable, Sec. Granholm celebrated the fact that the U.S. has doubled solar deployment in the last 3.5 years, and recently hit significant deployment milestones of 100 GW of solar, and 3 million installations. The industry has seen an 80% reduction in utility scale solar costs as well. Despite all this progress, Sec. Granholm said recent heatwaves, wildfires, and other climate related catastrophes necessitate an urgent ramp-up of more solar energy deployment.
This is the aim of SolarAPP+; to spur faster deployment through lower wait times, lower costs to homeowners and solar developers, and centralized process for permitting. There is a cost of $25 per approved permit, but in many early trials, jurisdictions have subsequently lowered their permit fees due to the benefit of saved time, leading to an average of $6 in savings per project. 
Sec. Granholm said this cutting of red tape is going to be instrumental in realizing greater deployment and savings. She said an estimated $16 million in wasted energy savings was lost by homeowners due to extended permit times last year. Plus, the arduous process of permitting has barred many small solar businesses from setting up shop, said Sec. Granholm.
Now, SolarApp+ can handle about 90% of solar permits in most jurisdictions, tackling simpler projects, and freeing up time for jurisdictions to focus on more complex building permits that are already clogging their pipelines.

Lynn Jurich, CEO of Sunrun attended the conference, noting that distributed residential rooftop solar is one of the fastest ways the country can achieve its climate related goals. She said that 10,000 homes with solar and storage are equivalent to a 100 MW power plant. And, from a carbon perspective, homes will need to be increasingly electrified, so meeting power demand at-home will work in concert will large scale deployment. Currently, Sunrun is the 2nd largest holder of solar in the U.S., including utilities, so speeding the residential sector will continue to drive healthy competition.
Jurich said that in Australia and parts of Europe, 20-25% of rooftops are covered in solar PV, compared roughly to 3% in the U.S. A top reason for this, according to Jurich, is that their processes are more streamlined, and less costly, and programs like SolarAPP+ exist in other nations. 
Sec. Granholm has set a goal of 125 jurisdictions to sign up for the program by September 30th. Officials from Stockton, CA, Tucson, AZ, and Montgomery County, MD attended the rountable, praising the success of the program in their communities thus far.
The “plus” in SolarAPP+ indicates that energy storage permitting will soon be added to software as well.
Jurisdictions interested in taking on this initiative to save time in their approvals departments, and solar companies looking for faster install times can navigate to https://solarapp.nrel.gov/ to get started.

The developers said they plan to file an appeal to the decision in district court. They told local news outlets that they would take the project elsewhere if they could not find support for it in Butte.
Zoning board members cited the project’s size and its potential impact on nearby residences. They also cited public opposition as a reason for turning down the permit. They suggested that they might support a smaller project that would be less intrusive.
Madison River Equity LLC sought the special use permit for the 1,600-acre solar array known as the Basin Creek Solar Project. It was to have been built on private ranch land in Butte.
Madison River Equity is a unit of an entity that developed the Atlas Power data center near the proposed solar project. Atlas Power mines cryptocurrency and reportedly plans to expand its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), adding new buildings and thousands of additional GPUs. Atlas Power’s owners planned buy the Basin Creek Solar Project to power the data center.
Roughly 700,000 solar panels would have been sited on either side of a seasonal drainage channel, with a 1,500-foot wide corridor for wildlife. Developers said the array would be large enough to power around 40,000 homes. Butte has around 15,000 homes.
After the permit was denied, the cryptocurrency producer said its planned expansion hinges on the solar array, and that the operations may relocate if the board decision isn’t overturned.

The tests were administered at 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit), and solid-state batteries have historically struggled to scale up cell capacity, which is why the results are so monumental. The achievement was made possible by the company’s breakthrough Factorial Electrolyte System Technology (FEST), a proprietary solid electrolyte material, which enables safe and reliable cell performance with high-voltage and high-energy density electrodes. On top of being used in Factorial’s own batteries, FEST can also be integrated into existing lithium-ion battery infrastructure.
Factorial gained sudden notoriety this spring for being the first startup to reach the 40 Amp-hour benchmark for a solid-state cell.
For Factorial, the accomplishment could prove as a performance backing that it can use in discussions with auto manufacturers about the adoption of solid-state battery products into their EV technology.
