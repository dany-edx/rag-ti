The 5 MW project will use solar-generated electricity to split non-potable water into hydrogen fuel.
The project mark’s Chevron’s first direct investment in its own hydrogen project. Deloitte estimates the global hydrogen market will reach $1.4 trillion by 2050.
Hydrogen fuel is created by using electricity to split a water molecule in a process called electrolysis. When it is burned as fuel, it emits water vapor and warm air, rather than carbon dioxide. However, today, about 95% of all hydrogen is produced from steam reforming of natural gas, according to the Department of Energy.
Chevron expects the plant to produce 2.2 tons of hydrogen per day starting in 2025. This is the equivalent of powering 54,000 homes or fueling a vehicle for 132,000 miles, said the company in a press release.
Hydrogen acts as an energy storage medium for renewable energy generators like solar and wind. It is highly dispatchable and long-duration fuel, making it available to serve a different set of use cases than lithium-ion battery storage, which is currently the leading form of new-build storage under development for renewables.
The project is part of Chevron’s plan to reach 150,000 tons of hydrogen fuel production per year, supplying industrial, power, and heavy-duty transportation customers.
The company is spending $2 billion on “lower carbon” projects in 2024, though a significant part of these investments are expansions of renewable diesel and carbon sequestration, rather than an investment in renewables. Chevron announced a $16 billion capital expenditure plan company-wide for 2024.
A recent report from Stanford University showed how hydrogen plus renewables-charged battery storage could help many nations lower their annual energy costs by about 61%.
Last month, utility-scale energy storage company Energy Vault announced a first-of-its kind 293 MWh energy storage and hydrogen project in California. Once complete, it will represent the largest long duration energy storage and green hydrogen hybrid project in the United States.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/04/24m-develops-recycling-process-for-its-semisolid-battery-platform/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-03-04,24M develops recycling process for its SemiSolid battery platform,"24M Technologies, based in Cambridge, Mass., developed what it calls a low-cost, simple, modular approach to lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Designed around the use of standard lithium-ion supply chain materials, the company announced a direct material recycling method it calls Liforever.
“Better battery recycling is essential for a sustainable energy future, but the use of binders in conventional cell production has made direct recycling impractical,” said 24M CEO Naoki Ota.
Liforever works by keeping the active materials in their original form and does not create a black mass. This is in contrast to recycling methods used for lithium-ion cells that form black mass e-waste as a result of its use of toxic pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical recycling processes. This conventional method also damages the structure of the anode and cathode materials and so it is not usually used to recycle more expensive metals such as nickel, manganese and cobalt.
“Liforever solves these challenges by enabling the reuse of nearly every part of the battery cell without requiring the expensive, inefficient and environmentally challenging processes used in conventional cell recycling,” said Ota. “These cost savings are further optimized by our streamlined SemiSolid technology, which eliminates half of the steps used in conventional cell production.”
24M reports that its Liforever method enables recycling of all active materials from the anode (graphite) and cathode (NMC, LFP, NCA, etc.). After recovery, the active materials undergo a low-cost cleaning and, as needed, re-lithiation to reclaim their original capacity.

The Liforever recycling methodology is designed to be compatible with recycling regulations, 24M reports. The fact that the process is chemistry agnostic means that it can support next-generation batteries of all chemistries, according to 24M.
24M Technologies was spun out of A123 Systems in 2010, and then acquired a renowned customer base, including license agreements with Volkswagen Group, Fujifilm Corporation, Kyrocera Corporation, Lucas TVS, Axxiva and FREYR. The last three companies announced plans to to build gigafactories based on 24M’s technology in India, China, Norway and the United States.
The company says it has simplified lithium-ion battery production with a new design that requires fewer materials and fewer steps to manufacture each cell. Its solution is a semi-solid flow battery in which the electrodes are mixed directly into the electrolyte, and as a result of its SemiSolid cell process and chemistry-agnostic platform, it can reduce manufacturing costs by up to 40%. The company says it also reduces the need for more than 80% of the inactive materials in traditional batteries, such as copper and aluminum.
In 2022 24M received a grant from the Department of Energy’s ARPA-E program to develop and scale a high-energy-density battery that uses a lithium metal anode and semi-solid cathode for use in electric aviation.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/04/the-path-beyond-5-tw-of-solar/,"SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,2024-03-04,The path beyond 5 TW of solar,"From pv magazine 2/24
Solar power will play a crucial role in the planned tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030, delivering an unprecedented fivefold generation capacity increase by the end of 2030, to 5.4 TW – and some forecasts are even more optimistic. Despite the competitiveness of renewables, led by solar, challenges persist and require urgent policy action on financial flows, permitting, electricity grids, and supply chains.
The first step to delivering the renewable energy capacity the planet requires is to align global policy around a renewables transition. The GRA launched the #3xRenewables campaign in September 2023 with the aim of focusing attention on this urgent objective, in order to deliver rapid progress.
Just five months after that launch, some 300 organizations have signed an open letter calling for #3xRenewables and 198 countries and regional blocs agreed to the target at COP28, with 130 of them also committing to a global renewables and energy efficiency pledge. In order to deliver on that global commitment, governments must focus on four core actions, outlined below.
Financial flows
The flow of funds – including export finance and climate finance, as well as public and private capital – must be redirected from fossil fuel energy to the build-out of renewables and grids. In a policy report developed by the GRA, the International Renewable Energy Agency, and the COP28 presidency, we found that a $10 trillion investment in renewable energy deployment between 2023 and 2030 will be key to align with a global net-zero trajectory by 2050. While this may be a staggering number, $7 trillion is currently paid in fossil fuel subsidies annually and an additional $1 trillion was invested into fossil fuels in 2023. There is a need for a long-term sustainability perspective, rather than more capital.
To achieve our global target, we must also prioritize low-cost and long-term financing in the least developed economies and off-grid communities for a “just energy transition.”
Supply chains
Strengthening supply chains is crucial to avoid vulnerability and ensure all benefits from the opportunities offered by the energy transition. Investing in local supply chains promotes job creation, economic growth, and stable renewable energy expansion. Governments should prioritize transparent supply chains and should incentivize adherence to high environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards to bolster investor confidence and eliminate market barriers to pave the way to achieving solar targets. ESG standards such as the “do no significant harm” principle, as well as best practice initiatives such as the Solar Stewardship Initiative, will also be critical for ecologically and socio-economically sustainable development.
Electricity networks
Grid upgrades and development are a critical factor in the growth of renewables. Beyond accommodating the variability of renewable energy, the focus of grid upgrades should prioritize bolstering resilience, flexibility, and accessibility to smart grids. Solar power can be a cornerstone of energy security, through decentralized energy generation systems ranging from utility-scale sites to individual homes – offering unique opportunities for the least developed countries to expand energy access. Achieving this means tackling both transmission and distribution grid issues to deliver cost-competitive solar energy globally.
Solar’s decentralized potential enhances resilience against grid failures and other crises, powering essential services such as fridges for food and vaccines, light for construction, and mobile phone charging points. Policymakers must integrate decentralized solar design into national planning for a secure and just future.
Permissions process
With lengthy timelines and overlapping responsibilities among government entities, permitting processes can represent a significant roadblock for the rapid expansion of solar, both large and small scale.
To overcome this obstacle, permitting procedures for solar projects should adopt a standardized and clearly defined process proportionate to the size of installation and incorporating a “one-stop shop” approach. Considering the relatively small impact of rooftop solar, permitting processes for small-scale projects should be much more streamlined, compared to utility-scale developments. In some countries, the permitting burden has even been removed entirely for residential and commercial rooftops for installations with a generation capacity of up to 5 MW.
Cautious optimism
As we look ahead, the renewables sector is optimistic but realistic. The technology is at our disposal, renewables are cost-competitive and will create millions of jobs, and the benefits of a green grid are undeniable. Realizing this vision, however, demands policies which align to remove barriers and direct finance where it will have the most significant impact. This is where organizations such as the Global Solar Council (GSC) are critical – uniting the world’s solar industry. By bringing together expertise and stakeholders from regions across the world, the GSC, in strong collaboration with other renewable energy sectors, through the GRA, can drive the way to shaping our sustainable energy landscape.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/04/thin-prospects-for-ingot-wafer-and-solar-cell-manufacturing/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-03-04,"Thin prospects for ingot, wafer and solar cell manufacturing","From pv magazine 02/24
While certain solar production steps are measured in nanometers, atomic layers, and fractions of a percentage or cent, ingot and wafer production more closely resembles heavy industry. Gleaming crystalline silicon ingots emerge from towering pullers to be sliced by diamond wire saws into iridescent, black square, or rectangular, monocrystalline wafers.
The ingot and wafering production steps are power hungry and produce waste in the form of kerf slurry – the residue ingot material from between the sliced wafers. Those are the PV production steps most highly concentrated in China.
Jessica Jin is the principal research analyst for solar and clean energy technology at S&P Global Commodity Insights Shanghai. Jin reported that in 2023, China accounted for 96% of global ingot and wafer production. She added that the wholesale switch within PV manufacturing from multicrystalline to monocrystalline technology, in and around 2018, was decisive for China’s dominance of the production step. That dominance has extended upstream.
“This was led by Longi, as everyone knows,” she said. “Since then, Chinese equipment manufacturers working with Longi keep improving their technology and also add capacity and they all grow up with the market expansion in China.”
The development is one that is common throughout China’s solar success story. Through aggressive scaling and close cooperation with technology and material suppliers, Chinese manufacturers have been able to rapidly adapt new technology and production processes, outcompeting European and American rivals first on cost, and then on performance and efficiency.
“Nowadays, we see most of these equipment suppliers are also in China as well,” said Jin. The result being that in 2024 there are few credible pathways for non-Chinese manufacturers interested in developing ingot and wafer capacity.
European setbacks
PV manufacturing advisory Exawatt, now a part of CRU Group, finds that the only notable ingot and wafer production hub outside of China is in South East Asia. Exawatt tallied some 35 GW of wafer facilities in operation in South East Asia by the end of 2023, with that potentially expanding to 45 GW by the end of 2024.
While expansions are under way in South East Asia, the opposite is the case in Europe. The year 2023 saw both Norsun and Norwegian Crystal suspend or wind up their operations in Europe – effectively reducing wafer production in Europe to zero. Those decisions were followed shortly after by that of, presumably, a key supplier. Polysilicon producer REC Solar Norway began winding up its operations in Kristiansand, Norway – which had an annual output of 8,000 tons – and in Heroya, Norway – with 5,500 tons – in November 2023.
Norwegian Crystal had closed its 500 MW ingot facility in Glomfjord, Norway, a month earlier. As recently as 2022, it had been pursuing plans to develop a 6 GW ingot and wafer facility but had been unable to secure funding, forcing it to begin liquidation of the company.
In September, compatriot Norsun announced layoffs and a production halt at its 1 GW facility in Årdal, Norway. Tellingly, Norsun is now trying to establish a 5 GW ingot and wafer production facility in the United States. In August 2023, it announced it had raised NOK90 million ($8.5 million) in capital in pursuit of the plan, alongside the €53.6 million ($58 million) it was awarded by the European Union Innovation Fund.
Potential in United States
Subsidies are available for solar manufacturers in Europe but they pale in comparison to what is on offer in the United States. In the first 12 months after the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law, announcements were made totaling 155 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity, right across the value chain, according to trade body the Solar Energy Industries Association. However, few were for ingot and wafer production.
“According to our model, the incentive is actually very good for production in the United States,” said S&P Global’s Jin. “But it’s not simply about the production cost but also other costs, like the recycling, construction cost, and so on.”
Jin said that securing environmental approvals for wafer operations may prove difficult outside of China. Although she did note that in the past five years, many of the waste and recycling issues from wafer production have been addressed.
South Korean module maker Qcells stands out as an exception. In January 2024, Qcells announced a $2.5 billion investment decision which included 3.3 GW of annual ingot, wafer, and cell production capacity, to be executed in stages. The manufacturing will involve the establishment of a new production base, in Cartersville, Georgia – outside of the city of Atlanta in the United States. It follows the expansion of Qcells’ module assembly operations, to 5.1 GW capacity, in Dalton, Georgia, in the United States, completed in October 2023.
Supply deal
In January 2024, Qcells announced it had expanded an existing 2.5 GW module supply and engineering, procurement, and construction services deal with Microsoft to 12 GW of supply over eight years. The companies say the projects covered by the deal will be supplied by Qcells’ “fully integrated solar supply chain factory in Cartersville,” to the tune of 1.5 GW per year through 2032.

The deal provides offtake certainty to Qcells, with one-third of its ingot and wafer output accounted for in cooperation with a bankable counterparty. For its part, by working with Qcells in this way, Microsoft hopes to accelerate its renewable energy deployment by locking in supply and driving large-scale domestic production of solar modules in the process.
“There is always something that makes supply to the US uncertain,” said Alex Barrows, head of PV at Exawatt. “I can see an appeal to locking in something that gives you some certainty – even if you’re paying a premium.” PV module prices are higher in the United States and there remains a complex web of tariffs, exemptions, border seizures, moratoria, and legal challenges, all of which can delay final project realization or blow out costs.
On Jan. 27, 2024, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) issued a “plea for survival” to European policymakers. It argued that foreign PV module manufacturers were dumping modules, or selling below cost. It also pointed to the decisions to cease European operations taken by Norsun, REC Solar Norway, and Norwegian Crystals – along with the winding up of the German module production lines of Swiss company Meyer Burger. “The closure of PV module manufacturers is also closing possibilities to develop other parts of the PV value chain and European material and component manufacturers are thus also at very high risk,” the ESMC said in a statement. “Losing nearly all European PV module producers right now would have irreversible negative consequences for the entire EU PV manufacturing industry,” said the ESMC’s Žygimantas Vaičiūnas. He said that emergency measures must be introduced by the middle of February 2024, “at the latest.” 
Barrows noted that Qcells’ parent company, Hanwha, is South Korean rather than Chinese. It has access to American polysilicon from REC Silicon and is on the way to becoming a vertically integrated United States producer – making it well placed to offer stability in the face of potential policy turmoil or geopolitical shocks. “I feel like it is a pretty good way to lock in some security,” said Barrows.
Yet despite the IRA, higher prices, and advantages for locally produced products, Barrows remains skeptical of the prospects of many announced ingot and wafer facilities in the United States. Alongside Qcells and Norsun; Convalt Energy, CubicPV, and India’s Vikram Solar have announced American manufacturing plans that extend up the supply chain to ingots and wafers.
“I think we’ll get a bit [of ingot and wafer capacity] in the US but nowhere near what has been announced,” said Barrows. “Thirty-five GW of capacity by the end of 2026 has been announced but I would actually suspect it is more likely that 15 GW to 20 GW will be installed.”
Kerfless promise
On the list of aspiring manufacturers, CubicPV stands out. Not only has it announced its intention to develop 10 GW of traditional ingot and wafer technology, it is also a proponent of “direct wafer” usage. The company’s chief executive officer (CEO), Frank van Mierlo, formerly led 1366 Technologies. That business had attempted to commercialize “direct wafer” technology by producing multicrystalline solar wafers from a liquid, rather than cleft from a monocrystalline ingot.
Qcells worked in partnership with 1366 Technologies and achieved notable conversion efficiency achievements with the latter’s technology, including cells with more than 20% efficiency. However, when the PV industry switched to monocrystalline technology, 1366’s wafers were left stranded on the wrong side of development.
Germany’s NexWafe is pursuing a wafer technology not dissimilar to that used by 1366. The NexWafe approach is described as epitaxial and involves gases being deposited onto a seed substrate from which it can be separated and fashioned into a cell. Both approaches can be described as “kerfless” wafer production as they do away with wafer cutting and the waste kerf it produces.
In October 2023, NexWafe broke ground at a 250 MW factory in Germany where it will invest at least €70 million. Interestingly, NexWafe CEO Davor Sutija was the former president and CEO of SiNor, which eventually became Norwegian Crystals.
Production alternatives to the mature Czochralski process for monocrystalline ingot pulling and diamond wire sawing must overcome capital expenditure, throughput and efficiency challenges to become commercially viable. High cell efficiencies on epitaxial or direct wafer technology have not yet been reached, nor has competitive throughput from a factory at scale.
The establishment of any new ingot and wafer capacity with any technology will also take place under intense cost competition. The year 2023 saw module prices decline by more than 30% on global markets and there is a glut of product on the market. “We’re definitely expecting a wash in the industry next year,” said S&P Global’s Jin.
Yet, in times of bankruptcies and consolidation, there are opportunities for “step change” or next-generation technologies. European or United States companies may prosper while oversupply grips their Chinese rivals. NexWafe and CubicPV are pursuing new approaches to wafer production despite manufacturing-segment adversity.
In November 2023, NexWafe appointed Rick Schwerdtfeger as chief technology officer and André Seemaier as chief financial officer as the company moves into the commercialization phase of its gas-to-wafer technology.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/04/solar-wins-hundreds-of-millions-in-new-england-capacity-payments/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,NEW HAMPSHIRE,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-03-04,Solar wins hundreds of millions in New England capacity payments,"The latest New England Independent System Operator (ISO-NE) capacity auction for 2027-28 concluded with coal failing to secure a spot, while solar, storage and wind all increased their market share.
ISO-NE announced that approximately 950 individual energy resources successfully bid to provide capacity if needed. Out of these, 603 were solar power or solar-plus-storage facilities, accounting for 16.6 GW of the total 31.5 GW of capacity.
The size of the sources ranged from 7 kW to 1.2 GW. The smallest facility, a 7 kW solar power plant named “Grasshopper 142 Blackstone,” is located in southeast Massachusetts. The largest solar plant, Three Corners Solar, which is located in Maine, secured a bid for 77.1 MW of capacity.

Facilities receive a monthly payment based on their available kWac capacity. The auction’s preliminary price is $3.58/kW per month, 38% higher than last year’s bid, but similar to bids placed five years ago.
The 7 kW Grasshopper solar facility bid that it could guarantee 2.462 kWac of capacity, earning a monthly payment of $8.81 and an annual total of $105. The facility must rebid next year. The Three Corners Solar facility, bid for its full capacity of 77.1 MWac but only for the summer period from June to September. It will earn $276,018 for each month and $828,054 for the summer season.
In 2019, Sunrun secured capacity payments for a distributed solar and storage portfolio for the first time, with delivery beginning under the contract in fall 2022. Since this initial bid, known as “FCA 13,” Sunrun has consistently secured contracts each year. Most recently, they won with three portfolios, totaling 5.67 MW of capacity.
The ISO noted that 1.7 GW of energy storage won bids, with 700 MW of those being new facilities this year. Energy storage first won capacity bids in the 2019 auction with 5 MW of capacity.
Offshore wind had a big moment with Vineyard Wind 1, an ~800 MW facility nearing completion, securing capacity payments on its first bid. The facility clinched two blocks: a 146 MW/50 MW winter/summer capacity and a larger 347 MW/185 MW block. Notably, wind farms typically offered more capacity in winter, whereas solar installations mainly provided value in summer or had reduced winter capacity when paired with energy storage.
The largest resource in New England to win capacity was the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, which secured 1.25 GW of capacity.

The Merrimack Generation Station in Bow, New Hampshire, a 482 MW coal plant that had been winning capacity bids until 2023, failed again to win any bids. The plant’s last payments of $785,000 a month will end with the closure of the 2025-2026 capacity season. According to the plant owners, the only financial path forward is to rely on revenue generated from supplying electricity during winter peak demand periods.
There are no other coal facilities currently operating in New England. However, wholesale electricity emissions in the region have not decreased for several years. This is because natural gas still dominates the grid, representing 46% of generation. Additionally, the retirement of multiple nuclear facilities has contributed to this trend.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/04/canadian-solar-to-supply-texas-made-topcon-modules-to-sol-systems/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-03-04,Canadian Solar to supply Texas-made TOPCon modules to Sol Systems,"Canadian Solar announced it has secured a framework agreement to provide Sol Systems with a “significant supply” of modules from its newly ramped Texas module factory.
Under the partnership, Canadian Solar will supply its latest high efficiency N-Type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar modules to support Sol Systems’ project pipeline in the U.S. between 2024 and 2025. Sol Systems reports that it is operating and building over 1.5 GW of solar projects and it provides environmental commodity portfolio management services to more than 20,000 customers across the U.S.
Canadian Solar is one of the largest global suppliers of TOPCon solar cell technology, known for offering high degrees of bifaciality as the modules absorb and convert light from both sides of the module.
The modules that Sol Systems is buying are the TOPBiHiKu7 132/120 dual-cell N-type TOPCon bifacial module. The company reports that the front side provides power up to 715 W with up to 85% of the power from the backside.
The company is producing these modules in its first U.S. manufacturing facility located in Mesquite, Texas. The new plant represents a $250 million capital investment, and it has a planned output of 20,000 modules per day, totaling 5 GW of annual production capacity.
Dr. Shawn Qu, founder and chief executive officer of Canadian Solar said establishing the factory is a key milestone for the company as it moves to serve the U.S. market.
“Canadian Solar’s TOPCon modules boost project economics through higher yields, smaller site footprint and lease costs, and lower balance of system costs,: said Diamond, chief construction officer of Sol Systems. “We were very impressed with the state-of-the-art facility during our visit to the Texas factory in December.”
Sol Systems is a national solar energy company focused on developing and operating renewable energy projects with community impact. One of its most notable accomplishments was a renewable energy procurement and investment strategy with Google that helps develop new solar energy projects while supporting local communities where the projects are built.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/04/amazon-helps-duke-energy-complete-power-flow-studies-in-hours-not-months/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,2024-03-04,"Amazon helps Duke Energy complete power flow studies in hours, not months","Developers of utility-scale solar projects in Duke Energy’s service territory should receive their final interconnection study from Duke more quickly now that the utility can complete a power flow study—a key step in the interconnection study process—in hours, not months.

Nationwide, about 2,000 GW of solar, wind and storage projects await interconnection to the transmission grid, a backlog “caused in large part by grid interconnection processes that observers have characterized as dysfunctional,” says a scorecard report prepared by the consultancies Grid Strategies and The Brattle Group.
Amazon worked with Duke Energy to develop a custom solution that speeds the power flow studies, said Nate Hill, head of energy policy for Amazon Web Services. “That’s not even an artificial intelligence product,” it’s “just a solution” that Amazon built with Duke, he said, speaking at a policy forum held by the renewable energy trade group ACORE.
Hill predicted “amazing” AI applications in the utility industry and with power grid operators, especially by “combining our forces and brainpower” with the capability of exascale computing at the Department of Energy, and “all the resources and scientists they have in their national lab network.”
Amazon was in discussions with grid operator SPP in 2022 about using AI to speed interconnection studies for utility-scale solar, while a NextEra executive was bringing the idea to other grid operators at that time.
Hill added that Amazon is “bullish” on grid-enhancing technologies and similar approaches, saying they should be studied “very seriously,” but added “it’s not a panacea.”
Speaking of the work of Amazon Web Services, Hill said firms are “early in the process” of switching from on-premise data services to cloud services, “and now you layer on top of that this big transition to machine learning, AI.” He said transmission infrastructure “is going to be one of the key ingredients to allow the U.S. to be a dominant force in this big revolution that’s happening right now.” To maintain U.S. leadership, he said “there’s a role for AWS and the datacenter community” to start planning early and providing “accurate forecasts to our partners,” so they can plan ahead and “plan the right grid.”
Transmission build cycle
Jeff Dennis, deputy director for transmission development at the Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office, said at the policy forum that “if we improve transmission planning, like we want to, and if we improve permitting, like we want to, we’re going to build a lot of transmission in a short amount of time. That means we’re going to need a lot of workers, we’re going to need a lot of equipment, we’re going to need a lot of supply. DOE is focused on that for sure. And I know many of you are also, but it will be a tremendous build cycle.”
Dennis also spoke about building “no regrets” transmission lines. He referenced DOE’s 2023 National Transmission Needs Study, which projected a need for 54.5 TW-miles of within-region transmission capacity and 125 GW of interregional transfer capacity by 2035, under future scenarios with moderate load but high clean energy assumptions.
Part of the transmission need, Dennis said, is “simply to relieve congestion that is costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year, especially in extreme weather events.” He said “even if we disagree on what the future looks like,” among 200 different scenarios, “we should build the high value connection options that pop out at you,” because those are “no regrets” options.
Cyberattacks and microgrids
Bill Murray, senior vice president of corporate affairs for Dominion Energy, spoke on the same panel and drew a reaction from the audience when he said the utility fields 3 billion cyberattack attempts per month.
