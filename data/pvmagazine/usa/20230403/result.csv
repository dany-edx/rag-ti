Solar installer SunPower released a report tracking these changes and showing how solar may offer price stability under uncertain utility rate environments.
In 2022, EIA reports retail electricity rate increases averaged 7.5%, marking a difficult year for ratepayers in U.S. In August 2022, 11 states had electricity rates that were 20% higher than August 2021 rates.
The increase moved along with a global trend of rising energy costs and demonstrates what little control utility ratepayers have over their energy costs. Adopting residential solar is one way U.S. homeowners are exercising control and increasing predictability for their bills.
Based on EIA data, SunPower shared that the top three states that have suffered the most from rate increases over the last decade are California, Maine, and Massachusetts. In California, rates have risen 78% since 2012, moving from $0.15 per kWh to $0.27 per kWh over that time. At this rate of increase, Californians could be paying as much as $0.33 per kWh for electricity. Massachusetts residents may pay the highest rates in the nation if rates continue to increase as precipitously as the last decade, with SunPower projecting a potential rate of $0.342 per kWh based on EIA data.
Residential solar can offer a different path. Whether purchased upfront, financed through a loan, or sold as a third-party owned power purchase agreement, the solar agreement transparently maps out the cost for power provided by the array over the next 20 to 30 years. Meanwhile, one may wonder, where will utility rates be in 30 years?
Solar adoption has risen steadily over the past decade as homeowners look for alternatives to centralized utility bills with unpredictable rates. California has led the way, and produces about 39.3% of residential solar energy in the U.S. In 2018, California mandated that all new single-family homes and multi-family dwellings up to three stories high must be built with solar panels. The law was implemented in 2020 and is expected to drive rooftop installations for years to come. California is followed by New York as a distant second, producing 6.1% of all residential solar generation in the U.S., and Arizona takes the third place slot with 5.9%.
SunPower also modeled the states for potential year-one solar savings using its SunPower Residential Solar Power Calculator. It used three randomly selected addresses for each state — one with no shade, one with a low shade level and one with a high shade level. For all addresses, the report assumed no use of an electric vehicle and the use of solar energy for 80% of the residence’s power.
Michigan ranked first for potential savings, with an average potential year-one savings of $2,230, based on an average monthly bill of $109.86.
Next came Hawaii, a leading adopter of residential solar. Based on an average monthly bill of $162.66 in Hawaii, SunPower estimates year-one average savings potential of $1,623. 
Residents of Connecticut are estimated to have an average year-one savings of $1,433 based on a $161.55 average monthly bill. While year-one savings are helpful, the increased visibility of electricity costs gained from adopting a solar contract can be a benefit in the face of uncertain and increasing utility rates.
Home value may increase with a purchased home solar array as well. Rocket Mortgage, one of the largest home mortgage providers in the U.S., reports that home listings with solar are 24.7% more likely to sell over ask and spend 13.3% less time on the market. Zillow reported that solar can add an average of 4.1% to a home’s value. For example, the average home in New York is valued at $408,833 and could be worth $425,595 once it has solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/03/enteligent-releases-dual-solar-optimizer-with-rapid-shutdown-monitoring/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 3, 2023","Enteligent releases dual solar optimizer with rapid shutdown, monitoring","Morgan Hill, Calif.-based Enteligent announced it has introduced a new rapid shutdown device (RSD) with module level power optimizers and a production monitoring system.  
The device, called the Enteligent NMax Rapid Shutdown with Optimization, can be attached to a single panel or paired with two panels. The paired unit can support up to 900 W of maximum power. It offers a pass-through efficiency of 99.8% in full sun, and maximum power consumption by the device tops out at 1.8 W.
Power optimizers overcome an inherent limitation of PV string installations. In traditional stringed solar arrays, an entire string of panels will only produce as much as the weakest link in the string. This means that shading, soiling, or faults in the panel can severely cut down on electricity production. Power optimizers avoid this issue, allowing each individual panel to achieve its highest output without being affected by others in the array configuration. 
The RSD/optimizer dynamically switches in and out of optimization mode when required, resulting in an average of 10% higher electricity from a typical rooftop solar installation, the company said.  
The NMax model also has module-level monitoring for reporting solar generation statistics. The monitoring allows installers to validate the panels are functioning properly, helps service providers diagnose and troubleshoot module issues, and helps homeowners monitor performance. 
Monitoring data reported includes voltage and current inputs and outputs, status errors, internal temperature, and the performance mode (passthrough, optimization, or stand-by). The rapid shutdown feature in the device is a microprocessor-controlled device for real-time response management. 
Enteligent said the product offers a competitive alternative to the power optimizer space, which has typically been dominated by market leaders.
“Currently, over 80% of North American rooftop solar installations benefit from power optimization and panel-level monitoring, but this solution is only available from the two leading solution providers who form a market duopoly,” said Sean Burke, founder and chief executive officer of Enteligent.“It also brings alternatives to the solar installer community, who are eager to provide new offerings to differentiate from the large regional and national dealers.”
The product is available for order on the company’s website and sells for $65 or $70 per unit before tax.
The Enteligent NMax RSD with Optimization is compliant with NEC 2017 and 2020 and UL 1741. It has a NEMA Type 6P enclosure and is SunSpec RSD certified. Full specifications can be found here. The products are expected to be available in Q3 2023, sold via leading industry distributors like Power Store and ABC Supply.

To date, PGE has reduced emissions from power sold to Oregonians by 25% below 2010-2012 baseline emissions. The utility has plans of reducing emissions by 80% by 2030, and to be fully net zero the following decade. To access the full IRP and Clean Energy Plan (696 pages), click here.
PGE’s roadmap to a sustainable energy mix includes the development of new utility-scale renewable projects like wind turbines and solar arrays, located both in-state and out-of-state, and power transmission upgrades to modernize the grid and bring clean energy to its 900,000 plus customers.
To address its clean energy goals, PGE forecasts a significant power capacity need of 1.14 GW in summer, 1 GW in winter, and up to 2.5 GW nameplate capacity clean energy assets by 2030.
According to the American Clean Power database, Oregon ranks 12th in the U.S. for renewable energy production with 4.9 GW of installed wind, solar and energy storage generation resources, with renewables representing 17.3% of the state’s energy mix.
PGE
Community solar
Additional programs such as energy storage and expansion of its community-based solar, storage, energy efficiency and demand response programs such as virtual power plants are all on the table. The utility said its IRP calls for 155 MW of community-based projects by 2030, with 66 MW of projects to be deployed through 2026 alone.
Under statute HB 2021, Oregon defines community-based renewable energy projects as systems that provide community benefits through a community benefits agreement or direct ownership. The desire for local benefits is reflected in different ordinances and climate action plans by local governments and municipal entities. For example, Portland and Multnomah County have both stated goals in their Climate Action Plans that call for 2% of their 2030 clean energy targets to be met with community-based renewables and infrastructure.
PGE
PGE’s support of community-based projects is both established and evolving, the utility says in its roadmap. The company sees more opportunities of pairing community-scale and customer-sited generation with energy storage, flexible loads and energy-related infrastructure.
As required by ORS statute 469A.210, PGE has an existing 10% small-scale renewable requirement. It expects the community-based program to contribute to that requirement, using 20 MW and smaller projects.
Moving forward, PGE expects the following items to contribute to its community-based program expansion:
The Oregon Public Utilities Commission inaugurated the first three statewide community solar projects in March 2021.
Microsoft, Nike and Common Energy are partnered offtake parties to Standard Solar in Oregon’s community solar market, with more than 100 Nike employees in Oregon subscribing to the Skyward Solar project, a 2.5 MW project in Boring, Ore.
Utility solar
PGE’s IRP bases its solar photovoltaic (PV) resource definition on three projects: one central Oregon location near Christmas Valley, one location near Wasco, Ore., and one location in the Willamette Valley near McMinnville, Ore.
A solar PV facility located near Mead, Nevada, that will be accessed via incremental transmission action, is also included in PGE’s IRP analysis. Each location is modeled using identical parameter assumptions.
Portland General Electric
“This plan reflects the values and expectations of our customers who, for decades, have made clean energy a top priority,” said Maria Pope, president and chief executive officer of PGE. “Achieving decarbonization will require continued collaboration with our customers and community partners at the local, state and federal levels. At PGE, we are committed to making the investments in innovation, diverse resources and the electric grid necessary to decarbonize our energy system, while we continue to focus on affordability during the clean energy transition.”
Portland General Electric is a public utility company providing electric service to more than 900,000 customers in 51 Oregon cities, and is one of the three investor-owned utilities providing power across the state.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/03/microgrid-planned-for-tribal-casino-in-san-jacinto-california/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,MONITORING,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 3, 2023","Microgrid planned for tribal casino in San Jacinto, California","As part of their strategic initiative to rapidly deploy cleaner and more resilient energy infrastructure across tribal lands, Scale Microgrids announced a microgrid project that will serve the Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians at its Casino Resort in San Jacinto, Calif.
Scale will install 1.5 MW of solar on the roof of Soboba’s 474,000 square foot casino and hotel, and the energy will be stored in a 6 MWh Tesla Megapack energy storage system. The company expects that the microgrid will offset power consumption and its golf course operation. Scale will also provide round-the-clock on-site and remote monitoring by Scale.
“This project serves our mission to strengthen our tribe’s sovereignty, self-sufficiency, and prosperity,” says Soboba’s Tribal Council. “We are responsible for helping our people and our land thrive for generations to come, and we believe this microgrid system is an important step towards advancing our objectives.”
The microgrid is intended to serve as an economic asset for the tribe and an emergency cooling center in the event of a community-wide power outage. Scale reports that, historically, tribal communities suffer from higher service costs, higher interconnection fees, more blackouts or brownouts, and remote and distant service locations. Having distributed energy generation on site adds resiliency and is intended to lower energy costs for the tribal communities. The Soboba microgrid is intended to work in energy savings mode when the utility is available, and the energy storage will also back up the facility for short-term and long-term outages.
“The impact of the Soboba Microgrid project goes beyond kilowatt hours and savings. It secures the community’s long-term energy sovereignty and will inspire more public and private sector distributed energy development efforts on tribal lands,” says Guillermo Gomez, business development manager at Scale Microgrids.
More than half the project’s costs will be funded by California’s Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) and the Direct Pay Investment Tax Credit for tribes.
Scale is partnering with Chris Deschene, who recently completed a distinguished term as the Director of the Office of Indian Energy within the U.S. Department of Energy. During his career, he served as general counsel and advisor to tribes and built  partnerships between non-Indian energy businesses and tribal leaders working on energy projects within Indian Country.
“America’s energy transition must include tribal lands,” says Ryan Goodman, co-founder and chief executive officer at Scale Microgrids. “As we work towards our mission of powering the world with distributed energy, we are committed to leading the way for equal access and economic equality.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/03/federal-government-releases-1-billion-in-rural-electric-funding/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 3, 2023",Federal government releases $1 billion in rural electric funding ,"The advent of agricultural practices of growing crops and grazing animals under and between solar arrays, whose combination has been called agrivoltaics, has spurred a green thumb in the mind of many this year, and now federal funding is on the way. 
Starting April 1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is accepting applications for $1 billion in grants to help agricultural producers and rural small businesses invest in renewable energy systems and make energy-efficiency improvements. The USDA is making grant funding available under the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), with funding from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, the largest-ever investment in combatting the climate crisis in the country.  
REAP is a funding mechanism aimed at bolstering off-grid resiliency and energy efficiency projects on agriculture sites. Recipients may use REAP funding to install on-site renewable energy systems such as ground-mounted solar systems and battery storage, or to make energy efficiency improvements. The USDA will hold quarterly competitions through Sept. 30, 2024 for REAP participants. 
The REAP program also includes a separate funding tier to support under-utilized technology, with $144.5 million available.  
The federal farming agency is particularly interested in energy projects that will help rural communities recover economically with improved infrastructure, reduce climate pollution and increase energy resilience amid climate change. Secondly, the REAP program is designed to support the conservation of American farmland, while investing in underserved communities.  
The REAP program is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure that 40% of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved and overburdened by pollution. 
To ensure that small projects have a fair opportunity to compete for funding, USDA has set aside at least 20% of the available funds until June 30 of each year for grant requests of $20,000 or less, including the grant portion of a combined grant and guaranteed loan request. 
The maximum share of REAP funding which may be requested is up to 50% of the total project cost for energy efficiency projects and renewable energy systems. An award of up to 50% of the total project cost is also available for any project in a designated energy community and/or submitted by an eligible tribal entity. All other projects are eligible to apply for grants of up to 25% of the total project cost. 
The maximum grant is $1 million for renewable energy systems and $500,000 for energy efficiency projects under the REAP program. For additional information on application deadlines and project submission details, see page 19239 of the March 31 Federal Register. 
Rural applications  
Speaking to pv magazine USA in January, Bram Walters, chief executive officer of SunVest Solar, said his firm is focused on developing solar projects for farming communities that aim to take advantage of federal funding from the IRA, including the USDA’s REAP program. 
SunVest’s 8 MW Elkhorn project portfolio, which consists of three community solar projects for the Elkhorn Rural Public Power District in Battle Creek, Neb., is an example of a project that could qualify for adders under the IRA that promote the development of distributed generation assets in regions of stranded grid transmission and distribution capacity, Walters said.  
Assets such as Elkhorn, which received funding from the USDA’s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) program, a loan forgiveness program tied to farming projects, under which projects can qualify for different federal incentives such as RUS and certain IRA adders, while alleviating the need of the offtake counter-party or utility from having to make a costly T&D upgrade, he said.  The RUS electric program provides funding to support demand-side management, energy efficiency and conservation programs, plus on-and off-grid renewable energy system deployments to rural customers.
