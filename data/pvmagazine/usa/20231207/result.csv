Demand has fallen sharply, reeling from policy changes like the transition to net metering in California, utility rate changes in Europe, and macro conditions like high interest rates.
Publicly traded solar stocks have plummeted in 2023, particularly in the residential sector, and Enphase has been no exception to this trend. The Invesco Solar Exchange Traded Fund is trading down 35% year-to-date.
“However, we could be starting to see some of the bottom,” said Raghu Belur, co-founder and chief of products at Enphase Energy in an interview with pv magazine USA.
He said that California’s market may be a quarter or two from reaching the bottom trough in demand, and Europe has started to stabilize and clear out channel inventories. France, in particular, is showing market strength, while countries like Netherlands and Germany have had modest recovery from recent demand implosion.
“I feel that 2024 will be a year of recovery,” said Belur. “I don’t see the market getting worse, but I don’t see it getting dramatically better. We won’t be back to the 2022-type growth. That will probably take an extra year. But 2024 you see things starting to turn around and slowly recover.”
pv magazine USA asked Belur about his outlook for the California market, which often serves as a waypoint for other U.S. states as a more matured market. Recent data from California interconnection queues has shown that the state, which is responsible for roughly 40% of the U.S. solar market, has seen demand fall off a cliff. Installations have dropped 80% since NEM 3.0, and over 17,000 jobs have been lost to layoffs, said the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA).
While Enphase is a major player in the California market, it is a diversified global company, stands as the dominant global supplier of solar microinverters, and has expanded to be a full energy service provider, complete with storage, EV charging, and energy management software.
Belur recognized that it has been a difficult year for California rooftop solar but said he remains confident that financial fundamentals will win back customer demand. Under California’s NEM 3.0, what used to be a four-to-five-year payback period, or return on investment, for rooftop solar, is now about seven to nine years.
“But you’re buying a 25-year asset, so you’re still coming out way ahead,” he said.
He points to the financial fundamentals of rooftop solar, storage and EV charging. Interest rates are eventually going to come down, and meanwhile, utility rates are rising far faster than inflation. This is particularly true in California, where the Public Utilities Commission approved a 13% bump to electric utility rates in 2024. Couple these changing forces with diving solar module prices, and suddenly the payback period looks strong, and demand recovers.
While solar and storage shoppers typically use a rule of thumb of about 3% to 4% annual rate increases from the utility company to estimate long-term savings, Belur said this assumption no longer applies. “Double-digit rate hikes are common now,” he said.
Belur noted that adding energy storage to your home solar array serves as the ideal hedge against utility rate increases and policy changes like NEM 3.0. Enphase continues to introduce intelligent software that interacts with grid price signals, essentially turning your battery into an energy market broker.
In a follow-up interview with pv magazine USA, Raghu Belur will describe how Enphase’s residential solar-plus-storage and other supportive technologies are evolving to meet customer needs.

Ernst & Young (EY) shared and other insights in a recent energy and resources report.
Solar is the cheapest new-build electricity in many markets, even amid inflation and price rises, EY noted in the report. The global weighted average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar is 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative. Large-scale energy storage is also quickly becoming more cost-competitive and sophisticated, said EY.
Solar has rapidly fallen in average LCOE globally, from over $400 / MWh in the early 2010s to about $49 / MWh in 2022, representing decrease of 88%. Wind power LCOE has fallen roughly 60% over the same period.
EY forecasts that solar and wind will become the global baseload electricity source. By 2030 the two traditional renewables are expected to represent 38% of the energy mix, and by 2050 solar and wind may supply 62% of the energy mix. China, Europe and the U.S. will drive a 53% increase in solar and wind generation, producing over 57% of global solar and wind output by 2050, said EY.
“A global solar boom will power more than half of this, but adoption will vary across markets. Solar-generated power will become the biggest source of energy in countries such as the US, and those in Oceania and South Asia, driven by technologies around solar PV modules advancing at rapid pace,” said EY.
However, these landmarks will not be reached without clearing major barriers to progress, EY says. Particularly in the U.S., a backlog of grid interconnection applications is causing delays, cancellations, and large incurred costs. The EY report notes that the United States has at least 1,350 GW of wind and solar capacity and 680 GW of storage is waiting to be connected, which is enough to double the country’s electricity supply.
In a survey of over 70,000 global consumers, EY found that sentiment towards residential solar adoption is strong. About 62% of survey respondents said they have bought or are thinking about buying solar panels, while 50% are considering buying or have already purchased battery storage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/07/agrivoltaics-may-increase-forage-quality-in-semi-arid-regions/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 7, 2023",Agrivoltaics may increase forage quality in semi-arid regions,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Colorado State University in the United States have investigated the impact of an agrivoltaic system on semi-arid grassland previously managed for hay production. The team investigated, in particular, how grassland responded to different simulated grazing management strategies within the agrivoltaic array.
“This is the first study to test how forage quantity and quality respond to simulated grazing in the semi-arid climate of Colorado,” the research’s corresponding author, Matthew Sturchio, told pv magazine. “The ability of plants to regrow at different stages of the growing season, when environmental conditions become hotter and drier, is important for determining best practices for grazing management in grassland agrivoltaic systems.”
The scientists took their measurements at the Jack’s Solar Garden (JSG), an elevated, south-oriented agrivoltaic learning and research facility using single-axis-tracking systems near Longmont, Colorado. They quantified how the timing of grazing alters overall productivity and if forage quality changes throughout the growing season.
Their analysis considered air temperature and relative humidity throughout the growing season from May to September 2022. These data were then used to calculate vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which is the difference between the amount of moisture that is actually in the air and the amount of moisture that air could hold at saturation.
The primary goal was to assess how PV panels altered patterns of forage production, which is technically known as aboveground net primary production (ANPP), and forage quality. “ANPP in grasslands is a valuable ecosystem service that is important for the economics of grazing as an agricultural land use,” the academics explained, noting that they compared the results of the simulated ungrazed grassland under the panels with an ungrazed reference area without PV modules. 
The measurements showed that the agrivoltaic system did not have a significant impact on end of season ANPP totals in the absence of simulated grazing activity.
“More importantly, re-growth following simulated grazing led to equal or greater ANPP than in un-grazed sites at all microenvironment locations throughout the array,” the team said. “This finding indicates that a previously managed low diversity semi-arid grassland can maintain productivity within an agrivoltaic array and that the timing of grazing is unlikely to strongly affect total annual productivity.”
Overall, the results indicated that the forage quality in semi-arid regions may even be increased later into the growing season with grazing under solar panels.
The group introduced its findings in the study “Agrivoltaic arrays can maintain semi-arid grassland productivity and extend the seasonality of forage quality,” published in Applied Energy.
Another research group at the Colorado State University investigated last year how agrivoltaic systems mounted on single-axis trackers affect rainfall and light redistribution at a 1.2 MW installation on grassland in Boulder. This team believes that their understanding of the effects of single-axis agrivoltaic systems on rainfall and light redistribution and consequent impacts on crop productivity can help to restore land degraded by overgrazing, agriculture practice, and water scarcity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/07/lithos-approach-to-scaling-battery-systems-for-the-non-commercial-automotive-sector/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"DECEMBER 7, 2023",Lithos approach to scaling battery systems for the non-commercial automotive sector,"Battery module and pack manufacturer Lithos has been creating lithium-ion battery systems for the non-commercial sector since 2015. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, Calif., Lithos’ custom-engineered applications are configurable for eight industries: automotive, marine, off-highway, energy storage, defense, construction, mining, and agriculture.
“We saw much attention paid to certain applications, like electric vehicles, for example,” says James Meredith, president and founder of Lithos. “This isn’t true for other vehicles and products that still need to be electrified; the business was started to try to address that gap.”
The company is working to develop lithium-titanate-oxide chemistry systems to add to its high-power product offerings in 2024. These packs and modules are expected to charge in less than 10 minutes and offer 10 times the lifecycle of batteries made from lithium-ion-phosphate chemistries.
Lithos uses nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum chemistry for its Gen5 modular battery systems. The high-voltage modules and packs continuously discharge 50.05 kW and have a capacity of 210 kW. Alternatively, the low voltage systems have an output of 3.5 kW and 1.2 kW capacity.
While it’s possible to use Lithos battery systems for residential storage, Meredith states that isn’t the company’s current focus.
Lithos bases its battery chemistry selection on high energy and competitive power density. Moreover, affordability, safety, calendar life, and cycle life also play a role.
“There’s a litany of requirements that drive the choice of chemistry,” Meredith says. “The big ones are, we need something with a lot of energy and something that will last for our customers.” With more stakeholders developing battery systems made from sodium-ion chemistries, Meredith states that the company will continue to leverage different cell chemistries as the technology becomes more commercially available.
Currently, Lithos imports battery cells from South Korea, Japan, the U.S., Canada, and China, while its non-cell components come from Mexico, Canada, the U.S. West Coast, and Southern states. According to Meredith, the company is currently in discussion with domestic cell engineering partners. Lithos aims to begin sourcing cells produced in the U.S. in 2026. The company also wants to leverage tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. However, details on their decision have yet to be released.
Lithos tests its systems based on certification standards that vary by application. “Outside bodies and third parties do the certification,” Meredith said. Some of the certification standards Lithos applications adhere to include Underwriter Laboratories standards, which ensure products meet industry requirements for safety by checking that devices can handle the current they claim to. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) certification standards regulate sustainability regarding energy efficiency and environmental performance. DNV-certified products must also undergo quality management and risk assessment tests to ensure the offering meets industry safety standards. 
Meredith states that Lithos also conducts in-house testing to prevent common hazards like thermal runaway.
“We want to generate deep insights into the failure mechanisms of our products,” he says. This approach helps reduce product-to-market time as the organization addresses potential risks before demoing solutions in front of a standardized body.
Moreover, generating configurable modules means much of the design validation and testing is conducted on the base architecture of a system, which can then be used in various applications.
“We carry that forward and have confidence that any battery we build using the same architecture will also pass those tests, barring certification standards for specific systems that are met,” said Meredith.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/07/after-a-banner-year-u-s-solar-industry-back-on-roller-coaster-through-2026/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 7, 2023","After a banner year, U.S. solar industry back on roller coaster through 2026","The 6.5 GW of new electric generating capacity added in 2023 set a new record, according to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q4 2023 report, and the expected 55% increase over last year is a slight upward revision over last quarter’s expectations. The growth is attributed, for the most part, to the Inflation Reduction Act and other federal clean energy policies.
While the growth in solar capacity has been on an upward trajectory, with an estimated 6.5 GW installed in Q3, the report forecasts economic challenges ahead, and expects to see just 10% growth in 2024.

“Solar remains the fastest-growing energy source in the United States, and despite a difficult economic environment, this growth is expected to continue for years to come,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “To maintain this forecasted growth, we must modernize regulations and reduce bureaucratic roadblocks to make it easier for clean energy companies to invest capital and create jobs.”
Solar made up nearly half (48%) of all new electric generating capacity additions in the first three quarters of 2023, according to the report. This brings total installed solar capacity in the United States to 161 GW with 4.7 million installations.

The California equation
California residential installations led the nation, growing at 31% year-over-year in Q2 and 29% in Q3. Nationwide, residential solar grew 12% in Q3. California’s installation pace, however, will not continue as it was driven by the scramble to get residential solar up and running before the changes to net energy metering took effect. The report notes that the California decline will be short-lived and growth in residential solar will resume in 2025.
Challenges
Aside from state policies that are slowing residential installations, other challenges now are the high cost of financing and a shortage of transformers. Still impacting the utility-scale market are the slow interconnection queues. The report notes that this segment had its lowest level of contract signed in a quarter since 2018.
The interconnection bottleneck will remain a challenge into the future, according to the report, and this along with worsening grid congestion and lack of a robust workforce.
“Growth is expected to be slower starting in 2026 as various challenges like interconnection constraints become more acute,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “It’s critical that the industry continue to innovate to maximize the value that solar brings to an increasingly complex grid. Interconnection reform, regulatory modernization, and increasing storage attachment rates will be key tools.”
Future
While economic challenges are expected to affect the industry in the near term, there’s a bright light as we head into the future. The report forecasts that growth in the U.S. solar industry will average 14% over the next five years.
By 2028, the report says U.S. solar capacity is expected to reach 377 GW, or enough to power more than 65 million homes. By 2050 solar is expected to be the largest source of generating capacity on the U.S. grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/07/community-collaboration-for-solar-success-is-key-to-minimizing-opposition/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 7, 2023",Community collaboration for solar success is key to minimizing opposition,"Solar energy is opening more access to more people than ever as the United States strives to meet its attainable clean energy and climate change mitigation goals. Encouragingly, projections from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie suggest that the solar market is poised to triple by 2028, reaching an impressive 380 GW of installed solar capacity. That means delivering on clean energy goals for communities across the country. And it means energy reliability, access, affordability, education and leadership. It also means installing 938,220,000 solar modules throughout the United States over the next five years, according to the Department of Energy. Overall, communities with the solar industry accounted for 54% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the grid in the first quarter of 2023.
With that much solar being installed, developers and communities are working hard to diversify the types of locations to build solar facilities. The diversification includes opening access to underutilized rooftops, parking lots, brownfields, timberland and farmland, including low-yield land.

Despite best efforts, landowners and developers often encounter significant opposition from local communities, who don’t believe distributed generation (DG) solar systems are a good use of the land. The concerns tend to be echoed from county to county, including viewscape, noise, traffic, property value, and environmental concerns. All are important to address and largely unfounded, but when left unaddressed, they can hinder getting a project implemented.
This is why strategic site selection is essential for solar developers in their quest for ideal project locations. Best suitable sites can become optimal locations that also positively impact the community. An additional benefit is that this can help mitigate opposition from the community.
Education delivers
Though developers and landowners are steeped in the advantages of solar projects, they shouldn’t assume the community is. That’s why it can be effective to bring the community together early in the process and discuss the projects’ advantages for everyone.
These projects bring value, and different advantages can be emphasized depending on the type of project being developed.
Making affirmative arguments for how solar energy will offer tangible benefits like improving the local economy, providing landowners with a steady source of revenue through long-term rent payments, and lowering electricity bills can cultivate a good working relationship between the developer, landowner, and community. Locally, the dollars invested and saved through lower electricity prices get recycled into the local economy, raising the standard of living for everyone.
Collaboration, Not Confrontation
Early involvement by landowners, local residents and government officials can defuse oppositional attitudes in a community. Particularly in cases where permitting pathways include local preemption policies for power plant construction. It’s essential to hear the voices of the residents and their representatives to work together to eliminate roadblocks to the process.
By working together, local officials and residents can better accurately assess the effects and values a commercial or community solar project will have on a town. Collaborating offers opportunities to learn from each other and create advocates for the project within an area. Communities and local officials benefit from understanding  the intricacies of any given site, including answers to questions like:
Answering these questions and others that occur goes a long way toward building trust between the developer and the community—a vital step in reducing opposition and turning the project into a positive experience for everyone.
Implementation
In any commercial or community solar project, developers must be strategic about their decision to site the project. Bring as many stakeholders on board as early as possible and adopt an attitude of collaboration rather than confrontation. Answering residents’ legitimate concerns can also build the trust necessary to smooth a project’s development from start to finish.
By following strategic siting approaches, developers can get more projects completed on time and within budget. Mitigating opposition will help communities build resilience in their electrical systems and enlist them in the larger mission to access reliable, clean and affordable energy for decades.
