https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/08/bipartisan-michigan-bill-would-unlock-community-solar-market/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MICHIGAN",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 8, 2023",Bipartisan Michigan bill would unlock community solar market,"A bipartisan coalition led by Michigan Senators Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) and Ed McBroom (R-Waucedah Township) introduced Senate Bills 152 and 153 to enable a statewide community solar market.
The bill would create a pathway for residents and businesses in Michigan to subscribe to a portion of capacity of off-site solar facilities. Production of the facility would be credited to a customer’s utility bill.
“Solar energy brings a lot of economic and environmental benefits, but not everyone is able to build their own solar array,” Sen. Irwin said. “These bills give people, organizations, and businesses the option to participate in affordable renewable energy generation in their own communities.”
From 2020-22, the average monthly residential electricity bill in Michigan increased by more than 15%, according to the Energy Information Administration. Some Michigan homeowners can lower their energy bills by installing their own solar panels, but more than 50% of households cannot access solar due to financial barriers, roof limitations or property ownership, said Irwin’s office. Under this legislation, residents can subscribe to community solar projects.
“These small-scale, local solar projects will be particularly useful to residents, providing an opportunity to independently produce energy for themselves and their neighbors, and providing savings on energy bills for those who subscribe,” said Sen. McBroom.
Community solar projects would be limited to 5 MW of maximum nameplate capacity. The program would enable homeowners, small businesses, government buildings, schools, and churches to share a solar facility’s capacity. These arrays are often built on small parcels of underutilized farmland, but can also be built on large commercial rooftops, parking lots, brownfields or reclaimed mining lands.
Michigan performs worse than the U.S. average in terms of hours of electric service interruption and the number of interruptions, according to a report by Local Solar for All. More than a quarter million Michiganders went without electricity for six hours in August 2022 due to grid failures started by inclement weather. Equipment failures left Ann Arbor in the dark for six hours on February 1, 2023, disrupting university and municipal operations.
 The Local Solar for All report found that interruptions in service led to just under $5 billion in losses throughout 2020 and 2021. Local community solar offers a solution as electricity is generated close to where it’s needed and can provide homes and small businesses power even during demand spikes and widespread outages.
Local Solar for All released a roadmap in 2020 for distributed solar and storage adoption. It found that distributed clean energy like local solar could provide energy consumers nationwide as much as $473 billion by 2050 as part of the clean energy transition that is already underway.
In Michigan, Vote Solar modeled that ratepayers would experience direct benefits of $379,966 annually from local solar and storage expansion. The roadmap also showed that a clean electric grid that leverages local solar and battery storage can be $88 billion less expensive to run across the country than today’s centralized grid.
Utility DTE Energy proposed a $7 billion, five-year grid investment plan in November 2021. Consumers Energy also filed its own grid investment plan in 2021, which includes $5.4 billion in investments over five years. This $12.4 billion in spending is passed to consumers in the form of rate raises. Community solar may offer a more cost-effective and reliable electricity grid for Michigan.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/08/utility-completes-construction-of-250-mw-texas-solar-project/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 8, 2023",Utility completes construction of 250 MW Texas solar project,"Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions (DESS), the nonregulated commercial renewables business of utility Duke Energy, completed construction of Pisgah Ridge Solar, a 250 MW utility-scale solar project in Navarro County, Texas.
Pisgah Ridge Solar will generate approximately 200,000 MWh  of electricity per year for Meijer, a midwestern retail company which will receive 83 MW of the project’s offtake capacity. The decarbonization of Meijer’s operations is the equivalent of taking 20,000 vehicles off the road. Meijer holds a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for energy produced by the Texas solar facility.
Charles River Laboratories is another corporate offtaker on the project, which signed on for 102 MW of the project’s generating capacity for 15 years. Meijer splits the rest with one other corporation, which has not been revealed.
“Charles River has committed to sourcing 100% of our global electricity needs through renewable sources by 2030,” said Gregg Belardo, executive director of EHS & sustainability at Charles River. “Our VPPA with Duke provides coverage for our North American facilities and moves us significantly closer to that global goal.”
Duke worked with engineering and construction contractor Moss & Associates for construction of the west Texas solar project.
Major utility Duke Energy recently announced plans to phase out coal use by 2035. Duke aims for 50% carbon reductions by 2030 and zero-carbon by 2050. Its subsidiary Duke Energy Sustainability Solutions operates 500MW of solar and a 36MW battery storage facility in Texas. Duke Energy said it plans to double its enterprise-wide renewable portfolio from 8 GW to 16 GW by the end of 2025.
Currently Duke Energy’s Texas-based commercial renewables portfolio includes close to 1.5 GW of wind, 750 MW of solar and a 36 MW battery storage facility.
Along with indirect economic benefits that accompany solar project development, such as increased local spending in the service and construction industries, the Pisgah Ridge Solar facility will also have a positive economic impact on the local community by providing significant tax revenues for the Corsicana Independent School District.
The U.S. utility solar market was beset by project delays over 2022, with Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) panel ban enforcement causing widespread module detentions as the industry scrambled to develop quartzite sourcing documentation. The anti-circumvention investigation by the Department of Commerce froze project installations and power purchase agreement negotiations, as 85% of total module imports could be subject to tariffs of up to 240%.
Wood Mackenzie anticipates another 2.8 GWdc of utility-scale solar will come online this year, increasing the 2022 outlook to 10.3 GWdc. After this year, IRA-driven demand and supply normalization will boost the utility-scale sector to 150 GWdc of installations through the forecast period.
The research agency said it expects Texas to account for 5.1 GWdc of solar developments this year,  of which 4.4 GWdc will come from the utility-scale solar, Matthew Sahd, an energy transition analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told pv magazine USA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/08/sunnova-to-deploy-solar-and-storage-virtual-power-plant-in-texas/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,SOFTWARE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 8, 2023",Sunnova to deploy solar and storage virtual power plant in Texas,"Sunnova Energy International announced a partnership with David Energy, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based retail energy provider, to deploy a virtual power plant (VPP) service called Adaptive Retail in Texas. 
The VPP leverages Sunnova’s solar and battery storage systems, optimizing fleet interaction of energy assets connected to the electric grid. By aggregating customer resources, Sunnova can provide a more reliable, flexible source of energy that can respond to changes in demand and market conditions. 
“Our Adaptive Retail plan represents a significant departure from the traditional centralized power generation model, putting more control and flexibility in the hands of our customers,” said William (John) Berger, chief executive officer of Sunnova. 
Sunnova’s fleet of batteries will respond in real time to David Energy’s electricity modeling software platform, dispatching the fleet in response to wholesale electricity market prices.  
David Energy’s platform will allow distributed energy resources to integrate the value of demand response and bid their capacity into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s (ERCOT) ancillary markets, tapping into new revenue streams that the company said will help boost customer savings. 
“By combining a retail energy plan with software that connects to a broad range of devices many customers already have, David Energy’s platform can turn Texans’ homes into power plants. The potential to bring hundreds of megawatts of much needed flexible capacity to ERCOT via these VPPs in the near future is very real,” said James McGinniss, chief executive officer of David Energy.
Texas has 1.5 GW of rooftop and other small-scale solar, while on a per-capita basis, small-scale solar in Texas trails most of the other ten sunniest U.S. states. Research has found that rooftop solar adoption rises sharply as the value of PV systems to building owners increases. 
Texas storm 
The value of VPPs in Texas can be exemplified by the Winter Storm Uri event of 2021, when much-higher-than-expected demand caused wholesale market prices to balloon up to the capped rate of $9,000/MW. This led to widespread blackouts and customers receiving energy bills in the multiple-thousands of dollars. 
The inability to meet demand was caused by a combination of nonfunctioning natural gas equipment, and congestion on the grid from intense localized energy demand, that caused substations to cut power to stabilize the grid. A study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found 87% of the outages were caused by issues with natural gas supply as uninsulated stations failed to function. 
Grid congestion and bottlenecks are an acute problem for Texas. A vast bulk of the large-scale solar projects are in the western, sunnier part of Texas, and are delivered to population centers in the east. 
Congestion rents, or the cost of transmission services, are expected to worsen in many areas across ERCOT, despite hundreds of millions of dollars planned to build transmission to alleviate the congestion. 
Solar and batteries can serve a critical role in alleviating this congestion, reducing renewables curtailment, smoothing the curve of wholesale market demand spikes, and providing critical backup power in times of crisis. 
VPP pilot 
In September 2022, ERCOT approved a pilot project to test the efficacy of VPPs to support the grid. The pilot project, ERCOT says, will enable premises with any combination of generation, energy storage, or controllable load with the capability of 1 MW or less to participate in ERCOT’s wholesale markets. 
The project will at first enroll up to 80 MW of aggregated resources. Each local aggregation must have the capability to provide at least 100 kW of response, through demand response capability and injection capability. These aggregations will be eligible to provide up to 40 MW of “non-spinning reserve service,” or capacity that can be started or interrupted within 30 minutes as needed. 
ERCOT’s goals for the pilot project are to examine how aggregated DERs can support reliability, enhance the wholesale market, incentivize investment, potentially reduce transmission and distribution investments, and support better load management during emergencies. 
Following the first one-year phase of the pilot project, ERCOT expects to design additional phases that could expand participation. ERCOT will also study, using data from the pilot project, how different dispatch and pricing schemes could improve its efforts in managing transmission congestion. 
“Amazed at how quickly a group of private sector folks designed the bones of Texas’ first distributed energy resource (DER) export program,” said Arushi Frank, U.S. energy markets policy lead at Tesla and co-chair of ERCOT’s DER Task Force. In May 2022, Tesla rallied owners of its home-scale batteries to demonstrate how they could help power the Texas grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/08/how-nem-3-0-could-change-californias-clean-energy-landscape/,"GUEST POST,NET METERING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",,"MARCH 8, 2023",How NEM 3.0 could change California’s clean energy landscape  ,"California’s electricity bills are already about 5% higher than the national average, and rising. Rate hikes went into effect in January and Southern California Edison proposed another 4.4% increase that would be effective this summer.
California has also become the largest solar market in the United States, seeking clean and affordable energy alternatives, and has been among other states trying to increase the value of clean energy assets with net energy metering (NEM).
The first two iterations of California’s NEM program greatly incentivized the adoption of solar, but NEM 3.0, which was approved unanimously by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in December, is about to roll that value back. NEM 3.0, which takes effect on April 15, could significantly alter California’s solar landscape.
Let’s dive into the history behind California’s NEM program, and what developers need to grapple with as this new policy is implemented.
How did we get to NEM 3.0?
California’s NEM 1.0 policy ran on a 1-to-1 incentive ratio, meaning for every one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy generated from solar, customers were given one kWh of utility-generated credit that could be applied to their energy bills.
In 2017, the CPUC replaced that with NEM 2.0, which redesigned the incentive program to include non-bypassable charges, which were additional charges determined by the amount of kWh of electricity customers consumed from the grid. These additional charges were used to fund important low-income and energy efficiency programs. Although non-bypassable charges decreased the value of solar, credit for exported solar energy was still offered based on retail electricity rates.
When California made the decision to switch from NEM 1.0 to NEM 2.0, few imagined that the state would soon pass another overhaul of the incentive program. Now the landscape is set to shift again.
 What changes are coming with NEM 3.0 — and why?
The most significant change under NEM 3.0 is that the value of credits for excess solar exported to the grid will be reduced by roughly 20% to 40% from what is currently being received under NEM 2.0, further decreasing the value of solar. Additionally, under NEM 2.0, customers could lock in retail rates for 20 years, but with NEM 3.0, customers can only lock in rates for nine years. After those nine years, the rate is calculated each year via the Avoided Cost Calculator (ACC) – essentially, customers will get credited the avoided cost, or the wholesale rate of energy at that specific time that the utility would have otherwise paid a supplier for.
Why the changes? For one, the CPUC believes that NEM 2.0 negatively impacts non-participating ratepayers — particularly those with lower incomes. Furthermore, NEM 3.0 could be seen as a vehicle to encourage the adoption of storage. Currently, the solar power produced during the day does not correspond to the periods of peak electricity demands that come at night when customers are home, resulting in the higher consumption of traditional energy sources during peak hours. Since California offers time-of-use rate structures, which are required to participate under NEM 3.0, electricity costs during these peak periods will be very high, but storage can save solar energy generated during the day and use it to power homes and businesses during peak demand.
With the decreased value of solar coming under NEM 3.0, implementing storage to offset the lost value will be a natural next step for customer-generators. This allows customers to avoid paying exorbitant electricity rates that come at peak hours, and lowers their usage of fossil fuels, helping the state meet its goal of slashing carbon emissions to 48% below 1990 levels by 2030.
How should you prepare for NEM 3.0?
Commercial solar customers that don’t already participate in NEM 2.0 have an opportunity to avoid the changes in NEM 3.0: If they submit an interconnection application for the program by April 14, they can be grandfathered into NEM 2.0, locking in retail rates for the next 20 years. If the application is approved, projects must be built and operational within three years to receive NEM 2.0’s benefits.
Those looking to participate need to act fast, getting necessary paperwork together and interconnection applications submitted to ensure they are processed and approved in time. However, commercial customers and some smaller developers may not have the resources and time to get the necessary documentation, such as detailed design documents and project drawings, across the finish line. Therefore, enlisting expertise from more experienced developers or partners who are familiar with the process can be a wise choice.
The chance for customers to retain higher value for their solar projects will create a rapid influx of projects looking to come online under NEM 2.0. With this in mind, developers and customers must be aware of the possible roadblocks that could arise during implementation — there could be interconnection queues or permitting delays. Developers need to apply the right planning on the back end to account for unanticipated roadblocks, as well as ensure they have the necessary labor and materials to build the projects, especially considering potential labor shortages and current supply chain disruptions the industry is facing.
For customers who don’t qualify, or don’t get an application submitted in time, developers need to be ready to implement more solar and storage projects down the line. In the short-term, NEM 3.0 will impact solar adoption, but with time the market will adjust and customers will shift focus to solar-plus-storage deployment to achieve the best value. Even though customers are getting reduced credits for their system under NEM 3.0, adding storage can help balance the overall cost impact on electricity bills. Even implementing things like EV charging infrastructure can be leveraged for vehicle-to-grid charging applications, providing power back to the customer from an EV battery during peak electricity demand periods.
California is at the crossroads of significant electricity related challenges such as high energy costs and grid constraints, and a transition to clean energy. Ultimately, adding storage capabilities could incentivize businesses to go solar, and significantly change the nature of projects across California while also meeting climate goals and increasing grid reliability. A solar-plus-storage market is already a norm in places like San Diego, and developers should be ready for that trend to continue across the state.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/08/arizona-county-approves-solar-powered-cobalt-sulfate-production-facility/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,ARIZONA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 8, 2023",Arizona county approves solar-powered cobalt sulfate production facility,"EVelution Energy, an electric vehicle battery materials company, has received the approval of the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to develop a solar-powered cobalt sulfate production facility in Yuma County, Ariz., the first EV battery facility with on-site renewable energy generation in the U.S.
The facility expects to produce  7,000 tonnes of cobalt per year and calls for 28.4 MW of on-site solar power generating arrays to be installed on 105 acres of the company’s 139-acre property in Yuma County, Arizona. The estimated power needs of the cobalt processing facility are expected to be about 6 MW, allowing the company to sell excess power during the day to local electric utility, the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation District, Gil Michel-Garcia, executive vice president and general counsel of EVelution, told pv magazine USA.
EVelution expects to start construction of the processing facility in 2024 and expects to be fully operational by 2026, when it will have 360 full-time employees, the company has stated.
Currently, the primary source of power for the district is hydropower from the Parker Dam, whose water level has been decreasing due to drought conditions, Michel-Garcia said. As a result, the district has expressed an interest in purchasing 6 MW of excess power production, with the possibility of acquiring more in the future, Michel-Garcia said.
“We expect that the surrounding agricultural community will benefit will from having access to our locally generated low cost clean power,” he said, adding that EVelution’s facility is expected to cost about $200 million to build.
The EV battery materials facility uses an atmospheric leaching process, a process which requires a significant amount of peak energy to heat water. In typical leaching facilities, the heating is typically done using natural gas or propone heaters, while EVelution intends to use solar power to heat the water and to store it in large hot water storage tanks, Michel-Garcia explained. The tanks will store heated water to operate its processing facility overnight and thus reduce the overnight power requirement load on the district utility as well, he said.
With excess generating capacity, Michel-Garcia said EVelution plans to install battery storage capacity of about 24 MW (96 MWh) to manage peak power sold to Wellton-Mohawk during the day and to store excess solar to further reduce its overnight power requirements.
To interconnect the cobalt processing facility to the  grid, EVelution will pay the district to build a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line to interconnect to a local power substation, which will require an interconnection agreement with the district for the purchase and sale of power, Michel-Garcia said.
The company is currently in discussions to reach an offtake agreement for the pricing of excess solar power and the pricing for the supply of electric power during the evening periods, as well as the construction of the 34.5 kV electric transmission line from to interconnect with its processing facility, he said.
As a U.S. company, Michel-Garcia said EVelution will be the first company to build a carbon neutral cobalt sulfate production facility in the U.S. with on-site generation.  The company’s aim is to combat climate change, boost U.S. manufacturing, and reduce our economic reliance on other countries for EV battery materials.
Currently about 70% of the world’s EV battery-grade cobalt sulfate comes from China, with Finland and Indonesia producing most of the remainder.  EVelution Energy is hoping to contribute to supplying 40% of the EV battery-grade cobalt sulfate required by U.S.-made EVs by 2027, Michel-Garcia said.
“What is interesting about this project are the confluence of the various tax incentives that have recently become available in the U.S. in order to make green infrastructure projects like this possible,” he said.
 EVelution Energy stands to recover costs from the solar investment tax credit for its on-site solar facility, as well as the Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act.  This Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (PTC) applies tax credits of up to $31 billion to the production of cathode and anode materials used in lithium-ion batteries and advanced battery minerals sourced in the U.S.
According to a tax presentation by the company, EVelution stands to recover either or both Section 45X or 48C of the IRA, the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit. The energy project credit is a one-time ITC equal to 30% of the amount of invested capital in a mineral processing facility used for EV batteries.
Prior to forming EVelution in October 2021, co-founder and chief executive officer Navaid Alam was president of commodities trading firm Cobham Capital for 21 years, and was also an attorney at Clifford Chance and other firms.  Michel-Garcia also spent four years at Cobham Capital after practicing law in various firms for over two decades.
In October 2022, EVelution signed a memorandum of understanding to partner with commodities firm Trafigura for the supply of raw materials and marketing of cobalt sulphate and nickel sulphate from the Arizona facility.
