Its PairTree product can be used in on-grid or off-grid modes and can be paired with lithium-ion battery systems with storage capacities of up to 40 kWh.
“The product is currently only being sold in the U.S., Paired Power is focused on the US market but will consider international opportunities down the line,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The carport can host up to 10 bifacial solar modules and can be installed within a single workday, with just two workers using standard hand tools.
“The installation of traditional EV chargers and solar canopies is a time and labor-intensive process, not to mention the disruption and delays of construction,” said CEO Tom McCalmont. “We designed PairTree to eliminate these hassles and make the transition to solar and EV charging simple and scalable while also being modular enough to accommodate future needs.”
The system measures 10.5 feet by 16.4 feet by 12.13 feet and supports single- and dual-port “Level 2” charging and a universal SAE J1772 charging interface. The J1772 5-pin is a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles.
The canopy sits on a ballasted steel foundation, which the company said allows customers to avoid costly foundation work and permitting delays.
PairTree offers additional options of batteries or ground screws to secure the charger in high winds. PairTree is designed to be installed side by side in multi-unit configurations for additional energy output to power additional chargers.
The company also claimed that the system needs minimal maintenance, as there are no moving parts.
“AC charging stations are offered to support Level 2 charging, and 120V outlet panels can be added to support emergency or temporary power,” it explained.”Orders for PairTree can be placed now and are expected for general delivery starting in Q2 2023.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/21/dual-purpose-solar-makes-a-greater-impact/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Dual-purpose solar makes a greater impact,"Environmental Social Governance (ESG) may have been used first in a 2004 report titled “Who Cares Wins”, which was a joint initiative of financial institutions spearheaded by the United Nations. The thought behind ESG is that there is much value far behind financial advancement in focusing on sustainability throughout an organization. The three pillars can be defined this way:
BlueWave is certified B Corp based in Boston, Mass, that was recently acquired by Axium Infrastructure, an infrastructure investment management firm with a North American renewables portfolio.  BlueWave has long believed in responsible development and is driven by strong adherence to ESG. In fact, BlueWave earned a top score in the Governance Impact Area of B Lab’s Impact Assessment, earning the company a spot on the list of the 2022 Best for the World B Corporations.  Axium is also committed to integrating ESG throughout its project development and management process. The acquisition enables BlueWave to build, own and manage projects within its development portfolio.
“We feel incredibly lucky to have landed with such as well-aligned partner from a values perspective. This will enable BlueWave to transition from what is primarily a develop-and-sell model to a develop, build, own and operate model,” said Trevor Hardy, co-founder and CEO of BlueWave.
And while BlueWave was the first company to complete a community solar project in the state of Massachusetts, it recently spun off its community solar servicing business as Perch Energy. BlueWave still plans to develop, own and operate community solar projects and work with partners like Perch to acquire and manage the customers.
Agrivoltaics
BlueWave was the developer of an agrivoltaic installation in the state of Maine. The 4.2 MW solar project, which is owned and operated by NaviSun, is built on a 10-acre blueberry farm, providing protection for the crops, while also serving as a pilot project. The project was developed by BlueWave, which worked with CS Energy, the EPC partner, and Navisun, the owner operator, and University of Maine, the research partner to create a pilot program in which they are studying solar construction techniques as well as ways of harvesting blueberries that are grown among solar panels.
Floating solar
Another example of dual use is the development of floating solar or floatovoltaics. In July of 2021 BlueWave entered into a joint venture agreement with Ciel et Terre, the world’s leading floatovoltaics company, to develop floating solar projects in Massachusetts and other markets in the Northeast. BlueWave sees great opportunity in developing solar on man-made ponds and reservoirs, as it solves land-use problems while providing ecological benefits to the water resources where the system is located. In 2018, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated that installing floating solar on the more than 24,000 man-made U.S. reservoirs could generate about 10% of the nation’s annual electricity production. Ciel et Terre has about 22 floating solar projects installed in the United States to date totally around 28 MW, with about 62 MW in various states of engineering and hundreds of MWs in various stages of development.
A dual use future
BlueWave is looking to expand its dual-use projects and prioritizes working with communities and individual farmers in finding the best use for their land. Hardy also noted that providing clean energy to low-to-middle income people is another major focus for BlueWave as one of the company’s ESG missions is to ensure that renewables are accessible to absolutely everyone. BlueWave also sees stand-alone battery storage as one of the most interesting dynamics in the market right now, and one that Hardy sees as vital to accelerating the energy transition. “To be part of a team where we are lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time and be very much the proactive participant in that transition is incredibly exciting” Hardy concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/21/solaredge-launches-new-power-optimizers-for-commercial-solar/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,ISRAEL,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",SolarEdge launches new power optimizers for commercial solar,"From pv magazine global
Israel-based battery and inverter manufacturer SolarEdge has unveiled two new power optimizers for commercial PV systems.
“The S-Series Power Optimizer is designed to accommodate higher power modules and bi-facial modules, which due to the rear-side module mismatch can suffer from even greater potential power loss,” the company said in a statement. “Providing 99.5% efficiency and supporting two high power, high input current PV modules, the S-Series lowers Levelized Cost of Energy thanks to higher yield and enables longer and more powerful strings.”
The optimizers are available in two versions, one for ground mount and carport applications and one for rooftop applications.
The two devices, dubbed S1200 and S1201, respectively, have both a rated input DC power of 1,2 kW, maximum efficiency of 99.5%, and weighted efficiency of 98.8%. The maximum output current is 20 Adc and the maximum output voltage is 80 Vdc.
Both optimizers measure 129 mm x 155 mm x 59 mm and weigh in at 1.1 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and support the connection of two PV modules in series. The maximum allowed system voltage for both products is 1,000 V.
For both products, the manufacturer offers a 25-year warranty.
“The SolarEdge Sense Connect technology joins an expanded range of safety features, among them the SafeDC technology that is designed to enable the PV systems’ DC voltage to be automatically reduced to touch-safe levels (1V DC per module), in grid failures or when the inverter is shut down,” the manufacturer stated. “Adding to these the Rapid Shutdown feature, installers can activate SafeDC at the flip of a switch, discharging the conductors to safe voltage levels within just 30 seconds.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/21/netting-true-value-from-batteries/,"GUEST POST,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Netting true value from batteries,"As U.S. states replace traditional net metering rules with “net billing” structures, a greater number of customers are co-installing solar with battery storage. But these batteries may not be being put to best use if they are utilized primarily to optimize self-consumption of rooftop PV, as net billing reforms incentivize.
Net billing allows solar customers to offset their electricity consumption with solar on an instantaneous or hourly basis, receiving full retail rate credit for that portion of their solar generation (area B in the chart below left). However, any solar generation exported to the grid (area A) is compensated at a reduced rate. This asymmetric pricing structure incentivizes solar customers with battery storage to charge their batteries with surplus solar (A) and discharge that stored solar energy to serve load during hours of net consumption (area C).
Battery drivers
Battery storage operation under net billing tariffs is also influenced by other policy and rate design features. For example, many residential customers in the United States remain on time-invariant rates, which do not reflect dynamic grid value.
Federal tax incentives encourage customers with paired solar-plus-storage systems to charge exclusively from onsite solar. Those rules are intended to ensure that batteries do not increase the consumption of carbon-intensive power. However, this restriction limits batteries’ ability to charge when the grid costs are lowest, and to fully charge in advance of exceptionally high-cost time periods when discharging the battery could provide the greatest value to the electric system.
Residential batteries may face additional barriers, for example through interconnection agreements or provisions in retail electricity tariffs, that restrict discharge to the grid.
A paper recently published by Berkeley Lab researchers in the journal iScience evaluates the merits of net billing structures, in terms of the incentive they create for solar customers to use battery storage to arbitrate between retail rates and grid export prices. The article, titled “Private vs. public value of US residential battery storage operated for solar self-consumption,” quantifies the value of the resulting storage dispatch patterns from the perspectives of both the individual solar customer and the larger power system.
Relying on hourly metered loads from roughly 1,800 residential customers across six utility service territories, the study’s central finding is that residential storage dispatched to maximize solar self-consumption under flat (i.e., non-time-varying) net billing tariffs provides virtually no value to the broader power system. This occurs partly because of the temporal misalignment between the storage dispatch profile and real-time grid value. However, a significant source of the deficiency occurs because, on system peak-load days, batteries used solely for solar self-consumption tend to stand idle, as there is little surplus solar to fuel storage discharge during system peak hours.
Neither of those deficiencies can be wholly corrected simply by replacing flat prices with time-varying ones. Rather they also require that customers are able to charge their batteries from, and discharge to, the grid, especially during key high-value hours.
Key takeaways
There are several important implications of the findings above. First, net billing tariffs may create what economists call “deadweight loss,” by encouraging large customer-investments in storage equipment that provide little societal benefit.
Second, the findings show how using storage to move solar exports back behind the meter could perpetuate the same set of issues related to fixed-cost recovery as with net metering, undermining the intent of the rate reforms. Finally, net billing structures could potentially exacerbate inequities in the costs and benefits of distributed energy technologies, insofar as they will be most beneficial for customers who can afford to co-install storage with solar.
Yet, the conclusions above are not foregone. The study goes on to show how net billing tariffs could be designed or coupled with other incentives in a manner that provides significant benefits to the power system – without degrading solar self-consumption levels or imposing significant additional stress on the local distribution network.
In part, incentives could promote more grid-friendly battery usage by allowing and incentivizing storage to discharge to the grid during a relatively small number of high-value hours – for example, through critical peak pricing tariffs or demand response programs.
While utilities must ensure that additional exports do not create reliability issues, interconnection agreements could impose softer limits, such as setting a maximum for the solar-plus-storage system’s combined instantaneous net exports based on the solar system’s nameplate capacity. Within the study’s analysis, those constraints tended not to bind during the highest value hours of the year, allowing storage to dispatch fully at those times.
In summary, as state regulators and utilities continue down the path of net metering reforms for rooftop solar, it will be critical to consider the implications for customers with battery storage. That imperative will become even greater as control and communication technology and standards make it more feasible to capture residential battery value, and as opportunities emerge for distributed batteries to participate in existing wholesale markets.

BlackRock Real Assets, a subsidiary of the $14.8 trillion United States-headquartered investment giant, announced on Wednesday it had agreed to acquire SolarZero and will commit almost $90 million ($NZ100 million) over the next three years to accelerate the growth of the company’s solar and battery technology platform.
Founded in 2008, SolarZero has established itself as a leading provider of rooftop solar and smart battery energy storage systems in New Zealand, claiming a 40% market share of new residential rooftop installs.
The company has installed approximately 8,500 rooftop solar PV systems across the residential, commercial, and community sectors, linking them using its proprietary smart battery and energy management platform to build what is said is the largest virtual power plant (VPP) in the Asia-Pacific region.
SolarZero said the VPP currently generates more than 89 GWh of energy each year and with over 48 MWh of storage provides active support to the national grid by reducing peak loads across the country by 16 MW every day.
SolarZero founder and chief executive Andrew Booth said BlackRock’s acquisition of the company would allow it to build on its track record and drive its next phase of growth, with plans to invest $1 billion in new solar and battery systems across New Zealand over the next 10 years.
“BlackRock Climate Infrastructure team’s investment and backing will enable us to rapidly scale, grow our energy services network, and accelerate the transition to a 100% clean energy future,” he said.
“By 2030, 50% of the world’s energy will be generated in the Asia Pacific region. The window to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis is closing fast and the power couple of solar plus storage is one of the few true paths to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity, and a liveable planet.”
New Zealand has set a target of 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035 and to be a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 but with rooftop solar penetration currently at 2% and the expected demand for electricity in the nation to double by 2050, there is a clear need for additional residential solar.
BlackRock’s co-head of climate infrastructure for the Asia Pacific region, Charlie Reid, said the acquisition of SolarZero is the United States-headquartered company’s first investment in New Zealand and its first residential solar investment in the Asia Pacific.
“Our move into New Zealand demonstrates BlackRock’s commitment to invest in attractive markets as part of our broader efforts to offer a flow of addressable global climate investment opportunities for our clients,” he said.
“SolarZero is a global pioneer, and we look forward to supporting its expansion into other Asia-Pacific markets and, at the same time, to accelerating New Zealand’s net zero journey.”
The acquisition is subject to various conditions including approval by the New Zealand Overseas Investment Office.
The investment in SolarZero follows BlackRock’s recent acquisition of Melbourne-based battery storage developer Akaysha Energy and its portfolio of nine projects in the national grid.
BlackRock renewables portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region also includes recent investments in Taiwanese solar energy firm, New Green Power, Korean renewables energy developers, KREDO and Brite Energy Partners, and Australian electric vehicle (EV) charging provider JOLT.
