Rulemaking proceedings led to the slashing of net metering, a program in which utilities pay customers for their excess solar generation. Net metering has been pivotal in launching rooftop solar, a technology that supports climate resilience in the grid, launched local businesses and helps residents save on their electric bills.
Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb signed a bill in 2017 that put the state on a path to phasing out net metering by 2047. Meanwhile, it let utilities begin paying solar customers a lower rate when solar penetration reached 1.5% of their summer peak load, or by July 2022. Net metering rates are often lowered over time as a way to avoid cross-subsidization of solar owners by non-solar owners, and a way to retain profits for electric utilities. However, national laboratory studies have shown that until rooftop solar reaches 10% of the grid mix, it leads to a negligible cost to utility companies, and can instead lead to cost savings.
Utilities in Indiana wasted no time in aggressively slashing net metering rates. On July 1, 2022, investor-owned utility CenterPoint Energy switched from monthly net metering to a new model known as “instantaneous netting.” Under instantaneous netting, customers pay the full retail rate for all power used from the grid, and all solar power sent back to the grid is paid at the much lower “excess distribution generation” rate.
Overnight, CenterPoint was approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to pay their customers $0.031/kWh for solar, and northern Indiana utility NIPSCO was approved at $0.026/kWh. Since then, net metering payment rates have creeped up to about four or five cents per kWh as power prices have increased considerably following the invasion of Ukraine.
The new rates altered the estimated typical residential solar payback period from the seven to 10 years to 21 years or more, a value proposition that Hoosiers haven’t been able to stomach.
The rates are so unpalatable that only two NIPSCO customers have installed rooftop solar since July 1, 2022, reported Ben Inskeep, program director at Citizens Action Coalition (CAC). NIPSCO serves over 1.2 million customers.
CenterPoint has had roughly 100 rooftop solar installations, and across the state’s four other utility companies, only 124 customers have applied to go solar under the new rates, reports the Indy Star.
The ratemaking case has found its way to the Supreme Court. Solar advocates argue that the 2017 Holcomb bill never had provisions that allowed for “instantaneous netting.”
“We prefer to call this ‘no netting’, because there really is no netting that’s happening,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of CAC.
The shorter the interval of netting excess solar production, the lower the payments to rooftop solar customers. Analysis by CAC found that once the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) from the Inflation Reduction Act steps down to zero, payback periods for rooftop solar could exceed 30 years.
The ratemaking debacle highlights an ongoing critical issue for residential solar rollout: uncertainty. Reducing uncertainty was one of the main motivations for the industry push to have the ITC extended for a decade, rather than the piecemeal way it had been extended historically.
“It’s hard to say what your compensation will be in the future — it will change every single year,” said Inskeep.
“You’re making a 25-year investment, but the value is updated on an annual basis. You have no ability to see if your investment will pay off. Utilities never make large investments for 30-year assets without having certainty for that cost recovery. Now they’re asking residential customers to take that risk — with no ability to understand when their investment will pay off or if it will never pay off,” he said.
A similar battle between utilities and a coalition of consumer advocates, environmentalists and solar industry members is raging across the nation in various markets. The nation will be watching Indiana’s Supreme Court case as well as the ruling on Net Metering 3.0 in California as waypoints to determine the fate of rooftop solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/17/urban-racking-to-focus-on-rooftop-solar-canopies-in-u-s-metropolitan-markets/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,INTERVIEW,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,ILLINOIS,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON, D.C.",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022",Urban Racking to focus on rooftop solar canopies in U.S. metropolitan markets,"Urban Energy, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based distributed energy project developer, recently launched a solar racking business focused on deploying rooftop solar canopies in U.S. metropolitan markets. The new business, called Urban Racking, formed in conjunction with the construction of Urban Energy’s first solar canopy system in Brooklyn, N.Y.
Located in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, the 46 kW solar canopy was formally approved by utility Con Edison in October. It consists of 118 Canadian Solar bifacial modules (390 watt)  and SolarEdge inverters with optimizers, Russell Wilcox, founder and chief executive officer of Urban Energy, told pv magazine USA.
Urban Energy’s solar canopy is more than three times larger than standard rooftop-mounted solar systems whose average output is 14.8 kW, while Urban’s solar canopy is rated at 4.5% shading factor. This is a 16.3% reduction from previous rooftop solar systems whose shading factor is about 20.8% for a comparable rooftop system.
The solar canopy produced 754.1 kWh of output in its first week of operation, while its relative output without shading was about 17.5 kWh per kW, a 17.2% improvement from previous New York City rooftop solar systems, said Wilcox.
According to the company, there are several advantages to Urban Racking systems. They maximize solar potential with bifacial modules, building codes provide no obstruction or fire lane intrusion, and its systems are compatible with energy storage and heat pump systems.
With many urban buildings often having an internal courtyard or rear-facing gap, Urban Racking’s systems are deployed with overlapping support beams that double the amount of modules installed, allowing for 30% more energy production and three times the project value for the building owner when deployed with batteries or heat pumps.
Urban Racking is designing and manufacturing the main structure of its canopy system in-house.  The company could procure hardware from a solar tracker manufacturer for future generation systems or design its own tracker, said Wilcox.
Parent company Urban Energy is the first installer and partner of the solar canopy system, while the company will add new installation partners once its third-generation canopy is in production in about a year.
Urban Racking’s second generation canopy system will be installed in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City by the end of 2022. The company plans to deploy its third canopy system in the Bronx during Q3 23, at which point, Wilcox said, the company anticipates closing a $1.5 million pre-seed stage venture funding for Urban Racking.
The company anticipates expanding outside of New York into other markets such as Chicago and the District of Columbia in early 2024, according to Wilcox.
Urban Racking sees a $5 billion marketplace for rooftop solar systems with more than 75,000 buildings in New York providing a 40,000 project funnel for the company in the next few years.  Currently the company has three projects in construction and another 51 projects in permitting stages with low to moderate income building owners.
In the racking market, the company competes with Brooklyn Solar Canopy, SunModo and Lumos.
DOE, NREL award recipient
Urban Energy was a finalist in the Department of Energy’s American Made Solar Prize competition in April 2021. To date the company received $150,000 in DOE and NREL funding, as well as $75,000 in DOE vouchers for partnerships and research laboratory opportunities to advance its solar canopy prototype.
Urban Racking was formed by Wilcox earlier this year and hired Mark Preston and Matt Binder as chief executive officer and business development director. Preston is former vice president of engineering for Array Technologies and FTC Solar, while Binder previously held business development roles at Array, Clear Skies Solar and RP Construction Services.
Urban Energy was founded in July 2017 by Russell Wilcox, a NABCEP engineer, and Ilona Wilcox, chief operating officer, with the goal of expanding solar access to low-and-moderate-income multifamily building owners and tenants.

The company is now joining a wide field of competitors as it sets its sights on hydrogen electrolyzers.
Looking at the confluence of technological breakthroughs and rapidly growing investments in hydrogen, one cannot help but wonder if the price of the world’s lightest energy storage medium might soon collapse, much like the price of solar cells. BloombergNEF’s hydrogen market outlook recently published a chart showing what looks to be the beginning of a dramatic S-curve. Remember – everyone underestimates the rate of change.

Source: BloombergNEF
Longi expects to have 85 GW of solar module assembly capacity built by the end of the year.  pv magazine USA briefly conversed with Longi at RE+, where we asked the company about their green hydrogen plans.
The company has launched three electrolyzer models.  At the company’s booth it was suggested that the 5 MW alkaline water electrolytic bath – the LHy-A1000 – was the most efficient of the three models. The unit generates approximately 90 kg of hydrogen per hour.

Longi stated that it hopes to expand its Wuxi manufacturing facility to 1.5 GW by the end of 2022, and to produce 5 GW to 10 GW of electrolyzers by 2025. These targets imply a growth of multiple gigawatts per year.
The company began thinking hard about hydrogen in 2018, as wind and solar prices plummeted, and renewables expanded massively across China. Since electricity comprises 60% of the cost of producing hydrogen, excess solar was thought to be the perfect partner.
Meanwhile demand for net zero industrial processes has been looming. Longi cited some of the key industries: cement, fertilizer, and oil refinement.
At its booth, pv magazine USA pried for pricing data for Longi’s electrolyzers, asking whether they were below $1,000/kW. The company replied that their products cost less than $500 per kW. Bloomberg NEF recently reported that alkaline electrolyzers produced by an unnamed Chinese manufacturer were less than one-third the price of those manufactured in the United States, at only $343/kW.
Because Longi is the largest producer of electrolyzers, it is likely to be the manufacturer of the $343 electrolyzer. However, since six companies are already producing more than 1 GW of capacity each year (per the chart, below), we’re not sure who is leading these cost reductions.

Bloomberg NEF’s analysis also predicts that we should expect an additional 30% reduction in costs due to scaling by 2025, though some of those gains will be offset by increases to the price of labor and commodities.
This scaling process is still in its early stages, so it is still very likely that the 20% price decrease, (associated with each doubling of capacity), should greatly outpace the relatively small increases to labor pricing that can be expected. External forces are playing a strong role in these developments, too. The Inflation Reduction Act in the USA pays $3/kg for green hydrogen. And as other forces cause energy pains, like the war in Ukraine, it appears likely that manufacturers will find new markets for these components.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/17/california-climate-policy-to-kill-fossil-fuels-shining-a-spotlight-on-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022","California climate policy to kill fossil fuels, shining a spotlight on solar","The California Air Resources Board (CARB), a state agency vested with the power to regulate air pollution released its Scoping Plan, setting the marching orders for the state’s path to net-zero emissions. It is among the most aggressive climate plans in the world, making drastic changes to a state that would represent the fourth-largest economy in the world if it were a sovereign nation. 
By 2045, the plan’s benefits include cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 85% below 1990 levels, a 71% reduction in smog-forming air pollution, the reduction of fossil fuel consumption (liquid petroleum) to less than one-tenth of what is used today a 94% reduction in demand. The 2045 plan is expected to create 4 million new jobs and save Californians an estimated $200 billion in health costs due to pollution.
“This plan clearly and unequivocally presents challenging and ambitious goals, but we simply have no other choice but to meet them – and do it in less than a quarter century,” said  Liane Randolph, CARB chair. “We all have experienced firsthand the impacts of climate change, whether wildfires, drought, record-breaking heat waves and more. Failure is not an option.” 
The new plan includes a 48% reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030, surpassing the statutory mandate to reduce emissions 40% below 1990 levels in 2030. The plan also calls for no new fossil gas capacity in the electricity sector; reducing the electricity sector’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30 million metric tons by 2030. It targets at least 20 GW offshore wind capacity built by 2045; 3 million climate-friendly homes by 2030 and 7 million by 2035; and 6 million heat pumps deployed by 2030. To achieve a carbon neutral goal by 2045, the plan expands reliance on carbon capture, which many environmental groups criticize as expensive, unproven technology that risks extending the life of fossil fuel plants.
The scoping report relies on Senate Bill 100, which revised California’s Renewable Portfolio Standard ensure that by 2030 at least 60 percent of California’s electricity is renewable. Deployment rates will need to be raised considerably to reach this target. 
Energy efficiency moderates some of the need for additional electricity generation. However, that mitigation is quickly surpassed by growing electricity demand of 26% by 2030 and 76% by 2045. CARB said the estimated resource build needed to meet this level of demand amounts to approximately 72 GW of utility-scale solar and 37 GW of battery storage by 2045. Annual build rates (over the 2022–2035 period) for the Scoping Plan Scenario will need to increase by about 60% and over 700% for utility solar and battery storage, respectively, compared to historic maximum rates.
The plan also places emphasis on distributed energy to mitigate the challenges of climate-related disasters. “Heat, drought, and wildfires can both reduce electricity supply from reductions in hydropower generation and impacts on generation and transmission performance, and increase demand, especially in the evening hours when solar generation is declining,” said the report.
As a result, distributed solar energy paired with storage is recommended by CARB. California has been placing a lot of focus on energy storage, with 3.5 GW of lithium-ion batteries added to the grid since 2020.
CARB said it is in support of an emphasis on rooftop solar and distributed technologies like microgrids. However, while CARB can regulate emissions, it is not able to direct the regulatory and incentive structure for non-emitting energy sources. This lies under the purview of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which has demonstrated an affinity for centralized power built by investor-owned utilities. 
“At a time when California is facing severe wildfires, droughts and other extreme weather-related disasters, our state’s leadership on addressing climate change – as we’re poised to become the world’s fourth largest economy – is important now more than ever. CARB’s new plan for global warming pollution reduction takes critical steps to accelerate the path to 100% clean energy that will ensure a healthier, safer and cleaner future here in the Golden State and beyond,” said Laura Deehan, Environment California state director.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/17/solar-company-protects-215000-acres-of-mojave-desert/,"MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022","Solar company protects 215,000 acres of Mojave Desert","Avantus, formerly 8minute Energy, partnered with wildlife services to protect desert lands by retiring grazing rights on more than 215,000 acres.
The company is partnering with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for the Onyx Conservation project. Onyx will conserve and permanently dedicate the area in Kern County to wildlife forage.
As one of the largest mitigation projects in the nation, Onyx will permanently protect a swath of Mojave Desert seven times larger than San Francisco. This will protect and enhance desert wildlife and plants, including the western Joshua Tree.
The solar developer launched the Onyx project as a mitigation effort, which is a way that solar developers make amends for the land it has used for development of large-scale clean energy projects. This land use issue seeks to find a balance between clean energy development and conservation.
Avantus, which changed its name from 8Minute Energy last month, has in the past 10 years executed over two dozen energy offtake agreements, including multiple projects with the largest utilities in California and Nevada. Its portfolio includes the largest solar cluster in the United States.
One of the company’s most notable projects is the Rexford 1 Solar & Storage Center in Tulare County, California. Among the largest solar-plus-storage installations in the country, the project features 400 MW of solar and 180 MW/540 MWh of energy storage.
Avantus continues to spread its clean energy infrastructure. Its development pipeline exceeds 50 GW, effectively doubled over the last two years. With 42 GW of solar and 78 GWh of energy storage, the pipeline spans more than 90 utility-scale projects throughout California, Texas and the Southwestern United States, and represents over $70 billion in investments.
The Onyx project is the first time grazing rights have been retired to mitigate for solar projects. A contiguous area seven times larger than the city of San Francisco, Onyx will provide greater benefits for desert species to thrive than traditional mitigation strategies, which typically involve small, disconnected land parcels resembling a checkerboard. Avantus will also invest millions of additional dollars for habitat enhancements across Onyx to jumpstart restoration for desert plants and wildlife species.
“Our Department is committed to the conservation, protection and restoration of the Golden State’s habitat, and this groundbreaking state and federal public-private partnership provides a roadmap for how renewable energy can continue to combat climate change while also providing landscape-level ecosystem benefits to native plants and wildlife,” said Julie Vance, regional manager of CDFW. “By purchasing and permanently retiring the grazing rights, Avantus is assuring this rich, vibrant land is preserved and its inhabitants can flourish.”
Located between Ridgecrest and Mojave in Kern County, the habitat in the protected area includes the California condor, Mojave Desert tortoise, American badger, Mohave ground squirrel and golden eagles. It is also estimated to include more than 80,000 acres of western Joshua tree habitat, including 3,000 acres of dense woodland. All 215,000 acres will also be open for public recreational use, including hiking and camping.
Onyx is an example of a public-private partnership that aims to conserve land while delivering on President Biden’s America the Beautiful campaign, which established a national goal to conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and freshwater by 2030.
“The single greatest threat facing desert ecosystems is climate change, and Avantus is proud to be driving climate solutions that are decarbonizing our planet at the gigaton-level. Our portfolio of utility-scale solar and energy storage centers will deliver affordable, emissions-free energy to tens of millions of Americans, which allows us to embark on innovative mitigation strategies of the same magnitude,” said Dr. Tom Buttgenbach, founder and CEO of Avantus. “In line with our ambitions to be a clean energy major, the Onyx Conservation Project will provide critical habitat preservation and environmental benefits at a scale our industry has never seen before. This is a prime example of our endless pursuit of smarter, more sustainable solutions and we thank our federal and state partners for working with us on this pioneering effort.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/17/proposed-hvdc-macrogrid-to-transmit-low-cost-renewable-power/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022",Proposed HVDC macrogrid to transmit low-cost renewable power,"Modeling firm Vibrant Clean Energy (VCE) has proposed a transmission “overlay” for the contiguous U.S., with about 210 underground high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines, 70 nodes, and underwater lines along nearly the entire coastline, as shown in the image above.
HVDC transmission can deliver power over long distances more efficiently than alternating current (AC) transmission.
“This is the system built in our zero2050usa study,” said Christopher Clack, VCE’s founder and CEO, on LinkedIn, adding that a report describing the study will “come soon.” The study modeled a net-zero emissions economy for the contiguous U.S., including an HVDC “macrogrid” built by 2025.
In the least-cost scenario, installed solar capacity would exceed 830 GW by 2050, as shown in red in the nearby chart, while wind capacity would exceed 1130 GW, with onshore wind predominating as shown in green. VCE modeled ten scenarios using the firm’s WIS:dom-P model.

Previous solar and wind capacity projections from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s “Interconnection Seams Study” showed that HVDC could economically transmit solar power from sunnier regions to less sunny regions, but that adding HVDC transmission would not result in more solar overall. Rather, it could lead to more solar development in sunnier regions but less solar development in other regions, leaving the total approximately unchanged.
VCE’s modeled transmission system would cost $400 billion if financed over 30 years at a 3% interest rate. That translates to a cost of $7.5 per MWh, which would enable reduced electricity costs of $25/MWh. It would save 4.5 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. At an 8% interest rate, it would cost $700 billion. Costs were based on cost numbers from “Tier 1” vendors and construction companies likely to do the work, with some “padding” since the numbers “might be a little optimistic,” Clack said.
DOE research, HVDC in Midwest
DOE is conducting a National Transmission Needs Study, and will release the draft 2023 study by year-end for comment and feedback. To date, the consultation draft has been presented to Native American tribes.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has identified transmission along highways and other rights of way as a research and development opportunity.
The proposed SOO Green HVDC Link transmission project, to transmit wind power from Iowa eastward, has been gaining investors and partners for a 349-mile, 2.1 GW transmission line, largely along railroad rights-of-way and entirely underground.

Construction at the yet undisclosed location is to begin in the first half of 2023, with production anticipated by late 2024.  The facility is expected to create up to 1,500 new full-time jobs and supports the domestic solar PV supply chain.
“Recent policy tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act have served as a catalyst for our solar manufacturing ambitions in the US, ushering in a new era of made-in-America energy,” said Enrico Viale, head of Enel North America.
The proposed facility will be Enel’s second global PV manufacturing facility. The company previously announced the expansion of its 3Sun gigafactory in Catania, Sicily, increasing production capacity from 200 MW to 3 GW.
For the U.S. facility Enel intends to produce the same type of modules as its Sicily plant is producing, the bifacial heterojunction (B-HJT) PV cells, which capture more sunlight as the cells can respond to light on both front and rear surfaces.
3Sun’s B-HJT PV cells have already produced at high-efficiency levels. In February 2020 Enel announced that the cells carried a 24.63% efficiency, setting a record established by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin, Germany.
Currently fewer than five large-scale solar gigafactories (over 1 GW) are operating in the U.S., while annual PV installations are projected to grow from 16 GW to 41 GW in 2025, according to Wood Mackenzie.

The new factory was announced in August, however, the exact location had not yet been determined. The recently announced Alabama factory is part of the company’s plan to scale its U.S. manufacturing footprint to over 10 GWDC by 2025. The new factory represents an investment of approximately $1.1 billion and is expected to be commissioned by 2025, with a planned annual capacity of 3.5 GWDC.
“First Solar is a world-class manufacturer, and its solar modules are poised to play an increasingly important role in US energy self-sufficiency,” said Kay Ivey, Governor of Alabama. “I’m thrilled to see the company’s growth project headed to Lawrence County because I know it will create good jobs and have a major economic impact on this rural region.”
First Solar, founded in 1999, has had a manufacturing presence in Ohio since 2002 when it produced 1.5 MW of modules and employed 150 people. In 2019 First Solar commissioned a second U.S. factory, and just recently it announced that a third factory is under construction. Representing an investment of $680 million, it will bring First Solar’s Ohio manufacturing capacity to 6 GW.  In October of this year, First Solar also announced that it plans to invest approximately $270 million in a dedicated R&D innovation center in Perrysburg, Ohio. The new facility is believed to be the first of its scale in the United States and is expected to accelerate American leadership in the development and production of advanced thin film photovoltaics.
U.S. supply chain
First Solar specializes in cadmium tellurium (CdTe) thin-film PV technology, which is primarily used in utility-scale installations. With the signing of an executive order by President Biden to boost America’s clean energy economy, coupled with the goal of attaining 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, there is a push for increasing U.S. manufacturing across the solar supply chain. First Solar intends to scale its U.S. manufacturing base in support of the effort to decarbonize the American economy and achieve self-sufficiency in reliable and competitive renewable energy technologies.
“The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has firmly placed America on the path to a sustainable energy future,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “This facility, along with its sister factories in Ohio, will form part of the industrial foundation that helps ensure this transition is powered by American innovation and ingenuity.”
First Solar estimates that its new investments in Alabama and Ohio of about $1.3 billion, will bring the company’s total investment in American manufacturing to over $4 billion. The Alabama facility will add over 700 new direct manufacturing jobs and over 100 new R&D jobs, taking its total number of direct jobs in the U.S. to over 3,000 people in four states by 2025, which is believed to make it the largest employer in the American solar manufacturing sector. By 2025, First Solar says it expects to support an estimated 15,000 indirect and induced jobs as a result of its ongoing and future manufacturing operations.
“Our team, from the State down to the local level, has worked extremely hard to make this project a reality,” said Tabitha Pace, president and chief executive officer of the Lawrence County Industrial Development Board. “First Solar will have a tremendous impact on our economy and region. We look forward to building those relationships for a successful future.”
In addition to its U.S. manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building its first new manufacturing facility in India, which is scheduled to begin operations in the second half of 2023.
