The deal represents one of the largest income-qualified portfolios in the United States, and will provide access to affordable, clean energy to thousands of households throughout the state. In order to find customers to fill the portfolio’s capacity, Pivot shares that it will be partnering with local community organization, and will be using SunCentral’s software platform to manage active subscribers.
The two companies have not yet shard how many individual installations will make up the 41 MW portfolio, nor where those projects will be located.
“Pivot Energy is thrilled to deploy this portfolio, which will deliver profound benefits — both environmental and economic — to thousands of income-qualified households,” said Tom Hunt, CEO of Pivot Energy. “As the renewable energy industry strives to advance both energy equity and the clean energy transition, I hope to see other states and utilities emulate the leadership and constructive collaboration of Xcel Energy and the state of Colorado to facilitate more equitable access to clean energy.”
Community solar is recognized as an effective method for expanding access to clean energy and utility bill savings to low- and middle-income (LMI) electrical customers, helping to bridge the means gap that has plagued the solar industry, since ownership and leases are often financially out of the question for LMI individuals and families. These same households have historically been left out of the clean energy transition and that face many of the most adverse climate impacts.
According to Energy Outreach Colorado, one-in-four Colorado households struggle with a high energy burden, which leads to such households spending a disproportionate amount of their income on energy bills, when compared to higher-income households, with the average burden being three times worse. Households that meet or are below the 80% area median income threshold can see energy bills take up to 20% of their monthly income.
The income-verification aspect of the projects included in this portfolio is a bit of a tricky subject. Vote Solar’s Access & Equity Advisory Committee, which includes energy leaders from Vote Solar and a rotating list of partner organizations, including nonprofit solar installer GRID Alternatives, the NAACP, and Nexamp, has publicly shared its view that that one of the biggest barriers to implementing LMI community solar programs is a cumbersome, lengthy, and often humiliating income-verification process in which both the state and the solar vendor are involved. The committee said streamlining this process is critical to enrolling more families in community solar programs.
The group has instead proposed automatic qualification in community solar programs as a solution. Automatic qualification means that eligible LMI households would automatically be included in community solar programs through qualification for another government program, such as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.

The sale includes Borrego’s project pipeline, which contains 8.4 GW of solar and 6.4 GW / 25 GWh of energy storage.
ECP will own the development business as a new, separate entity. The current development team will remain in place, and the headquarters will be in Lowell, Mass. Dan Berwick, currently President of the development business, will become CEO.
“This sale ensures we can invest in our people and build the technology that will position them to capitalize on what will be a record-breaking decade for solar and storage deployment in the United States,” said Mike Hall, chief executive officer of Borrego. “I am thankful for the incredible development team that I’ve had the pleasure of working with for the last 12 years.
Borrego said it will continue to invest in both its EPC and O&M business units. The EPC unit is a national developer with more than 450 MW of solar projects and 200 MW of energy storage projects currently in design or construction. The O&M unit currently manages the performance of 1.4 GW and over 1,000 solar operating assets, the majority of which were built by other EPCs.
The acquisition expands ECP’s already significant investment in the energy transition. “We’re excited to join forces with Borrego’s development business to create ECP’s eleventh renewable platform and fourth standalone solar platform,” said Andrew Gilbert, partner at ECP.
ECP was founded in 2005 and has performed more than 60 transactions over the last decade, representing more than $45 billion of enterprise value.

The 300 MW Goliad County project will join CPS FlexPOWER Bundle, which set a goal of procuring 900 MW of sustainable energy for the municipal electric provider.
The initiative aims to diversify CPS Energy’s power generation mix, adding up to 900 MW of solar, up to 50 MW of energy storage. The bundle is part of the utility’s wider plan to replace older generation with newer and cleaner technologies.
Since the initiative was launched in 2020, a request for proposals resulted in over 650 bids from 100 companies across the US and ten other nations, including Japan, England and South Korea. CPS Energy said it expects to award all contracts within the next few months with the next solar selections expected in the coming weeks.
The 300 MW project is expected to commence construction next year, creating an expected 250-300 jobs. Con Edison Development will contribute $500,000 over a 10-year period to support one of CPS Energy’s community priorities of supporting customers and education. It will also hire up to eight positions from Greater San Antonio and maintain $750,000 in annual spending with local suppliers and vendors through the life of the 25-year agreement. The project will lead to $19 million in local investment, said CPS.
Frontier Group and the Environment America Research & Policy Center ranked San Antonio, CPS’ primary market, as #6 ranked in their Solar Superstar Cities report. CPS said this project is expected to solidify the city as a top 5 solar city in the nation. Read the full list of high-achieving solar cities here.
“The way we generate power determines our ability to ensure a sustainable environment. San Antonio is making great advances toward carbon neutrality and CPS Energy’s continued leadership in renewable energy is making our progress possible,” said San Antonio mayor Ron Nirenberg.
“Our customers have shared their desire for an affordable but more sustainable energy system,” said Rudy Garza, CEO of CPS Energy. “The FlexPOWER bundle is our response to say that we hear you, that we want the same and are making great strides in that direction.”
CPS Energy’s portfolio includes 1,049 MW of wind, 552 MW of solar and 10 MW of battery storage resources. This new project, dubbed Peregrine solar, will add 300 MW to the total.

By 2030 we may be deploying 1 TW a year – generating $5 billion in new opportunities a year for O&M practitioners.
With that in mind, it was no surprise that there was a double digit number of groups showing off their panel cleaning robots.

The hyCLEANER solarROBOT in the featured image above has recently launched in the United States. The representative in the booth told me they have a salesperson, Carla Dawson, showing off their units up and down the coast of California on existing solar power projects.
Another panel cleaning company, SolarCleano, shows off their wearable remote control unit (below). This design helps workers operate their robots from a safe location, so they can keep their eyes on the robot as it moves.

The company also pointed out that they sell a transport unit, the T1, which helps move these robots from one rack of modules to another.
There were at least half a dozen additional robotic panel cleaners, in addition to more traditional vehicle based cleaning arms.
A solar install company that was visiting one of these robotic groups was discussing how the O&M portion of their business has grown, and are now providing a most stable revenue for their companies.
Across from the six Intersolar halls were two halls for ees Europe – housing mostly lithium ion batteries, as well as flow batteries and hydrogen technology.

Voltstorage was exhibiting their flow batteries. The representative told me that vanadium redox flow batteries were first invented by NASA in the 1970s. The company offers this product for commercial customers. They also offer an iron salt flow battery for more cost-competitive, larger and longer duration settings.
Green hydrogen was a hot topic, with some presenters suggesting an inevitable freight train of industry expansion coming. Geopolitical concerns have been driving the market more than anyone in the industry expected, as government investments promise to be massive, and sustained.

There were a few hydrogen units, including the modular fuel cell from Proton Motors of Germany (above). Their 3-foot wide, 2-foot deep, and more than 5-foot tall “PR Frame” can build up fuel cell systems with outputs ranging from 3.1 through 42.6 kW output.
And of course, many vendors were displaying elegantly wired lithium ion batteries. Lithium ion products did in fact dominate the two rooms that were focused on energy storage.
Fenecon showed off their Commercial 30 unit that holds a range of 30 to 90 kWh per stack. To be honest, it was the color, and the striking simplicity of the wiring which caught this author’s eye.

The night ended with an invitation to an event hosted by Baywa RE in downtown Munich. Spirits were high as discussions focused on challenges of product availability, and various deliveries promised by distributors.
If we were to invest in spirit alone, then Europe appears to be a good bet for significant growth in volume deployed in 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/25/trackers-vs-the-elements-part-one-tackling-uneven-terrain/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,INTERVIEW,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 25, 2022","Trackers vs. the elements, part one: tackling uneven terrain","Since their introduction into the utility-scale solar market, the name of the game with single-axis trackers has always been about increasing yield and optimizing generation for project owners and PPA off-takers. In the years that have followed, a whole host of solutions have driven up the savings presented by the technology exponentially, with gains up to 35% more than conventional systems, when paired with other breakthrough technologies, like bifacial panels.
Even with all the accomplishments that have been made, you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the space who believes that we’ve reached or are nearing the theoretical limit to gains made possible by tracker technologies. Chief among the variables keeping us from realizing this theoretical limit are obstacles that have been around since trackers’ introduction and are only growing more common as the geographic footprint of solar projects expands: high wind, uneven terrain, and interruptions in optimal production, be they expected or unexpected.
Moreover, these phenomenon are not singular in the obstacles they present. For example, high wind can mean sustained gusts over the course of hours – known as static wind loads – or short bursts of incredibly high-speed wind – known as  dynamic wind loads. Both can be part of development considerations for a project being installed on uneven ground in wind-prone West Texas.
Since the advent and subsequent adoption of large-format modules, which exacerbate each of these issues via their large surface area and high power output ratings, tracker manufacturers have developed a host of solutions to attack one or more of these issues, each in their own way.
Going with the flow
In March, Nextracker unveiled its NX Horizon-XTR, a terrain-following, single-axis tracker built specifically for projects located on sites with sloped, uneven, and challenging terrain. The product has been seen as a complete overhaul of traditional tracker design. Historically, all trackers in a row have been set to a standard plane, with the piers supporting the tracker and module units being installed at different lengths and depths to achieve that plane while maintaining structural and operational stability.

The NX Horizon-XTR also utilizes adaptive tracking, which allows each tracker row in an installation to operate independently from all of the other rows. Before adaptive tracking, tracker controls were largely on the project-level, meaning that if the angle for one row was adjusted, the angles of all modules across the project were adjusted. This approach would leave a great bit of generation on the table in an installation on uneven terrain, where the optimal angle at any given time can differ greatly between two adjacent modules.
“[Adaptive tracking] allowed a whole range of benefits: we could self power the tracker with a little solar panel, instead of hooking up to the grid, and each row could be independent, meaning you could drive through the system for vegetation management, cleaning, maintenance on solar panels, or during construction,” shared Nextracker CEO and co-founder, Dan Shugar “So if you’re on an if you’re on a hilly site, in the morning and sun’s on the east side, all of your trackers can all be at the ideal angle.”
Another leader in the tracking space, Terrasmart, has taken a different approach to tackling uneven terrain, first taking a close look at the terrain adaptations that make each site unique, before shifting focus to the tracker foundations.
“What we are doing is taking a technology or platform agnostic approach,” explained Dean Vukovic, the General Manager of Terrasmart’s ground mount division.” As sites have become a little bit tougher to build on, there might be some preconceived notions about science, geography, wind, snow, or other governing factors there. What we try and do is work with asset owners, developers and EPCs to put forward a neutral approach. If we don’t have a technology base, as this predetermining factor, we can have a full suite of options available at our disposal, and really figure out what the best solution is. It might require a tracker with a certain type of foundation, it might have a certain configuration on a fixed-tilt, or there may be some different engineering calculations we can apply.”
According to Vukovic, rather than develop a catch-all solution, Terrasmart deemed it more valuable to ask their partners what their specific needs are in tackling terrain on a project-by-project basis, ultimately leaning on existing solutions and the company’s extensive project modeling and output software to create the ideal, yet unique to that project, solution.
“What we try and do is have an engineer to order approach,” said Vukovic. “There was an interesting example, out in Hawaii not too long ago, where a developer couldn’t get a tracker system to pencil out. Working with them and using some of the custom software that we’ve developed to do some pretty rapid modeling, we ultimately figured out that it wasn’t a tracker that was the best thing for them at all. It was a certain configuration of fixed tilt, with a certain foundation type, and that ended up meeting all the key and core metrics for the project.”
Image: TerraSmart
In January, Terrasmart’s Mike Faraone and Chris Lantz outlined how choosing the right ground-mount foundation, i.e. ground screws vs. pile foundations, is key to optimizing a project’s cost and risk profile.
According to the two, ground screws present higher up-front material and construction costs but eliminate 100% of the refusal risk. In the context of project development, a refusal refers to when a pile doesn’t advance 12 inches over 30 seconds or takes more than five minutes to install.
Ground screws can also minimize land grading and slash other civil expenses which, when paired with adaptable racking designed for flexible land use, can deliver reliable returns from unreliable sites.
On the flip side, pile foundations are the standard option for cost-effective PV. From a material and construction standpoint, they can be deployed quickly and reliably — on typical sites. In rugged or sloped terrain or in unpredictable conditions, however, pile foundations can leave your project high and dry, presenting costly and schedule-derailing refusals.
In short, both solutions can pencil and have their own advantages, but without an intricate knowledge f the project site, one can’t be certain which solution will be the best to pursue.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/25/50-states-of-solar-incentives-pennsylvania/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,PENNSYLVANIA",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 25, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania is the top exporter of electricity in the country, mostly generated by natural gas, as the commonwealth is second to Texas in its natural gas reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Coal and nuclear power also factor into the mix, with Pennsylvania being second to Illinois in nuclear power generating capacity. Wind, hydropower, and biomass contribute to its renewable energy generation, with solar accounting for less than .5% of production.
Solar in Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania currently ranks 23rd in the country for solar installations, which is not very impressive as it ranks fifth in the country by population.

The commonwealth is currently receiving .41% of its electricity from solar; however, the growth projection of 1,904 MW over the next five years forecasts that Pennsylvania could achieve a ranking of 18th in the country for solar power generation. How will it get there? Scott Elias, director of state affairs, mid-Atlantic for the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said that increasing the carve out under the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (APS) standard will send a demand signal. The requirement set back in 2004 was .5%, which has been exceeded, and SEIA is hoping to push it to 2% or 2.5% by 2030. “We want to make sure that Pennsylvania is not less valuable for development than neighboring states,” said Elias.
Net metering
One positive note is that Pennsylvania has no cap on net metering. In 2007, the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PUC) expanded the net-metering rules, which approved the use of third-party ownership models. Furthermore, utilities must provide the same rates to net-metered customers as non-net metered, and they may not charge any fees that do not apply to other customers. Net-metered customers are credited for excess generation at the full kilowatt-hour rate, which includes generation, transmission and distribution changes. Meter aggregation is allowed on properties owned or leased by the customer, which can benefit commercial entities that may have multiple buildings with separate meters that fall under the same account. Virtual net meter aggregation is also allowed.
SRECs
The value of SRECs are a serious challenge to Pennsylvania’s solar market According to Elias, regardless of what type of project you have, you get the same SREC, so utility scale solar and distributed generation solar gets the same REC value. The concern is that if you don’t increase the solar goal from a half-percent, that market will be indefinitely oversupplied, which will shrink the value of the SREC. This scenario will change the economics of projects and hurt utility-scale investment in the commonwealth.
Pennsylvania does not have community solar regulation, nor does it have a specific program for low-income solar. As in all states, the federal investment tax credit of 26% is available for those who qualify.
Landmark projects
A solar installation currently under construction at the University of Pennsylvania will be the largest in the state to date. The University signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) in 2020 with Community Energy (acquired in December 2021 by AES). for a 220 MW solar project that will reduce the university’s carbon emissions by 45% from a 2009 baseline, bringing it closer to its goal of a 100% carbon neutral campus by 2042. The power purchased from the site will provide about 75% of the total electricity demand of the campus and the University’s Health System. The project broke ground in the fall of 2021 and is expected to begin delivery of electricity in 2023.
Another large solar project in Pennsylvania (shown in photo) was completed for the Pennsylvania State University in 2020. Located on approximately 500 acres of land, the 70 MWdc project, installed by Lightsource bp, provides 25% of the university electricity requirements. The installation moves the school further along the path toward its goal of reducing greenhouse emissions by 35% by 2020. The project was financed, built maintained and operated by Lightsouce bp, and power will be purchased by Penn State under a 25-year PPA. The project is a living laboratory for Penn State students who, through internships, gain real-world experience.
Clearing the hurdles
One area of growth expected in Pennsylvania may be community solar and utility scale development, although challenges to this growth—as well as growth in other states–is the pending Auxin trade case. Elias said he sees that as the number one near-term risk to the solar industry, and the result is that some utility scale projects are not being completed. In Pennsylvania specifically, the largest threat is the looming SREC price decrease, which may have material impact on deployment. In a state that is the biggest exporters of electricity, there is great opportunity for solar to play a greater role once the hurdles are overcome.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/25/what-are-upfront-and-lifetime-costs-of-heat-pumps/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,MASSACHUSETTS,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 25, 2022",What are upfront and lifetime costs of heat pumps?,"In the quest to electrify everything, it appears that heat pumps are the answer for many homeowners, according to a recent survey conducted by Carbon Switch, a producer of research and guides on how to live more sustainably. Carbon Switch surveyed 125 homeowners in the United States and Canada, reviewed previous research, spoke with installers, and analyzed data from states including Massachusetts and California.
The bottom line is that the average cost of a heat pump is $14,000 after rebates. But there’s a huge difference in  costs depending on rebates available, size of the home, location, whether the home needs ducts, and more.
As far as rebates go, some of the homeowners surveyed got zero in rebates, while others got as much as $14,000. The average rebate was found to be about $1,500. Not surprisingly, New York and Massachusetts have some of the most generous rebates, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. Rebates can vary (and not be obvious). For example, Central Hudson (upstate New York) customers can receive $1,000 per 10,000 BTUs if they replace a fossil fuel heating source, so at least $3,000 for a typical 3-ton system. The DSIRE database is a good place to start.
The survey found that home size directly correlates to the cost of heat pump installation. According to the survey, heat pumps for a 1,500 to 2,000 square foot home was $16,933. And a home of over 2,000 square feet averaged $19,117. For mini-splits, the number of zones in a home was another cost factor, ranging from $7,100 for 1 zone up to $26,573 for five zones. The bottom line on the size of home/cost correlation is that more than half of the homeowners surveyed paid between $4 to 10 per square foot, with the most common installation costing between $4 to 6 per square foot.

Location is a factor as the market for heat pumps is more mature in the South, and costs tend to be lower. Also the homes in the South are generally already wired for electric heat, which saves some retrofitting costs. The Northeast and West are more dependent on fossil fuels and have not yet embraced heat pumps, so costs are higher. The survey found that across the South, costs averaged $7.33 per square foot. In the Midwest, the average was $7.44 per square foot. In the Northeast and West, costs were over $8 per square foot.

The survey also found that costs are far lower when heat pumps are installed in new construction compared to existing home. In new construction the average was $7,384 after rebates and $6.54 per square foot. In an existing home, the average heat pump installed was $15,113 after rebates and $8.15 per square foot. Why? Because the electrical service can be designed for a fully electric home, and ducts and mini-split lines can be run before the walls are enclosed.
Other factors to consider include what type of heating system is being replaced. Some states offer rebates priced per heating ton when switching from fossil fuels. New York, for example is offering $2,500 per heating ton in rebates if a homeowner switches from gas, propane or fuel oil. Another factor is whether the home already has functional ductwork—if not the installation involves major renovation, and thus higher costs. And a final consideration is the electrical panel. Upgrading the panel to accommodate new equipment also boosts costs.

Kevin Purdy, author of the survey summary“Are heat pumps worth it?”, noted that upfront costs are only a fraction of the energy picture. ”Heat pumps can save the average US homeowner $10,000 throughout the unit’s lifetime. They replace both a furnace and an air conditioner, and they’re usually more comfortable and efficient than either of them. They free your budget from fluctuating fuel costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

Renewables Forward, a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative of leading U.S. clean energy companies and partners, today announced the appointment of its first executive director, Chris Nichols, an industry veteran who has championed access to clean affordable energy for all in both public and private sectors throughout her career. This key organizational milestone demonstrates a deepening commitment from the RF Board of Directors who are driven to “get stuff done” now, while setting the clean energy industry on a growth path toward a more equitable clean energy future.
Nichols is uniquely qualified for this position. From her work at Groundswell to the Department of Energy and SunEdison, she has spearheaded energy workforce development and credentialing programs, youth workforce development in green jobs (YouthBuild), forged public-private partnerships and delivered solar and energy efficiency programs designed for low-income communities. One of her most prized accomplishments is having founded the Solar Ready Vets program, a well-known industry program creating career pathways for military veterans.
In her first 120 days, Nichols aims to execute on existing strong program commitments while building new ways for RF to help drive diversity and inclusion within the member companies, industry partners and the industry. Her immediate focus will be to collaborate with other RF partner organizations to benchmark current progress and set specific, measurable goals for DEI progress. In parallel, Nichols will work across the industry to launch a new Renewables Forward business-to-business mentorship program and develop a community investment and impact strategy in partnership with social and environmental equity organizations across the US.
Global law firm K&L Gates LLP has added a team of four high-profile partners with substantial experience in the renewable energy sector, continuing a path of strategic growth that has included the addition of more than 120 new partners and of counsel since the start of 2020 and the opening of new offices in Nashville and Luxembourg in 2021. Joining K&L Gates in Kansas City are partners John Crossley, Jim Goettsch, and Brogan Sullivan, with colleague Maria Faconti arriving as a partner in Austin. The newly created Kansas City office is K&L Gates’ 47th worldwide and 25th in the United States.
John Crossley advises traditional and renewable energy companies on the acquisition, development, construction, operation, and financing of projects and assets. He has assisted clients on billions of dollars worth of renewable energy projects totaling more than 30 gigawatts of power in 35 states, and also regularly represents lenders and tax equity investors in real estate, permitting, and other state and local matters across the U.S.
An experienced transactional lawyer, Jim Goettsch counsels clients in the energy sector on mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, project finance, and complex commercial matters. This includes having represented multiple national renewable energy owners on the acquisition and financing of wind and solar projects; assisting with joint ventures for the development and ownership of pipelines, terminals, and other infrastructure projects in the midstream oil and gas sectors; and advising on power, natural gas, and water utility acquisitions and dispositions.
Brogan Sullivan is an accomplished advisor to clients in acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, and other complex commercial arrangements, with a primary focus on transactions in the energy and manufacturing industries. He has assisted clients in numerous regulated utility and power plant purchase and sale transactions, as well as the acquisition, joint ownership, and tax equity financing of utility-scale wind and solar projects across the U.S.
Maria Faconti provides regulatory advice to energy and renewable development clients on transactional, compliance, and litigation matters. While focused primarily within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, her practice also encompasses a variety of regulatory matters pertaining to other states and electric markets. She ensures that clients have all required permits to operate lawfully and maintain regulatory compliance, including assisting with obtaining regulatory permits and drafting compliance-related provisions of interconnection, power purchase, retail, and shared facility agreements.
