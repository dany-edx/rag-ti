This marks the 4th largest quarter ever for solar development in the United States.
Sector-by-sector growth was strong. It was a near-record quarter for residential (974 MW), commercial solar was up 31% year over year (354 MW), and there was 177 MW of community solar developed. Perhaps most impressive, 4.2 GW of utility-scale solar was developed, and 9 GW of utility-scale solar was procured.
Despite these growth figures, presenters from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie who spoke at this year’s Solar Power International warned of bottlenecks and cost increases ahead. While the market is set to grow, it is “not all unicorns and rainbows,” said Xiaojing Sun, head of solar research at WoodMac.
Supply chain bottlenecks, raw material price increases, delays due to congestion at ports, and limited availability of shipping containers are all increasing costs, particularly at the utility-scale. Uncertainty and sanctions due to reports of forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China dampen the growth outlook, as well.
Increases in costs for polysilicon, glass, steel, aluminum, and copper affect the cost of nearly every component in solar, including modules, racking, inverters, and the full suite of balance-of-system components. WoodMac analyst Molly Cox said that it can take 3-9 months for end-users to see the impact of raw material cost increases in their price.
Cox said some manufacturers will opt to absorb the increased cost of raw materials, but others may pass it on to the end user. This has caused some power purchase agreement contracts having to be renegotiated, or price increases passed on to customers, said Cox.
Different sectors have been affected by raw material costs at different rates. While residential and commercial scale solar have seen about 1% project price increases year over year in-quarter, utility-scale has seen a 6% project price increase in the same span.
Cox said that about 60% of the cost stack of a utility-scale solar project is impacted by raw material cost increases. The figure is 40% for residential, and 45% of commercial. Freight costs have had a larger impact on utility-scale solar prices than other sectors, as well, said Cox.
Despite these challenges, utility scale solar increased 29% year over year in Q2. Texas led the way with over 17,490 MW installed, and Florida took second place at 515 MW.
Conspicuously, California was not among the top installers of utility-scale solar. Sun said the state is expected to have a strong total in 2021, and that the high rate of complex hybrid facilities with co-located energy storage may be a reason for delays. Roughly 39% of the upcoming 106 GW pipeline capacity is in Texas, Florida, and California.
Investor-owned utilities are a top procurer of utility-scale solar, and accounted for 48% capacity procured first half 2021. About 60% of utility-scale projects in development are procured by investor-owned utilities.
Corporate and retail procurement of these projects is on a sharp rise, and now 43% of first half 2021 projects were procured by corporate customers.
While raw materials affect utility-scale projects, Cox said soft costs have been the largest barrier for commercial projects. Varied labor requirements, and complex permitting and interconnection requirements are bogging down this sector.
There is strong customer interest on the commercial-scale, but interconnection issues have caused 3.5 GW of projects to get jammed in queues in Massachusetts, Maine, and New York. Often in these states, utilities conduct long studies to determine whether transmission infrastructure upgrades are needed. If upgrades are deemed necessary, the cost can be pushed to the solar developer, which often leads to project cancellations and even market exits, said WoodMac analyst Rachel Goldstein.

Community solar is faced by similar issues to commercial scale, and also faces challenges in siting, zoning, and changing incentive schemes. Overall, community solar is having a flagship year, and is expected to peak in 2022. Largely, community solar is driven by incentive program, like those seen in New York and Massachusetts, said Goldstein.
Residential solar is on pace for a record year. Installations are up 46% year over year from the pandemic-impacted Q2 2020. Still, Goldstein said that the growth is an indication of the sector’s ability to adapt, as many installers moved to online and remote customer-interface strategies.
The main bottlenecks facing this sector are labor supply issues and slow and costly permitting times. One tool that may help alleviate the latter is the SolarAPP+, a Department of Energy and National Renewable Energy Laboratory collaboration that delivers instant, automated residential solar permit approvals. In a push by Secretary of Energy Granholm, the SolarAPP+ has been implemented in over 120 jurisdictions, and it continues its reach.
Some states are growing in residential solar rapidly, and some are experiencing  problems. Goldstein said that Georgia, for example, implemented a limited net metering program that hit its capacity cap sooner than expected. Now, the market has become uncertain, leading several installers to withdraw.
Conversely, Florida has moved from an emerging market to a major residential solar market. A 2018 regulatory decision to allow solar leasing caused national installers to enter the market, driving competition and lowering prices.

The data contained in the report, which is current through June 30, reveals that renewable sources accounted for 12.91% of the U.S. energy produced and 12.71% of the energy consumed for electricity, transportation, heating, and other uses.
This growth has been driven in large part by solar and wind, as hydropower, geothermal, and biomass all experienced year-over-year declines in production. Wind, solar, and biofuels saw their shares of production grow 10%, 24%, and 1.8%, respectively.
With this new growth accounted for, wind is now the largest single renewable energy source, accounting for 27.78% of total U.S. renewable energy output, followed by biomass at 21.28%, hydropower at 19.84%, biofuels at 17.11%, solar at 12.32%, and geothermal at 1.67%.
For non-renewable resources, the first half of the year was not as inspiring. Production by the nation’s nuclear power plants in 2021 dropped by 2.81% and 4.07% compared to 2020 and 2019 levels. Meanwhile the energy supplied by the mix of fossil fuels also declined by 1.67% and 5.57% respectively, but still accounted for 78.69% of total domestic production and 78.83% of U.S. energy consumption. Fossil fuel consumption during the first half of 2021 increased by 6.50% compared to the same period in 2020, largely attributed to first half 2020 energy use being lower during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of the first half of the year, energy provided by renewable sources has exceeded nuclear generation by more than 50%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/29/the-worlds-largest-solar-parks/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2021",The world’s largest solar parks,"The concept of the solar park was first developed in India and China a decade ago. Regional energy agencies in states such as Gujarat, Qinghai, and Gansu identified suitable locations where several solar power plants could be sited together. The coordinators provided for high-capacity grid connections and often procured or provided the land.
Probably the most notable early example is the Charanka Solar Park in India’s Patan district. When this was first opened in 2012 by Gujarat’s then chief minister, Narendra Modi, it had a combined capacity of 224 MWP from 19 individual solar power plants, of which the largest were 25P MW each. It has since been expanded to 500 MW of overall capacity.
(Read “The world’s largest solar power plants” and “The world’s largest solar power stations.”)
The largest solar parks now house up to 80 individual solar power plants, achieving higher capacities than single plants. The concept has subsequently been adopted elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. A similar approach was implemented by the Bureau of Land Management in the USA, when it designated several ‘Solar Energy Zones’, such as that at Dry Lake in Nevada.
The following list selects the solar parks which are thought to have at least 1 GWAC of current operational capacity (typically equivalent to 1.25 GWP). The position each held in the 2019 lists are shown in brackets. The list is still dominated by China and India, joined by single entries in Egypt and the UAE, and a likely future entrant in the USA.
Located in the desert to the East of Golmud in Qinghai Province in China this solar park now houses about 80 solar power plants with a combined capacity of over 2.8 GWAC – up by a gigawatt since the last list – and includes a 200 MW ‘power tower’ CSP plant. It also houses a 200 MWP PV plant by Huanghe – the largest individual solar power plant in the world, when it was first built in 2011.
It is not known what the final capacity will be, but the overall area would be sufficient for an eventual 4 to 5 GW.
The Bhadla Solar Park, covering about 160 km2 at Bhadlachuhron Ki in the north of India’s Rajasthan state, has also expanded by around 1 GW since 2019, with several new plants, the largest of which is 300 MW. It will eventually accommodate nearly 30 solar plants with a total capacity of 3.5 GWAC.
This group of solar plants located beside the Longyangxia Reservoir in Eastern Qinghai, China, delivers its power in conjunction with a nearby hydro-electricity plant. It has been progressively expanded since the first phase in 2013 and now stands at an estimated 2.4 GW.
United Photovoltaics’ smaller Tara Beach Solar Park is visible to the north and the 50 MW Gonghe CSP power tower to the East.
Originally developed by China Power Investment – now State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) – this was previously listed as an individual plant (where it ranked #3).
This compact solar park scraped into the last list before it was officially commissioned. It is now largely complete with 27 blocks mostly of a nominal 50 MW, though there is space for around a further 400 MW.
The solar park covers 37 sq.km. in the desert in Egypt’s Aswan governorate and is the only solar park outside Asia on this list.
Also known as Anantapur Ultra Mega Solar Park, this solar park covers some 90 km2 in the Nambula Pulakunta district of Andhra Pradesh, India.
Promoted by Andhra Pradesh Solar Power Corporation, it is scheduled for a total capacity of 1.5 GW, of which about 1.2 GW is currently believed to be operational, though the site has been dogged by various delays.

The fourth and fifth phases are now under construction to the north-east and south of this solar park in the south of the UAE emirate of Dubai. Phase IV includes CSP plants using both parabolic trough and power tower technologies.
One of only two listed parks outside China and India, the eventual capacity of this complex is scheduled to be 5 GW, which may make it the largest in the world, covering up to 200 km2.
Jinchuan in China’s Gansu province is almost surrounded by solar power plants. The solar park covers almost 90 km2 of semi-desert to the north west of the city, while a further cluster of projects is to the south.
The solar park has now been increased to 15 plants with a combined capacity just over 1 GW. Jinchuan’s largest plant has a capacity over 200 MW.

A new entry at #8, covering 92 km2 of semi-desert in the Mori Kazakh district of Changji Hui prefecture of China’s Xinjiang Province is this solar park to the north of the town of Danangouxiang.
The current capacity of its 13 plants is just over 1 GW, and it has sufficient space to at least double in size in future years.
Located on some 80 km2 of low grade agricultural land in Karnataka state in India, to the north-east of the city of Pavagada, this solar park is now largely complete with its 19 plants giving a combined capacity of 1 GWAC.
The solar park was sponsored by Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Limited (KREDL) and the off-taker for most of its output is India’s National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).

Delingha Solar Park is located in the Haixi Prefecture, and is the third on this list in Qinghai Province. It houses about 40 projects with a combined capacity of over 1 GW. This includes 3 CSP plants together delivering about 200 MW (edged in red on this aerial view).
Plants now in construction will take the capacity over 1 GW, while Delingha Solar Park has enough site area for an eventual capacity of at least 2 GW.
The highest U.S. solar park on the list, the Dry Lake Solar Enterprize zone, is at #20. Way below even that, Westlands currently has only one small plant in service. However, most of its 10 plants are now in construction, and it will reach 1.5 GW when they are all complete.
The Westlands Zone covers 120 km2 of mainly agricultural land in the San Joacquin Valley, south of Fresno, California. There are also several existing solar power plants in the vicinity.
The term “solar plant” is used for an individual project that has been developed by a single developer or consortium. The largest of these were listed previously. Where, as described in this article, multiple plants are co-located in a discrete area under the coordination of an identified agency, this is called a “solar park”. The  word “cluster” is used where multiple solar farms are co-located in an area without formal coordination.
For consistency, all capacities are quoted in MWAC to allow direct comparison between PV and CSP plants (and other forms of generation). Readers will be aware that the DC peak capacity of PV plants is typically ~25% higher than the rated AC capacity, quoted here.
The final article in the series will identify the world’s biggest solar clusters.

The projects accounted for nearly 60% of all new PV capacity added that year.
Declining costs have been a chief driver of utility-scale solar growth, which has seen its reach expand beyond the sunny Southwest to more northerly regions. Prices negotiated through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) have fallen to new lows, and solar PPAs are now less costly than wind in many regions. As solar increases its share of the capacity on the grid, its wholesale value reduces.

However, this observed decline in value has kept pace with declining prices, meaning that solar has remained competitive. The growth prospects for utility scale solar look strong, with interconnection queues adding 170 GW last year alone.
Those insights were shared by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory during this year’s online Solar Power International. The Department of Energy laboratory drew its results from its database of 983 projects that have at least 5 MW of capacity, totaling 40.5 GW.
Falling costs remained the most significant driver of utility scale solar deployment in the U.S. Median installed costs have fallen  in the last decade, down nearly by 75% since 2010.
Lower capital costs and higher capacity factors, along with reduced operating expenses, longer design life, and improved financing terms have driven down the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) over the past 10 years. LCOE is a measure of the average net present cost of electricity generation for a generating plant over its lifetime.
LCOE has fallen 85% since 2010, to $34/MWh. If the federal investment tax credit of 30% is included, LCOE currently averages $28/MWh for utility-scale solar.

Steady growth in utility scale solar is expected to continue.

While prices have fallen, the value of solar has also eroded over time. This is due in part to wholesale electricity market prices declining overall, largely driven by declining natural gas prices. Solar-specific causes such as location, generation profile, and curtailment have driven this decline as well.

The loss of value in solar has shown some correlation with the resource’s overall share in the wholesale energy market. For example, in 2020, in CAISO (California’s grid) solar made up 21% of capacity and netted an average value of $25/MWh on the wholesale market,  30% below the average wholesale price. In contrast, solar was valued at $51/MWh where it made up less than 1% of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) grid-control region (Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma).
Despite the decline in wholesale value, declining PPA prices largely have kept pace, maintaining solar competitiveness in the market.
Steady growth in utility scale solar is expected to continue. About 460 GW of solar was in interconnection queues at the end of 2020, 170 GW of which were entered into the queues that year. Nearly 160 GW of the total queue include co-located battery energy storage, about 34% of the total. CAISO had the largest attachment rate in-queue, with nearly 90% of projects opting to include batteries.
What’s more, data reported by the Energy Information Administration showed that of the 14.5 GW of battery storage power capacity planned to come online in the U.S. from 2021 to 2024, around two-third will be co-located with a solar photovoltaic power plant.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/29/how-much-glass-is-needed-for-terawatt-scale-solar-pv/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,RESEARCH,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2021",How much glass is needed for terawatt-scale solar PV?,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) have tried to estimate how much float glass the PV industry may need to help the world reach the terawatts of installed solar capacity that will be necessary to reach climate goals and limit global warming to 1.5 C.
The scientists outlined two different scenarios: a conservative one predicting that the world’s cumulative PV capacity will reach 20 TW by 2050 and 80 TW by 2100, and a more optimistic scenario envisaging that global PV capacity will reach 80 TW by 2050 and 170 TW by 2101.
For both scenarios, they considered a maximum CO2 budget of 600 billion tons of carbon dioxide for the 2011-2100 period.
“The two scenarios span a plausible range of values for parameters describing the price learning curve of PV, the size of system integration challenges, the upscaling dynamics of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and the development of electrification of end-use demands,” they explained.
Depending on the two scenarios, the German group predicts that demand for solar glass could be met by an annual output of between 1,000 km2 and 1,300 km2 in 2020 and between 12,000 km2 and 22,000 km2 by 2100. The scientists assumed solar module efficiency at a learning rate of 6.7%, starting from a module efficiency of 20% in 2020.
“Looking at the total area of the active PV capacity, the values increase from 4,200 to 4,600 km2 in 2020 to 252,000 to 466,000 km2 by 2100,” the group said. “To put this in perspective, the values for 2100 correspond roughly to the land area of the U.K. or Sweden, respectively.”
The researchers expect bifacial glass-glass modules to see their share increase in the upcoming decades and the reduction of glass thickness from 3 mm to 2 mm could help to meet the huge demand triggered by this trend.
“A fully double glass-based PV production will require amounts of float-glass exceeding today’s overall annual glass production of 84 Mt as early as 2034 for Scenario 2 and in 2074 for Scenario 1,” they said. “In 2100, glass consumption would reach 122 Mt to 215 Mt.”
Available sand reserves for glass manufacturing do not represent an issue for future glass supply, the academics explained, but the PV and glass industries will have to expand capacities over the coming decades in order to avoid bottlenecks and reduce costs. More importantly, PV module efficiencies will have to improve significantly and reach 24.1% and 25.9% by 2030 for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.
“This roadmap foresees solar cell efficiencies in the range of 25% for leading products of both n- and p-type products of monocrystalline Si-PV,” they added, noting that no specific technological learning is expected for solar glass.
Emerging technologies such as perovskite solar cells and other cell technologies with efficiencies above 25%, if made commercially mature by the industry, might help to considerably reduce the amount of solar glass needed for the current century.
“Just recently, major commercialization efforts have been announced for thin double glass perovskite module, which would reduce glass demand by an order of magnitude,” the German team said, referring to a roll-to-roll printing technique of perovskite PV on glass developed by New York-based startup Energy Materials Corp.
The scientists presented their findings in “Technological learning for resource efficient terawatt scale photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science. The study also analyzes silver and indium demand, the projected costs of PV, and the greenhouse gas emissions of the solar industry.

Another 1.3 GW of battery storage will be co-located at sites with wind turbines or fossil fuel-fired generators, such as natural gas-fired plants. The remaining 4.0 GW of planned battery storage will be located at standalone sites.
Up to now, most U.S. battery systems have been located at standalone sites. Of the 1.5 GW of operating battery storage capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2020, 71% was standalone. The rest was located onsite with other power generators.
(Read “Strategies to enhance the value of utility-scale PV is focus of Berkeley Lab study.”)
EIA said that most standalone battery energy storage sites have been planned or built in power markets that are governed by regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs). RTOs and ISOs can enforce standard market rules that lay out revenue streams for energy storage projects in their regions. That, in turn, promotes the deployment of  storage systems. Of the utility-scale battery systems announced to come online from 2021 to 2024, 97% of the standalone battery capacity and 60% of the co-located battery capacity are in RTO/ISO regions, EIA said.
Over 90% of the battery storage capacity that is planned to be deployed outside of RTO and ISO regions will be co-located with a solar plant, EIA said. At some locations, the batteries can charge directly from the onsite solar generator when electricity demand and prices are low. They then discharge electricity to the grid when power demand is higher or when solar generation is unavailable, such as at night.
Solar generators in particular can effectively pair with battery storage because of their relatively regular daily generation patterns. EIA said this predictability works well with battery systems. That’s because battery systems are limited in how long they can discharge their power capacity before needing to recharge. If paired with a wind turbine, for example, a battery system could go days before having the opportunity to fully recharge.
Another advantage is the ability to take advantage of incentives such as the federal Investment Tax Credit, which is available for solar projects.
