A report from Environment America based on analysis from Georgia-based nonprofit The Ray shows that the counties of Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Diego in California have 4,800 acres of suitable solar project space alongside its highways and rights-of-way.
These spaces are advantageously located alongside infrastructure and are otherwise unused. The sites could host over 960 MW of solar capacity, generating 1,960 GWh per year. This is roughly equivalent to the electricity demand of 270,000 California homes.
“California can utilize the results of our solar analysis tool to prioritize the most promising spaces for solar panels in the state’s vast rights-of-way, and generate a wealth of clean electricity in the process,” said David Peters, western regional manager, The Ray.
California needs to triple its solar power capacity to meet its 100% clean energy requirement, according to the California Energy Commission. Putting solar panels alongside already-developed highways reduces the need for large utility-scale projects that can harm environmentally sensitive areas such as California’s deserts, said Environment California.
Environmentally sensitive or protected lands, areas within roadway clear zones, and areas in close proximity to pipelines, transmission lines, and other infrastructure were omitted from the report as “suitable” locations alongside highways.
Past solar highway projects have shown promise across the country, even in northern or rainy climates. The nation’s first right-of-way solar project was installed in 2008 just outside of Portland, Oregon. In 2012, a second project was added, adding 1.75 MW of solar capacity.
In Georgia, a segment of highway near LaGrange, Georgia known as The Ray Highway, is home to a 5-acre 1 MW solar array commercialized in February 2022 on otherwise underutilized state-owned land.
And in Maine, the state’s Department of Transportation (DOT) completed three projects in June 2023, adding 8.5 MW of capacity. The projects power the state’s Capitol building complex and additional facilities. The projects are expected to save the state $7.2 million over the next 20 years on electricity costs. In addition to the solar deployment, Maine DOT planted pollinator-friendly plants in the ground surrounding the panels.
California targets 100% emissions free electricity by 2045. The three counties in the report, along with California’s 55 other counties have an opportunity to move towards this goal while preserving land.
“This new analysis makes a strong case for utilizing land along California’s highways to generate clean energy,” said state Sen. Josh Becker. “If just three counties have this much solar potential alongside their highways, imagine our entire state’s potential. Let’s make better use of the available roadside land at our disposal.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/31/nexamp-orders-1-5-gw-of-heliene-solar-modules/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MINNESOTA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 31, 2023",Nexamp orders 1.5 GW of Heliene solar modules,"Boston-headquartered community solar developer Nexamp announced it made a purchase order for 1.5 GW of solar modules made by Heliene, making it the largest procurement effort for the community solar sector in U.S. history. 
“A solar order of this size is without precedent and comes at a critical time as the U.S. continues to develop its solar supply chain,” said Zaid Ashai, chairman and chief executive officer, Nexamp. “This partnership wouldn’t be possible without the Inflation Reduction Act and is proof that this historic piece of legislation is continuing to encourage renewable energy production and help drive the energy transition.” 
The North American-made Heliene modules will support the construction of about 400 new community solar projects over the next five years. Community solar projects are typically smaller than utility-scale projects and involve customers subscribing to a portion of the facility’s electricity generation in exchange for utility bill credits. 
The modules will be produced at Heliene’s Minnesota facility, potentially making them eligible for the 10% domestic content bonus tax credit adder provided by the Inflation Reduction Act. Heliene expanded its facility in 2022 to meet increasing demand and has additional capacity expansions planned for September 2023.  
U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm and Senator Tina Smith (D-MN) joined Heliene chief executive officer Martin Pochtaruk and Nexamp chief executive officer Zaid Ashai at the Mountain Iron, Minnesota facility to commemorate the order and view Heliene’s manufacturing operations. 
“Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, companies like Nexamp [and Heliene] can make investments that boost American manufacturing and create American jobs, while lowering families’ energy bills,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden has said ‘enough’ to watching jobs leaving the country—now, America is the irresistible nation for new clean energy investment.” 
Nexamp and Heliene’s partnership is expected to support additional research and development and create nearly 1,000 jobs in the Iron Range region. 
“The well-designed incentives and the industrial policy included in the IRA will drive continued growth of solar projects and this partnership puts Heliene and Nexamp on track to meet demand with high-quality, domestically manufactured solar modules,” said Pochtaruk. “This historic order also enables Heliene to maintain its commitment to creating good paying manufacturing jobs in the U.S. solar industry.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/31/summit-ridge-energy-to-develop-six-rooftop-community-solar-projects-in-maryland/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARYLAND",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 31, 2023",Summit Ridge Energy to develop six rooftop community solar projects in Maryland,"Commercial solar and energy storage company Summit Ridge Energy celebrated the construction of six rooftop community solar projects in Maryland, totaling over 17 MW.
The projects are part of the Maryland Community Solar program – an effort to provide local residents with low-cost, renewable energy – and are expected to generate over 25 million kWh of power annually. They will be sited on the rooftops of industrial assets owned by LBA Logistics, a real estate investment and management firm. 
The first project is expected to come online in the third quarter of this year, according to Summit Ridge Energy. The projects are all rooftop solar, and no trackers were used, Leslie Elder, Summit Ridge Energy’s vice president of political and regulatory affairs, told pv magazine USA. While they won’t be paired with energy storage at this time, “as the Maryland market evolves to incentivize storage, we will be very excited to consider adding storage to these systems,” Elder added. 
Summit Ridge Energy – along with LBA Logistics and commercial buyer’s representative Black Bear Energy, which facilitated the collaboration between the two companies – held a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Rosedale, Maryland.
The company has also expanded a partnership with HASI, a climate solutions investor, to build and operate a 250 MW community solar portfolio. The two companies entered a joint venture in 2019, and this transaction doubles the size of that. Under the new agreement, HASI will help finance Summit Ridge’s pipeline of community solar projects in Illinois and Maryland over the next two years. Summit Ridge estimates that this portfolio of projects will help avoid more than 51,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.
“Our programmatic, client-centric approach delivers long-term value to our partners, and we look forward to supporting the rapid growth of Summit Ridge Energy’s solar pipeline,” said Susan Nickey, chief client officer at HASI. 
Summit Ridge Energy,  launched in 2017, has a development pipeline of more than 2 GW and has deployed over $1.6 billion into clean energy assets over the last six years. The company expects to have more than 400 MW of PV online by the end of this year. 
Community solar could play a key role in the energy transition. Three out of four Americans want to switch to solar, but rooftop solar panels aren’t an option for many residents, either because they live in apartment buildings, are tenants, have shaded roofs, or don’t qualify to finance them, noted Elder. 
“Community solar is solving this issue. Community solar programs allow customers to ”subscribe” to local solar farms and receive the benefits from solar generation. Customers are matched with a local energy project, lowering their utility bills and guaranteeing that more clean energy is generated locally,” said Elder. 
But while community solar is growing rapidly – Wood Mackenzie has forecasted existing markets will grow by an annual average of 8% with nearly 14 GW of cumulative capacity expected by 2028 – not all states are on board yet, Elder said. 
“The US Department of Energy cites a lack of supportive policy and interconnection issues as key barriers,” Elder added.
