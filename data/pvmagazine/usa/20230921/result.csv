Only a few projects to date are designed to transmit solar power.
HVDC transmission over long distances costs less than alternating current (AC) transmission, said Cornelis Plet, vice president for power system advisory at DNV, on a webinar describing the report. That’s because while an HVDC line has a higher fixed cost, due to the need for a converter at each end where it connects to AC transmission, as shown in the image below, it has a lower cost per mile.

Plet served as one of two senior authors of the 204-page report, along with Johannes Pfeifenberger, a principal with The Brattle Group consultancy.
The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) said in a statement that the U.S. is “lagging on HVDC transmission deployment” and recommended deploying HVDC transmission “to deliver significant reliability, market and operational benefits.” ACORE, one of six report sponsors, also hosted the webinar.
Pfeifenberger, presenting a map (below) of existing and proposed HVDC projects in North America, highlighted the Pacific DC Intertie, completed in 1970 to bring hydropower to Los Angeles, but noted that most of the HVDC projects are in the planning stages, as shown in red. Most of those, he said, are proposed by merchant transmission providers and offshore wind developers, not grid operators, although the CAISO grid operator in California is pursuing HVDC.
Most of the proposed U.S. HVDC projects are focused on transmitting wind power, both onshore and offshore. The map also shows some hydropower transmission projects in the Northeast and a few intertie projects to connect the Eastern, Western and Texas interconnections.
The report lists five challenges to HVDC deployment. To address the challenges, the report makes nine recommendations that it says could be implemented through collaboration among grid planning authorities, transmission owners, HVDC equipment manufacturers, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, industry groups, regulators, states, and the U.S. Department of Energy and its national labs.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s “Interconnection Seams Study” showed that HVDC transmission could economically transmit solar power from sunnier U.S. regions to less sunny regions, but that adding HVDC transmission would not result in more solar capacity overall. Rather, it could lead to more solar development in sunnier regions but less solar development in other regions, leaving the total approximately unchanged.
Globally, however, Plet of DNV said that several HVDC lines to transmit solar energy are being planned between Africa and Europe, such as Xlinks and Tunita, while the Sun Cable link is planned between Australia and Singapore. “More such links are being planned around the Middle East,” he added.
The report by The Brattle Group and DNV is titled “The Operational and Market Benefits of HVDC to System Operators.”

The company displayed both N-type and traditional PERC cell technology.
Among the new modules displayed was a 54 half-cell N-type module with a full black aesthetic designed for rooftop applications. The module is a small, lightweight format that carries 425 W of maximum output power.
The new module, HY-DH108N8B, sports a 22% efficiency rating. It measures 68 in by 45 in x 30 x 1 in and weighs 53 lbs. The module has an 80% bifaciality rating.
The company also introduced two N-type modules with 72 and 78 half cells, designed for ground mounted projects and tracker systems. These modules carry between 560 W to 625 W of maximum output power and carry a 22.6% efficiency rating. Full specifications can be found here.
The 72 cell modules received an “Overall Highest Achiever” designation from the Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC). Read more about module evaluation and testing from RETC’s PV Module Index.
All the new modules come with a 15-year product warranty, 30-year linear power warranty, and have protection for 1% degradation in the first year, 0.4% in subsequent years.
Runergy has grown to a 50 GW annual cell shipment of 50 GW in its ten years of operation.
In addition to releasing a new series of modules, the company inked strategic partnerships at RE+. Hyperion, the high-end brand of Runergy, signed a strategic agreement with Nanosun to enter markets like Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. It also entered agreement with Grape Solar, focusing on the U.S. market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/21/on-the-floor-at-re-12-module-recycling-tesla-powerwall-iii-specs-ev-vegetation-management-and-more/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023","On the Floor at RE+: $12/module recycling, Tesla Powerwall III specs, EV vegetation management, and more","At the RE+ conference in Las Vegas, Swap Robotics showcased its electric, solar-powered vegetation mower. Rather than selling the mowers, the company rents them with their trained site clearing crews. Among their current projects is a 2,000-acre site managed by their traveling six-person team. It takes onsite technicians about five minutes to swap batteries, allowing the mower to run nearly 24/7. 

While the team addresses specific areas the robot might miss, the majority of vegetation is accessible due to the mower’s agile deck. The clever design extends the deck several feet to the left, so that it can reach beneath the solar racking where the main body cannot fit.
Company representatives at the booth mentioned that since its inception, Swap Robotics has secured $9 million in vegetation management contracts. They anticipate a potential for a $50 billion annual market in vegetation trimming by 2040.

The SnakeTray, an elevated wiring system, eliminates the need for trenching. Its open air and spread-out design result in better cooling, so there’s no need to reduce the power capacity of the cables. The company also claims this design can lead to an up to 8% increase in electricity generation.
After connecting with Tor “Solar Fred” Valenza, he guided pv magazine USA to Maxeon’s booth to showcase their stunning all-black residential solar module. However, two features stood out, apart from the module itself. The first feature was the company’s 40 year solar module warranty, which not only covers the module but also the labor costs for its replacement, should any issues arise.

This remarkable warranty can be attributed to a second striking feature, shown in the above image: the “Interdigitated Back Contact” of the company’s solar cells. The backside of these solar cells contain an intricate, highly durable copper layer that collects electricity with exceptional efficiency and longevity.
Tor also briefed pv magazine USA on the company’s newly launched solar module with a 24.7% efficiency rating. This positions it alongside the soon-to-be-released 25% product from 3Sun and Aiko Solar’s 24% efficiency 620-watt module, both leaders in solar module efficiency.
In other news, Tesla has unveiled its Powerwall III, set to hit the market next summer. The unit will be DC-coupled with Tesla’s solar inverter, utilizing the inverter for grid connectivity. The combined solar and battery inverter can deliver up to 11.5 kWac of power. To expand the DC capacity, these batteries can be physically stacked. The alignment involves positioning a new unit in front of an existing one, anchored at a single attachment point, highlighted in red in the accompanying image. The inverter accommodates a solar module DC-to-inverter AC ratio of at least 1.7:1.

A particularly enlightening discussion on the exhibit floor featured Nick Gotsev and Moises Aguirre from Ontility. Rather than discussing solar module sales, the duo highlighted the company’s dedication to module reuse and recycling. Informing pv magazine USA, Gotsev detailed their innovative module recycling approach that costs approximately $12 per unit, with an additional transportation cost of $3 per module (when efficiently filling a shipping container).
Ontility prides itself on both recycling and recertifying older modules for resale. Gotsev and Aguirre highlighted a significant market demand from O&M teams and asset owners seeking replacements for damaged modules in older projects, especially when the sizes differ from current market offerings. Aguirre added that most reused modules still produce over 90% of their original rated output.

pv magazine USA will share more insights from attendees at the RE+ event in the upcoming weeks. Until the next RE+, here’s a wish: may your pallets be delivered free of damaged modules. If, however, there’s a mishap, consider transforming them into artwork or reach out to Ontility for recycling solutions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/21/ohio-community-solar-pilot-would-unlock-1-75-gw-market/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,OHIO",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",Ohio community solar pilot would unlock 1.75 GW market,"Advocates are drumming up support for Ohio House Bill 197, a law that would carve out a 1.75 GW community solar program for the state. Ohio state representatives James M. Hoops (R-Napoleon) and Sharon Ray (R-Wadsworth) introduced the legislation.
Community solar programs involve residential and commercial electricity customers signing up for a portion of an off-site solar facility’s generation, receiving bill credits for the generated electricity. The Department of Energy said community solar customers can typically expect to see 10% to 20% savings on their annual electricity costs.
Ohio University conducted an economic analysis on the program, finding that it would generate an estima9ted $5.6 billion in gross output and $409.5 million in local tax revenues.
“IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) members have been generating and distributing energy to Ohio residents for more than 100 years, and Community Solar could only deepen that relationship, creating opportunities for Ohio workers to lead the transition to a cleaner energy future,” said IBEW International Representative Steve Crum.
House Bill 197 allows for the installation of 1,750 MW of new capacity. This includes 500 MW allocated to brownfield sites like capped landfills, retired coal facilities, and more. An additional 250 MW will be allotted for qualified sites in the Appalachian region, a region that has economically relied on coal.
The 1000 MW of standard capacity additions will be capped at 250 MW of development per year for four years, with project sizes capped at 10 MW each. Brownfield projects are capped at 20 MW and may be eligible for the Inflation Reduction Act energy community tax credit adder.
All projects in the program would be required to be constructed within five years. In total, the 1.75 GW of capacity would contribute an estimated 2% of the state’s electricity retail sales, said Ohio University. Find a recording of an informational session about the pilot program here.
“House Bill 197 isn’t just a leap towards a greener future; it’s a financial boon for our great state,” said Tristan Rader, Ohio director of Solar United Neighbors. “By unleashing billions in economic activity and pumping hundreds of millions into our local tax coffers, this community solar initiative showcases the profound win-win potential of sustainable energy.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/21/ira-one-year-later-and-the-future-of-community-solar/,"COMMUNITY,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",IRA one year later and the future of community solar,"With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) one year ago, Congress created historic job growth opportunities, invested heavily in clean energy deployment, and strongly committed to serving America’s disadvantaged communities. In the year since, federal agencies have done incredible work in carefully considering the competing goals of the IRA and attempting to right-size its impact.
Yet, even they could not have predicted the deluge of applications for all these programs.
Take, for example, the $7 billion Solar for All (SFA) competitive grant program, which is overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and accepting applications through October 12, 2023. After receiving 270 notices of intent requesting more than $40 billion — more than five times the amount allocated — the EPA recently had to revise the required reach of the award amounts. This is fantastic news. Yet, this fierce competition means states need to be even more intentional about their community solar program designs in their applications if they are to capitalize on this once-in-a-generation opportunity to impact their most vulnerable residents.
The SFA program aims to expand the number of disadvantaged communities primed for rooftop and community solar investment — enabling millions of low- to moderate-income (LMI) households to access affordable, resilient, and clean solar energy. Community solar refers to a solar array located within a community where multiple customers can subscribe and receive a credit on their utility bill for their share of the power that is produced — a perfect solution for millions of Americans who face barriers to installing rooftop solar. Given the goals of the SFA program and community solar at-large, you can see why the two are a perfect match and have created such high demand.
Across both the SFA and other IRA programs, a few principles stand out: incentivize the deployment of shovel-ready clean energy projects and ensure that LMI Americans reap the lion’s share of these projects’ benefits. From my time at the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA), I can say that the community solar industry has been focused on these areas long before this law and stand ready to meet these programs’ requirements. However, some program design proposals are creating tension between the immediate need for clean, competitively priced generation and longer term program objectives like market transformation and wealth building. To ensure the ultimate goals of said-programming occur while creating strong, sustainable projects, applicants need to keep three things in mind.
First, I encourage states and federal agencies to think big and to prioritize solutions that most rapidly deploy community solar and the benefits that come with it. Program designs that use incentives, rebates, or other monetary awards will cover part of the project costs while developers access private capital to fund the rest. This approach can fund deployment of more capacity significantly faster while leveraging private money to meet the goals of the IRA.
Incentive-based programs can also help offset the increased risk of a commitment to serve LMI populations that other program designs often cannot. Some states are considering using the SFA funding primarily for increasing money available through green banks. While green banks are an effective tool for building new markets and market entrants, they often fund 100% of a given project, which can limit long-term potential growth opportunities. Overall, coupling and designing incentive-based programs will more effectively provide immediate benefits, reduce energy burdens, and increase access to clean energy for LMI households. By thinking bigger — and strategically — about how to design programs that combine the best of each funding mechanism, we can achieve more and meet the goals of EPA’s application requirements.
Second, SFA programming that prioritizes broad and rapid deployment needs to also benefit the consumers who currently face the most barriers to clean energy market entry. American households making less than 80% of the area median income have energy burdens nearly three times higher than more affluent households. Utility rates are widely seen as regressive — lower income households are more likely to live in poor housing stock and lack access to capital for energy efficiency and other upgrades to reduce utility bills.
To help alleviate this disproportionate burden LMI households face, applicants should prioritize SFA projects that reduce energy bills, helping such households afford other necessities like rent and medicine. In addition, LMI households experience disproportionate impacts from utility outages and natural disasters. Extreme heat, flooding, and storms are more likely to impact LMI communities where they live and work. These households are the least able to bear these costs. Rapid deployment of renewables, such as community solar, will provide increased resiliency to these customers while reducing energy bills.
Finally, by thinking holistically, states can ensure applications support and harmonize with our broader electrification goals while still providing customers most in need with immediate savings. The IRA, in combination with the Bipartisan Infrastructure law, will boost electrification of transportation and home heating. This will create demand for new electric generation that should not be provided by increased fossil fuel generation. States should also consider the rapidly changing clean energy policy landscape in designing their programs — state legislatures are considering and passing clean energy legislation every year. Applications should ensure the flexibility necessary to respond to any new SFA opportunities that may arise during the five-year program period.
Achieving the IRA’s goals and working through the clean energy transition is going to require innovative program designs and lots of them. The SFA and all of its eligible applicants — states, territories, Tribal governments, municipalities, nonprofits, and even multi-state coalitions — are all vying for 60 awards of up to $400 million. The demand is enormous and bipartisan, coming from 45 red and blue states across the country. This diversity highlights the importance of effective program design and selection by federal implementers. Let’s make sure the community solar industry continues to prioritize rapid deployment of renewable generation and delivery of these immediate benefits to LMI households — both in our current work and applications for future programming.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/21/maxeon-to-acquire-shingled-cell-solar-patents-from-complete-solaria/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,NEW MEXICO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",Maxeon to acquire shingled cell solar patents from Complete Solaria,"Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. announced that it is acquiring Complete Solaria’s dealer channel operations as well as its solar panel patent portfolio relating to shingled cell solar panel technology.
The shingled cell technology, originally developed by SunPower, is incorporated into Maxeon’s Performance line of solar modules. The 425 W modules use bifacial mono-PERC solar cells made on large-format eight-inch G12 wafers, and have an efficiency of 20.6%, according to Maxeon. Maxeon was spun off from SunPower in 2020, when both became separate entities.
Maxeon’s CEO Bill Mulligan said that the transaction with Complete Solaria will expand the company’s distributed generation footprint incorporating Solaria’s dealer chanel, which will accelerate Maxeon’s direct sales efforts. Plus, he said, it will give Maxeon “immediate access to a qualified source of tariff-free solar panels that we plan to market adjacent to our flagship IBC solar panels, allowing us to replicate in the U.S. market the “better-best” product strategy we have successfully employed in our international markets for years”.
California-based Complete Solaria is an integrated provider of solar installation solutions using its own 360 to 400 watt solar modules. The company was formed in November 2022, when Solaria merged with installer Complete Solar, and operated the resulting Complete Solaria business as a vertically integrated company. In July of this year the company announced its intention to go public upon completion of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Freedom Acquisition I Corporation
The acquisition of Complete Solaria’s solar panel patent portfolio adds to the over 130 granted patents and over 80 pending patent applications for fundamental shingled solar cell panel technology. Mulligan noted that Maxeon designs and manufactures globally, and plans to use the shingled solar cell technology in its the cell and module manufacturing facility the company plans to build in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Maxeon announced in August that it had chosen Albuquerque for its new 3 GW facility, which will produce TOPCon PV-silicon cell technology and the Maxeon’s proprietary shingled-cell Performance Line solar modules. The company said the facility will produce millions of solar modules each year for the growing utility-scale and distributed-generation markets in the U.S. Maxeon reports that its new plant is expected to be the first large-scale cell and module manufacturing in New Mexico. While 3 GW is the planned capacity, the company said there’s a chance it will increase it to 4.5 GW in the future.
According to Will Anderson, CEO of Complete Solaria, after the transaction is complete, the company plans to concentrate on it core systems segment.
“This transaction will provide Complete Solaria with capital to optimize our end-to-end customer offering, including beautiful, high-quality solar energy systems with Maxeon premium, high performance solar panels,” said Anderson.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/21/u-s-could-be-understating-global-warming-impact-of-blue-hydrogen-ieefa-report/,"HYDROGEN,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",U.S. could be understating global warming impact of blue hydrogen: IEEFA report,"The U.S. government could be significantly understating the global warming impact of producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, according to a new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
The report takes a closer look at blue hydrogen – which can be produced from natural gas or coal, both of which contain methane – and its authors analyzed the carbon intensity of the fuel, looking at potential methane emission rates, leakage, as well as the effectiveness of carbon capture technologies. 
“The findings in the current report are clear – producing hydrogen from natural gas is not clean, not low-carbon, and cannot and should not be considered a solution in our efforts to solve the world’s worsening climate change crisis,” said David Schlissel, director of resource planning analysis at IEEFA  and co-author of the report.
The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have promised billions of dollars to establish hydrogen hubs around the country, and give production tax credits to the production of hydrogen as well as carbon capture and sequestration, Schlissel said. 
“We decided it was important to look at whether in fact blue hydrogen is clean and if not, in what circumstances it would not be clean,” he added. 
This report is the first in a series that the organization is planning, which will include analyses of producing hydrogen from coal and renewable natural gas, Schlissel said. 
IEEFA’s report points to four ways it says the U.S. government is significantly understating the global warming impact of producing hydrogen from fossil fuels. First is the assumption that just 1% of the methane used to produce hydrogen will be emitted into the atmosphere between the well and production facility, which the authors say is far less than recent scientific analyses have indicated.
Second is the focus on the 100-year global warming potential of methane, which is actually much lower than its 20-year global warming potential, according to the report.
Methane has a very high 20-year global warming potential, which declines over time, Schlissel said. 
“If you only focus on the 100-year figures… the impacts of methane in hydrogen are significantly smaller and that leads to an undercounting of their impact on global warming in the short term,” he said. 
The third factor is that the government assumes hydrogen does not have any effect on climate change when it leaks into the atmosphere, according to the report. 
And the fourth is the reliance on “overly optimistic and unproven assumption that hydrogen production projects will be able to capture almost all of the carbon dioxide they create.” 
In the case of hydrogen, the DOE has mandated a well-to-gate lifecycle analysis of emissions, which for blue hydrogen includes upstream emissions related to the production and delivery of natural gas, as well as emissions related to the electricity generation for hydrogen production and carbon dioxide management, Anika Juhn, IEEFA analyst and co-author of the report, said.
However, except for some of the emissions related to the transport and storage of captured carbon dioxide, the life cycle analysis covers emissions only up to the back gate of the production facility, she said.
“As a result, the downstream emissions related to hydrogen are not included,” said Juhn. 
According to the report, if more conservative assumptions are used for carbon capture rates, downstream hydrogen leakage, and downstream carbon emissions from the production of electricity needed to compress, store and transport the hydrogen, “then blue hydrogen gets even dirtier, with a carbon intensity more than three times as much as the DOE’s clean hydrogen standard.”
