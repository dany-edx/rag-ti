Community solar, sometimes called shared solar, is pitched as a way for homeowners, businesses and other organizations like nonprofits to invest in the benefits of clean energy when they have unsuitable conditions for rooftop or ground-mounted installations.
Either through buying or leasing a portion of an off-site solar project, customers typically receive a utility bill credit for the electricity generated by their share of the community solar system, similar to the way rooftop solar net billing works.
“People are searching for ways to access locally-generated renewable energy and this tool will help expand access to community solar through education and consumer empowerment. Community solar also offers low- and middle-income households the opportunity to access the cost-saving benefits of distributed solar energy without having to install solar themselves,” said Corey Ramsden, vice president of Go Solar Programs, Solar United Neighbors.
This class of solar projects is also hailed as an opportunity to ensure a more equitable energy transition. Residential rooftop solar has been historically adopted by higher-income customers, though that trend has been softening recently.
A National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) study estimated that nearly half of all U.S. households and businesses are unfit to host rooftop solar arrays. There are many reasons why one might invest in community solar instead of rooftop solar, including:  
“I have a small roof. It can’t fit enough solar panels to cover my yearly electricity usage, so I subscribe to community solar for the rest,” said Ramsden.
Community solar is currently available in 20 states and Washington, D.C., as a solar subscriber option. SUN’s vendor-neutral resource offers an overview of how community solar works, what to consider when shopping for subscriptions, and where projects can be found.
National partnership
The Department of Energy (DOE) is promoting the buildout of community solar through the National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP). NCSP, along with the Biden Administration, set a goal to achieve the equivalent of 5 million households subscribed to community solar projects by 2025, leading to $1 billion in bill savings based on an assumption of a 20% bill discount.
The goal represents a 700% increase in total community solar deployment, growing from 3 GW in 2020 to 20 GW in 2025. NCSP works to achieve these goals through engaging stakeholders, providing technical assistance, and collaboration on addressing common development barriers through sharing resources and information.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/22/philly-transit-authority-unveils-second-lightsource-solar-deployment/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,PENNSYLVANIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 22, 2022",Philadelphia transit authority unveils second Lightsource solar deployment,"The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) announced the successful commercial scale operations of its second solar project built by Lightsource bp in Franklin County, Pennsylvania.
Located in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, about 180 miles west of SEPTA’s downtown Philadelphia headquarters, the 25 MW Elk Hill Solar 1 farm is one of two utility-scale solar farms that the transit authority partnered with Lightsource to develop, bringing their joint statewide operational solar assets to 42 MW, enough clean energy to meet about 20% of SEPTA’s electricity demand.
Elk Hill Solar 1, developed under a virtual power purchase agreement between SEPTA and Lightsource bp, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 28,000 metric tons of CO2 annually. The solar farm also supports Pennsylvania’s clean energy goals, helping to lower carbon emissions while diversifying the state’s energy portfolio and increasing energy security with locally generated electricity.
The Philadelphia metropolitan transit agency’s other solar project, 17.5 MW Elk Hill Solar 2, entered COD operations in February 2021.  According to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission notice from April, the Elk Hill solar projects went into operation out of order because Elk Hill Solar 1 was being investigated under Sec. 206 of the Federal Power Act for potential rate schedule irregularities.
Elk Hill Solar 1 was fully funded by Lightsource bp and project investors with an estimated $25 million investment into the state’s energy infrastructure. The project also created 100 jobs during the construction of the facility.
Under a biodiversity and land management action plan, Elk Hill Solar 1 was installed to maximize sustainability benefits through an agrivoltaic habitat creation and co-located agriculture to farm the land while also harnessing solar energy.
Land under and around solar panels will be planted with groundcover that is grazing and pollinator friendly, including native wildflowers and clover species. Lightsource bp is working with a local farmer on a plan to graze sheep to manage the vegetation around the Elk Hill project.
In April 2020, SEPTA released a broad sustainability report called the ‘SEP-TAINABLE Annual Report for 2020’ which outlined the Philadelphia regional transit authority’s long-term climate change reduction goals. Initiatives the authority has undertaken include:
SEPTA is planning for a full transition to zero-emission buses (ZEBs) by 2040 and during its 2020 sustainability plan briefing outlined a master plan to spend $1.09 billion on future bus purchases from 2022 to 2033. The first phase calls for hybrid buses through 2024, with the second phase from 2024 onwards calling for electric and fuel cell electric buses.
Progress on the authority’s switch to battery electric buses was marred by public media station WHYY reports in mid-2021 of SEPTA sidelining a 25-bus fleet of Proterra all-electric vehicles due to an alleged cracked chassis defect.
In February 2022, SEPTA signed an order with Canadian bus manufacturer New Flyer of America for 220 Xcelsior hybrid electric buses.
A hotbed for natural gas with 21.8% of the nation’s gas reserves lying underground according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), Pennsylvania currently ranks 24th in the country for solar development, with 1 GW of installations through September 30.  According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the Keystone State ranks 14th in the U.S. based on its robust 3.09 GW development pipeline for the next five years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/22/is-2022-the-year-that-launched-the-u-s-solar-industrial-revolution/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 22, 2022",Is 2022 the year that launched the U.S. solar industrial revolution?,"With the signing of an executive order by President Biden to boost America’s clean energy economy, coupled with the goal of attaining 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, there has been a push for increasing U.S. manufacturing across the solar supply chain. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) gives those manufacturers the shove they need to get going.
The IRA does a lot for the solar industry. It incentivizes people to go solar by offering a 30% investment tax credit. It offers what can amount to lucrative incentives to solar developers who use domestically manufactured solar equipment. And it offers credits to manufacturers who produce the much-needed domestic content.
Solar developers are now more than ever pushed to use domestic content, thanks to the significant “adders” that can raise the tax credit beyond 30%. For example, projects featuring a minimum amount of domestically produced content are eligible for another 10%. To reach that target, all steel and iron must be U.S. made and at least 40% of manufactured goods – solar panels, inverters, electrical gear – must also be U.S. made, with the latter percentage to rise in future.
And then there are the incentives for manufacturers. The IRA provides two types of tax incentives to encourage manufacturers to set up shop in the U.S. First there are production tax credits. The IRA includes an investment of $30 billion in production tax credits to accelerate domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing. The IRA also has $10 billion for investment tax credits for those companies that build clean technology manufacturing facilities, including solar modules as well as electric vehicles and wind turbines. For more details on tax credits for solar manufacturers, see the DOE’s summary here.
Manufacturers respond
The U.S. Department of Energy has an interactive map that shows where in America the domestic solar supply chain is being built. This image of the map shows just module and wafer manufactures. When you click on the dot on the map, a text box lists the name of manufacturer, type of product, and manufacturing capacity.

Expect changes to this map in the coming months because, since passage of the IRA, several manufacturers have announced that they are either setting up module manufacturing in the U.S. for the first time or they’re expanding production.
Heliene is one module manufacturer who already had U.S. manufacturing plans in place at the time of the passage of the IRA. The opening of its 420 MW plant in Minnesota was announced in October, adding to the Canadian company’s existing 150 MW operation in the state. The facility is set to assemble monofacial and bifacial panels with half-cut cells. Construction of Heliene’s new facility had begun prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, so the company achieved operation without taking in the newly-established manufacturing tax credits. Heliene did, however, receive over $9 million in state and county funding.
In November pv magazine USA reported that Enel North America affiliate 3Sun USA is surveying the U.S. for locations to build a 3 GW bifacial solar module and cell manufacturing facility with plans to scale up production at the facility to 6 GW per year. While the location has not yet been disclosed, the company says that construction of the facility will begin in the first half of 2023, and production anticipated to begin by late 2024.
“Recent policy tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act have served as a catalyst for our solar manufacturing ambitions in the US, ushering in a new era of made-in-America energy,” said Enrico Viale, head of Enel North America.
Philadelphia Solar, a solar manufacturer from Amman, Jordan, announced last year that it plans to build a module factory in the U.S. That plan may be moving closer to reality, as Philadelphia formed a joint venture with Translucent Energy, called Trading Philadelphia Solar. The team plans to establish the U.S. manufacturing arm of Philadelphia Solar modules by the end of this year, with full U.S. production by 2024. First it will produce 400- and 530-Watt mono-PERC solar modules for residential and utility-scale markets, with plans to move into heterojunction technology in 2025. An announcement of the location was expected to come this month, but it has not been disclosed at this time.
In November, First Solar—already a leading U.S.-based module manufacturer—announced that it had selected Alabama for the location of its fourth module factory. Part of the company’s plan to scale its U.S. manufacturing footprint to over 10 GWDC by 2025, the new factory represents an investment of approximately $1.1 billion and is expected to be commissioned by 2025, with a planned annual capacity of 3.5 GWDC.
“The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has firmly placed America on the path to a sustainable energy future,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “This facility, along with its sister factories in Ohio, will form part of the industrial foundation that helps ensure this transition is powered by American innovation and ingenuity.”
Wafers
In December, U.S.-based CubicPV, formerly 1366 Technologies, announced plans to establish 10 GW of conventional mono wafer capacity in the United States. Driven by incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, the wafers produced by the new facility could fill a void in the domestic supply chain as well as create 1,500 new direct jobs.
“The IRA represents a titanic shift in the global solar landscape, and the U.S. is poised to become the world’s most competitive location to manufacture solar. We’re excited to have a role in the U.S. manufacturing renaissance while accelerating our business plan and supporting the development of our next generation tandem module technology,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO, Cubic.
Set for takeoff
Certainly it will take some time for these manufacturers to ramp up production to meet the burgeoning demand in the U.S. market. In the meantime, solar installers have until June of 2024 to still purchase tariff-free solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The domestic content requirement in the IRA also comes with a few caveats, for example, an exception is made if domestic components are not available or if by purchasing domestic content raises project costs by more than 25%.
The IRA is considered by many to be the United States’ most significant clean energy industrial policy. The ten-year extension of the ITC will ensure a strong solar market for the next decade, giving manufacturers confidence that the U.S. is the place to be. The added incentives for domestic production will help boost manufacturing, closing solar supply chain gaps, and enable U.S. solar industry to become a global leader. Stay tuned as pv magazine usa continues to report on more domestic manufacturing moves in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/22/tracking-solar-policy-winners-and-losers-in-the-southeast/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,ALABAMA,GEORGIA,MISSISSIPPI,NORTH CAROLINA,SOUTH CAROLINA,TENNESSEE",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 22, 2022",Tracking solar policy winners and losers in the Southeast,"The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) completed its fifth year of tracking solar policies of major utilities in the Southern U.S., identifying the “makers” that have encouraged solar adoption, and the “brakers” that are slowing it down.
“No path to widespread solar adoption can bypass the South,” said Jill Kysor, senior attorney and leader of solar initiatives for SELC. “Many utilities have implemented good solar policies that lower customer electricity bills, create local jobs and advance the clean energy economy. Others have opted for punitive policies that hurt their customers and the entire region by leaving solar potential untapped.”
Called Rates of Solar and launched in 2018, the SELC project tracks ~10 GW installed or committed solar capacity. Now in its fifth year, the SELC project tracks over 23 GW of capacity across the region. Approximately 25,000 homes and businesses had rooftop solar in the project’s six-state study region in 2018, and now that number has quadrupled to over 100,000 homes and businesses.
SELC said Southern states have a lot to gain from improving policies to make solar more accessible to customers and embrace the solar industry, which has grown at an average annual rate of 33% over the last decade. Solar represents a strong economic engine that could help a region with higher poverty rates than most of the U.S., and an opportunity for ratepayers to save on their utility bills.
Net metering policy has emerged as one of the central indicators of whether a utility region is a “maker” or “braker,” said SELC.
The organization’s Rates of Solar tool allows users to understand how much their utility company charges (or pays) when you adopt solar.
Brakers
Alabama is a prime example of a solar “braker,” with only around 500 residential solar customers, said SELC. Since 2013, utility Alabama Power has imposed some of the nation’s highest monthly fees on rooftop solar customers of any regulated utility. Every year, the average rooftop solar system of 5 kW accrues $300 of additional fees imposed by the state’s largest utility, totaling more than $9,000 in fees over a system’s lifespan.
Another state with low solar buildout is Tennessee, which has under 3,000 residential customers. With a lack of net metering and low and inconsistent export rates, it is very difficult to estimate potential savings of a system.
Georgia is a state that has made some incremental progress, introducing net metering in 2020, but leaving a low participation cap of 5,000 spots for over 2.5 million customers. The program filled up in less than four years.
Recently, utility regulators voted against expanding the popular net metering program in Georgia and instead adopted a new solar export rate that falls just below 7 cents per kWh. The new policy offers a slight improvement on the existing rock bottom rates, regulators missed an opportunity to do more, said SELC.
Makers
SELC said North and South Carolina “lead the pack” in solar policy. North Carolina leads the six-state region with over 35,000 installations to date. The state implemented a net metering policy in 2005 for its two major utilities, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The state has also gotten a boost from a rebate program implemented from 2017 to 2022. Revisions to the current net metering and rebate framework have been proposed but are still pending with state regulators.
South Carolina has the highest per capita solar installation rate and over 29,000 customers have gone forward to date. The state has active net metering policies that were established in 2008 and distributed energy resource programs that helped jumpstart the market in 2015. New time-of-use based net metering policies were adopted in early 2022.
SELC said Virginia is catching up to the Carolinas quickly following the passage of the Clean Economy Act of 2020, which lifted the state net metering cap from 1% to 6% of the utility’s peak lead forecast. Net metering has been active in the state since 2020.

Dubbed My Energy Optimizer Partner+, the VPP program will have the ability to scale up from 20 MWh / 10 MW of initial storage and power capacity to 54 MWh / 27 MW over time. Contractual capacity under the program is based on a two-hour delivery capacity, with day ahead notification to handle up to 240 events per year.
While individual solar and battery storage systems help customers manage their own energy needs, the My Energy Optimizer Partner+ program enables customers to operate their individual systems alongside many others to aggregate and dispatch renewable energy sources to benefit their communities. Participating My Energy Optimizer Partner+ customers will receive both upfront and ongoing compensation, or GridRevenue, based on the capacity of their solar and energy storage systems.
“As more SMUD customers add solar panel systems paired with battery storage solutions, they’ll be better able to manage their own energy needs while making meaningful contributions toward reducing their community’s carbon footprint,” said Lora Anguay, chief zero carbon officer of SMUD.
Currently, there are about 600 residential energy storage systems in SMUD’s service area with an additional 400 in the interconnection process. The utility has a backlog of thousands more to come online over the next several years.
SMUD has committed to funding batteries for low-income customers in its service territory through local non-profit programs such as Grid Alternatives.
“We’re honored to work with SMUD towards the achievement of their Carbon Zero 2030 plan through the deployment of a multifaceted virtual power plant across SMUD territory and the overall CAISO grid,” said Suleman Khan, CEO of Swell Energy. “We believe this model is a beacon for how municipal utilities and other public utilities can achieve scale and value with distributed energy resources.”
My Energy Optimizer Partner+ will take enrollments in January 2023, with VPP operations planned to begin in April.  Local residential solar and electrical installers are invited to partner with Swell Energy to co-develop projects for the VPP program.
On November 22, Santa Monica, California-based Swell Energy raised $120 million in equity financing to expand its VPP program offerings. The round was led by SoftBank and Greenbacker Capital, with participation from Ares Management and Ontario Power Generation.
The company is developing 600 MWh of VPP systems that use 26,000 battery systems from residential and commercial applications. Currently the company operates across utility systems in California, Hawaii and New York.
Swell is pursuing new development opportunities in underserved markets where grid services are necessary to strengthen and modernize infrastructure, such as New England, the PJM Interconnection market, as well as western and southern states where renewable energy and electric vehicle adoption is occurring.
The energy technology start-up creates VPPs by linking utilities, customers and service providers to aggregate distributed energy resources. The company was formed in 2014 and has raised about $152 million in VC funding to date and counts CIT Group, Aligned Climate Capital, For Good Ventures and Third Sphere as investors.
Virtual power plants or VPPs are virtual aggregations of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar, energy storage, electric vehicle charging stations and demand responsive devices such as water heaters and smart thermostats. The benefits of VPPS are more than just providing decarbonization and grid resiliency. The networks offer grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new sources of generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/22/comparing-customer-value-of-solar-plus-storage-under-net-energy-metering-versus-net-energy-billing/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA",,"DECEMBER 22, 2022",Comparing customer value of solar-plus-storage under net energy metering versus net energy billing,"The fundamental difference between the two regimes is that net energy metering subtracts energy produced from energy consumption and prices the resulting “net energy” at the retail rate while net energy billing charges imports of energy from the grid under the retail rate and compensates exports from the consumer to the grid at a much lower rate, which is sometimes interpreted to be the wholesale market rate.
What’s the difference in payback periods between the two regimes: the one that’s currently in place that relies on net energy metering, NEM 2.0, and the one that’s going to kick in sometime in the spring of 2023, based on the CPUC’s unanimous decision on December 15 to rescind net energy metering and replace it with net energy billing?
The answer depends on who you ask. The issue has become so politicized that I don’t know who to trust. To answer the question, I decided to carry out a thought experiment using stylized data from my solar-plus-storage system that is the kind that commission wants to promote.
I installed solar-plus-storage in December 2019 and was given permission to operate the system a month later. Earlier, in June 2019, I had bought a Tesla Model 3.
I installed an 8 kWdc system and paired it with a battery capable of storing 9.8 kWh of energy.  The system was designed to net out my energy usage for the year, which in the prior twelve months was 10,000 kWh. After discussions with my local utility about my best rate, I decided to switch to the EV2-A rate.
The payback for the system was estimated at nine years, using (a) an estimate of $200 a month for the 12 months preceding my purchase of the EV and the installation of the pre-solar-plus-storage bill and (b) the estimated savings from the system after its installation. The big unknown was the magnitude of the bill savings, which depends on a number of factors, including the weather, the amount of shade from any big trees, the orientation of the roof, the efficiency of the panels, and so on. This analysis did not include a projected change in future rates, so it was a bit conservative given PG&E’s rates history.
During this calendar year, from January to November, my True-Up bill under NEM 2.0 and PG&E’s EV2-A rate came in at $42 a month. That’s based on the numbers in the table below (adding $309.90 in the 5th column to $149.02 in the 8th yields $458.92, then dividing by 11 yields $41.72).

I am guessing by the time the data from December is added, the monthly average bill will come in at $50 a month.
Now let’s engage in a thought experiment. Imagine if I had not made my investment back in 2019, but was planning to make it sometime in the coming year with the new net energy billing rules in place. I would be switched over to the E-ELEC rate and pay an additional fixed charge of $15 a month. See the comparison of rates below.

My energy rates during the peak and part-peak periods would be a tad lower on the E-ELEC schedule but the off-peak rate, which has the largest number of hours, would be higher. Let’s assume the effect of switching rates would cancel out, so there would be no incremental impact on my bill.
Under net energy billing, export compensation will drop down by 80% in five years and then hold steady. My pre-solar bill was $200 a month. Under NEM 2.0, the post-solar-plus-storage bill is $50 a month, representing a savings of $150 a month. Using a rule of thumb, I am estimating that 60% of the monthly bill savings (or $90) from my solar-plus-storage system comes from reducing usage and 40% from export (or $60). Some 80% of the export savings ($48) will disappear, leaving me with just $12 of savings from exports.
I would only be saving $102 a month as opposed to $150 a month, a drop of roughly a third. Clearly, that would extend the payback period from 9 years. I just don’t see how the payback period would be shortened, as asserted in the December 15 decision.
The ostensible purpose of the decision seems to be to promote self-consumption. Consumers will have to avail themselves of the following choices under the new rules:
The decision to end net energy metering will have several consequences. Rooftop solar installations will plummet because most people don’t want to pair them with batteries. Battery installations are rare because they are expensive. I personally know two dozen people who have installed solar panels. Of this number, only three have installed batteries.
Only wealthy customers who really don’t care about payback periods, earning a million dollars a year and higher, would make that investment. I certainly would not be making that investment if I had not already made it. Neither will the low-income customers whose well-being is the stated intent of the decision.
The only thing I can think of that will validate that assertion is that rooftop solar installations, either with or without batteries, will plummet and thus the so-called cost shift from the poor to the rich will diminish. Maybe that’s the real intent of the unanimous decision. But what will also diminish is California’s pursuit of net zero carbon emissions.
Telling consumers that large-scale solar costs only 4 cents/kWh rings hollow when they are paying 30 cents/kWh. In the coming decade, electricity rates will continue to rise in the billions of dollars, as stated by the utilities. They won’t be able to blame NEM for the rate increases. However, the one option consumers have today for lowering bills while staying connected will be taken away by this unanimous decision.
This will also represent a setback for the state’s electrification goals. What’s the primary reason that heat pump installations are rare in California? The high cost of electricity mentioned above. Heat pumps become cost-effective when customers have installed rooftop solar panels. The same can be said for EVs.
Consumers will be asking why they can’t get power for 4 cents/kWh if the utilities keep insisting that bulk renewables are the cost-effective solution. The utilities undermine their own viability when they insist on ignoring the customers’ viewpoint on the economics of power purchasing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/22/reducing-interconnection-time-to-one-year-is-a-draft-long-term-goal-of-does-i2x-initiative/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"DECEMBER 22, 2022",Reducing interconnection time to one year is a draft long-term goal of DOE’s i2X initiative,"A U.S. Department of Energy initiative to speed interconnection has drafted goals to reduce both interconnection costs and timelines by 50% in five years, and then transition to no more than one year “from application to build,” said Tom McDermott, chief engineer and solar lead at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, in a webinar.
Three national trade groups have said that interconnection studies for large-scale renewables and storage could be completed in “months instead of years.”
DOE’s i2X initiative, which 600 people from 400 organizations have joined, will refine its draft goal statement over the next couple of months, McDermott said.
The initiative is designed to enable partners to work together, said Michele Boyd, program manager at DOE’s Solar Energy Technology Office, on the webinar.
“Getting buy-in and adoption” is “very important,” McDermott said. “We can get things done perhaps by building consensus and illustrating better practices,” he said, but the stakeholders that DOE has been recruiting to join the initiative “are the ones that will have to adopt” new practices. Speaking to stakeholders on the webinar, he said “All we can do is encourage you and provide good examples.”
The initiative will operate through six working groups, and each participant is invited to join at least one working group, McDermott said. Ten staff members from DOE and the U.S. national laboratories, including Boyd and McDermott, are supporting the initiative.
The initiative will evaluate improvements to interconnection of both large-scale resources and distributed resources.
Timeline
Having engaged stakeholders, the initiative plans to release a five-year roadmap by mid-2023 that will “identify solutions that we have available today, as well as the data, research and technology gaps that need to be filled,” Boyd said.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC’s) final interconnection rule, which McDermott expects in the next few months, “will be the baseline” for the roadmap, he said.
Also in 2023, the i2X initiative will announce new technical assistance programs, Boyd said, to help individual organizations, or groups of organizations, “identify, test and implement solutions to their interconnection challenges.”
After 2023, pending Congressional appropriations, Boyd said DOE plans to collect interconnection data and conduct research to fill gaps identified by the roadmap, “to make it easier to solve” interconnection challenges. “To understand what success in interconnection means, we need to understand the status quo, set goals, and measure whether we are making progress,” she said.
The Solar and Storage Industries Institute earlier this year asked DOE’s Energy Information Administration to collect and publish interconnection data, but that request was denied as being burdensome.
With continued funding, the initiative will focus through 2028 on implementing and adopting better practices, McDermott said. By 2035, he envisioned that a “connect and manage” approach to speed interconnection could be used for at least 50% of new generating capacity. A similar approach is currently used in the ERCOT grid region in Texas.
The initiative has a “long view of success,” McDermott said.
Studies
To evaluate options for potentially improving interconnection processes and timelines, such as studying smaller clusters of interconnection applications within shorter timeframes, McDermott said the initiative will use a synthetic representation of the Texas grid.
Another planned study, he said, would evaluate prioritizing interconnection based on “successful experience in auctioning off wideband spectrum.” An auction could involve a capacity market, or an energy market, or both, he said. “It’s a little bit complicated; some people are positive on the idea,” he added. The study would simulate a market process to “see what kind of outcomes could change, and can that be a more efficient market-based approach to handling interconnections.”
Such studies, McDermott said, “could inform a future FERC notice of proposed rulemaking.”
Partners
