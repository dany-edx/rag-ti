The project is the first project in the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA’s) Green Invest program, an initiative that has raised TVA’s contracted solar capacity.
Muscle Shoals was developed by Ørsted and its 227 MW of capacity makes it the largest project in Alabama. Just saying that  doesn’t quite tell the full story, however. Prior to Muscle Shoals, Alabama had a cumulative installed solar capacity of around 280 MW, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). That means Muscle Shoals nearly doubled the state’s total installed solar capacity.
While solar has not historically had a strong presence in Alabama, SEIA projects the state will install 1,350 MW over the next five years. That would place Alabama 27th in the country for capacity installations.
Muscle Shoals has a long-term Green Invest power purchase agreement (PPA) with TVA, which, in turn, will supply energy to a Facebook data center in Huntsville, Alabama.
Ørsted acquired Muscle Shoals in 2020 from Longroad Energy.
Facebook is proving to be a regular customer for TVA’s Green Invest program. In March, the company signed deals for 145 MW of the 173 MW Logan County project in Kentucky, sharing that project with General Motors. It also signed a deal for the output of a 150 MW solar farm and 50 MW battery energy storage system in Mississippi. That project, located in east central Mississippi, marked the first Green Invest deal that Facebook made for a project that includes battery storage.
In May, Facebook signed a Green Invest contract for 110 MW of  a 150 MW solar facility, set to be constructed in in Shelby County, Tennessee. That capacity will be used to support a data center operations in Gallatin, Tennessee. RWE Renewables agreed to receive the remaining 40 MW of capacity.

Each link below links to the most current insight and resources on the topic.
Any rooftop solar installation starts with a couple of key questions that need to be addressed. Is my roof ready for solar? And how will the angle of my roof affect my solar system’s output?
Ideally, solar should be installed on a newer roof. For people in North America, solar should be angled due south to capture the most sunlight. But in reality, homeowners install solar on the home they own, so we show how to decide whether, say, a middle-aged roof that points slightly the wrong way is suitable. (Spoiler alert: solar usually works pretty well, even in less-than-ideal configurations.)

Next, we ask what’s my solar system going to cost? To answer that question, we need to look at the list of unique variables and components in a standard solar project that a homeowner at least needs to be aware of. Once you start to accessorize your rooftop PV with batteries, panels, and EV chargers – the list gets even longer! We take a moment to make sure your solar system is sized correctly to align with your electricity bill and future energy needs.
After determining out-of-pocket costs, we show how to figure your solar system’s payback period. To get a ballpark estimate, divide your project’s costs by its expected annual production output. The caution here is not to overlook federal tax credits, as well as possible state tax credits and incentives. And keep your eye on issues like net metering, whose rules seem to change almost every year.
Admittedly, adding batteries to a residential solar system will significantly slow down the payback period in most states. However, it’s important to remember that there is more value to a residential battery backup system than a simple return on investment calculation may show. As recent grid challenges in Texas, Louisiana, and California have shown, when you really need a backup power source, storage is extremely valuable.

After contemplating all the laws and a few of the important components, we help guide you through the ins and out of how to pay for your rooftop solar. After all, your new solar power system is a 20-year investment, and contractors will accept bank loans, on-the-spot finance, third-party ownership, and even cold, hard cash!
The cost of a solar power system can be high, making the purchase much like buying a car. However, since solar panels pay measurable dividends, it’s more like investing in a financial product. And there are a number of ways to find the money to pay for it.
Not to be overlooked is issues related to local market, and for some of us that means a Homeowners Association. Here we might encounter a bump in the road, such as grumpy neighbors.
By now, many homeowners are ready to strike up a relationship with a local contractor. To find a good one, take advantage of the resources provided in how to find … and evaluate … a solar contractor for your rooftop project.
Your contractor will help you spec the hardware that you are interested in. When specifying solar panels, it all comes down to curb appeal. Aesthetics are among the most important factors which determine a home’s value, so the demand for beautiful, low-profile or hidden panels is growing.

Just as important as the handsome solar modules, are the brains behind the beauty of your solar power system. Module-level power electronics – known as optimizers and microinverters – maximize electricity generation between strings of solar panels that receive different amounts of sunlight due to angles and shade.
Once you have chosen the hardware, it’s time to determine the best way to attach your solar system to the roof. Your contractor will do the work, but it’s good to know how local building codes and risk factors come into play.
Once installed, your solar system represents a long-term investment. You keep your car in good working order, and your solar system benefits from the same sort of TLC. Keeping your rooftop solar system humming over the long term will require some sound decision-making early on. Solar O&M comes down to mechanical rooftop connections, electrical solar panel connections, panel and connection temperatures, and inverters. We present a handful of options to ensure that your solar system remains well maintained through its entire lifetime.
Our final message is simple: go solar, but go with your eyes open. Like all industries, consumers need to pay attention in order to protect themselves. One useful guide is this 24-page Solar Consumer Protection Guide from the California Public Utilities Commission, which is intended to educate consumers about solar leasing and power purchase agreements.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/20/irec-guide-aims-to-help-states-deploy-solar-hosting-capacity-maps/,"POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2021",IREC guide aims to help states deploy solar hosting capacity maps,"Solar hosting capacity maps have been called “treasure maps” for solar developers as they show which portions of distribution circuits can accommodate more solar installations without costly circuit upgrades.
More states are set to join the nine states that already require utilities to provide the maps, which help to speed up the most cost-effective solar installations. But states that have already embraced hosting capacity maps faced bumps along the way, including delays that can last for years.
To smooth the path for states that are just beginning to implement requirements, as well as states that want to improve existing maps, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) published a guide, “Key Decisions for Hosting Capacity Analyses.”
IREC’s guide advises states to start by involving stakeholders and defining the use cases that the maps must serve. The guide describes 12 more high-level decision points for states as they work to achieve useful hosting capacity maps.
The first iteration of maps could be based on a modest set of state requirements, said the guide. Later iterations could specify additional functionality. A map that shows why hosting capacity is limited in a given location, for example, will let a customer see whether redesigning the project, perhaps with energy storage or a smart inverter, will address the capacity limitation.
Maps also could show locations where a distributed resource may provide a system benefit. Over time, the maps could guide deployment not just of solar but also storage, electric vehicle chargers, and heat pumps.
IREC said that while it has opinions on preferred ways of approaching each of the regulatory decision points, its guide aims to present options and their implications, rather than expressly advocate for any given approach. The guide reflects IREC’s insights from numerous state proceedings on hosting capacity maps.
The guide describes California’s “rocky rollout” of its integration capacity analysis tool—the state’s name for hosting capacity analysis—as all three investor-owned utilities showed in 2019 that anywhere from 60-80% of their distribution systems had little to no load hosting capacity. Discussions among stakeholders and regulators led to the conclusion that the results were erroneous, the guide said.
California then set data validation requirements for each utility. It also invited stakeholders to comment on the utilities’ data validation plans, and hired an independent expert to review the plans.
Regulators in other jurisdictions have the opportunity to begin oversight of data validation earlier in the hosting capacity analysis process, the guide said.
IREC noted that some early decisions can be “difficult, expensive, or time-intensive” to change after the fact, while others “can be built upon and evolve along with the analysis over time.”
Illinois and Colorado recently ordered their utilities to provide hosting capacity analyses, said IREC staff. Several other states are having regulatory discussions about requiring the analyses or improving existing ones, including Oregon, New Mexico, Ohio, and New Hampshire.
Those states join at least seven others that already require hosting capacity analyses: California, Nevada, Minnesota, New York, Maryland, New Jersey, and Connecticut.
And in at least seven more states, at least one utility provides hosting capacity maps. Those states are Hawaii, Michigan, Virginia, North Carolina, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, according to IREC staff and our previous coverage. In Georgia, solar groups have called for hosting capacity maps, while in Maine two citizens groups have done the same.

The battery system consists of a series of Tesla Megapacks connected to SRP’s energy grid. The batteries can be recharged overnight when power is abundant and less expensive and then discharged during peak energy periods to help meet high customer demand.
SRP also recently contracted for the output from the Sonoran Energy Center, which will be one of the largest solar-charged battery projects in the state. The utility has contracted for an additional large-scale solar and battery storage project called the Storey Energy Center to be built south of Coolidge. Both projects are scheduled to become operational in June 2023.
In addition to the new battery system in Peoria, SRP receives power and collects data from two pilot battery storage projects. These include the Pinal Central Solar Energy Center, a 20 MW, integrated solar energy and battery storage plant in Casa Grande and the Dorman battery storage system, a 10 MW, 40 MWh stand-alone battery storage system in Chandler.
