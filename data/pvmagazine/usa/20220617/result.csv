What sets ZiGGY apart from most charging systems is that it doesn’t require a vehicle to park in a designated place and it can be implemented without the electrical infrastructure required of a stationary charger. In addition ZiGGY can display digital ads, so it can be a money maker for hotels and other businesses that want to lease Ziggy to provide “charging as a service”.
“Strong EV sales and emissions reduction goals are creating a more sustainable future, but EV charging infrastructure isn’t keeping up,” said Caradoc Ehrenhalt, inventor of Ziggy and founder and CEO of EV Safe Charge Inc. “ZiGGY is a flexible and simple solution for virtually any office, mall or apartment complex to help meet growing charging needs of its tenants and guests without expensive, time-consuming infrastructure and installation investment, if it’s even possible. In many cases, especially in older buildings, adding EV chargers isn’t an option until now.”
The way ZiGGY works is that the EV driver summons the robot through an app, and it arrives at the vehicle’s parking space before the EV arrives. It moves aside to let the EV park, and then positions itself behind the car for charging. Afterwards ZiGGY returns to its base to be charged from the electrical grid, a battery or by solar energy.
Advertising can be displayed on ZiGGY’s extra-large screens. Facilities such as hotels, parking garages, places of employment and others can lease ZiGGY, and they can opt to have customers pay via the app or they can provide ZiGGY’s charging services as an amenity.
“We created ZiGGY in response to growing demand for flexible EV charging solutions from our customers, and to help support the global transition to a cleaner, greener, all-electric mobility future,” Ehrenhalt added. “By helping drivers to overcome charging anxiety, one of the barriers to mass EV adoption, ZiGGY is enhancing the EV charging experience for everyone.”
EV Safe Charge reports that it has already taken order for ZiGGY, even though it is not scheduled for production until next year. Businesses that the company says are interested include Holiday Inn Express in Redwood City, Calif., Opera Plaza in San Francisco and The William Vale, a luxury hotel in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood.
“We delight in finding opportunities to introduce our guests and neighbors to next-level amenities and technology,” said David Lemmond, general manager of The William Vale. “ZiGGY is perfect for the growing demand for easier charging solutions. ZiGGY will introduce our entire community to just how convenient charging your EV really can be without substantial infrastructure updates.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/17/why-every-state-can-learn-from-hawaiis-solar-journey/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,HAWAII",,"JUNE 17, 2022",Why every state can learn from Hawai’i’s solar journey,"As the entire country sits on the edge of an energy and climate crisis, the mainland is looking to Hawai‘i on clean energy policies. Perhaps that’s why the Western Conference of Public Service Commissioners chose to have its annual educational conference in Honolulu this year, with a focus on clean energy innovation and emerging technologies.
Last week, the Aloha State hosted these energy regulators and leaders to discuss the policies and regulations needed to ensure a reliable but also zero-carbon future. But the most valuable lesson was just beyond the conference halls. Hawai‘i’s solar energy policies are a model for the nation as we move toward 100% clean energy by 2045. Though getting solar right wasn’t an easy, or even linear path.
In 2015, our public utilities commission decided to end net-energy metering, or NEM, the billing practice of crediting solar homeowners for the excess power they give back to the electric grid. This was a huge financial blow to families who wanted to choose solar as a more affordable option to notoriously high traditional energy bills Hawaiians face.
Ending NEM for solar customers resulted in an 80 percent decline in new solar installations in certain parts of the state. The number of active solar companies on Oahu, the state’s largest market, dropped from 300 in 2015 to just 98 last year, according to the Hawai‘i Solar Energy Association (HSEA). It’s worth noting that this type of post-net metering falloff in the residential market isn’t exclusive to Hawai‘i, with Nevada and South Carolina experiencing similar declines after their respective NEM restrictions.
But what Hawai‘i realized in years following is that rooftop solar, especially when paired with battery systems, can be a powerful solution to drive to a 100% clean energy grid. Hawai‘i regulators, utilities, and industry have been working together to develop a program to leverage these distributed resources, and restore a full value when rooftop solar is exported to the grid.
The Hawai‘i Public Utilities Commission (HPUC) is finalizing a program that will allow Hawaiian Electric utility to utilize 50 megawatts of rooftop solar plus batteries to help provide clean power as Oahu island’s last coal-fired power plant is scheduled to be shut down by September 2022. In this program, enrolled home solar and battery customers will receive an upfront incentive to encourage enrollment, a monthly payment based on capacity of the battery, and a re-established fair export value for solar electrons provided to the grid for several hours every day.
This program demonstrates the success of radical collaboration: utilities, stakeholders, and industry leaders work together to make a more resilient, renewable, and local energy system. By advancing solar and storage at this level, we’re well on our way to meeting our aggressive goal of 100% renewable energy generation within less than two decades.
But what makes me proudest of these forward-leaning clean energy standards is how they came about through innovative cooperation between what might be seen as traditionally opposed parties. Valuing and paying for the benefits of distributed resources was revived thanks to an unlikely partnership between Hawaiian Electric, clean energy developers, and stakeholders.
I say, “unlikely” because across the country, investor-owned utilities are far too often at odds with home rooftop solar and storage installers and advocates. Take California for example, where utilities are supporting a proposal from California regulators that would impose a monthly tax on anyone who adds rooftop solar – upwards of $650 each year on a single household, depending on system size.
This type of proposal is not only making access to resilience solutions like solar and batteries more difficult for families, but as we found out in Hawai‘i, it will make it more difficult to reach clean energy goals efficiently and affordably.
I urge our friends in California and beyond to look at not only our accomplishments but our missteps. Ending NEM nearly killed solar for us, and our clean energy goals with it. Thankfully, it appears states and territories across the US are paying attention to at least protecting families’ right to self-generate clean energy.
An Arkansas judge just opted to protect households from a solar tax and NEM cutbacks. Puerto Rico recently rejected an arbitrary solar tax. Even Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed a bill that would allow utilities to charge excessive fees on rooftop solar customers.
Hawai‘i is proof that the impossible can be done; utilities and distributed energy companies can not only compromise, but collaborate, on innovative solutions that are beneficial to the grid, all ratepayers, and the environment. So, as energy leaders continue discussing renewable solutions, I urge them to emulate our successes rather than our past mistakes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/17/residential-solar-offers-price-certainty-in-chaotic-electricity-markets/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 17, 2022",Residential solar offers price certainty in chaotic electricity markets,"In Texas, electricity is deregulated, which means distribution-level energy supply companies can compete in the open market to offer residential and commercial contracts. Texans are now accustomed to shopping around for new electric rates every six to twelve months or so to choose who will deliver power and select a contract that works for them.
While deregulation has initially led to lower electricity prices in the state, it comes with some issues of complexity and transparency. These issues may be negatively impacting the long-term outlook for reasonably-priced and reliable electricity for Texans in the long term.
Complexity
Electricity rates are “decoupled” in Texas, meaning generation from power plants and transmission from the grid are two separate costs on a utility bill from separate companies. In the Texas deregulated market, customers have choice over who provides the generation, but not the transmission. Customers choose their electric rate packages from Retail Electric Providers (REPs).
REPs offer contracts to Texans in a fashion very similar to a cable contract, where there is often a “teaser” electric rate that starts the customer off at a low, attractive rate, and then increases sharply months later. Typically, a customer signs a contract that ranges between six months to three years. There are often cancellation fees exceeding $250, so it can be costly to change providers when that teaser rate period ends.
There are also a lot of complexities hidden in the fine print of these contracts. For example, shopping for an electric rate contract in Dallas, Texas, at the time of writing, the “lowest” available contract on Choose Texas Power, a rate shopping platform, is from REP Frontier Utilities. The rate is listed at $.0132/kWh at 1000 kWh.
However, the fine print of the contract reveals that the first 500 kWh used each month, a significant portion of a home’s monthly usage, is charged nearly double that posted rate at an average of $0.236/kWh. The next 500 kWh are charged an average $.132/kWh, and any usage exceeding 2000kWh is charged an average of $.181/kWh.
The true charge, looking over the standardized Electricity Facts Label, is $0.19/kWh, or 44% higher than the advertised sticker price. Plus, there is a $200 cancellation fee, and additional charges from utility TDU of $.038/kWh, and a $3.47 fixed delivery charge.
This example is representative of many in the Texas energy supplier market, and it creates a real opportunity cost for residents. The time spent sifting through the fine print of these contracts to save on monthly bills is valuable time lost.
Predatory contracts
The deregulated market also opens the door for predatory contracts to be signed, which disproportionately affect low-income community members. Currently, Massachusetts is proposing legislation to eliminate competitive electric suppliers, citing problems with predatory contracts.
This problem was highlighted by the Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, which caused massive spikes in unexpected electricity demand and froze some natural gas peak demand plants. The storm led to widespread shortages, rolling blackouts, and wholesale market prices exploded to the legal cap of $9/kWh for several days. This was a 7,400% increase over the average rate at the time of about 12 cents /kWh.
Some customers who signed predatory contracts were exposed directly to wholesale prices. Following the storm, Chambers County resident Lisa Khoury received a bill from supply company Griddy for $9,340. Her normal bills ranged $200 to $250 a month. Griddy drafted payments from Khoury’s bank several times, pulling $1200 before she blocked further charges from the bank.
Khoury still owed Griddy for the rest of the bill when she decided to enter a class action lawsuit against the company, seeking $1 billion in relief for affected customers.
Prices rising, reliability lowering
David Kinchen, chief operating officer for Energy Ogre, is close to the issue, as his company charges residential customers $10 a month to shop for competitive REP contracts, sifting through the fine print and predatory contracts to find reasonable rates. Kinchen said prices have gone up sharply, nearly doubling since last year.
“The direct correlation is natural gas setting that marginal price unit and causing prices to double,” said Kinchen. “Say we get to an event and we need large amounts of natural gas. We can only pull so much out of production. A lot of that has to come out of storage. As you can imagine, when you get to these very brief periods of high demand, having that sitting there in storage ready to go has a lot of value. When that number’s not sitting there in storage, it has to come out of production.”
As the south and west portions of the US are hit with an early heat wave this June, demand, and therefore prices, are already spiking, at a time where Americans are already dealing with steep inflation and high gas prices. Kinchen said there may be relief in the next eight to ten months, but this is uncertain, as gas prices can be tied to geopolitical events.
Reliability is a growing concern, too. Demand hit a seasonal record of 69,150 MW during the winter storm, and the Texas grid did not have enough reserve power to deliver, leading to widespread blackouts.
The problem lies in deregulated markets, as Utility Dive editor Paul Griffin wrote, “The power system in Texas wasn’t really designed to deliver power to customers. It was designed to deliver revenue to the patchwork quilt of companies that choose to participate in its marketplace. Companies that could disappear in a year. Companies that collect bills from customers, but have no obligation to restore downed power lines, because someone else owns them.”
Griffin said this model opens the door for energy producers and suppliers to cut corners, like not winterizing equipment or running proper reliability tests for reserve power.
The winter storm Uri was described as a “tail event,” but extreme weather is becoming increasingly common. At the RE+ conference in San Antonio, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said, “The past as a model for the future is not true anymore. One hundred-year storms occur every five years. What is normal? What is baseline?”
The panel Hopper led at RE+ on the ERCOT grid shared that 40,000 power outage events occurred in the US last year. That is a 50% year-over-year increase over 2020. As electrification of homes and vehicles continues, demand will only increase, putting greater strain on the grid and on residents’ wallets.
Solar for clarity
In this web of complexity, residential rooftop solar can offer some clarity to Texas homeowners. Even if the system cannot meet 100% of a home’s energy needs, the demand that is supplied by solar will provide a clear, transparent look ahead for the next 20-25 years of electricity bills. There are no re-negotiations every several months, and on day one a customer is shown the exact amount of what they will pay for their system for the entirety of the contract. 
As Kinchen noted, rates have nearly doubled since summer of 2021. Where will ERCOT rates be in 25 years?
Historically, people have benefitted from adopting solar early, but savings can vary based on the suitability of the roof, the energy needs of the home, and other factors. Homeowners interested in solar should gather at least three customized quotes that are designed for their needs to understand the opportunity available. EnergySage and SolarReviews’ Solar Calculator can be a good place to begin your research.
As an example, we return to the “lowest” available contract on the REP shopping website from Frontier Utilities. At an average rate of $.19/kWh for 1000kWh, that is $190 per month. Add in the TDU energy charges and the rate is $.228/kWh and a monthly bill of $228. Paid 12 months of the year for 25 years, and the total cost of power would be $68,400.
Based on an average solar irradiance during peak sun hours of 4 kWh/m2/day, this same energy usage of 1000kWh a month would need an 8 kW system to meet its needs. Many locations in Texas receive significantly more sunlight than this example.
According to EnergySage, an 8kW solar system averages $15,925 after incentives in Texas. Financing rates often range from 3% to 7% for an array. Assuming the highest incentive rate of 7%, loan payments would average $112 per month, and the total amount paid over the 25 years would be $33,768.
So, assuming that grid rates stay flat for 25 years, staying with the status quo would cost $68,400, while paying for a solar array that produces the same 1,000 kWh a month would cost $33,768 under highly conservative assumptions.
It’s safe to say that electricity rates will continue to follow historical trends and rise in the future, so securing a rate for long-term clarity may be one of the best reasons to install residential solar.
In the next edition of this series, pv magazine will follow up with analysis of solar and battery storage, and how the technologies benefit both homeowners and the grid at large.

The Module HC 108M is made with 108 half-cut 182 mm mono PERC cells and features a power output ranging from 400 to 410 W. It also shows a power conversion efficiency of just under 21%.
The panel’s temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius, with an operation temperature range from -40°F to roughly 180°F. The module is designed for wind loads up to 2,400 pascals and snow loads of up to 5,400 pascals. For the module, Solarever offers a 12-year product warranty and a 25-year linear power warranty. The panels are said to be able to operate at roughly 85% of their original performance at the end of the warranty period.
According to Solarever, the company opted to switch from its previous module design of 60 half-cut 166mm cells to 108 half-cut 182 mm mono PERC cells in order to reduce overall PV system cost and maximize the wattage output per module.
The panels are all-black in appearance, a design choice that the company says was pursued to match the color of residential roofs. The modules can also be used in commercial and industrial applications, but the output is 5-10W lower due to reflections cause by typically lighter-colored commercial roofs and the higher operating temperatures related to light reflected by these lighter roofs.
In addition to launching the company’s new module series, Solarever also recently announced plans to increase its production capacity from 500 MW to 1 GW at its factory in Tecomán, southwestern Mexico. Solarever also operates plants in Tepei del Río, in the state of Hidalgo, where the company is based, and in Irapuato, in the state of Guanajuato.
The company recently signed agreements with the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the Autonomous Metropolitan University to build an R&D center for the development of solar, EV and storage technologies and plans to expand into the EV market.
Solarever’s modules have been distributed throughout the U.S. since 2015, but the company is looking to strengthen its position as a North American tier-1 manufacturer and increase its American market presence.
The company also shared with pv magazine USA that it is in the early stages of research into developing modules with emerging TOPCon and HJT solar cells, but any products utilizing those technologies would still be a few years out.
