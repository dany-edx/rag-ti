While there have been bumps along the road, the inevitable energy transition, boosted by the emergence of mission-driven investing, has attracted “an unprecedented wave of investment”, said Andrew Redinger, Managing Director and Group Head of Utility, Power & Renewable Energy for KeyBanc Capital Markets, in a white paper.
Bloomberg NEF reports that global investment in renewables totaled $226 billion in the first half of 2022, an increase of 11% year-over-year from 1H 2021. Redinger discussed this growth at the 2022 RE+ conference in Long Beach, California.
Redinger said KeyBanc has long been involved in renewables, giving it an early foothold in a rapidly evolving industry. Under his leadership over the last two decades, KeyBanc has committed more than $12.3 billion to renewable energy clients, and has financed a cumulative capacity of 43 GW of capacity.
“We bank most of North America’s investor-owned utility companies, and have been doing so since the late 1990s,” said Redinger. “In 2007, we saw that renewable energy was coming on like a freight train as an opportunity that could complement our core business.”
In the last 24 months, the KeyBanc director said renewable energy in the institutional investment world has gone “from niche to mainstream.”
One sign of this mainstream nature is an increase in competition in the sector. Redinger said when KeyBanc got started in the space, developers wouldn’t approach the bank until they were ready to put a shovel in the ground. Now, they’re approaching banks months or even years before breaking ground for construction.
“That’s just a natural maturation of the industry – as more capital has come in, capital providers have to be more aggressive to win deals, and that means lending earlier and earlier,” said Redinger.
Renewable energy investment has evolved from the “Yieldco” financing era of the mid 2010s. At the time, the industry was ready to take another step forward, but was held back by a lack of capital. A solution that emerged was a structure that allowed developers to put assets in a C-Corporation and then attract investors looking for a yielding product.
However, this model did not lead to long term buy-and-hold investors. Hedge funds snapped up these assets, and when “clouds appeared on the horizon” they sold, and the market collapsed.
Redinger said the profile of investors is different now, though, and he expects a much better reaction from equity markets. “This new batch of IPOs won’t be dividend-paying entities, they’ll be buying and holding renewable assets with a tremendous amount of growth potential. So, they’ll be growth vehicles versus yield vehicles,” he said.
The Inflation Reduction Act is expected to further supercharge renewables investment, which Redinger said was already so red-hot that it was not necessary in his view. He likened the $369 billion package to throwing gasoline on a roaring bonfire. Regardless, he said tax credits will help accelerate renewables procurement, which has now doubled 2030 projections following the legislation.
While project-based financing has carried the torch for the energy transition, Redinger said he sees a new massive source of capital opening to the industry. Once potential source is the multi-trillion-dollar Term Loan B marketplace.
“That marketplace tends to lever these deals up more than banks, they tend to be less restrictive and, I think, that will end up being a better source of capital for renewables,” said Redinger.
Redinger admits that there may be more bumps on the road for the renewables sector as the U.S. navigates supply chain constraints and grid interconnection issues, but the long arc looks very promising for the industry.
“There is so much incentive now to go out and get these projects built and operating,” he said. “We may hit a couple of speed bumps here in the near term, but we’re going to figure it out.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/03/solar-field-robot-mower-receives-solv-energy-seed-funds/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 3, 2023",Solar field robot mower receives SOLV Energy seed funds,"Swap Robotics, an operator of a robotics-as-a-service vegetation management system, has received $7 million in seed funds from leading U.S. utility-scale solar developer SOLV Energy to scale its business.
The service features a fully autonomous battery-powered mower that manages vegetation height to minimize shading on a solar array. The modular design allows for easy battery swapping, and the device can be outfitted with other attachments like snowplows.
The startup company charges its customers through a subscription based model, pricing based on frequency and terrain type. Swap said it has $9 million in contracts lined up for the next three years.
The robots can work 8- to 12-hour shifts, with the ability to do 24/7 operations with a battery swap, performed by Swap servicers. Each robot has two charging ports and is able to charge fully in two and a half hours. Swap said it aims to achieve 20% vegetation management cost savings from day one.
Swap Robotics projects the solar vegetation management market could reach “tens of billions of dollars” by the 2030s.
To start operations, the company pre-maps the solar project site. Once the robots have mapped out the area, they can run routes autonomously with remote “guardian” oversight. The company said if a robot goes out of service while on the job, it will have a new one working within 90 minutes.
The 5-foot tall robot clocks in at at top mowing speed of 7.5 miles per hour, although it has to operate at half that speed for safe operations. The company offers models with a 48-inch cutting deck and a 60-inch cutting deck. A series of sensors helps the robot avoid obstacles. It slows down if there is a person is detected within 30 feet to 70 feet and it will come to a full stop if a person is within 30 feet. The robot can cut vegetation beneath the array as long as it is raised at least 18 inches off the ground.
“Rough cut” solar vegetation cutting decks on the robot can cut grass down to anywhere from two inches to eight inches. It can cut woody vegetation can be up to 2.5 inches in diameter.
The company says the system is packed full of safety features like visual detection, sensing edges, remote guardians, six built in mechanical emergency-stops (all over the robot that meet ADA height requirements), wireless emergency-stop, two-way audio, back-up beeper, amber revolving lights, signal indicators.
“Driving the development of innovative technology is essential to optimizing our capabilities and preparing our workforce for the influx of new projects in a growing number of states,” said George Hershman, chief executive officer, SOLV Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/03/utility-to-procure-u-s-made-trackers-for-321-mw-texas-solar-project/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 3, 2023",Utility to procure U.S.-made trackers for 321 MW Texas solar project,"Iberdola energy services company Avangrid will use U.S.-manufactured solar trackers for a 321 MW utility-solar project in Falls County, Texas, one of the company’s largest solar facilities under development in the U.S. to date.
Avangrid signed a $30 million order for Array Technologies trackers at the True North solar facility in Texas, which will include safe harbor inventory and newly purchased DuraTrack trackers by Array, according to the Connecticut-based energy services and utility company.
“We are very proud to announce this collaboration with Albuquerque, New Mexico-based Array Technologies,” said Pedro Azagra, chief executive officer of Avangrid. “Projects like True North are crucial to decarbonization and will help the country reach its ambitious clean energy goals and help New Mexico grow industrial green energy jobs.”
Array has been a long-standing supplier to Avangrid and Iberdrola, and the companies anticipate further supply chain growth across Avangrid’s U.S. solar portfolio.
The True North tracker procurement was vital to the final investment decision for the construction of the Texas solar facility, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and situated on 1,907 acres in western Texas.
“Our durable and low maintenance trackers will help provide clean renewable energy for the Texas grid, ensuring the local community has reliable power for years to come,” said said Kevin Hostettler, chief executive officer of Array Technologies.
Solar trackers are a key component of the construction of ground-mounted solar farms used in utility-scale projects, as they allow for the movement of the panel to adjust to the exact location of the sun to optimize the absorption of solar energy throughout the day.
With the purchase of solar trackers and the development of projects like the True North solar farm, Avangrid continues to expand the development of renewable energy projects across Texas.  The company currently generates more than 1.25 GW across six wind farms and manages a 1.3 GW project pipeline.
In an April 2022 permitting application submitted to the Texas Comptroller, the utility listed that it was evaluating Longi solar panels and Power Electronics inverters for use on the True North project. Baker Botts represented Avangrid in permitting of the project.
Texas is one of 24 U.S. states where Avangrid has developed solar and wind farm facilities, delivering close to 8.5 GW of renewable energy to the U.S. power grid, enough to power about 2.8 million home with clean energy.
Under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act, the federal government created an Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (PTC) that can be claimed for the domestic production and sale of qualifying solar, wind and battery components, such as solar cells and tracking hardware produced on U.S. soil.  The 45X PTC provides a $0.87 per kilogram credit for torque tubing components made by U.S. manufacturers and $2.28/kg for structural fasteners used on renewable energy projects, among other various PTC incentives for U.S. components.
Across each solar installation category, Wood Mackenzie has forecast 5.1 GW (dc) of solar systems will come online in Texas in 2023, of which 4.4 GW (dc) or 86% of will come from utility-scale projects, Matthew Sahd, a research analyst in Wood Mackenzie’s Energy Transition group told pv magazine USA.
Most of Texas’ new solar capacity is being built at the utility-scale, with a large band of projects occupying the drier, sunnier western half of the state. While this region benefits from cheaper land and more solar irradiance, it comes with some challenges. Delivering electricity generated in the west to the high-population centers in the east requires substantial transmission capacity. Currently, the Lone Star state is dealing with growing pains of large projects “leapfrogging” interconnection queues, leading to grid congestion, reliability issues, renewables curtailment, and high costs from “congestion rent.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/03/louisiana-utility-seeks-approval-for-225-mw-project-construction/,"MARKETS,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,LOUISIANA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 3, 2023",Louisiana utility seeks approval for 225 MW project construction,"Louisiana’s largest utility has filed a request for approval of two utility solar projects that can bring the southern state up to pace with its neighbors in the region by doubling its solar output. Earlier this week Entergy Louisiana filed a request from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to approve the purchase, construction and operation of 225 MW of solar projects.
With just 216 MW of solar in the Pelican State, its Fortune 500 utility company could catapult Louisiana back into line with other southern states with 441 MW of aggregate solar resources.
Entergy Louisiana selected an Iberville Parish solar facility at 175 MW and a second facility with 49 MW of total capacity, the Sterlington Solar Facility in Ouachita Parish, to add to the state’s clean energy mix. If approved, the utility will be able to increase its renewable portfolio and help meet the growing demand for clean generation.
For the developments, Entergy entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Coastal Prairie Solar, a NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary, for the power produced from the Iberville Parish project. Entergy will build and operate the Sterlington facility in Ouachita Parish.
If approved, construction on the Iberville project will begin in the spring of 2024, with commercial operations on track for late 2025. The Sterlington facility will follow Iberville and is expected to begin delivering clean power into the grid by early 2026.
The utility solar proposal also includes a request for authorization to include the new projects into Louisiana’s recently approved green tariff Geaux Green Option, or Rider GGO. This is a voluntary program that allows Entergy residential and commercial customers the opportunity to subscribe to renewable energy resources across its Louisiana region. Adding the 225 MW of solar generation to the Rider GGO resource portfolio will further enable Entergy customers to meet their environmental and sustainability goals.
The Geaux Green program will include the two new solar projects (225 MW) combined with 475 MW of solar generating capacity in various stages of development:  Elizabeth (125 MW, Allen Parish), Sunlight Road (50 MW, Washington Parish), Jacques (150 MW, St. James Parish) and Vacherie Solar Energy Center (150 MW, St. James Parish) projects.
Entergy customers can be billed in one of three ways under the Geaux Green program:
The Geaux Green pricing is subject to change, as under the terms of the commission-approved settlement in Docket# U-36190, Entergy Louisiana will submit a final Rider GGO pricing update in Q3 2023, prior to the operational date of the first clean energy resources in the GGO portfolio.
Once final pricing is shared under the Rider GGO, Entergy customers will be asked to sign an amendment to their electric service agreement which will serve as a binding, one-year commitment to the Geaux Green subscription program.
Commercial and industrial customers can also subscribe to Geaux Green, under which the utility has issued a 50 MW cap per customer.
The Louisiana PSC in September 2022 approved Entergy’s initial 475 MW solar portfolio as part of the Geaux Green program, and also approved the solar subscription and green tariff program itself.
In June 2022, Entergy Corp. discussed plans for generating up to 7 GW of renewable resources by the end of 2025, and as much as 14 to 17 GW of renewable resources by the end of 2031.
Entergy’s multi-state renewable generation portfolio consists of 1.93 GW of solar projects set to enter commercial operations by 2025, with an additional 6.8 GW of solar and wind assets to be deployed through 2027, according to a late 2022 generation mix chart. The utility operates 300 MW of biomass, waste heat and hydroelectric generation assets.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/03/u-s-needs-47000-more-gw-miles-of-transmission-by-2035-for-a-cleaner-grid/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 3, 2023","U.S. needs 47,000 more GW-miles of transmission by 2035 for a cleaner grid","The U.S. will need 47,000 GW-miles of new transmission by 2035, assuming moderate load and high clean energy assumptions “in line with the future power sector enabled by all currently enacted laws,” according to recent modeling studies reviewed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).
That finding, representing 57% growth over the current level of transmission, is the median of model results from several capacity expansion modeling studies completed since 2020, and is presented in DOE’s draft report titled “National Transmission Needs Study.”
The DOE reported the median modeled amounts of transmission that will be needed in 9 of 13 geographic regions across the continental U.S., under both moderate and high clean energy scenarios, with the four remaining regions having adequate transmission. Under the high clean energy scenario, an additional 120 GW of “transfer capacity” between regions will be needed to achieve cost savings and reliability benefits “as clean energy deployment increases to over 80% annual generation,” DOE said.
The department said it will consider the report, once finalized, as an input to a separate process to potentially designate “National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors” under the Federal Power Act.
Draft findings of a separate “National Transmission Planning Study,” released by DOE last fall, modeled the added transmission needed to reach 100% clean electricity by 2035—a scenario selected as the core modeling assumption of that study. Preliminary findings showed that the highest density of needed transmission additions would connect the “wind belt” in the central U.S. with eastern demand centers.
In the draft transmission needs report just released, the DOE said that more than 1,400 GW of proposed generating capacity, mostly solar, wind, and storage, was “sitting in clogged interconnection queues” at the end of 2021. The “enormous amount” of renewables and storage in the interconnection queues “demonstrates that market and economic trends will lead to continued shifts in the nation’s resource mix, requiring a different approach to transmission planning and development,” it said.
Two other “key indicators” that more transmission is needed, the DOE said, are interregional wholesale electricity price differentials showing that lower-cost power cannot reach higher-cost areas, and that transmission investments nationwide have steadily declined since 2015.
Regarding non-wire alternatives, the report says that “strategically placed” generation near load centers, grid-enhancing technologies, energy storage and distributed energy resources could help lower the need for new transmission infrastructure. The DOE noted there is “some inclusion” of these solutions in the capacity expansion modeling results that it analyzed. The report does not mention flexible demand as a means to increase transmission utilization and reduce the need for new transmission.
The DOE invites comments on its draft report, titled the “National Transmission Needs Study,” with an upcoming webinar on the report scheduled for March 3, 1:30 p.m. EST.

Fund 8 consists of nearly 30 MW of community solar projects in California and New York.
The financing partners have supported Renewable Properties’ local renewable energy projects in 15 states across the U.S. by continuing to commit additional capital.
In addition to supporting renewable energy projects, funds managed by project lender AB CarVal, an alternative investment manager, invested $60 million to support the expansion of Renewable Properties’ portfolio. The capital allowed Renewable Properties to further develop its existing community solar pipeline, expand development efforts into new and existing markets, and secure new project opportunities and acquisitions.
Fund 8 is Renewable Properties’ fourth tax equity fund partnership with Nelnet, a tax equity partner that also has a solar engineering, procurement, and construction business. Totaling nearly 30 MW, the projects are expected to produce enough energy to power 4,438 homes per year and offset 35,246 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
The California projects total 11.5 MW and are located in Madera County, with the Avenue 26 Solar Phase I & II projects expected to commence construction in Q2 2023 and completed by the end of the year. The company reports the projects are expected to produce enough energy to power 2,004 homes per year and offset 15,910 tons of CO2 per year.
The California projects are part of the state’s Disadvantaged Communities Green Tariff program, which is designed to promote community solar in disadvantaged communities as identified by CalEnviroScreen, a mapping tool that helps identify California communities that are most affected by pollution. The tool uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores for every census tract in the state, and the scores are mapped so that different communities can be compared.
Fund 8’s New York projects are in various stages of development. The Slayton Settlement Solar A and Slayton Settlement Solar B projects in Lockport, N.Y. began construction at the end of 2022 and are expected to be online in October this year. Two projects in Batavia, N.Y. will begin construction by May 2023 and are expected to be finished by the end of the year. The third project, Clemons Road Solar, is located in Minoa, N.Y. and will commence construction in April and is expected to be operational by the end of the year. Combined, the 18.4 MW from New York projects are expected to produce enough energy per year to power 2434 homes and offset 19,336 tons of CO2.
Founded in 2017, Renewable Properties specializes in developing and investing in small-scale utility, community solar and energy storage projects. The company currently has over 700 MW of solar under development with just over 115 MW in construction or operation. In December 2022, the company announced the expansion of its Maine portfolio with a third tranche of projects acquired from NextGrid, bringing its total Maine portfolio to over 42 MW of community solar projects in various stages of development, construction, and operation.
Prior to Renewable Properties, founder and president Aaron Halimi was Senior Vice President of solar at Gardner Capital, and before that worked at Borrego Solar and in various real estate roles, as a licensed CA Real Estate Broker and LEED Accredited Professional.
Renewable Properties has also acquired over 100 MW that is either under construction or in operation.

Allume Energy, RENU Communities, and ESA Solar announced the successful commissioning of a solar installation that will generate renewable electricity for the 296-unit apartment complex, Canopy Apartment Villas. The 165 kW DC rooftop solar was installed in two phases on 12 buildings.
ESA Solar designed and developed the entire project and served as installer on phase 1. Local installer Castaways completed phase 2.
The system uses the SolShare technology, which enables residents in 65 of the apartment units to subscribe to a portion of the solar energy produced on the roof, offsetting the cost of their individual electricity bills.

SolShare is hardware developed by Australian-born, California-based Allume Energy, and is designed specifically for sharing rooftop solar to apartments without requiring tenants to sign up for additional billing services or solar trading platforms. It sits behind the meter and logs the amount of solar delivered to each apartment and, over the course of each month, ensures that the connected units each receive the same amount of solar.
The solar project at Canopy is the first asset within the recently announced environmental, social, and  governance (ESG)-centric venture between Taurus Investment Holdings, LLC and Aegon Asset Management. Using RENU, Taurus’ sustainable retrofit subsidiary, the partnership will acquire multifamily assets with the goal of reducing the energy consumption and carbon output of those assets. RENU aims to deliver clean energy retrofits to existing real estate assets.
The installation at Canopy will contribute to the City of Orlando’s goal of generating net-zero energy by 2050, which was set in 2017. The Orlando Utilities Commission worked with Allume, RENU and ESA Solar to review and ensure this first-of-its-kind system for Florida met its interconnection and safety requirements.
“Because Orlando is one of the fastest growing cities in Florida, it needs to develop affordable housing solutions that also prioritize energy efficiency and sustainability,” said Morgan Brawner, ESA Solar’s vice president of business development.
By 2025, the Orlando Utilities Commission’s (OUC) solar energy capacity is projected to produce 496 MW of renewable energy, enough for 90,000 Floridian homes. The OUC has committed $420 million to increasing its solar generating capacity, which will include the opening of two, 74.5 MW solar farms in 2024, according to a December news release.
