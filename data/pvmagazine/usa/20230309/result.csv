Speaking during the American Council on Renewable Energy’s (ACORE) 2023 Policy Forum, held today in Washington, D.C., three renewables corporate executives and an industry banker shared their prognostications for how soon we should expect to see tax credit and equity transferability occur, as well as a wishlist of IRA policy items they would like to receive Internal Revenue Service guidance on this year versus next.
During a morning keynote session with John Podesta, Senior Advisor to President Biden for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation at the White House, the senior energy official said the sweeping IRA legislation will require 18 to 24 months to implement and transfer tax credits.
Seth Hanlon, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax and Climate Policy at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, reiterated Podesta’s timeframe, saying that while the treasury is hopeful to provide more guidance on tax transferability this year, the treasury is first focused on stakeholder feedback before it establishes a statutory deadline adherence and getting the IRS into a timeframe, which could take us into 2024.
During a conference panel titled “Paving the Road for Successful IRA Implementation,” Urvi Parekh, head of renewable energy at Meta, said the global social media company is planning a two to five-year plan on how to factor in IRA provisions, as the company looks to unlock new systems to implement into its net zero by 2030 agenda.
When asked by moderater Jose Zayas of ACORE to prioritize items that panelists would like to hear immediate guidance on from the IRS, Jack Thirolf, head of public policy and institutional affairs for Enel North America, said guidance on domestic content procurement and sourcing, as well as the energy communities adder would be two items his firm hopes to hear about first.
In November 2022, Enel North America affiliate 3Sun USA revealed official plans to build a 3 GW bifacial solar module and cell manufacturing facility in the U.S., becoming an early entrant into the onshoring of domestic PV panel production from the global arena. The facility is expected to create 1,500 clean energy jobs with production from the facility commencing in late 2024.
Chrissy Borskey, executive director of global government affairs and policy, GE Renewable Energy, said the domestic content adder, advanced manufacturing tax credits under Sec. 45X, and additional clarity on prevailing wages and apprenticeships are priority items for her group.  For prevailing wages and apprenticeships, GE anticipates reporting on this by Q3 2023, so fast-tracking by the IRS is a key focus for the seamless rollout of IRA incentives, she added.
Ray Wood, managing director and head of global natural resources and energy transition at Bank of America said, “Ambiguity is monumental right now” without full guidance on transferability.  “Ambiguity on long-term infrastructure assets gets priced into project finance,” he added, meaning clean energy deals are priced with ongoing uncertainty from the IRA incentives.
When asked about emerging technologies that could benefit from IRA incentives coming due, GE’s Borskey said the industrial giant’s offshore wind group is receiving vast amounts of inquiries for project developments stretching from the Northeast and MidAtlantic region down to Louisiana.
Enel’s Thirolf said his firm will be doing “gigawatts of battery storage” in the coming years, while the Standalone Storage ITC from the IRA can’t be overlooked for grid-scale and distributed generation project development.
Asked about tax equity and the project finance market, Bank of America’s Wood said the IRA should “institutionalize the project finance market” for the long-term, while a challenge to the tax equity market for ages has been the just three or four household name investors participating in tax equity deals. With tax credit transferability coming due under the IRA, Wood expects new entrants to emerge in the tax equity finance market to create a larger capital pool.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/09/silfab-solar-raises-125-million-for-u-s-cell-and-module-manufacturing/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 9, 2023",Silfab Solar raises $125 million for U.S. cell and module manufacturing,"Silfab Solar, a North American solar module manufacturer with facilities in Washington state and Toronto, Canada, announced a new round of funding led by ARC Financial Corp. The $125 million investment is expected to help Silfab expand its facilities and launch a third cell and module fabrication in the United States. 
Silfab’s third facility, a 1 GW cell production and 1.2 GW module assembly plant, is expected to reach operations in 2024. The site is expected to create over 800 U.S. jobs. Details on the facility site location will be shared at a later date. 
The cell production capacity addresses a critical solar module value chain constraint for U.S.-based solar manufacturing. Read more about the current state of the U.S. solar value chain here. 
“Silfab has grown more than 40 percent since ARC’s initial support,” said Paolo Maccario, chief executive officer, Silfab. “Our growth means more solar jobs for America and reliable energy that customers will use to reduce both costs and their carbon footprint.” 
The funding round was led by ARC’s Fund 9 and included co-investments from Manulife Financial Corporation, Ontario Power Generation Inc. Pension Plan, CF Private Equity and BDC Capital’s Cleantech Practice. The investment marks ARC’s “continued confidence” in Silfab’s 40 years of experience in the solar industry. 
“Silfab is ideally situated to meet North America’s growing appetite for domestically manufactured cutting-edge solar products. ARC remains confident that Silfab will be a driver in clean tech manufacturing and U.S. engineered product innovation,” said Brian Boulanger, CEO of ARC. 
ARC’s first investment in the company, which took place in September 2021, totaled $100 million. It enabled Silfab to expand its existing Washington facility and make improvements to its production lines. 
In February, Silfab announced a new series of solar modules with innovative conductive backsheets. The Elite Series includes the Elite 410 BG, a proprietary x-pattern module that combines an integrated cell design with a conductive backsheet, leading to gains in efficiency and power.  
The module provides 410 W, a module efficiency of 21.4%, and a max system voltage of 1000 Vdc.

The mono-PERC module measures 73.4 x 40.5  x 1.4 inches and weighs about 45 lbs. It is rated to handle a maximum surface load for wind and snow of 112.8 lbs. per square foot and a 1-inch hail impact resistance of 52 mph. 
The frame is an anodized aluminum black frame, and it contains a multilayer, integrated insulation film and electrically conductive backsheet with strong demonstrated hydrolysis and UV resistance. 
The product comes with a 25-year product workmanship warranty and a 30-year linear power performance guarantee. Performance is guaranteed at ≥ 97.1% at the end of year one, ≥ 91.6% by the end of year 12, and ≥ 82.6% at the end of year 30. 
“With its all-black sleek look, Elite provides the aesthetics homeowners have been looking for,” said Paolo Maccario, chief executive officer, Silfab.
Maccario said the modules are a result of the company’s 40-year record of technological and engineering experience. “Elite puts American solar products back on top,” he said.
Each Silfab production facility features multiple automated ISO 9001-2015 quality certified production lines. The company operates just-in-time manufacturing to deliver Buy American approved PV modules designed for the North American market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/09/topcon-shingle-solar-cell-achieves-22-0-efficiency-via-thermal-laser-separation/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 9, 2023",TOPCon shingle solar cell achieves 22.0% efficiency via thermal laser separation,"From pv magazine global
Scientists from Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and U.S.-based solar panel maker Solaria have developed a solar cell based on TOPCon technology and shingle design.
“To our best knowledge, this is the first publication dealing with TOPCon shingle solar cells separated by thermal laser separation (TLS) and edge-passivated by the passivated edge technology (PET),” researcher Elmar Lohmüller told pv magazine. “The PET is a proprietary development of Fraunhofer ISE, to address the cutting losses in today‘s half-cut, third-cut, or shingle solar cells, by simple, high-throughput post-processing of singulated cells.”
Fraunhofer ISE filed a patent application back in 2018 and is offering a sampling of the technology for interested partners. Solaria is one of the first industry partners testing post-metallization PET on TOPCon shingle solar cells.
“The PET approach could address a key need of the industry – to mitigate efficiency losses incurred by cell cutting and do so in a cost-effective way,” Ricky Dunbar, a Solaria spokesperson, told pv magazine. “Our cooperation with Fraunhofer ISE has shown that PET can effectively reduce these losses for TOPCon shingle cells at a promising throughput.”
The proposed manufacturing process uses thermal laser separation (TLS) instead of conventional laser scribing and mechanical cleaving (LSMC) for cell singulation. TLS only requires a short initial laser scribe with a cleave laser and water-air aerosol jet to create a starting crack that can then propagate through the wafer in any direction.
“This results in cuts with very smooth edge surfaces,” the scientists explained, noting that TLS was performed via the microDICE laser system developed by Germany’s 3D-Micromac.
“The TLS process optimized in this work yields up to 0.2% more efficient shingle cells directly after separation in comparison with shingle cells that have been singulated by LSMC,” the academics said, noting that the cell based on TLS achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.0% “It is shown that TLS can be performed such that no degradation of the surface passivation quality occurs in the vicinity to the dividing line.”
The research team introduced its findings in “TOPCon shingle solar cells: Thermal laser separation and passivated edge technology,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“As we are still in the development phase of an industrial PET tool, valid data for yield ratios of the two approaches for a reliable cost calculation is not sufficiently available, yet,” Lohmüller said. “Nevertheless, PET will add a process step, which to our current knowledge is easily scalable to current throughput demands, thus the demonstrated gain in efficiency has substantial potential to overcompensate the additional cost.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/09/pjm-projects-48-to-94-gw-of-renewables-will-be-built-in-the-grid-region-by-2030/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 9, 2023",PJM projects 48 to 94 GW of renewables will be built in the grid region by 2030,"The grid operator PJM projects that 48 GW of solar and wind capacity will be added across the 13-state grid region by 2030 in a “low” scenario. That amount would be “insufficient to keep up with” expected generator retirements and demand growth, PJM said.
In a “high” scenario, PJM projects 94 GW of added solar and wind capacity by 2030, plus 9 GW of added gas capacity, saying that at these levels, “resource adequacy would be maintained.” PJM presented both scenarios in a report forecasting resource adequacy and reliability, as the PJM grid’s generating mix changes.
PJM’s analysis was questioned by Elise Caplan, vice president of regulatory affairs for renewables trade group ACORE, and Ric O’Connell, executive director of the consultancy GridLab.
Caplan questioned PJM’s projection of future renewables growth in the grid region based on what PJM termed a “historical rate of completion” of about 5% for renewables projects, “from queue to steel in the ground.”
That historical pattern, Caplan said, is “highly unlikely to continue due to the interconnection queue reforms that PJM is implementing and new federal incentives through the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which are likely to accelerate the rate of renewable and storage development.”
“ACORE is pleased,” Caplan added, that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips has announced a forum to discuss the PJM capacity market, “which will provide an opportunity to address in-depth” the rate of renewable and storage development, as well as the “poor performance” of thermal resources during extreme weather events and “the reliability benefits of transmission expansion.”
O’Connell said in a Twitter thread that “PJM asserts that it can’t get projects online fast enough to meet a forecast resource adequacy gap. The tone of the report implies this is an external problem,” yet hundreds of gigawatts of projects “are waiting in a queue that PJM has shut down.”
“PJM is wholly in charge of planning the network backbone that could bring enough generation online to meet the 2030 needs,” he continued. “It could be proactively doing that planning, instead of using past performance to worry about the future.”
“The take-away of this report should not be ‘oh, no, we can’t get enough online in time,’” he said.  “It should be ‘what do we need to do to get all this clean energy waiting in the queue online so we can meet our future needs?’”
PJM’s queue and progress
PJM now has 290 GW of renewables projects waiting in its interconnection queue, it said in its report. That’s an increase from year-end 2021, when the queue included about 150 GW of solar projects, 40 GW of wind projects, and 50 GW of storage projects, as shown in the nearby image from Berkeley Lab. PJM’s queue is currently closed to new projects.

Responding to a question about its interconnection queue progress, PJM said that in 2022 it issued to project developers either a final Interconnection Service Agreement or a Wholesale Market Participation Agreement for a total of 9.6 GW of solar projects, 1.3 GW of solar-plus-storage projects, and 0.6 GW of storage projects.
Under the first type of agreement, a project developer would commit to pay for, and transmission owners would commit to build, the transmission system upgrades needed to connect the project to the grid. The second type of agreement allows the owner of a project connected to the distribution grid to sell energy and/or capacity into the PJM markets.
In comparison to PJM’s combined data for projects seeking interconnection and projects already connected to the distribution grid, ERCOT, the fastest-moving regional grid operator in the U.S., completed final facilities studies for 15 GW of solar projects last year, although it is less than half the size of PJM.
All 13 states in the PJM grid region have called for PJM to make faster progress on interconnection.
In a story for the New York Times, reporter Brad Plumer quoted a PJM system planner who said PJM faces the challenge of a limited number of power engineers capable of conducting interconnection studies—a concern that has also been raised by two other grid operators.
PJM Interconnection is a regional transmission organization that serves approximately 65 million people in 13 states and the District of Columbia. PJM’s report is titled “Energy transition in PJM: Resource retirements, replacements and risks.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/09/50-states-of-solar-incentives-iowa/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,IOWA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 9, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Iowa,"In Iowa, through the end of 2022 the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports 658 MW of installed solar capacity to date. This is enough clean energy to power over 80,000 homes.
The Hawkeye State was largely a commercial, industrial, and residential solar market until 2020, when utility-scale development took off. Most of the solar capacity in the state was installed across three recent landmark utility-scale years of 2020 through 2022.
While only about 1% of the state’s electricity comes from solar, nearly 60% of Iowa’s energy mix is sourced from wind power, according to the Iowa Environmental Council (IEC).
SEIA forecasts Iowa to add another 1.5 GW of solar over the next five years, ranking it 33rd among U.S. states in terms of capacity. Meanwhile, the IEC projects the total cumulative wind capacity in Iowa will reach 14 GW by 2024.
Incentives
While Iowa doesn’t have a state-mandated net metering law, some utilities have offered it. Net metering involves the crediting of a customer bill for sending excess solar production to the electric grid.
MidAmerican Energy, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy utility, and Interstate Power & Light, an Alliant Energy utility company, do not participate in net metering, but do offer a bill credit based on 15-minute energy inflow and outflow intervals.
Iowa also offers solar easement and access rights laws that help ensure a consumer installation won’t be covered by shade. Some municipalities in Iowa also have provisions to prevent homeowners associations from blocking a solar installation, according to EnergySage.
Like most states in the U.S., solar is property tax exempt in Iowa. While Zillow modeled that purchased solar arrays can raise a home’s value by 4%, that additional assessed value won’t be assessed for property taxes. Iowa also has a sales tax exemption for electric generating equipment, so solar array purchasers will be exempt from the 6% state sales tax.
Like all states in the U.S., Iowa solar installations are eligible for the solar Investment Tax Credit, a direct-paid credit that covers 30% of installed system costs.
Iowa used to have a state tax credit for solar, though it has been phased out. The credit was 15% from 2016 to 2019, phasing down to 0% for systems installed after June 2022. The credit was capped at $5,000 per installation.
The state’s tax credit program has led to $15 million in credits paid over the last ten years, and private investment averaging $5 million per year in the state. About 4,600 Iowa homeowners have received credits.
In March 2022, Iowa Senator Dan Zumbach (R-Des Moines) submitted legislation that could dictate to landowners that they are forbidden from leasing their land for commercial solar use, even if their soil meets a minimum ‘corn suitability rating.’ 
Notable installation
The Hawkeye Solar Project received approval for electric generating certificates from the Iowa Utilities Board in October 2022. The 200 MW utility solar project is expected to produce enough power for 50,000 homes. Ranger Power is the developer of the 1,500-acre solar project. Construction of the project generated an estimated 200 jobs. The carbon offset is equivalent projected to reach the equivalent of taking nearly 100,000 cars off the road.
Upon approval, Hawkeye’s developer pegged commencing construction for the fourth quarter of 2022 or the first quarter of 2023, with a projected commercial operation date in the fourth quarter of 2024. Located near Grand Mound, Iowa, the project represents a $250 million capital investment into the local community and is expected to generate over $12 million in new tax revenues to the county. Tax funds are expected to be allocated as 40% towards Clinton County infrastructure and public services, 50% to school districts, and 10% to local townships and agricultural extensions.
As part of the land leasing agreement, the owner-operator of the project is required to return the land to its pre-existing condition following decommissioning of the project. There will be a decommissioning bond, or money set aside, to ensure that funds are available to take care of restoration obligations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/09/volatile-electricity-markets-should-give-solar-financial-modelers-pause/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,NEW HAMPSHIRE,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 9, 2023",Volatile electricity markets should give solar financial modelers pause,"As we learned in 2022, the price of natural gas in Germany is a major influence on residential solar power sales in the United States. And due to the unpredictable nature of these prices, solar sales people choosing which escalators to put into their proposals would be wise to consult with history.
There is significant evidence that the war in Europe had been driving residential solar sales in both the United States and Europe. Electricity prices across the United States increased in part due to the war. This was partially enabled by the newly expanding natural gas export market, which has exposed U.S. consumers to more expensive international pricing.

Ohm Analytics shared data with pv magazine USA that shows that some of the states with the highest rates of electricity price increases – Massachusetts and New Hampshire – also had some of the largest growth in solar installations. New Hampshire’s electricity supply rates doubled, and saw a 380% increase in residential solar demand.
For now, the natural gas price increases of several hundred percent have burned out, challenging the salespeople who do the financial modeling of solar proposals with an increasingly volatile new reality.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects that gas usage in the first quarter of 2023 will be the lowest it’s been since 2018, due to warmer weather this winter. This, along with the international gas market calming, has led the EIA to project that the price of wholesale natural gas will fall to roughly half of the average price paid in 2022. 

Some electricity generators have started adjusting their pricing. Rhode Island Energy says they may drop the supply side prices of electricity more than 25% for residential customers, along with small and mid-sized commercial customers, starting April 1, 2023. This announcement follows the Massachusetts Public Utility Commission’s approval of winter gas price decreases in early February.
According to U.S. Government data, the average US electricity pricing increased by 14% in 2022.
This whipsaw will affect some solar customers differently. For instance, the pricing changes are affecting how people enroll in the Massachusetts SMART solar program. The SMART program pays out incentives based on a project’s return on investment and the price of electricity. Higher electricity prices produce better returns, and reduce the incentive.

In the Eversource utility region of the south coast of Massachusetts, the incentive is under 2 cents per kilowatt hour, due to the high winter electricity pricing. This somewhat low incentive led some customers to forgo the SMART program and connect without incentives due to fewer hardware requirements and other regional incentives. However, when the price of electricity in Massachusetts drops, and the incentive increases, customers who switched from the SMART program to a pure install will miss out on ten years of increased incentives.
In contrast to dropping electricity prices, there are still a few regions where pricing continues to increase. Florida and California, for example, are both seeking rate increases. Florida is seeking to cover their energy procurement price increases from 2022, while California’s strange winter season drove heavy demand for gas. We should expect to see the rates in these regions fall at some point later this year.
With a variety of market outcomes possible, anyone signing up for solar power right now should take heed of their escalators and starting electricity rates. A number of residential installation companies have been sued for electricity price escalators in their contracts that outpaced the market. For instance, Vivint was sued by the State of New Mexico for a seemingly reasonable 2.9% electricity escalator. That escalator would likely have gone unnoticed if electricity prices had increased through the end of the 2010s, as they had in the prior decade.
Going forward, bullish escalators might still be the right choice, but long term natural gas pricing presents a dilemma. Almost all demand growth for the fuel in the United States has been a direct result of increased natural gas exports. Exports were clearly the reason for price increases in 2022. And after becoming the world’s top exporter of natural gas in 2022, the United States is expected to continue increasing exports of the fuel.
With ongoing warfare, continued global growth in energy demand, and an energy transition underway, the only thing we can expect is change.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/09/tariff-investigation-equipment-detainments-lead-to-16-drop-in-new-solar-capacity-in-2022/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 9, 2023","Tariff investigation, equipment detainments lead to 16% drop in new solar capacity in 2022","The United States added 20.2 GW of new solar capacity in 2022, down 16% decrease 2021. According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight 2022 Year in Review by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and analyst firm, Wood Mackenzie, this was due in large part to an investigation into new anti-circumvention tariffs by the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as equipment detainments by Customs and Border Protection under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
The decrease is an unfortunate result of these policies, however, it is much less than previously anticipated as SEIA had  previously lowered its solar installation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 by 46%, and SEIA had predicted that the case will result in a drop of 24 GW of planned solar capacity over the next two years, which seemed drastic as it was more solar than the industry had installed in all of 2021.
While Q4 2022 was the best quarter of 2022 for the utility-scale segment,  installing 4.3 GW, this was still the segment’s lowest fourth quarter since 2018. The report indicates that utility-scale installations fell by 31% year-over-year to 11.8 GW, the sector’s lowest total since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Commercial and community solar installations also fell by 6% and 16%, respectively. In addition to the policy constraints, interconnection backlogs are another factor limiting deployment in each market segment.
“Companies are aggressively shifting their supply chains, helping to ensure that solar installed in the U.S. is ethically sourced and has no connection to forced labor,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “While the solar and storage industry acts swiftly on supply chains and building a stronger domestic manufacturing base, ongoing threats of steep tariffs are holding back the potential of the historic Inflation Reduction Act.”
Residential was the bright spot in the U.S. solar market last year. With half the residential market installing domestically sourced solar modules, it is not as affected by trade issues. The residential sector experienced a 40% increase in installed solar capacity in 2022, and now 6% of all homes in the United States have solar.
More good news is that solar accounted for 50% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in 2022, which is the fourth consecutive year that solar topped new additions. Looking ahead, the United States is expected to add over 570 GW of new solar capacity in the next decade, bringing installed solar capacity from 141 GW today to over 700 GW in 2033.

Energy storage
In 2022, the report estimates that 783 MW of new residential, commercial and community solar capacity deployed was paired with energy storage systems, a new record. By 2027, 33% of new residential solar capacity and 20% of new commercial and community solar capacity will be paired with storage.
Top states
California, Texas, and Florida were the top three states for new solar capacity additions for the third consecutive year, with California assuming the top position from Texas after the Lone Star State led the nation in 2021.
Looking ahead
With the current supply chain constraints and myriad near-term uncertainties, for the first time Wood Mackenzie created two forecast scenarios. The bull case estimates 10% more capacity through 2027, assuming more availability of non-tariffed supply as well as a more optimistic view on how much, and how quickly, domestic manufacturing capacity comes online and supplies the US market. The bear case anticipates 11% less capacity through 2027, assuming a less favorable supply environment. The report notes that the alternative cases take into account the various outcomes related to the guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury on qualifying for tax credits and associated adders of the Inflation Reduction Act.

“While 2022 was a tough year for the solar industry, we do expect some of the supply chain issues to ease, propelling 2023 growth to 41%,” said Michelle Davis, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “With major uncertainties ahead of the industry, our high- and low-case scenarios can help the industry benchmark potential outcomes. In each scenario, there is roughly 20 GW of upside or downside risk over the next five years — the same amount of capacity installed last year.”
Anticipating supply chain relief this year, the report authors expect a “robust return to growth in 2023,” forecasting that the United States is expected to add over 570 GW of new solar capacity in the next decade, bringing installed solar capacity from 141 GW today to over 700 GW in 2033. After another year of trade policy turmoil, the U.S. solar industry is hoping for supply chain relief in 2023, expecting shipments to accelerate in the second half of the year. Assuming policy stays a steady course, the report authors contend that we will see 2023 installations grow 41% over 2022 to 28.4 GW (DC).
Looking a decade out, the report authors anticipate that the solar industry will experience five-fold growth. The Base case forecasts cumulative solar installations by 2033 at over 700 GW (DC), compared to 141 GW (DC) installed as of year-end 2022, a five-fold growth over where we are today.
