Despite the challenge of entering the top-heavy lithium-ion home battery market, one company has risen from startup stage to a top-ten market share position just two years after its first storage project. 
Ranking eighth in terms of deployment in 2023, FranklinWH has emerged as a player in the growing space. Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Ambrose joined pv magazine USA to discuss the dynamic home energy solutions industry. 
FranklinWH’s founders had previous experience in the uninterrupted power supply (UPS) industry, supporting datacenters, utility, and industrial backup solutions. This experience carried over to the home storage business, and it is reflected in the company’s name. The “WH” in the name stands for “whole home,” and whole-home support and independence is central to its value proposition. 
FranklinWH’s solution is an AC-coupled battery with a built-in inverter, along with a smart energy management system for integrating power sources with the home. The company said its solution can transition to backup power during a grid outage within 16 milliseconds. A single LFP battery adds 13.6 kWh per unit, with 5 kW continuous and 10 kW peak power.
Ambrose said the company has a vision of bringing “power back to the people” by bringing full-home backup and control of energy at the home. Ambrose considers the company’s product as a “microgrid in a box,” reaching beyond just providing a battery, and instead offering customers home energy management solution. 
Through the battery and energy management system, customers can manage input from solar, from the grid, or from a generator into the battery, along with electrical load management, giving homeowners control over both production and consumption. 
“It’s grid-forming right out of the box,” said Ambrose. “You can form a microgrid on day one. It creates a firewall barrier between the utility and the homeowner.” 
This “firewall” is becoming increasingly valuable to residential ratepayers, as electricity prices continually rise, and time-of-use and other demand-related charges are introduced and increased. 
“The unending march of higher utility bills will not stop,” said Ambrose. “When you invest in a PV plus storage system, what you really are investing in is inflation-proofing your electrical requirements for your next 10, 12, 25 years, depending on the warranties you put behind it.” 
Furthermore, major markets like California have slashed compensation rates for exporting solar production to the grid, damaging standalone solar value, and making a flexible home battery an important feature in an economical solar project. 
“You can think of PV like a knife, it cuts one way, does one thing, and does it efficiently. It produces electricity,” said Ambrose. “When you take a look at an energy management system with a battery, now you’ve got a Swiss Army Knife. It serves all kinds of functions, whole-home backup, peak shaving, load management, even grid-interactive services.” 
Ambrose said this equates to choice for the homeowner, whether they need to have uninterrupted power for medical devices, desire lower energy bills, or want to charge an EV with home solar.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/14/direct-pay-process-tax-credit-transfer-recapture-risk-and-more/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-03-14,"Direct pay process, tax credit transfer recapture risk and more","The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) recently hosted its annual Finance, Tax, and Buyer’s Seminar in Times Square, New York City. This year’s seminar built on the main topic of 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and explored its various facets in greater depth.
Key topics included the much-discussed tax credit transferability rules, the process of filing for and monetizing “elective pay” (also known as direct pay), domestic content and brownfield tax adders, capital structures, and the evolving finance structures as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Treasury Department continue to release financial guidance.

Tri Merit, a specialist in renewable energy tax credit solutions, presented “The Process for Monetization of Renewable Energy Tax Credits.” The presentation highlighted a significant talking point for selling solar to non-profits: to convert the IRA tax credit into a direct payment, the non-profit must file the IRS 990-T form.
Their presentation outlined the steps for submitting various applications to the IRS, including parts of the process currently delayed due to the development of necessary online tools that will allow for the submission of the required documents.

pv magazine USA’s discussion with Tri Merit revealed their approach of early collaboration with project developers and CPAs to develop financial models. Represented by Barry Define and Randy Burge, Tri Merit provides a comprehensive document for developers to integrate into their financial models. As projects progress, Tri Merit assists with finalizing documentation for IRS submission, working with tax professionals to fine-tune values and navigate IRS website forms.
Despite the purported simplicity of the tax credit transfer process, multiple presentations highlighted the risks and challenges associated with monetizing the credits, especially among larger organizations dealing in projects priced above $10 million. Foley & Lardner LLP, a law firm with extensive experience in tax and energy law, presented “General Overview of Tax Credit Transferability,” which delivered a wealth of high-level information on the subject.

The Foley presentation covered the risks of tax credit recapture by the IRS, which can occur when solar projects fail to meet the technical requirements that initially qualified them for tax benefits. These recapture risks are a major factor driving the extensive documentation requirements, which continue to include significant fees and recapture insurance, necessary to complete tax credit transfers.
The presentation also detailed the processes of the newly developed finance structure that has emerged with the introduction of transferability. This structure begins with the traditional tax equity finance model that has been in use for years, but it now incorporates an additional tax credit transfer step at the end. A key aspect of this process, which is more complex and costly than a simple tax credit transfer, is that it enables solar developers to include a “step up” (or development fee) in the transaction at an amount approved by the IRS. It also has the potential to monetize the project’s depreciation.

An example is the recent $140 million tax equity deal between Barclays and Lightsource bp, which will finance the construction of the Prairie Ronde 180 MW solar project in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana.
Lightsource bp plans to construct, own, and operate the solar farm, while McDonald’s will purchase all of the electricity generated by the project through a power purchase agreement. The output is equivalent to the annual energy demand of about 630 of its restaurants.
Construction is underway at the St. Landry Parish site, where 800,000 domestically produced First Solar modules are mounted on Array trackers. Commercial operation is expected late this year, and the company reports the project will create 250 new jobs during construction.
Lightsource expects more than $20 million in economic benefits for St. Landry Parish public services such as local school systems and emergency services over the life of the project, including $8.3 million in the first five years after construction begins. The project is also estimated to abate 231,800 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, or the equivalent of removing 50,000 fuel-burning cars from the road annually.
“Lightsource bp’s investment in St. Landry Parish represents a new day for our community and our schools,” said Jessie Bellard, president of St. Landry Parish. “Their funding boosts job-creating development projects, stronger infrastructure, and better education for our children. With this support, St. Landry Parish is poised to become a regional leader in innovation and opportunity for all.”
As with other Lightsource bp projects, the developer adhered to the local ordinance, which includes strategic placement of buffer zones and vegetative screening to limit visual impact, a biodiversity plan, decommissioning details, and more. The project’s long-term land maintenance and biodiversity plan is expected to support habitat conservation by planting pollinator-friendly crops at the site, restoring one area of the site to native Coastal Prairie, as well as putting Eastern Bluebird boxes around the perimeter.
Barclays acted as the sole external equity investor on the $140 million tax equity deal, which is one of the first to be led by Barclays’ new Sustainable Project Finance team. Working in partnership with the bank’s Energy Transition Group, the tax equity deal will contribute toward the bank’s target of facilitating $1 trillion of Sustainable and Transition Financing between 2023 and the end of 2030.
“Barclays is fully committed to a just transition and working with key clients such as Lightsource bp to evaluate all economic and societal opportunities as we scale climate finance,” said James Edmonds, global head of sustainable project finance at Barclays. “Mobilizing strategic capital is critical for the energy transition and ensures Barclays can make a demonstrable difference in accelerating the scale up of clean energy development projects.”

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/14/247solar-closer-to-commercializing-modular-concentrating-solar-plant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-03-14,247Solar closer to commercializing modular concentrating solar plant,"Under development for more than a decade, 247Solar announced it is one step closer to commercializing its solar thermal electric generating technology with an $8 million Series A funding round, $6 million of which has been closed to date.
The company produces “247Solar Plants” that are capable of producing 400 kW of electricity from 1,800 F heat using a solar receiver design. It is a proprietary thermal storage system with a unique turbine, to produce 24/7 solar electricity. 247Solar told pv magazine USA that each plant module simultaneously produces continuous 400 kW of electricity and 600 kWth of industrial heat at 482 F.
The system can generate heat and electricity 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Like traditional concentrating solar power (CSP), 247Solar’s technology uses mirrors to reflect sunlight onto a receiver tower. The tower is 120 feet tall, shorter than traditional CSP towers, and its turbines run on hot air at normal atmospheric pressure, which the company said reduces the system’s complexity.
The intellectual property for the turbine involves a high-temp heat exchanger that replaces the combustor in an otherwise standard Capstone C200 turbine, 247Solar told pv magazine USA. The heat exchanger is based on a design developed by the late MIT professor emeritus David Gordon Wilson. MIT owns the patent for the heat exchanger and 247Solar licenses it from them.

247Solar adapted the heat exchanger to the turbine and tested a prototype in collaboration with Brayton Energy, a New Hampshire based firm that is focused on development of advanced energy technologies.
Another novel aspect of the 247Solar Plant is the energy storage method. Rather than storing the heat in molten salt, the system stores it in inert materials such as sand, ceramics or iron slag for 18 hours or more. When the heat is released, it spins the turbines to generate electricity and industrial-grade heat when it’s needed.
The ability to scale to any capacity is key to this technology, and 247 said its units fit on 5 acres of land. Because the setup is modular, the parts can be built in factories and assembled at the site.
“We’ve been refining our technology for more than a decade and have emerged with groundbreaking products that can provide zero-carbon electricity and heat around the clock with a small footprint, low technology risk, low environmental impact, and a long operating life,” said Bruce Anderson, founder and CEO.

AtmosZero said it has raised $21 million in a Series A funding round. The company said it will use the funds to accelerate the commercialization of its Boiler 2.0 technology.
“Boiler 2.0 can easily be combined with PV power generation and storage,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The tech runs off electricity and it doesn’t matter how that electricity is created, just that it’s there.”
Most industrial steam is generated by burning fossil fuels on-site in boiler systems. It is used in a range of industries, from food and beverage to chemical manufacturing, accounting for about 8% of global energy use.
“AtmosZero’s proprietary Boiler 2.0 technology extracts heat from the air and delivers high-temperature steam with maximum efficiency and zero carbon emissions, allowing companies to replace their existing natural gas and oil boilers quickly and cost-effectively,” the spokesperson said.
The heat pump draws 480 V of voltage in a three-phase configuration and can produce 650 kW of thermal energy, with an output flow of 997.9 kg/hr of saturated steam. Its output temperature-pressure ranges between 120 C/199.8 kPa and 165 C/701.7 kPa.
“The coefficient of performance (COP) of the system is dependent on the ambient temperatures as well as the desired steam temperature,” the spokesperson said. “We work together with customers and perform specific analysis to give them a better insight on expected performance. That being said, our target is a COP of 2 going from 15 C ambient to 150 C saturated steam.”
The system uses an unspecified refrigerant with “low global warming potential (GWP), flammability, and toxicity.” Its footprint is approximately 2.4 meters x 6.1 meters.
AtmosZero is currently testing the system under a full-scale pilot deployed at a facility operated by US-based New Belgium Brewing Company. It also recently launched a European subsidiary.
“Our first systems deploying in 2025 will produce 165 C and in 2026 we will achieve 200 C,” the spokesperson said.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/14/after-sale-support-key-to-boosting-off-grid-solar/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",MATTHEW LYNAS,2024-03-14,After-sale support key to boosting off-grid solar,"From pv magazine Global
Off-grid solar energy customers are currently facing several challenges, according to the Why Off Grid Energy Matters report released by US-based impact measurement company 60 Decibels.
The report analyzes issues such as product affordability, gender inequality, customer support, further investment in minigrids, and over-indebtedness, and proposes a series of recommendations to overcome them. The indebtedness recommendation, in particular, stems from reports from 5% of customers surveyed who said they find payments for their energy product or service to be a significant financial burden.
On customer support, Kat Harrison, director at 60 Decibels, told pv magazine there is room for improvement in the way some off-grid energy companies approach after-sale support. Issues ranging from technical faults, to a lack of customer education covering how to effectively use products, risk reputational damage for businesses and the off-grid technologies they sell.
“Some of these challenges prevent end users from unlocking the full benefits of energy access,” she stated. “So many of these markets rely on word of mouth. If your neighbor or friend is sharing their experience of their new solar product – and it doesn’t work or customer service is bad – then people won’t uptake these technologies.”
Despite these challenges, Harrison was positive about the role PV and other off-grid technologies can play in improving energy access globally. “Off-grid energy offers a real opportunity to get us closer to universal energy access, with benefits at a household level, and also a community and national level. We see real productivity, community, and economic impacts,” she added.
Solar lanterns
The report was compiled using survey data from more than 79,000 respondents in 31 countries. Field workers in each country contacted customers directly based on data supplied by 164 companies.
At a product level, the solar lantern offered the greatest return on investment in terms of quality of life improvement, according to the report. Of those surveyed, 64% of respondents with a solar lantern said it had “very much improved” their quality of life, while 62% of those with a residential PV installation said the same.
Around 88% of survey respondents live in Africa and East Africa was the largest region by number of customers surveyed, accounting for 68% of the total. A further 10% of respondents live in Asia and 1% were in Latin America.
Economic impact
The economic impact of off-grid energy was investigated as part of the survey fieldwork. It revealed that although 26% of off-grid energy customers had increased spending on energy, this was often accompanied by a higher level of service, such as longer-lasting or more reliable electricity access. And while 82% used off-grid energy products at home, 11% said they used off-grid energy in their business or farm, with 7% using energy products in both locations.
Economic gains were reported by those who did use off-grid energy products for business, with 58% stating they had experienced an increase in income due to the energy access.
Financing plays a significant role in off-grid solar deployment, according to the report. Of those surveyed, 74% said they bought energy products using some form of payment plan or loan. That figure rises to 92% when those who installed a PV system at home are considered in isolation.
Economic inclusivity was also examined and minigrids were revealed as the off-grid energy solution with the highest proportion of customers living in poverty. While 41% of all survey respondents were living below global poverty thresholds, 51% of minigrid customers were living in poverty. The survey also found users living in poverty tended to report higher impacts from gaining access to off-grid energy across a range of outcomes.

Researchers at Penn State University in the United States have fabricated a prototype of a hybrid energy system integrating solar cells for power production and radiative cooling for external cooling purposes.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
“The photovoltaic electricity generated in the dual system can be used for energy storage or be converted to alternating current by using an inverter,” the scientists said. “The coldness achieved on the transparent radiative cooler can be used to cool air or liquid, which can be driven by fan or pump, respectively, to interface with thermal systems for energy savings.”
The proposed system achieves simultaneous subambient daytime radiative cooling and photovoltaic electricity generation from the same area. “At night and during the day, the radiative cooler works as a 24/7 natural air conditioner,” said the research’s lead author Pramit Ghosh. “Even on a hot day, the radiative cooler is cold to the touch.”
The system consists of a transparent low-iron glass radiative cooler that is able to transmit 91% of sunlight, a visibly transparent infrared-opaque layer, and a 125 mm × 125 mm interdigitated back-contact (IBC) photovoltaic cell provided by US-based manufacturer Maxeon. The radiative cooler has no direct radiative heat exchange with the PV device.
The scientists tested the system in an outdoor environment at Penn State Sustainability Institute’s Sustainability Experience Center and found it could surpass the electricity saving of a bare solar cell by as much as 30%. “We demonstrated simultaneous subambient daytime radiative cooling at 5.1 C temperature reduction under solar irradiance of about 1,000 W/m2 and solar power generation up to 159.9 W/m2 from the same area,” they explained. “We experimentally achieved ambient cooling power of 63.8 W/m2 under peak sunlight and ambient cooling power of 87.0 W/m2 at night.”
The research group also assumed the power generated by the solar cell to be utilized to power a cooling system with a coefficient of performance (COP) 2.8, and found the cooling power of the hybrid system would be five times more than the daytime cooling power achieved in conventional solar-reflective radiative coolers.
“Our work highlights the significant opportunity of simultaneously harvesting both the sun and the cold universe for renewable energy at a level that can exceed the performance of using either resource alone,” it concluded.
The system was described in the study “Simultaneous subambient daytime radiative cooling and photovoltaic power generation from the same area,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait, among others.
