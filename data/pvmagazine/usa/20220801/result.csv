Total global solar deployment is closing in on 1 TW installed, an impressive milestone on the energy transition’s path.
“The global solar picture is just staggering at this point,” Barnett told Yahoo Finance. “We are on track to install something like 250 gigawatts of solar capacity this year.”
China is contributing the largest share to capacity growth this year, with about 108 GW of PV estimated to reach operations. This is a near-doubling of the roughly 55 GW installed by China last year. China has the world’s largest exposure to renewable energy, with 323 GW of solar and 338 GW of wind energy. President Xi Jinping aims for 1,200 GW combined by 2030, and the nation is currently ahead of schedule on that goal, said Bloomberg.
Renewable energy is hitting all-time highs in the United States, too. Renewable generation from solar and wind installations reached 28% in April, a new record for the category. And Barnett said the solar boom has just begun. “There really is this big, top-line growth scenario that we see unfolding for all of the companies that are participating in the solar supply chain,” said Barnett.
Climate goals are one driver of the red-hot demand for solar, but Barnett said there is another force that is accelerating demand in the near-term. “I would actually argue that the bigger driver for clean energy demand, particularly here in Europe, is elevated energy costs,” he said.
Costs continue to fall for PV, making it increasingly cost-competitive with oil, which has spiked in price following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Shipments of solar modules have fallen precipitously over 20 years, from $4.88/W in 2000 to $0.34/W in 2021, based on the Energy Information Administration’s recent release of its module shipments report.
Barnett said he expects solar demand to retain its momentum even if oil and natural gas prices cool off. “It’s certainly possible that if you had some easing in the traditional fuel markets, that it might take the accelerator off, but I don’t really see that as being a material risk on the demand side of the equation for clean energy,” he said.
This demand-side momentum is likely to continue as prices improve and the global economy targets decarbonization. “I do think that the economics are already quite good. And so you’d have to see such a sea change in terms of gas prices or coal prices, if you’re thinking about the power grid, to really reverse some of the trends. And I just don’t think there’s any appetite for it either,” said Barnett.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/01/the-role-of-seasonal-demand-in-an-all-electric-scenario/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 1, 2022",The role of seasonal demand in an all-electric scenario,"Most building decarbonization models do not account for seasonal fluctuations in energy demand for heating or cooling, which makes it difficult to predict what switching to all-electric heating could mean for the electrical grid, especially during peaks in energy use.
A new study by researchers at Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH), Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Oregon State University, and the nonprofit Home Energy Efficiency Team (HEET) examined these seasonal changes in energy demand, and found that monthly energy consumption varies substantially and is highest in the winter months.
The study, published in Scientific Reports, a journal of the Nature Portfolio, presented novel modeling of multiple building electrification scenarios and found that the surge in winter energy demand will be difficult to satisfy through current renewable sources, if buildings switch to low-efficiency electrified heating. The findings emphasize the need for buildings to install more efficient home-heating technologies, such as ground source heat pumps.
“Our research reveals the degree of fluctuation in building energy demand and the benefits of using extremely efficient heating technologies when electrifying buildings,” says Jonathan Buonocore, assistant professor of environmental health at BUSPH  and study lead and corresponding author.
“Historically, this fluctuation in building energy demand has been managed largely by gas, oil, and wood, all of which can be stored throughout the year and used during the winter. Electrified buildings, and the electrical system that supports them, will have to provide this same service of providing reliable heating in winter. More efficient electric heating technologies will reduce the electrical load put on the grid and improve the ability for this heating demand to be met with non-combustion renewables.”
The study analyzed building energy data from March 2010 to February 2020, and found that total monthly average for energy consumption in the United States, based on the current use of fossil fuels, as well as future use of electricity in the winter, varies by a factor of 1.6x, with the lowest demand in May, and the highest demand in January.
The researchers modeled these seasonal fluctuations in what they call the “Falcon Curve’’, a graph of the change in monthly energy consumption (which represents the shape of a falcon). The data shows that winter heating demand drives energy consumption to its highest levels in December and January, with a secondary peak in July and August due to cooling, and the lowest levels in April, May, September, and October.

The researchers then calculated the amount of additional renewables, specifically wind and solar energy, that would need to be generated to meet this increased demand in electricity. They found that to meet winter peaks, without storage, demand response, or other tactics to manage grid load, buildings would require a 28x increase in January wind generation or a 303x increase in January solar energy. Then they calculated adding more efficient renewables, such as air source heat pumps or ground source heat pumps, and found that buildings would only require 4.5x more winter wind generation, or 36x more solar energy—thus “flattening” the Falcon Curve as less new energy demand is placed on the electrical grid.
“This work really shows that technologies on both the demand and the supply side have a strong role to play in decarbonization,” says study coauthor Parichehr Salimifard, assistant professor of college of engineering at Oregon State University.
Examples of these technologies on the energy supply side are geothermal building heating and renewable energy technologies that can provide energy at all hours, she says—such as renewables coupled with long-term storage, distributed energy resources at all scales, and geothermal electricity generation where possible.
“These can be coupled with technologies on demand side—i.e., in buildings—such as passive and active building energy efficiency measures, peak-shaving, and energy storage in buildings. These building-level technologies can both reduce the overall building energy demand by reducing both baseline and maximum energy demand as well as smooth the fluctuations in building energy demand, and consequently flatten the Falcon Curve,” said Salimifard.
“The Falcon Curve draws our attention to a key relationship between the choice of building electrification technology and the impact of building electrification on our power grid,” said study coauthor Zeyneb Magavi, co-executive director of HEET, a non-profit climate solutions incubator.
Magavi cautions that this research does not yet quantify this relationship based on measured seasonal efficiency curves for specific technologies, or for more granular time scales or regions. It also does not assess the numerous strategies and technologies that can help address the challenge–all of which must be considered in decarbonization planning.
Even so, Magavi says this research indicates that, “Using a strategic combination of heat pump technologies (air-source, ground-source, and networked), as well as long-term energy storage, will help us electrify buildings more efficiently, economically, and equitably. The Falcon curve shows us a faster path to a clean, healthy energy future.”
“Our research makes clear that, when accounting for seasonal fluctuations in energy consumption apparent in the Falcon Curve, the drive to electrify our buildings must be coupled with a commitment to energy-efficient technologies to ensure building decarbonization efforts maximize climate and health benefits,” says study senior author Joseph G. Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment science and director of the Healthy Buildings program at
One fundamental change is, even under high-efficiency building electrification, the US electrical grid will likely switch from peaking in summer to winter. The researchers concluded that for building electrification to represent “healthy decarbonization of building energy, the additional electricity demand needs to be met with non-combustion renewable energy, which under our most optimistic scenario will require increasing wind generation by 4.5×”.
Currently, the seasonal fluctuations are being met largely by a fossil energy system with long-term energy storage. In an all-electric scenario, long-term electricity storage may have a strong role in aiding renewable electricity in meeting the demand from newly electrified buildings.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/01/us-2021-solar-panel-shipments-total-9-8-billion-at-0-34-w/,"COST AND PRICES,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 1, 2022",US 2021 solar panel shipments total $9.8 billion at $0.34/W,"The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its 2021 module shipments report, reflecting a market of $9.8 billion for imported and exported solar panels. The figure also includes US-made solar panels that were shipped to US projects. This represents a 19.5% increase over 2020’s total.
The average cost of these shipments was $0.34/W, down from 2020’s average of $0.38/W. The cost fell despite supply chain pressures, rising shipping costs, and increased materials costs. Modules prices have fallen steadily from about $2.00 per peak Watt in 2010.
In 2021, the United States had nearly 29 million module shipments. This number was only 320,000 when EIA began reporting it in 2006, and about 3.7 million ten years prior to this report in 2011.
EIA reports 4.2 million modules were manufactured domestically, while nearly 23 million were imported. Export shipments totaled about 1.1 million modules. About 119,000 were purchased from U.S. original equipment manufacturers.
China, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam accounted for 11.3 million modules shipped to the United States. Malaysia accounted for 3.2 million; South Korea, Thailand, and United Arab Emirates nearly 5 million; and “other” nations shipped nearly 3.5 million modules.
In terms of peak kilowatts, the top three states for module shipments were California (5.1 million peak kW), Texas (4.3 million peak kW), and Florida (1.7 million peak kW).
Notably, EIA said fewer companies now report on the module shipments “EIA-63B” form due to “company consolidation and changes to strategic planning of companies in the U.S. solar photovoltaic industry.” As a result, EIA’s 2021 report is less detailed to protect confidentiality of company-level data. Data can no longer be published for the specific types of PV cells and modules, or by region.

Canada-based power company Hydro-Quebec has revealed the bidders of two renewable energy tenders it launched in December 2021.
For a 300 MW tender for wind power, the utility received 11 project proposals with a combined capacity of 2.1 GW, while for a 480 MW procurement exercise for renewable electricity the company received 13 projects totaling 2.1 GW.
Of the submitted projects, only one is relying on PV technology — a 40 MW solar park under development by Saint-Augustin Canada Electric Inc (Stace) and planned to be located in Bas Saint Laurent, with completion scheduled for October 2026.
Selected projects will have to begin delivering power to the grid by the end of 2026 under long-term power purchase agreements.
Under the 2030 energy policy, Quebec’s government is targeting a 40% reduction in the amount of petroleum products consumed; the elimination of thermal coal use; a 25% increase in the share of renewable energy in total energy production; and a 50% increase in bioenergy production.

Since 2020, Salcomp has manufactured Enphase Microinverters and other components in a factory in India for the North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific markets.
While Salcomp plays a significant role in the solar industry, it is known for manufacturing chargers and nd adaptors for smartphones and other handheld devices. The company has a manufacturing presence in India, China, and Brazil and employs approximately 16,000 people globally.
Enphase IQ microinverters’claim to fame is that it is capable of forming a microgrid during a power outage, providing backup power even without a battery. It does this by limiting energy capture to just what the home is consuming, so in the event that the grid suffers a power failure, a proprietary, intelligent chip within the IQ8 will seamlessly switch between on or off grid.
(Read “Enphase going Einstein with IQ8 solar power inverters”)
Last week Enphase Energy announced record revenues in Q2 2022, beating expectations and quickly sending the company’s stock up 10% in after-hours trading. The growth was due in part to expansion in the European market, with second quarter growth of 69%, but was also attributed to the success of the IQ8 in the US market, which ROTH Capital Partners said has a 15% premium over the previous IQ7 model. As of the end of 2021, Enphase has shipped 43.4 TWh of microinverters, representing over 42 million microinverter units, deployed across nearly 2 million solar projects.
“Enphase has an outstanding reputation for developing safe, reliable, and industry-leading solar technology,” said Sasikumar Gendham, managing director, Salcomp India. “We are thrilled to collaborate with Enphase to bring its products to market and support the company’s ongoing growth.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/01/nearly-all-smart-inverter-manufacturers-will-be-delivering-smart-inverters-within-a-year/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA,HAWAII,MARYLAND,MASSACHUSETTS,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 1, 2022",Nearly all smart inverter manufacturers will be delivering smart inverters within a year,"States that require smart inverters for new rooftop solar can enable more rooftop installations, because smart inverters can stabilize voltage on a distribution circuit. And because smart inverters can receive communications, an aggregation of distributed storage can serve as a virtual power plant, injecting power to the grid when needed.
A handful of states already require new distributed resource installations to use smart inverters that meet a standard known as IEEE 1547-2018, once devices meeting the standard become available, and more are evaluating such a requirement. The SunSpec Alliance expects that more than 30 states will set smart inverter requirements by April 2023, based on an examination of state regulatory dockets from the past year, said SunSpec Alliance Chair Tom Tansy in an email.
Most smart inverter manufacturers will be able to provide smart inverters to project developers and distributors sometime between March and August 2023, according to an analysis from the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) authored by IREC Chief Regulatory Engineer Brian Lydic.
That’s of special interest in states where a smart inverter requirement is expected to take effect once smart inverters meeting the IEEE 1547-2018 standard become commercially available, such as Maryland, Washington, D.C., New York and Massachusetts, as noted in IREC’s analysis. (Hawaii and California already require smart inverters that meet earlier state standards, and are shifting to the IEEE 1547-2018 standard.)
IREC developed the timeline largely based on the time required to test all manufacturers’ inverters and certify them as meeting Underwriters Laboratories standard UL 1741 SB, to verify compliance with the IEEE 1547-2018 standard.
IREC considered 155 representative smart inverter models to be tested, across 30 inverter manufacturers, with each representative model representing a “family” consisting of multiple models with different power outputs.
Based on survey responses from manufacturers and nationally recognized testing laboratories, IREC determined that the likely duration of each test for a single inverter family could range from 9-12 weeks. At a 9-week average test duration, testing labs could test 85% of inverter families within 54 weeks, while a 12-week average test duration would mean testing would take 72 weeks.
After testing, 16 more weeks would be needed for a manufacturer to produce and ship the first inverters to project developers and distributors, IREC estimated.
IREC assumed that testing began in November 2021, or about a month after the latest UL 1741 SB standard was issued. Based on that testing start date, IREC estimated that 85% of manufacturers would be delivering smart inverters by the timeframe of March through August, 2023.
IREC’s analysis used industry surveys and a database of smart inverters available from the California Energy Commission (CEC). IREC expects that the database, which can be downloaded to show a data column for UL 1741 SB certification, “should provide good data on the number of certified models” as the CEC updates the list based on information provided by manufacturers.
