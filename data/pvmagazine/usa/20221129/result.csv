The complaint notes that Chinese companies sought out new countries to manufacture their goods in an attempt to evade tariffs levied against their products.
It’s well known that part of China’s national growth strategy is to strategically acquire technologies – via theft, if necessary. The Obama administration kept a lookout for bad actors, and ended up charging members of the Chinese military with computer hacking and espionage.

China has made solar electricity generation a key piece of its growth strategy. This includes strong subsidies for certain Chinese companies anointed by the state. Those companies then sell – or dump – heavily discounted products around the world.
As a result, there have been multiple instances where tariffs have been slapped on solar panels originating from China. During the Trump administration, nearly all solar panels originating from foreign countries received an import tariff.
Whether or not tariffs have ever worked to increase domestic production is a question of folklore. Data clearly shows that the United States saw paltry amounts of solar capacity growth preceding the Inflation Reduction Act. Immediately after the IRA act was signed, the industry was booming. Companies like Qcells began establishing vertically integrated solar module manufacturing facilities that are amongst the world’s largest.

For manufacturers, carrots are producing better results than sticks.
This begs the question: Should the United States add new import tariffs? I would argue that we should thread the needle. While we should not accept materials from geopolitically sensitive areas of China, and though we should maintain tariffs against materials from China’s mainland, we should not add new tariffs to global supply chains, for the following reasons:
First, China’s decision to make solar power a part of its Five Year Plans has driven the resource to its current amazing growth rates – with Longi suggesting 1 TW a year being installed by 2030.
Current projections suggest that if we account for emissions alone, electricity generation is on pace to meet our clean energy goals. Meeting our domestic goals would not have been possible if it were not for China’s acceptance of economic losses from financing solar factories in a market where the product’s price was falling precipitously.
By taking on the challenges of manufacturing several billion solar panels, China made itself a technological leader. Chinese companies have significantly advanced polysilicon technology and solar module efficiencies. Longi and Jinko have repeatedly broken each other’s efficiency records, showing how technological advancement in China’s solar industry is both persistent, and reliable.

Another reason to avoid tariffs is that our own budding domestic manufacturing boom may very well need competition from highly experienced overseas manufacturers, like the Chinese. We need manufacturing competition from China because they’re the world’s best, and they will push U.S. manufacturing to stay focused on delivering high quality goods to the American market. An analysis by Credit Suisse suggests that solar module costs could fall to almost a nickel per watt, on average. This author posited that First Solar products might essentially cost nothing to make, after tax credits are applied.
In order for these benefits to truly flow from the IRA to the American people (and not just to corporations – many of which are foreign companies), our manufacturers need to know that there’s a beast breathing down their neck. Global competition is essential, because it keeps domestic pricing and quality in check.
Projections have suggested that an aggressive tariff might mean that imported module pricing could hit 50 cents per watt. If that happens, foreign products will essentially disappear from the U.S. utility scale market, introducing an opportunity for highly incentivized U.S. fat cats to get lazy.
When it comes to installing clean capacity, some have suggested that we are on climate war footing – and that doing anything to hurt ourselves would be foolish. Removing so much product from the market could spite the United States, right when we need it the most.
The Biden administration seeks to deliver 40% of U.S. electricity from solar power by 2035. Reaching that goal will require hundreds of gigawatts of capacity – peaking at over a hundred gigawatts per year in the 2030s.
Although we have heard many announcements of domestic solar module manufacturing facilities, at this moment there is no path for the U.S. to manufacture all 37 GW of the capacity slated for 2023, not to mention the projected 75 GW for 2027, or 105 GW for 2029.
Take note: The aforementioned Credit Suisse report suggests that the IRA might turn the U.S. into a net exporter of solar modules. If the U.S. were a net exporter and subsidizer of solar modules, would our call for import tariffs really be… honorable?
Finally, geopolitically speaking, there are benefits to threading the needle when it comes to politics with China. While the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act has had little effect on American solar panel manufacturing, the current mainland solar tariffs did prompt China to move its solar supply chain globally.
Naturally, global attention on western Chinese actions has pushed solar manufacturing out of the region and into the rest of the world, into nations that should benefit from the added jobs and technological development. If our species can work together a bit more, by putting pressure on ourselves to be better to our neighbors, we will see incremental benefits.
There will be many complex considerations to be made as our nation moves forward with its energy resources on this aggressive planet. These anti-circumvention tariffs represent a small, but important, moment of inflection.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/29/watch-one-of-the-largest-solar-facilities-in-texas-achieves-operation/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 29, 2022",Watch: One of the largest solar facilities in Texas achieves operation,"National Grid Renewables celebrated the activation of the Noble Solar project, the largest yet developed by the company, and among the largest in the nation. The 275 MW solar, 125 MWh battery energy storage Noble Solar project began construction last year and is now feeding renewable energy into the Texas ERCOT grid-controlled region. 
The project installed First Solar Series 6 thin-film solar modules and Fluence Energy’s Gridstack battery energy storage system. Signal Energy constructed the project, which employed over 600 construction workers. Six full-time operations and maintenance workers will retain long-term jobs at the site. 
National Grid’s project is expected to avoid 450,000 metric tons of carbon emissions each year, the equivalent of nearly 100,000 gas-powered electric vehicles each year. During the first 20 years of operation, Noble Solar is estimated to produce $26 million in new tax revenues. 
The project included high-profile corporate offtakers that signed on to power purchase agreements (PPA) for a portion of the project’s capacity. The Home Depot executed a 100 MW PPA and The Hershey Company contracted for 50 MW of capacity via PPA. 
“This partnership will further our renewable energy capacity, as we work towards our pledge of producing or procuring 100 percent renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities by 2030,” said Ron Jarvis, chief sustainability officer for The Home Depot.
 
Components 
National Grid selected First Solar Series 6 panels for the installation, and the partnership will extend beyond the Noble Solar project. Recently, the company signed on to purchase 2 GW of solar modules from First Solar, with deliveries expected in 2024 to 2025. 
The Series 6 is a Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) thin-film module featuring up to 485 W capacity, 19.2% efficiency, and a 30-year linear performance warranty. The company warrants an annual degradation rate of 0.3%. 
The module’s design incorporates an under-mount frame, which the company said enables faster installation times. It contains a dual-junction box, thereby reducing wire management complexity. First Solar said its Series 6 also comes with the industry’s only cell cracking warranty. 
Fluence’s Gridstack battery is configurable from 2 MW to 500 MW +, with durations ranging from one hour to six or more. The liquid-cooled battery is IP55 rated and has numerous safety features, including fast stop, fire detection and suppression system (solid aerosol), gas detection (carbon monoxide), deflagration panels, lockable disconnect switch, open door sensor, gas spring damper, and a sliding door lock. 
The battery comes with the Fluence OS operating system for control, asset management, and system visibility. It is also equipped with Fluence IQ, a software that automates wholesale market participation to boost revenues.

Under the agreement, Powin will install battery systems over the next few years with SMA’s power inverters and other solutions. Tualatin, Oregon-based Powin secured a predictable power device supply for up to three years which will provide project planning stability and certainty.
“Our commitment to the U.S. market and to our customers is further strengthened by our partnership with SMA, one of the world’s best manufacturers of inverters,” said Anthony Carroll, president of Powin Energy. “The energy storage market is entering a new stage of transformative growth and SMA will help us meet the growing demand and provide our customers with more flexibility in choosing their preferred power conversion technology.”
In September, Powin acquired EKS Energy, a power electronics and energy management solutions provider. The acquisition expands Powin’s offerings to include power conversion and power plant controllers, allowing the company to offer a full suite of AC energy storage systems that support microgrids among other systems. Other new products tied to the acquisition include PV inverters, DC-to-DC converters and multi-port inverters used for utility-scale solar plus energy storage projects.
In February, Powin signed a supply agreement with Borrego for 800MWh of Powin’s Stack750 storage solution. Under the agreement Borrego will install Powin’s battery energy storage systems for both utility-scale, standalone storage projects and hybrid solar-plus-storage projects across the U.S., with more than 490 MWh of projects in the pipeline.
The bulk of Powin’s global supply pipeline came in February, when it signed supply deals covering a 5.8GWh pipeline of energy storage projects in the US and Taiwan. Of those 5.8GWh, the company said the majority will use Powin’s Centipede product.
Powin’s Centipede consists of pre-integrated modular units containing batteries, thermal management equipment, and other safety features. The Centipede requires half the time to procure and deploy – and uses 30% less space – than rival modular storage systems, while also reducing lifecycle costs.
Powin has delivered over 2.5 GWh of battery systems in more than eight countries and has a contracted pipeline of more than 10 GWh of systems globally over the next three years. The company is backed by GIC, Trilantic North America, Energy Impact Partners and Samsung Ventures.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/29/utility-shortcuts-on-residential-solar-applications-contribute-to-delays-researchers-find/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 29, 2022","Utility shortcuts on residential solar applications contribute to delays, researchers find","“Shortcuts” that utilities use to model interconnection of residential solar contribute to interconnection delays and low adoption rates, said a report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Some utilities fast-track residential solar applications only if solar capacity is less than 15% of the distribution circuit’s peak load, the report said.
Other utilities screen by assuming that residential customers are directly connected to service transformers. As a result, rather than allowing their distribution model to estimate voltage changes that would result from adding residential solar, these utilities “commonly assume” during screening that residential solar would cause “2-3 volts of rise, which can incorrectly suggest that a voltage violation will happen,” said an NREL spokesperson.
Researchers from NREL and three other organizations attempted to develop an improved screening technique with better shortcuts, based on “synthetic” models of distribution circuits, but concluded that the effort would require better data on distribution circuits in order to succeed.
Utilities use the shortcuts to help avoid voltage violations and thermal overload on a distribution circuit, the report said. Voltage violations are illustrated in the nearby image. Thermal overload, which can cause utility equipment to fail, could result if the power exports from solar and solar-plus-battery systems are too large, said an NREL spokesperson.

Smart inverters, DERMS
Voltage on distribution circuits can be maintained within proper limits when residential solar projects use smart inverters. That’s because smart inverters have autonomous settings that can instantly correct for voltage disturbances.
Three of the nine utilities participating in the NREL study said they rely primarily on smart inverters with autonomous inverter settings to integrate residential solar and other distributed resources. Smart inverter requirements have been in place in Hawaii and California for three years, while other states have since set such requirements or are considering doing so. A Sunrun executive has recommended that other states follow Hawaii’s example, where harmonized smart inverter settings have expedited interconnection.
Three utilities participating in the study said they primarily rely on “traditional” upgrades to integrate distributed resources, such as replacing distribution circuit lines with higher-capacity lines, a practice known as reconductoring.
A distributed energy resource management system (DERMS), which gives the utility control over distributed resources, is the favored tool to integrate distributed resources for two of the nine participating utilities. Customer net-load control is the primary choice for the remaining utility.
Among participating utilities, the top three strategies to integrate distributed resources over the next ten years will include DERMS for six utilities, smart inverters with autonomous inverter settings for five utilities, and traditional upgrades for five utilities. Only two of the nine participating utilities were identified.
The study is titled “Final technical report: Improving solar and solar+storage screening techniques to reduce utility interconnection time and costs.” The report’s authors work at NREL, Kevala, National Information Solutions Cooperative, and Electrical Distribution Design.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/29/brick-and-iron-heat-battery-for-zero-carbon-industrial-processes/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 29, 2022",Brick and iron heat battery for zero-carbon industrial processes,"California’s Rondo Energy announced it has released two models of its Rondo Heat Battery (RHB), an energy storage system that dispatches both heat and electricity for industrial applications. The battery is made of readily available materials such as bricks and iron.
The Bill Gates-backed company developed the battery as a way to decarbonize the industrial sector, which comes with challenges like the need for high temperatures and large amounts of highly dispatchable power. The RHB systems can store more than 1 MWh per square meter, a high level of density that preserves area use at industrial facilities.
RHB batteries offer continuous power with a 95% annual capacity power while operating on input power as low as 15% capacity factor, or four hours of dispatchable power generation per day.
The company’s so-called “brick toaster” heat battery stores intermittent generation from renewable energy resources like solar and wind, able to hold stored heat energy at temperatures up to 1,500 degrees Celsius for hours or days at a time. The zero-carbon solution supports manufacturing processes such as steel, cement and chemical manufacturing, as well as low-temperature food processing.
Rondo said a single RHB300 unit can eliminate more than 40,000 tons of carbon emissions per year, equivalent to the carbon offset of about 8,700 electric vehicles.
“The Rondo Heat Battery will help companies in industries such as cement, fuels, food and water desalination to begin leveraging the falling costs of renewables without modifying their facilities,” said Carmichael Roberts, Business Lead and the head of Breakthrough Energy Ventures’ investment committee.
RHBs use brick materials that have been used in the steel production process for over a century, but rearranged in a patented configuration. It can be used to replace fuel-fired furnaces and boilers, offering low-cost zero-carbon energy. The company said the units are fully automatic, able to deliver heat on demand for 24 hours a day at constant temperatures.
Rondo said the batteries can be integrated into existing process heating equipment, allowing for significant emissions reductions without the need for a factory overhaul. The batteries are expected to operate for 40 years or more with no performance degradation.
“Rondo’s mission is simple: lower cost heat and energy for large industrial processes. We’re finding that deep emission reductions are now both practical and affordable for many of the world’s most energy-intensive facilities. Our studies of customer facilities are showing 50% to 90% reductions in emissions and reductions in operating costs of 30% or more,” said Jeremey Keller, senior vice president of Rondo Energy.
Oakland, California-based Rondo Energy has raised $25.1 million in funding to date from Breakthrough and Energy Impact Partners, with its most recent funding from a February Series A round.

Canada’s cumulative solar capacity is set to hit 5 GW by the end of this year, according to figures from the federal government’s Canmet Energy lab. The country is expected to add around 500 MW of new solar capacity, from 944 MW last year, according to the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA-PVPS), which recently published a report on PV applications in Canada.
“If we look at the recent averages, Canada has installed around 500 MW annually. I expect in 2022 it will be at least 500 MW,” said Yves Poissant, research manager at Canmet Energy. “Last year it was 944 MW, mainly because of a 465 MW centralized PV power plant installed in Alberta.”
The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) studied renewables integration and concluded that Canada’s cumulative solar capacity will increase sevenfold to 35 GW by 2050, driven by cost competitiveness.
Canada now produces 80% of its electricity from power sources other than oil. Hydroelectricity leads the mix at 60%, followed by nuclear at 15%, wind at 7%, gas and coal at 7%, and PV at just 1%. While the government aims to increase the share of green electricity to 90% by 2030 and 100% by 2050, it has not set any specific goals for PV. Each Canadian province and territory is left to determine its own targets.
“Without comprehensive pan-Canadian policy framework with annual capacity targets, PV installation in the coming years will likely continue to be highly variable across the provinces and territories. Further policies mechanisms are needed to allow PV to reach its full potential,” the IEA-PVPS said.
Canada recently introduced investment tax credits for renewables to compete with the United States, but it is still far from being a solar powerhouse. That said, the landscape has started to change in the past five years.
“Some laws have been put in place to retire coal plants by 2025. That led to new opportunities to install capacity,” said Poissant. “We expect the newly installed capacity will consist mostly of wind, but also solar.”
The cost of solar has become more competitive and the residential sector is now close to grid parity, according to Poissant. For utility-scale projects, old hydroelectric dams are still considerably cheaper than solar, but newly built installations are now more expensive than solar.
“Starting 2030, solar PV will be cost competitive compared to wind,” Poissant said.

The NPUC’s Annual Utility Decarbonization Report 2022, released in conjunction with partners Motive Power and Visual Capitalist, examines the top multi-state utilities that have taken steps to buck the trend of greenhouse gas emissions with the electricity sector contributing 1.48 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2020, or 25% of the emissions produced across all U.S. industries.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data, over the last 40 years climate change incidents have grown six-fold, from $201.5 billion in damage from 31 storms and natural disasters from 1980 to 1989, to $1.2 trillion in damage-related costs related to 179 storms and disasters from 2009 to the present.  Major milestones tracked along the previous four decades include record drought and heatwaves during the 1980’s, Midwest flooding, the growing California wildfire season, and three catastrophic hurricanes from 2005 to 2017.
With the Covid-19 pandemic dampening electricity consumption by 2.5%, nevertheless the utility market continued to generate 4 billion MWh of electricity, 61% of all electricity was generated by coal, natural gas and oil-fueled power plants.
The NPUC’s decarbonization index uses six metrics to rank utilities:
Utilities are scored from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) for each metric, while a score of close to 5 indicates utilities leading on decarbonization strategy relative to peers.
It should come as no surprise that the top 5 U.S. utilities generated 50% or more of electricity from nuclear, solar, wind power and other renewables. Public Service Enterprise Group (4.7), which services New Jersey and much of Long Island, and NextEra Energy (4.7), a Florida and Texas utility that produces its own renewable resources, were tied for the top spot. PSEG ranks highest based on its low-emissions profile and climate goals to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, or five years ahead of the Biden Administration’s target. NextEra Energy, the second highest ranked utility and owner of FP&L in eighth place, is the largest producer of wind and solar energy in the world and generated 97% of net electricity from low-carbon sources of energy in 2020.
The full list of top 30 utilities can be accessed here and it’s worth noting that several utilities tied at various intervals of the chart, with laggards weighed down by ongoing baseload generation from coal, oil and natural gas remaining in the generation mix.
pv magazine USA’s most recent ’50 States of Solar Incentives’ features highlight several utilities operating the electric grid in states with a slow-growing mix of favorable solar incentives such as Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee. For these states, utilities Southern Company (2.3), Entergy (2.8)  and Duke Energy (2.8) appear in the trailing 10 rankings on the NPUC’s Decarbonization list based on carbon metrics related to its respective power generation fleet and prohibitive policies towards solar and other distributed energy resources.
Funding and Regulatory Needs
The NPUC’s report highlights the age old challenge of achieving rapid decarbonization by 2030 requires 200,000 GW-kilometers of new high voltage transmission capacity, which steps up to 637,000 GW-km  by 2050.
Similar to the Interstate Highway System that connected 48 intercontinental states by road a century ago with a $114 billion capital investment, the interstate grid will also require over 600,000 miles of transmission lines and 5.5 million miles of distribution lines to replace now 25+ year old U.S. transmission lines whose lifespan is 50 years.
Funding the net-zero grid requires $330 billion in investment by 2030, and spikes up to $2.2 trillion by 2050, averaging at $79 billion per year from 2030 to 2050 as states commit to rapid decarbonization goals.
In order to support transmission expansion for wind and solar generation offtake, including 200,000 GW-km of new high voltage lines, state coalitions will need to come together to cover a broader industry deficit from 2030 to 2050, the report finds.
The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act puts $68 billion forward for grid infrastructure upgrades, which is just a fraction of what is necessary to the $2.2 trillion of infrastructure funding necessary to support 2050 climate change goals.

Of the 19 GW, more than half was installed since 2020—and those numbers would have been higher if it were not for the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting supply chain challenges and trade disputes.
The report tracks over 47,000 corporate solar installations nationwide, which generate enough electricity to power 3.2 million homes and offset 20.4 million metric tons of carbon annually. Analyzing commercial solar adoption, the report names Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Walmart and Microsoft as the top five corporate solar users in the country. The report said recent growth is due to the expansion of off-site corporate solar procurement, which now represents 55% of all commercial solar use. Almost 70% of all off-site corporate solar has been brought online since 2019.
While off-site solar saw the strongest growth, on-site commercial solar has averaged a steady 3% growth over the last five years. Target, Walmart, and real estate firm, Prologis, make up the top 3 companies for solar installed on site. The report notes that nearly 30% of Target stores have rooftop solar installed. Cold storage and logistics company, Lineage Logistics, has recently made a huge jump in its on-site solar, with over 87 MW installed in the past two years.

“About half of all corporate solar has been installed in the last two and half years,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO. “Solar Means Business highlights the incredible flexibility of solar, whether it’s installed on a warehouse roof, on a carport or at an off-site facility, showing the various ways that companies are meeting their needs with clean, affordable energy. From data centers to industrial freezers, the most energy-intensive business operations are turning to solar as the most reliable and affordable way to power their infrastructure.”
 

Meta (formerly Facebook) increased its installed solar capacity from 177 MW in early 2019 to 3.6 GW in 2022 and now has the largest corporate solar portfolio in the United States. Target remains the top onsite corporate solar user, while Microsoft joins the top 10 after installing 479 MW of new capacity since 2019.
“We are proud of the work we have done to add new solar energy to the grid, bringing additional investment to rural areas and helping support the transition to renewables,” said Urvi Parekh, head of renewable energy at Meta. “As we continue to fulfill our goal to support our global operations with 100% renewable energy, we look forward to working with others, including SEIA, to facilitate the energy transition and support a sustainable, affordable and reliable electricity grid.”

Walmart is no stranger to the list, as it has been in the top 5 for the last decade.
“Solar energy is a key part of Walmart’s commitment to become a regenerative company, powered by 100% renewable energy by 2035,” said Vishal Kapadia, senior vice president, energy transformation at Walmart. “Our onsite and offsite solar projects have helped us deliver strong progress toward our goal, with 46% of our global electricity needs supplied by renewable energy as of 2021.”
Many top companies, including Intel, Google, Switch and Digital Realty, have embraced solar energy to power data centers. The food and beverage giants Ab Inbev and Starbucks, health care companies including Kaiser Permanente and DaVita, and other top brands such as Home Depot and T-Mobile are all top 25 corporate solar users.
Energy storage
In addition, the report now tracks commercial solar projects that are paired with battery storage. In California, the percentage of on-site commercial solar installations that are paired with storage has jumped from 0.5% in 2015 to nearly 4% in 2022. The average battery size in 2022 was over 500 kWac. Off-site commercial solar installations are also increasingly paired with storage, and the numbers are expected to rise as utility-scale storage costs continue to fall.
With the emergence of large corporate buyers, the utility-scale solar space has been dramatically altered. It used to be that utilities were the off takers for large-scale solar projects, but in 2021, nearly a quarter featured at least one commercial buyer. Out of the top 25 companies in this report, 18 are pursuing 100% renewable energy or carbon neutrality. And 13 of the top 25 corporate solar users have joined the RE 100, an initiative of businesses that are committed to 100% renewable energy.

Future growth
Buoyed by the Inflation Reduction Act, both on-site and off-site solar markets are expected to double again over the next three years. Total commercial solar installations are expected to double again over the next 3 years with nearly 27 GW of off-site corporate solar projects scheduled to come online by 2025. The on-site market is expected to grow over 24% in the next five years, and off-site by 51%, although some projects will be delayed due to trade disputes, supply chain issues, and rising prices.
