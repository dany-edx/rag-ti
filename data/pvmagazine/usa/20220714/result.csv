An international research team has developed a new approach to improve land use at ground-mounted solar plants, which they claim could be used to add important wildlife habitats or even agricultural activity to land already in use by a conventional PV system.
“We initially developed our approach for existing solar plants installed in the region of Apulia in southern Italy, but it could be utilized in other regions or countries with different vegetation,” Teodoro Semeraro, an environmental scientist at Italy’s University of Salento who led the research, told pv magazine.”It could also be used for new projects that include agricultural use or rooftop installations combining green roofs with solar power generation, where the agricultural aspect would have less importance.”
The approach would see new vegetated land cover cultivated below and around solar installations, as potential habitat for pollinating insects or for agricultural activities including beekeeping and medicinal herb production. This approach would provide a series of additional advantages such as reduction of maintenance costs of green areas in solar parks, fire risk reduction, potential development of small-scale agricultural activities, and positive media coverage, among others.
The scientists pointed out that the selected vegetation to be grown at the solar parks should be able to adapt to the ground’s environmental conditions, water scarcity, and nutritional deficiency. “Our approach may also consider non-indigenous species, but from the point of view of the landscape and the protection of local biodiversity, the use of indigenous vegetation is desirable,” Semeraro stated. “Moreover, the local species are adapted to the climate and the lack of water, which is chronic in Apulia, so they could respond better. But, having said that, the use of non-native species is technically feasible at conditions that respond to specific project needs.”
According to the research, Beekeeping at these sites would not require invasive structures and hives could be laid on the ground during the blooming time. “The biodiversity and ecosystem services could persist over time even after ground-mounted PV systems are dismantled and continuing to support population welfare at both local and larger scale, guaranteeing sustainability,” they further explained, noting that beekeeping may help overcome the issue of monoculture, which is typical of the Apulia region.
The research listed a range of ecosystem services which solar parks could provide without additional human input, on the basis of the intrinsic value of the vegetation in sustaining ecosystem services. This would turn the solar parks into semi-natural areas, or Agro-Ecological Photovoltaic Gardens, which would host melliferous species blooming in different periods to be harvested and marketed as medicinal herbs. Furthermore, the solar panels may reduce the water stress for the vegetation, while improving soil quality thanks to their shading function.
When asked about what exactly defines agrivoltaics and make it differ from conventional ground-mounted solar facilities, Semeraro said that the crucial element is the presence of an agricultural enterprise in a project. “We cannot speak of agrivoltaics if a stakeholder in the agricultural field is not involved in the project or if there is no farm interested in the cultivation or use of the soil,” he stated. “There is a risk that a plant will be created without there being someone who cultivates it.”
The scientists introduced their approach in the study “An innovative approach to combine solar photovoltaic gardens with agricultural production and ecosystem services,” published in Ecosystem Services.
The group includes scientists from the University of Salento and the Institute of Science of Food Production C.N.R. Unit of Lecce, in Italy, as well as from the Glasgow Caledonian University in the United Kingdom.
“A transdisciplinary approach is important to share knowledge across the different stakeholders and bridge the information gaps typical of a sectoral perspective, creating a holistic vision of the involved professional skills and experiences,” the paper reads. “Its proper implementation requires the joint effort of all economic stakeholders together with technical and scientific experts to promote multifunctional land-use in ground-mounted solar farms.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/14/applying-agricultural-siting-guidelines-to-renewable-energy-permitting/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 14, 2022",Applying agricultural siting guidelines to renewable energy permitting,"Local officials, who may not be renewable energy experts, are tasked with drafting ordinances and approving permits for siting solar on local lands. A new white paper from the Center for Rural Affairs, “Exploring Siting Guidance: Agriculture Siting Matrices Inform Renewable Energy Siting” explains how the creation of a set of guidelines, also known as a siting matrix, can help.
“While a renewable energy siting matrix is a relatively new tool, the concept has been applied and used in other industries for years,” said Lindsay Mouw, policy associate for the Center and author of the paper. “The agricultural sector has used livestock siting matrices, which provide guidance for responsible siting of livestock animal feeding operations.”
In Iowa, for example, a Master Matrix was created in response to community and natural resource concerns about siting livestock. The matrix considers air, soil and water quality issues, and for anyone seeking to build or expand a confined animal feeding operation (CAFO), the final decision is based on compliance with CAFO regulations and the matrix score. If the application meets both requirements, then the Division of Natural Resources must approve it, regardless of county or public opposition.
One of the major advantages to the matrix is that it helps local officials make decisions by providing a list of factors to be considered. This means that local officials don’t have to be experts in livestock or land use. The same holds true for the renewable energy industry, where local officials may not be energy experts. According to Mouw, the development of statewide renewable energy siting matrices can help reduce barriers to renewable energy development by providing guidance to local decision makers while improving transparency, trust, and fairness in the siting process.
“Every county and community has unique features that should be carefully considered by planning and zoning officials, and these considerations should lead to zoning that addresses the needs of residents,” she said. “While identifying standards that will operate effectively in every county is difficult, recommending broad principles and thoroughly researched guidance that communities and officials can use during the project permitting process is a possibility.”
One of the drawbacks to the matrix, however, is that if it is mandatory, it reduces local decision-making power. This can limit the ability to make decisions based on community input, specific geographic considerations, or other unique factors. But as the paper points out, it offers consistency and may help developers navigate the siting process. A renewable energy siting matrix would consider factors such as safety, public health, cost-effectiveness, practicality, community interest, objectivity and science. Overall, the paper suggests that such a matrix could simplify the renewable energy siting and zoning process—providing transparency among developers, local officials, landowners and the public.
According to the Center for Rural Affairs, a renewable energy siting matrix could be developed through state legislative action. The paper describes the make up of a committees that would be tasked with defining the process and specifics of the matrix, and it details the numerous factors that it says must be considered when siting renewable projects. Ultimately when the siting matrix is be used voluntarily and purely as guidance, it can ease the challenges in permitting renewable energy.

VinFast currently builds the VF8, a mid-size electric SUV, and the VF9, a full-size electric SUV.
The incentive package includes a job development investment grant of $316 million over 32 years, state appropriation of $450 million, to cover site preparations, road improvements, and additional water and sewer infrastructure, community college training worth $38 million, a Golden Leaf Foundation grant of $50 million, and $400 million in incentives from Chatham County. Additionally, VinFast said it has received hundreds of millions of incentives from commercial organizations in the State of North Carolina, which is excluded from the government budget figure.
The funds join an investment of about $2 billion in the first phase of VinFast’s US manufacturing plans. The plant is designed to produce 150,000 electric vehicles each year.
The facility will cover 2,000 acres, and will be divided into two major production lines, one for electric car and bus production, and the other for ancillary industries for suppliers. The facility is expected to bring thousands of jobs to North Carolina once it is completed.
“North Carolina’s partnership with VinFast to bring good, clean energy jobs to North Carolina took an important step forward today with the signing of the budget,” said Roy Cooper, governor of North Carolina. “Electric vehicles, like the ones VinFast will produce in Chatham County, are a critical component of our strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build North Carolina into a hub for the clean energy economy.”
Phase one of the project is slated for the second half of 2022, and production is planned to commence in July 2024. The facility will be the first car factory in North Carolina’s history, and the largest economic development in the state to date.
“VinFast applauds North Carolina for their efforts and determination in advancing the state’s clean energy economy and carbon mitigation goals,” said Van Anh Nguyen, CEO of VinFast Manufacturing US. “This investment by the State of North Carolina is the starting point for a future marked by innovation, job creation, and economic growth. Today exemplifies how government and industry can come together to pursue a brighter future.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/14/can-homes-with-solarstorage-act-as-virtual-power-plants/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",,"JULY 14, 2022",Can homes with solar+storage act as virtual power plants?,"Prosumers, or customers who install solar panels on their roofs, live in homes that produce power which displaces power that the house would otherwise draw from the electric grid. Such homes act as virtual power plants (VPPs).
Most prosumers size their solar panels to generate enough power during the course of the year to offset the energy that the house would otherwise have bought from the grid, effectively yielding a zero-energy outcome for the year as a whole. Under net energy metering, it does not pay to install a larger system since any surplus at year-end is paid the wholesale price.
During certain times of day, usually in the late morning and early afternoon hours, solar panels typically produce more power than is consumed by the house. That power is exported to the grid, and that’s a more sophisticated manifestation of how these homes serve as a virtual power plant.
Prosumagers are consumers who pair their solar panels with a battery. Their homes represent the most sophisticated manifestation of the VPP idea. More and more, prosumers and prosumagers are on a time-of-use (TOU) rate. These rates convey the relative abundance of power from the grid during the off-peak hours and its relative scarcity during the peak hours, thereby helping balance demand and supply.
Prosumagers use the battery to engage in arbitrage against the TOU rate. I.e., they minimize the customer’s bill by charging the battery from the solar panels in the morning hours, when grid power is being sold at off-peak rates, and discharging the battery later in the day to power the house and avoid paying the peak period rate.
For example, if the prosumager is on PG&E’s EV2-A rate, the off-peak period begins at midnight and runs through 3 pm. The peak period begins at 4 pm and runs through 9 pm. All other hours are the mid-peak period. When the sun is charging the battery in the morning, the house is buying power from the grid at the lowest rate. When the battery begins discharging at 4 pm, the house avoids buying power at the most expensive rate. Typically, customers don’t let the battery discharge totally. They keep a certain amount of battery power in reserve, such as 30%, to guard against power outages.
Some solar+battery homes only use the battery for reliability purposes. They do not charge it and discharge it on a daily basis. Thus, 100% of battery power is available to be tapped when the house has a power outage.
Given California’s looming power shortages, a hypothesis has been put forward which would allow homes with solar+storage to be used as a virtual power plants (VPPs) when the grid encounters an emergency. A system-wide emergency would most likely arise during the peak period. Customers who would otherwise be avoiding the peak rate of 56 cents/kWh on the EV2-A rate by powering their home with the battery during such times would instead be paid $2 a kWh for exporting power from the battery to the grid.
This proposition sounds very attractive in theory. But will it pan out in practice? Using data from my house, I put it to a conceptual test on three dates. The first date is June 29 of this year. It was a mild weather day. My system of 25 panels (rated at 8 kW) produced 49.41 kWh’s that day. The house consumed 23.32 kWh’s. The balance was exported to the grid. I have paired my solar panels with an LG Chem battery rated at 9.8 kWh.
As the graph shows, the house was self-sufficient until almost midnight. I could have availed myself of the VPP mode and come out ahead.
How likely is it that the grid would encounter an emergency on such a day? In my opinion, not very likely.
Let’s now look at August 14-15, 2020 when the grid in California did encounter a serious emergency. Hundreds of thousands of customers lost their power on those dates because the grid came up short. The weather was very hot in much of the state and central air conditioners in most if not all homes were running flat out. The skies were smoky, reducing the amount of solar generation, both central scale and at home. The wind was not blowing, reducing the amount of wind generation at central scale.
The grid came up short of power in the late afternoon and early evening hours. Homes such as mine did not have much of a surplus to send to the grid. I was actually concerned whether I had enough to keep my lights on in case the grid lost power. Why would I have exported power to the grid on either day?
On August 14, my system generated 32.79 kWh and the house consumed 63.12 kWh (even though I had adjusted the thermostat upwards by a couple of degrees). As seen in the graph, around 5 pm, the battery was unable to keep up with the consumption in my house. I started importing power from the grid. This would not have been the time to release whatever battery power I had remaining to the grid, regardless of the price being offered to me.
A similar situation was encountered on the next day, August 15, when my system generated 34.76 kWh and the house consumed 60.55 kWh. On neither day would I have wanted to export any power from the battery to the grid. Instead, I wished I could have tapped into the battery in my Tesla Model 3 that was parked in the garage. When fully charged, the car’s battery holds upwards of 70 kWh’s of energy. My wish could not be fulfilled because Tesla does not allow power to be pulled from the battery to power either the house (or to export it to the grid). Additionally, I would need to install a two-way charger rather than the one-way charger I currently have in the garage.
Of course, that’s just the data from my system. Other systems might behave differently. Diversity might exist across customers on mild-weather days. But are those the days when the grid will have an emergency? Probably not.
An emergency is likely to arise on days when everyone’s consumption is really high as it was on August 14-15, 2020. On such days, customers would be hard pressed to meet their own needs, let alone export power to the grid. Diversity would disappear.
What if the customer has multiple batteries paired to their panels? Won’t they may have an exportable surplus on emergency days? Yes, but that essentially means they had overinvested in batteries. How many customers would do that?
What about customers who don’t discharge their batteries on a daily basis? All of their battery power is in reserve. They might consider exporting power to the grid but that would defeat the purpose if they know the grid has an emergency and could come up short. These are the most risk averse customers. Wouldn’t they be gun shy of losing their reserve margin on the very days when an outage is likely?
How about localized outages on the distribution system? Customers in other areas may be willing to export their power on such days. This might be a successful application of the VPP-during-emergency idea.

The $4 billion plan represents the largest economic development in the state’s history. 
The Kansas Department of Commerce and the Kansas City Area Development Council and its partners shared that the company’s plans create a need for up to 4,000 US manufacturing jobs. Panasonic has identified a site in De Soto, Kansas for the project, pending approval by Panasonic’s board of directors. 
Competition for this milestone project was strong and required a coordinated effort from the state, said Lieutenant Governor and Commerce Secretary David Toland. The enactment of the bipartisan Attracting Powerful Economic Expansion Act (APEX) earlier this year helped support Panasonic’s decision to choose Kansas. 
“Once Governor Kelly signed APEX into law,” Toland said, “the state gained the necessary economic development tool to pursue megaprojects that could transform the Kansas economy. Panasonic recognized Kansas as not just a contender, but as the ideal partner for this revolutionary project.” 
Kansas currently has an established battery manufacturing sector with seven establishments and about 1,300 jobs. The state ranked second in the nation for employment in the sector in 2021. With the new facility, Kansas is set to be a national industry leader in a sector that is projected to grow precipitously. 
“With the increased electrification of the automotive market, expanding battery production in the US is critical to help meet demand,” said Kazuo Tadanobu, President, CEO of Panasonic Energy. “Given our leading technology and depth of experience, we aim to continue driving growth of the lithium-ion battery industry and accelerating towards a net-zero emissions future.” 
More than 1 billion customers use Panasonic products every day, generating 86 million tons of CO2 emissions based on electricity consumption figures. This amounts to approximately 110 million tons of CO2 emissions across our entire value chain, a number that is equivalent to about 1% of total emissions from global electricity consumption. The company has entered an initiative to become net-zero in its business operations by 2030 and sets further goals for its sustainability by 2050.

San Francisco non-profit, Empowered by Light, launched an initiative to power the local chapter house with solar.
In Navajo Nation, the chapter house serves as a town hall where community members gather for meetings and have access to services, like distribution of hay, free trash disposal, faxing, printing, notarizing, and more.
EBL partnered with Sunnova Energy International Inc., Generac Power Systems, Inc., to provide a free solar plus battery storage system to power the Hard Rock Chapter House. The clean energy installation is meaningful to the residents here, who have lived on the land scarred by strip mining by coal companies.
“For many years now, our people have been opposed to coal mining on our lands and we still feel the effects of the mining today. With this new project, we can finally shift to renewables and show our entire community the benefits and resilience of nature by harnessing clean energy from the sun to power our daily activities at the Chapter House, while combating climate change,” said Jay Begay, Hard Rock Chapter House president, Navajo Nation. “Our community relies on the essential services provided at the Chapter House because we live in a very remote area. The Chapter’s goal is to continuously develop these services, and with the extra bill savings from our new solar + storage system, we aim to do just that – expand and better our resources for the people we serve.”
Sunnova worked with Fusion Power, a Sunnova Dealer, to design the solar plus storage system to meet the needs of the community. Sunnova and Generac worked together to equip and fund the 18 kW solar system and 36 kWh PWRcell energy storage system. Sunnova is providing a 25-year service warranty for the system.
“Generac is proud to support the Navajo Nation and help ensure that the community has much-needed resiliency and power when the sun isn’t shining,” said Keith Marett, President, Clean Energy – Commercial, Generac Power Systems. “Batteries allow for self-sufficiency in a way that solar alone doesn’t. The addition of a Generac PWRcell energy storage system to the solar installation means that the lights will stay on and the water will continue to run, even when the grid goes down.”
“About 14,000 Navajo families are still living without access to electricity, so in addition to having more resources for the community thanks to the utility bill savings from the Sunnova system, the Chapter House can continue serving as a great resource for the community when the grid fails,” said Moira Hanes, Executive Director and Co-Founder, EBL. “Community members can continue to gather, and also cook food, get emergency supplies, and stay warm in the winter since many homes don’t have a heat source.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/14/shipping-costs-remain-key-challenge-for-solar-sector/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 14, 2022",Shipping costs remain key challenge for solar sector,"From pv magazine global
New figures from Dutch financial services provider Rabobank shows that ocean container shipping costs have fallen from a record-breaking high in September 2021. However, they are still up to five times higher than in 2019 and the banking group has warned that it does not see a return to pre-pandemic lows on the horizon.
Driven by pandemic-related disruptions, international container freight rates have increased dramatically since January 2019, reaching a record price of nearly $10,400 in September 2021. In June 2022, the global freight rate index stood at almost $7,100.
The higher freight costs and supply-chain disruptions are affecting all industries, but solar PV is one of the most affected due to the high concentration of solar panel manufacturing in China. The elevated freight costs and shipping constraints are also affecting other system components like trackers, inverters, and batteries.
Rabobank says in its “Global Ocean Freight Outlook” that container freight prices will continue to gradually decline over the next 12 months from the “irrational” highs reached late last year. However, it said it does not expect them to return to pre-pandemic lows.
Viet Nguyen, a RaboResearch global supply chain analyst, said that shipping container prices were “never” expected to return to the low pre-pandemic rates of approximately $3,000 per container. However, Nguyen predicted they would decline from the current level of $7,000 to $78,000 per container mark in the year ahead.
Nguyen said several global “macro drivers” are influencing shipping dynamics. While heightened inflation and all-time low global consumer confidence levels are exerting downward pressure on ocean rates, Nguyen said rates are being supported at higher levels by imbalanced global trade flows, which hinder a cost-effective repositioning of empty containers.
“Added to this, geographical uncertainties are adding risks and there are also growing operational costs for the sector from higher energy costs and sustainability regulations,” he said.
While shipping rates are forecast to soften, Rabobank expects schedule reliability for containers to also recover, albeit slowly. Port congestion, a major contributor to the continuing supply disruptions, is forecast to remain at key ports until the first half of next year.

The comment period for both RFIs ends on July 28, 2022, at 3:00 p.m., with submissions online.
The Large Scale Renewables group released a Summary of Changes and Focus Areas that includes 19 subsections of potential changes. Within each subsection are questions on how the changes could be implemented by NYSERDA, along with requests for commentary on the broader global reality that developers are experiencing.

For instance, in section 2.2 on the topic of suspended import tariffs, NYSERDA asks developers whether or not they plan on buying modules before the end of the 24 month pause. NYSERDA also asks stakeholders whether or not they consider this purchasing strategy to be risky, and to explain the perceived risks and other factors that have been guiding their decisions.
These nuances are particularly important to understand because in this program, Tier 1 large capacity projects always take more than 24 months to deploy – after bids are secured. If there are large increases in solar panel pricing due to import tariffs years after a bid, then it will affect project finances and could imperil the viability of a project.
A second question related to increased costs is found in section 2.14. The New York “Buy-American” law requires certain iron and steel used in state-supported renewable energy facilities to be sourced domestically, unless specifically exempted by the head of the applicable state entity. After commissioning a series of studies, NYSERDA concluded that sourcing iron and steel domestically was not in the public interest due to increased costs and schedule delays as a result of manufacturer availability, steel availability, and other market dynamics.
With that in mind, NYSERDA is still aiming for increased US material in their installations, and is considering a “minimum dollar requirement” of $30,000 per MWdc (3¢/Wdc) related to iron and steel products.
A requirement of this nature could make the reopening of NexTracker’s new/old Pennsylvania steel facility a very intelligent decision.

The second RFI seeks to refine how large scale wind and solar projects are paid for the energy capacity they offer. The current marginal capacity value of wind and solar are noted in the graph above.
The RFI puts forth the new calculation methods being considered for defining these project revenue streams. These methods are especially important to project developers, since increasing capacity deployments of solar will send the capacity value of these resources towards 0%.
NYSERDA asks a series of twelve questions regarding the newly suggested calculations. Among them are the questions of what other factors ought to be considered, and what other generation resources (tidal, geothermal, etc.) ought to be modeled within the framework.
