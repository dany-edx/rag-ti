First Solar will  supply its thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) modules.
The partnership dates back to 2015 when silicon ranch became the first owner-operator of utility-scale PV plants utilizing First Solar modules. The expanded partnership shows a continued commitment to domestic supply and lower-carbon production processes. Silicon Ranch said the deal will support U.S. innovation, manufacturing expansion and job creation; improve the carbon footprint of its supply chain; and reduce volatility and logistics risks.

“One of our guiding principles at Silicon Ranch is that we choose the right path over the easier path to get the job done, and this agreement with First Solar represents the ‘right path’ for our module supply,” said Reagan Farr, co-founder and chief executive officer at Silicon Ranch. “In recent months, Silicon Ranch has re-affirmed our leadership in supporting US solar manufacturers and decarbonizing our supply chain, and we are pleased to achieve this progress by working collaboratively with our strategic partners to deliver the best possible power plants to serve our customers and communities across the US.”
In addition to making long-term agreements with First Solar, Silicon Ranch has partnered with Nextracker to improve the carbon footprint of its tracker supply, while supporting additional investments in US manufacturing capabilities.
“Since the beginning of our relationship, it has been clear that Silicon Ranch places genuine emphasis on responsible solar development, and with the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV technology, First Solar delivers reliable and responsibly produced modules right in line with this vision,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer at First Solar.
In August, First Solar announced plans to invest up to $1.2 billion in scaling production of American-made solar modules, an investment that is forecast to expand the company’s ability to produce modules for the U.S. solar market to over 10 GWDC by 2025.
As part of its push to scale U.S. production of solar modules, the company intends to build its fourth, fully vertically integrated domestic factory, with an annual capacity of 3.5 GWDC, in the U.S. Southeast. The company said it expects to invest up to $1 billion in the new factory, which, contingent upon permitting and pending approval of various federal, state, regional, and local incentives, is expected to begin operations in 2025.
Solar project developers seeking the maximum value from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are required to meet minimum thresholds of domestic content in their projects. A 10% adder is applied to the ITC for projects that reach domestic content requirements. To qualify, 100% of any steel or iron that is a component of the facility must be produced in the United States, and 40% of all components of the facility must be produced in the United States. Products will be deemed to have been produced domestically if not less than 40% of the total costs across all such manufactured products of such facility are attributable to manufactured products that are mined, produced or manufactured in the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/21/u-s-corporate-funding-of-solar-reached-18-7-billion-through-nine-months-this-year/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 21, 2022",U.S. corporate funding of solar reached $18.7 billion through nine months this year,"In a report that tracks solar funding through the first nine months (9M) of 2022, Mercom Capital said that $18.7 billion of corporate investments took place in the United States solar industry. The figure represented an 18% decrease from the $22.8 billion raised in 9M 2021. This total includes all venture capital funding, public market, and debt financing in the industry. Over 51 GW of projects were acquired over this time period.
“Corporate funding in 9M 2022 is behind pace year-over-year, impacted by inflation and high-interest rates but is still ahead compared to the previous six years. There is renewed momentum after the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States. We have seen a resurgence in VC and private equity funding, breaking funding records since 2010. There is no longer any doubt about the growth potential of the solar industry – it is now a race to acquire the right technology and portfolios to scale,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.
The top venture capital deals were $750 million raised by Intersect Power, $500 million raised by Longroad Energy, $375 million raised by Palmetto, $360 million by Gokin Solar, $350 million raised by Agilitas Energy, $260 million raised by Sun King.
Public market financing reached $4.9 billion over 11 deals, 22% lower than $6.3 billion over 23 deals in 2021. Announced debt financing was $8.3 billion in 48 deals, 42% lower than 9M 2021 when $14.2 billion was raised in 50 deals. Eight securitization deals totaled $2.3 billion, a 28% decrease compared to $3.2 billion in 11 deals in 9M 2021. Cumulatively, over $13.4 billion has been raised through securitization deals since 2013.
Project developers and independent power producers (IPP) were the largest acquirers of solar projects in Q3 2022, purchasing 10.8 GW. This was followed by investment firms with 2.4 GW, and oil and gas companies, which acquired 345 MW of projects. Installers acquired 252 MW of projects, and electric utilities acquired 240 MW. Other companies acquired a total of 180 MW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/21/global-installed-pv-capacity-could-hit-260-gw-in-2022/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 21, 2022",Global installed PV capacity could hit 260 GW in 2022,"From pv magazine Global
The IEA PVPS recently published its latest report on “Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2022.” It estimates, “with a reasonable firm level of certainty,” that the world installed a minimum of 173.5 GW of new solar capacity in 2021, representing a 22% year-on-year growth. That makes 2021 another record-breaking year, despite the pandemic-related perturbations.
“The markets reached incredible numbers last year, but they will probably be even higher this year,” Gaëtan Masson, co-author of the report and co-chair at the European Solar Manufacturing Council, told pv magazine. “Without trade disruptions as we’ve seen in the last two years, my bet is that the market will reach 260 GW.”
He said this prediction is “roughly on line” with the predictions of an undisclosed company.
“Looking at production numbers , we had 153 GW of wafers produced in the first six months of the year, so it is not totally impossible to see a market of around 250 GW to 260 GW,” he added.
European manufacturing
Last year, the European Union came second in terms of new installed solar capacity with 28.7 GW, after China with 55 GW.
“Most probably we will see production capacities in all segments of the value chain in Europe in the coming years. I think that the atmosphere has changed significantly, policy makers started to understand that there is no growth without local manufacturing,” said Masson.
However, most European manufacturing projects happening at national level are too small to be competitive.
“There is a political will, there is an industry need, but the conditions are too favourable in the U.S. or in India for the time being, so we will lose a certain number of projects which only a few months ago were supposed to be developed in Europe,” Masson noted.
This problem of competitiveness will not be solved at the policy level through the European Commission, he said. He argues that European PV manufacturing isn’t lacking policy instruments at the European level, but rather massive investment and continuous technology development at the national level.
“If you want to remain competitive, you need to be flexible, you need to develop new production lines mostly on a yearly basis, with lower cost, to benefit not only from economies of scale, but also from technology improvements, and lower cost of manufacturing,” he said.
Continuous investment in the order of €1 billion (USD 977 million) a year will be needed to replace Europe’s current “static projects,” added Masson.
“That’s probably the key challenge that will not be solved by public support. It must be understood by the investors that it will be a multibillion investment for each company, with a continuous need for fresh money, and increase of production capacities,” he concluded. “The market will follow up – there’s no problem.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/21/xendee-microgrid-design-platform-update-includes-inflation-reduction-act-incentives/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 21, 2022",Xendee microgrid design platform update includes Inflation Reduction Act incentives,"Xendee, a microgrid design and decision support software developer, has launched a series of new features that integrate the latest tax incentives from the new Inflation Reduction Act directly into its platform.
In August, the US House of Representatives passed the landmark Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, hailed as the most significant piece of climate legislation in history. The 700+ document is not simple reading, and myriad groups have begun to distill the salient points for the solar industry. BlueGreen Alliance, for example, recently released a user guide to help energy professionals understand how to implement the incentives.
Now Xendee offers help by way of its modeling software, which is designed to allow engineers to design projects with the incentives in mind. The software enables them to see in advance how projects are going to pencil out, once the incentives are applied. Xendee expects that this modeling will result in more financially viable projects and increased investment in microgrids.
“These new features allow engineers to proactively design and optimize their energy project based on the real value streams and incentives that are available,” said Zack Pecenak, lead engineer at Xendee. “Instead of just adding these savings in later as a line item, this allows Xendee to plan and optimize the system around the new tax incentives. This creates both a more accurate view of project financials and allows Xendee to optimize the projects in light of the incentives. For instance, the applied tax credit may change which technologies are chosen or how they are sized or placed.”
To implement tax savings in the Xendee platform, users are now provided with an extended widget for each applicable technology. Users can then opt to implement the tax savings and can select the incentive they would like to apply. For instance, the investment tax credit (ITC) is a 30% credit that can be applied to both residential and commercial solar PV installations. Alternatively, engineers can elect to use the production tax credit (PTC), which pays tax incentives based on their production. Because you cannot opt for both incentives, Xendee allows the modeling of both systems as well as the capabilities to analyze each and determine which solution would be more beneficial to the project. Read more about the PTC here.
The PTC tax credit also applies to green hydrogen projects, and Xendee reports that it’s got that covered, too. Xendee already enabled modeling of  hydrogen production, storage, but now engineers can model the ramifications of the $3 tax credit per kilogram of green hydrogen produced.
“Xendee’s new tax incentive features give decision makers an opportunity to consider sustainable technologies that may have earlier been financially unattractive or completely out of the scope of the project,” said Michael Stadler, co-founder and CTO of Xendee. “For instance, with the incentives for hydrogen production, a facility that never would have considered it might become a net exporter of hydrogen or even use it to power their own fleet of vehicles.”
