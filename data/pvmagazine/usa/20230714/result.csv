RMI released data dashboards and state scorecards for 20 states, which assess where states are at in terms of reducing emissions.
Climate policies take many shapes from Maryland setting an ambitious clean energy target, to Massachusetts with its green bank for housing, to Minnesota’s binding transportation emissions standards, and Colorado’s passage of an innovative industry package.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden last August, is the largest climate and energy spending package in U.S. history. The bill includes $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is dedicated to renewables and climate resilience. The IRA mandates a nationwide reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030 and aims for energy savings for Americans.
The IRA, along with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and other federal policies, are incentivizing states to maximize these benefits for its residents and businesses. The RMI scorecards assess the progress that states are making in enacting policy that, if implemented collectively, would put the U.S. on the path to achieving its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target. The NDC target is part of the Paris Agreements, which set the U.S. on a path to reducing emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030.
Some economy-wide policies noted in the report are those in Washington, New York, Massachusetts and Colorado. Washington, for example, has a carbon pricing program. Most notably, Washington’s policies put its entire economy on track to reduce emissions to levels lower than those defined by an NDC policy package. Colorado recently passed tax credits aimed at accelerating the uptake of clean technologies across sectors.
Building and industry policy is lacking in most states, according to the report, however New York has adopted innovative building performance standards and the major city policy, Local Law 97, is seen in the scorecard as a driver of near-term building emissions reductions. Colorado is incentivizing use of clean hydrogen in high-impact industrial end uses.
Other policies that the scorecard authors would like to see in greater numbers include zero-emission vehicle standards, EV adoption, heat pump uptake, renewable portfolio standards, and strong building codes.

To create the scorecards, RMI chose a group of 20 states with significant emissions that also have diversity of industries, geographic location and political makeup. RMI partnered with Climate XChange to collect and review every major state climate policy passed before June 2023 for those 20 states. It used the state-specific Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) models, an open-source data tool co-developed by Energy Innovation and RMI, to quantify the impact of current policies in 2030. Then the group compared 2030 emissions from the current policy scenario with the state’s emissions in 2005, a common emissions benchmark year for climate targets, and an NDC-aligned scenario based on a policy package that achieves US climate targets.
Taking the good with the bad, in addition to tracking progress at the economy-wide and sector levels, the state scorecards show which sub-sector level metrics across states are the furthest behind when it comes to meeting NDC-alignment.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/14/pegasus-solar-introduces-roof-mount-with-integrated-sealant/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 14, 2023",Pegasus Solar introduces roof mount with integrated sealant,"Pegasus Solar unveiled a new roof mount for solar installations on composite shingles called InstaFlash. The mount is pre-installed with a watertight sealant designed to address roof irregularities and seal any missed pilot holes, cracked shingles and shingle seams. 
Pegasus Solar said the mount is designed to make it easy-to-install in a variety of composite roof configurations and weather conditions. The sealant instantly deploys when the mount is fastened to the roof, instantly creating a watertight seal. It seals any potential water ingress points under the entire footprint of the 4.6” wide base. 
Kai Stephan, chief executive officer of Pegasus Solar said that InstaFlash is “new guy proof,” as it “virtually eliminates the potential for user-error.” 
The non-hardening sealant is housed in a cage that contains where the sealant spreads when deployed, preventing any messes and directing the material to the point where it is needed. InstaFlash can be installed in freezing temperatures or extreme heat (0 F to 170 F) and can be installed in rain without leaks.
For sloped roofs it can be installed on composition shingle or rolled asphalt, and for flat roofs it can be mounted on modified bitumen or built-up roofs. 
“When a fastener lands in the so-called ‘slot-canyon’ between shingles, water can pass under a rigid tape, mastic or rubber-type barrier,” said Kai Stephan, chief executive officer of Pegasus Solar. “We realized we needed a semi-liquid sealant to fully penetrate and seal this gap to eliminate any potential for leaks.”
The mount comes with a 25-year warranty, is IBC and CBC code compliant, and UL certified. Full specification sheet can be found here. 
“We approached this design from a clean slate,” said Stephan. “The guiding principle was, ‘What are the toughest challenges for a comp roof mount, and how can we solve those challenges with a product that’s easy enough for the newest installer to master?’”
Pegasus Solar also provides rail systems, tile scissor mounts, tilt leg kits, tile replacements, conduit and accessory mounts, MLPE brackets, and wire management systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/14/texas-curtailed-9-of-solar-generation-in-2022/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 14, 2023",Texas curtailed 9% of solar generation in 2022,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) curtailed 5% of its wind generation and 9% of its solar generation in 2022.
Power curtailment is the deliberate reduction in output that otherwise could have been produced. It typically occurs when supply exceeds demand and wholesale power prices drop to zero or even negative. It is a common occurrence for solar and wind energy, as these technologies have intermittent cycles of generation, requiring a different set of engineering solutions to support them.
Two main constraints in Texas are leading to high levels of curtailment: lack of transmission and energy storage. Utility-scale Texas solar facilities are often built in the western part of the state, where land is less expensive and solar irradiance is higher. Much of this huge amount of generation is transmitted to cities in the east, passing through bottlenecks in the grid along the way.
Constraints in transmission can be alleviated in four ways. First, more transmission can be built, leading to less bottlenecks in the grid. However, this task is not inexpensive. Currently, there are $7.46 billion of future transmission improvement projects that are expected to be put into service between 2022 and the end of 2027, according to ERCOT. These costs will be passed on to home and business owners in the form of utility bill increases.
A second strategy to alleviate constraints and cut curtailments is the installation of energy storage. Storage facilities can “time shift” or store low-cost, off-peak energy, and discharge it during periods of high demand. Battery energy storage can provide additional support to electricity grids to manage demand through ancillary services, managing load, congestion, and resiliency services. At the 2022 RE+ conference in San Antonio, solar and storage developer 8minute Energy shared that 95% of revenues in a two-hour duration battery occur in the first hour of discharge in Texas.
A third method that is discussed less often in the booming utility-scale state of Texas is a more conscious choice of where to site projects and how to right-size them for the most benefit. Rather than building massive low-cost solar facilities that deliver lowered value and require billions in transmission upgrades, solar projects can be installed in a distributed fashion, bringing them closer to where the energy is in demand.
This allows generation to be installed at the distribution level, sending electricity over shorter distances and lowering line losses. It also alleviates the congested transmission superhighway, creating a more dynamic grid. This is especially true when distributed solar is installed with co-located energy storage, which enables revenue-creating demand response services and virtual power plants.
As a fourth strategy, at times of “surplus” renewable generation, customers with flexible demand for electricity can use more electricity that would otherwise be curtailed.
In a grid the size of Texas, at 15% renewable generation flexible demand could yield $3.3 billion in annual net savings for all consumers, including those with non-flexible demand, says the ESIG report by Michael Hogan, citing a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory study.
About 80% of cost reductions yielding those annual savings would result from avoided costs of investing in infrastructure—generation capacity, transmission and distribution hardware.
With increasing adoption of “inherently flexible loads” such as EVs and heat pumps, there is a growing potential for price-responsive demand, according to the report. To avoid unnecessary infrastructure investments and capture the cost savings, the ESIG calls for progressively assessing and incorporating expected demand elasticity into long-term capacity planning and procurement, at both the bulk system and distribution levels, among other measures.
The constraint problem in Texas will likely need to be solved in a combination of all three strategies. EIA projects that if no improvements are made to the ERCOT grid, curtailments of wind could reach 15% and solar as high as 19%.
About 64% of the wind and solar curtailments in EIA analysis occurred when the energy supply from high wind and solar resources outpaced low system electricity demand. An increase in demand, such as through battery charging, could potentially reduce these types of curtailments, said EIA.

As we strive to achieve our climate goals and transition to a carbon-neutral future by 2050, it is imperative that we accelerate the global energy transition. Innovation has proven to be the engine powering the global energy transformation towards a carbon-neutral future.
But innovative efforts should not only focus on the supply side of energy systems, where we have already witnessed significant progress in the last years — wind and solar show remarkable growth pace over the last years – but also on the demand side. By embracing smart electrification and integrating more solar photovoltaic (PV) power, we can revolutionize the way we consume energy and achieve a sustainable and resilient energy system. In this column, we will explore the benefits and opportunities presented by smart electrification, highlighting the role of solar PV integration in transforming our end-use sectors.
Electrifying End-Use Sectors
Both direct and indirect electrification with renewable power offer feasible solutions to electrify many end-use sectors thanks to sharp cost reductions for wind and solar technologies. Electricity consumption is expected to increase from the current 22% to 51% of final energy consumption in 2050, out of which 91% will be produced from renewables, according to IRENA analysis.
A Systemic Approach to Innovation is not only smart, but critical
Yet, the transport and heating sectors are still largely based on fossil fuels. To tackle this challenge, the transformation towards an electrified energy system, must follow a holistic and smart approach. Otherwise, we will miss out on the opportunities offered by cleaner and affordable renewable energy generation and overload the power grid. A systemic innovation approach goes beyond technological innovation and merely substituting one technology with another but includes innovations in market design, system planning and operation, and business models. Only by matching and leveraging synergies in innovations in all parts of power system and end-use sectors and including all relevant actors and stakeholders, successful solutions can be implemented on the ground.
To help turn this new paradigm into reality, IRENA’s new Innovation Landscape Report for Smart Electrification identifies 100 key innovations across three transformation avenues: power-to-mobility, power-to-heat and cooling, and power-to-hydrogen. Smart electrification offers a cost-effective pathway to decarbonize energy systems. By electrifying energy end-use sectors and managing these loads in a smart way, we can unlock flexibility in the power system, to integrate large shares of variable renewables. Therefore, smart electrification provides three key benefits:
Harnessing the potential of photovoltaics
The Innovation Landscape Report is a toolbox for policymakers to design smart electrification strategies, tailored to their own context.
The characteristic features of Solar PV bring major benefits to the energy transition when being integrated smartly into the energy system. The report identifies several “blind spots” – issues that are sometimes overlooked and can hinder the success of smart electrification strategies or have the potential to accelerate electrification. One of them is that co-locating EV charging points with solar generation can minimize the impact on the grid. Peak solar generation occurs in the middle of the day when most passenger vehicles are parked. Workplace charging, combined with solar photovoltaic rooftop arrays and solar canopies over parking lots can decrease the overall EV load on the grid. Furthermore, off-grid solar charging systems can accelerate the switch to EVs in places with low-capacity grids, avoiding the need for costly grid expansion.
In the heating and cooling sectors, an important blind spot is the temperature as the critical variable. Distinguishing between low temperature needs in buildings and district heating, and high temperature needs in industrial sectors, is crucial. Another ‘blind spot’ brings attention to the growing cooling demand and its synergies with solar PV integration, which need to be considered in energy planning. Reversible heat pumps supply cooling at low additional cost make thermal networks more efficient and profitable because they can provide services throughout the year. Since peak cooling demands and peak solar energy occur simultaneously, the growing cooling demand can be coupled with solar PV and ease the increasing solar PV’s penetration. Arizona County demonstrated that 55% of the electricity demand for cooling can be met by solar generation. Even a larger share of this demand could be met if buildings were pre-cooled during the sunniest hours, taking advantage of buildings’ thermal storage capabilities. However, effective energy planning measures are required to meet the greater cooling demand in the most cost-effective ways.
Similarly, in Nigeria, for example, the proposed ice-based energy storage with solar PV-powered refrigeration can reduce energy consumption by up to 40% in a cooling-as-a-service business model.
These examples show how systemic innovation is essential to electrify our energy system in a smart way, maximize the potential of wind and solar generation and avoid locked-in decision-making that will delay the decarbonization of our energy systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/14/solar-powers-manufacturing-of-concrete-utility-poles/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,INDIANA",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 14, 2023",Solar powers manufacturing of concrete utility poles,"Valmont Industries announced the completion of a 718 kW ground mount solar installation that uses Valmont Solar’s own Convert-1P tracker. The energy generated by the system is expected to avoid 400 tons of carbon emissions, offsetting 100% of emissions from the manufacturing of concrete utility poles in the Bristol, Indiana facility.
Valmont partnered with Ameresco, a cleantech integrator and renewable energy asset developer, to build the solar array.
“As part of the long-term need for critical infrastructure investment, we recognize the vital role transmission, distribution and substation structures will play in the energy transition super cycle as well as the importance of sustainability in the products, services and solutions we deliver that conserve resources and improve life,” said Aaron Schapper, president of Valmont Infrastructure.”
The solar modules are mounted on 70 Convert single-axis solar trackers. Valmont acquired the Convert tracker business in 2018 when it took at 75% stake in the company.

The 1P tracker is reportedly optimized to adapt to the topography of the land, and is designed for use in utility-scale as well as distributed generation installations.
In addition to solar, Valmont is taking other steps to reduce emissions in its manufacturing process. The facility is incorporating a concrete mix that uses supplemental cementious materials of steel slag, such as waste material from furnace-burned steel production. Traditional cement production is known as a carbon-intensive process, 90% of which are from the kiln where limestone and silica (shale and sand) are heated to create the material called “clinker” necessary in making cement. Of those emissions, 60% comes from “process emissions,” or the chemical decomposition of limestone in kiln. The other 30% comes from the combustion of fossil fuels to reach the high temperatures required to continually make cement, according to the Department of Energy.
After having been used for decades, Valmont reports that slag cement has proven to be strong and sustainable. According to the company, however, it has never been used at scale in utility pole production. Valmont plans to fully transition all six of its concrete utility pole facilities across the country to the eco-concrete mixture within the next 12 months. The company estimates that the rollout could reduce carbon emissions by 12,000 tons annually across these manufacturing facilities.
“Grid hardening has fundamentally changed the utility pole market and we are innovating with a sustainably focused mindset to meet the demand,” Schapper said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/14/the-last-net-metered-project-in-indiana/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,INDIANA",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JULY 14, 2023",The last net-metered project in Indiana,"Reimagined Power Guidance Energy Group (RPG) partnered with Florida-based Castillo Engineering to build a PV model meant to power automation and instrumentation manufacturing company Endress+Hauser’s measuring and control devices in Greenwood, Ind. Constructed with bifacial solar panels and ballasted racking, the project is expected to save Endress+Hauser $140,000 in operational costs in the first year.
The instrumentation manufacturer produces flow meters for liquid, gas and steam systems, and this project is expected to help Endress+Hauser offset the production of thousands of flow meters annually. 
That savings in energy and cost is due to the company’s adherence to a six-month deadline to meet specific regulatory and operational guidelines that exempted them from Indiana’s 2017 law that revoked net-metering. They had to apply for and receive permission to connect to Indiana’s utility grid from local utility companies within six months of finishing construction.
“We knew we could trust Castillo Engineering’s extensive expertise to help us meet the tight timeline for delivery of both the electrical engineering for interconnection and structural feasibility analysis required for construction,” said vice president of Design and Engineering at RPG Energy Group, Colton Cooper.  
From 2004 to 2017, residential and commercial PV system owners could, through net metering, sell their unused solar at the end of each month to utility companies at the same rate those businesses charged them for electricity. Another option was re-generating unused power month to month indefinitely on a credit-based system. 
Al Bacon, vice president of Operations and Engineering at Endress+Hauser, said RPG was the only company that could meet tight deadlines for achieving the net metering requirement that afforded them such savings. “We went from initial proposal to completion in eight months,” he said. 
The new bill cuts what customers could have earned selling back excess solar power to utility companies by 70%. “The rates are so unpalatable that only two Northern Indian Public Service Company (NIPSCO) customers have installed rooftop solar since July 1, 2022,” said Ben Inskeep, program director at Citizens Action Coalition (CAC). The company is reported to serve more than 1.2 million customers worldwide. 
“We are grateful to have had this additional opportunity to work alongside RPG to deliver substantial long-term savings to this business,” said Christopher Castillo, CEO of Castillo Engineering. “RPG’s expertise in industrial scale, behind-the-meter solar projects was crucial in the success of this project, which had two separate electrical services and meters that had to be assessed to maximize energy offset and utility bill savings.”
