https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/23/california-unlikely-to-reach-clean-energy-targets-without-rooftop-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 23, 2024",California unlikely to reach clean energy targets without rooftop solar,"California, once known as a clean energy leader, has fallen off track to meet its clean energy goals. This is the view that was shared last week by the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) on a panel discussion at the Intersolar North America conference in San Diego, California.
The state passed a bill in 2018 targeting 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. Governor Gavin Newsom recently set an interim target of 90% carbon-free electricity by 2035, accelerating the clock for deployment.
When considering the state’s ambitious goals for whole home electrification and the halt of new gas-powered car sales by 2035, electricity demand is only expected to rise sharply, making these goals even more ambitious.
The California Energy Commission (CEC) projects that the state will need to build 6 GW of solar-plus-storage every year for the next 26 years straight to meet the 2045 target. Over the past five years, California has only averaged about half of the 6 GW deployment figure.
“We started to get on pace in the past two years, but it is driven at least 50% by the distributed [rooftop solar] market,” said CALSSA executive director Bernadette del Chiaro.
On this march toward 100% carbon-free power, California shot itself in the foot, passing Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0, a policy that cut customer compensation for exporting power to the grid. Combined with a high interest rate environment, project economics for rooftop solar in California have eroded, and demand has imploded.
CALSSA reports that roughly 17,000 rooftop solar jobs have been lost, demand for rooftop solar has fallen about 80%, and solar business insurer Solar Insure told pv magazine usa that 75% of its covered companies are considered a “high risk” for bankruptcy. Major publicly traded global equipment providers like Enphase and SolarEdge have made significant cuts to their workforce.

California has averaged about 2.3 GW of utility-scale solar-plus-storage installations over the past few years, far behind the pace to reach that near mid-century goal of 100% carbon free power. Del Chiaro said she believes the goal is impossible to reach with a utility-scale only model, which the state seems to be hurdling itself toward.
Just add storage?
NEM 3.0 was supported by CPUC to push the state forward from a standalone solar-only market to one defined by combined solar and energy storage. While the new rate environment does support the economics of a solar-plus-storage project over a standalone one, it no longer represents a cash-flow positive benefit to the homeowner, making it a very difficult sale.
Ross Williams, chief executive officer of HES Solar, a regional installer operating in California, shared this grim reality in the Intersolar panel discussion. What was once a $20,000 to $25,000 standalone solar system with a five-to-seven-year payback turned into a solar-plus-storage system that costs $40,000 to $45,000 that has a nine-to-ten-year return.
“You weigh that against all the other options in the investing world, and that is not a good option,” said Williams. “Simply adding storage increased the cost by almost double.”
At the same time, high interest rates have further squeezed the industry, making it more expensive borrow money to pay for systems. Williams said a $25,000 standalone system used to be a cash flow-positive investment under, meaning on an annualized basis, paying for the loan would cost less than simply remaining with the traditional utility company. Now, with a $40,000 project and higher financing costs, customers would expect to pay more for power with a solar-plus-storage.
“It’s not as simple as ‘just add storage,’” said Williams.
Part of what made the NEM 3.0 decision such a disaster for rooftop solar companies were the wild oscillations of business it caused. For HES Solar, a rush of consumers trying to secure NEM 2.0 rates led to its first quarter booking 20% more sales than the entirety of 2022. Once NEM 3.0 went into effect in April 2023, sales went to zero for HES Solar.
“We had one sale in May. In the first quarter we sold 600 systems. I’m telling you it went to zero,” said Williams.
When July and August came around for HES Solar and sales were still 50% of what they needed to be to retain staff, Williams had to begin to lay off staff. A similar story has plagued most of the rooftop solar installers in the state, leading to the some 17,000 jobs lost.
CALSSA warned that the next couple of months could be even worse, as this is typically a slow season for rooftop solar. Cash flow issues and going concerns are likely to be raised in the first quarter of 2024, said Del Chiaro.
Changes
The Intersolar panelists warned that California may be only the beginning for the fall of rooftop solar. Del Chiaro said 15 to 20 states are already mulling cuts to net metering, including Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and others. She said utilities have the wind at their backs now, citing California’s decision to cut net metering as justification for their own cuts.
CALSSA said it is currently focused on supporting changes that can get the industry through the next six months, suggesting changes to keep businesses alive. Brad Heavner, director of policy for CALSSA shared steps for stopping the bleeding. Short of reversing NEM 3.0, CALSSA’s specific recommendations include:
As currently structured, utilities in California and much of the nation have a perverse incentive to inefficiently spend money on transmission projects. The more capital utilities spend on infrastructure, the more they can get rate increases approved.
Customer-sited solar is preferable to centralized utility-scale solar when it comes to reducing transmission needs, systemwide costs and efficiency and transmission line losses. It also cuts down on the development of otherwise usable land. California’s largest solar-plus-storage facility just went online, and to power over 200,000 homes, over 4,600 acres of previously undisturbed land was developed into a sheet of nearly two million solar panels.
Customer-sited solar represents competition to utility sales and directly cuts its potential earnings base. In return, it offers customers local-clean energy that is more efficient in its operations, more environmentally friendly, and more predictable in cost.
“Getting the utility to stop fighting customer solar is ultimately the thing that is needed in California and around the world,” said Heavner. “We’ve had it in our head for years, how do we change this perverse incentive. It’s a hard thing to undertake, but I’m hearing more talk about it.

Developed in partnership with Nomad Transportable Power Solutions, the new product is a towable lithium-ion battery system with integrated EV charging. The device is designed to serve events, remote locations, disaster response events, or for flexible EV fleet management.
The product, called Zero Emissions e-Boost (ZEeB), is a 500 kw power capacity unit containing Kore Power lithium-ion battery cells with 1.3 MWh of energy storage capacity. It can deliver more than five hours of EV charging with a 240 kW charger, and more than 10 hours with a 120 kW charger. The company stated plans to release 750 kW and 1 MW versions later in 2024.
“While many battery energy storage solutions are available in the U.S. market, they are severely limited by dependence on a high-power, near-site grid connection for recharging,” said Nathan Mazurek, chief executive officer, Pioneer Power Solutions. “By pairing a mobile battery energy storage solution with a mobile, low-carbon recharge system, we are opening immense possibilities for our customers.”
The company reports that the ZEeB is charger brand-agnostic and able to connect with 3-phase, 2-phase, and single-phase devices. It supports 480 V, 240 V, or 120 V power applications.
“Whenever electricity becomes unavailable at a site, these units transform instantly into integral parts of a microgrid or Distributed Energy Resource, which we believe places them years ahead of their competition when it comes to peak demand shaving and resiliency,” said Mazurek.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/23/how-large-scale-solar-developers-can-tackle-community-opposition/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"JANUARY 23, 2024",How large-scale solar developers can tackle community opposition,"Perceptions around large-scale solar project development, and the impacts of the projects, continue to be one of the key concerns that stakeholders keep in mind when thinking of hosting these projects in their communities, according to a new study from Berkeley Lab, Michigan State University, and the University of Michigan.
The study is based on 54 interviews with residents, developers and policy makers, about seven large-scale solar projects in the U.S., defined as ground-mount photovoltaic projects that are equal to or more than 1 MWdc.
The research seeks to address what it calls an important information gap – that is, while rural Americans broadly support large-scale solar, local opposition to proposed projects is also increasing, with developers pointing to community opposition as one of the reasons for delayed and canceled projects. At the same time, there isn’t much data on the perception of these projects among local communities. 
As solar deployments across the U.S. continue to grow – one estimate from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie suggests the market is set to triple by 2028, touching 380 GW of installed solar capacity – developers are working to find new locations for projects, including things like underutilized parking lots, timberland and farmland. But developers still face plenty of opposition from local communities who point to blocked views, noise and environmental concerns, among others. 
The new paper essentially tries to answer two questions: identifying the most prevalent concerns that residents have about large-scale solar projects; and looking at what strategies developers and others could employ to improve those perceptions. 
The researchers found that planning processes and local impacts of large-scale solar projects remain a key concern. The seven sites that the study focused on span regions, ownership structures and ecosystems, but all raised concerns among local stakeholders regarding development impacts. Specifically, the authors noted, local residents and officials were concerned about the information provided to them, and their lack of influence on project design. 
The research also produced multiple measures that its authors say could address these concerns. For instance, there is a need to bolster direct engagement between developers and operators of projects, local officials and community members, which should begin earlier and be more frequent and in-person – not just during the development process, but also while the project is in operation or being decommissioned, the report said. The authors stressed the need to go beyond the format of public meetings and town halls, and instead recommended strategies that “stress in-person contact and communication, and presume residents have a meaningful role in influencing project design.”
Developers can also turn to third-party, local intermediaries to liaise with the community and local officials, the report’s authors recommend. In addition, they stress the need to ensure residents are well aware of both the benefits and burdens tied with going ahead, or restricting, project development.
“This included inviting individuals in from neighboring communities that had undergone solar development to share about their experiences, both good and bad, with a focus on the opportunity costs of decisions that in the short-term may be seen as victories for residents, but later may generate regret,” the report stated.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/23/solar-canopies-as-a-central-pillar-of-ira-driven-energy-transition/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 23, 2024",Solar canopies to help IRA-driven energy transition,"From pv magazine Global
The unprecedented opportunity offered by the IRA, to invest in domestic clean energy production and investment, requires careful equilibrium, not only in terms of economic expansion through domestic production but also in line with the need to achieve federal greenhouse gas reduction targets. The complex dance between economic growth and environmental sustainability requires a nuanced and vigilant approach. As the United States embarks on this journey, it is important to monitor and navigate this space with acumen to ensure that economic prosperity aligns harmoniously with environmental goals.
From a macroeconomic perspective, a closer examination of the IRA execution process reveals a critical nexus between policy incentives and the effective use of available spaces. This intersection is particularly important when it comes to open spaces throughout the country, both public and private. To unlock the full potential of such spaces, a strategic embrace of current and emerging technology is needed. Here, the emphasis extends beyond mere economic gains and focuses on the multifaceted benefits of these spaces that are consistent with broader sustainability goals.
Data from Portland-based nonprofit the Parking Reform Network introduces the compelling statistic that cities in the United States with a population of more than one million people allocate around 22% of their city center land for parking purposes. That figure presents a significant opportunity: the integration of solar canopies as an innovative solution to transform open parking spaces into multi-functionality hubs. Beyond the conventional purpose of parking spaces, these areas can be used as platforms for the generation of renewable energy, demonstrating the harmonious coexistence of urban infrastructure and sustainability.
The prospect of innovative solar canopies is a shining light in this landscape. It is a tangible and transformative means of using open parking spaces for various purposes. Under the guidance and coordination of the IRA, these spaces can be re-imagined as hubs for innovative solar canopy deployment. This vision transcends the mere shading of vehicles; it signifies a paradigm shift toward stacking functionality within the same spatial domain – a testament to the convergence of economic viability, environmental sustainability, and effective infrastructure development.
Transformative
The importance of this transformative potential extends beyond the conceptual realm. Given the variety of technology currently available, the previously far-fetched idea of using open parking spaces for different functions has become an achievable reality. Astute resource allocation allows these spaces to be transformed into dynamic entities that provide shade for vehicles, support the deployment of micro-grids, facilitate demand-response initiatives, promote grid energy peak shaving and the creation of virtual power plants, and serve as charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) – all coexisting within the same physical realm.
World4Solar believes this multifaceted approach necessitates a conceptual shift in how we conceive and implement synergies among technology, and how we design our solutions with this vision in mind. Traditionally manufactured and implemented separately, these diverse technological solutions now offer harmonious integration that converges within the same spatial dimensions. The profound impact of such integration goes beyond a singular focus on renewable energy generation; it embodies a holistic approach to comprehensive infrastructure development.
However, this transformative vision is not without challenges. Access to open parking lots faces various obstacles, including local permitting requirements and timetables, accessibility of compatible electrical grid interconnection points, and initial investment in the project costs required before any investment tax credits benefit investors. Overcoming these hurdles requires strategic foresight and commitment to consider the necessary investment in time and resources as a positive game for all stakeholders.
Municipalities and government leaders, especially those who lead sustainability planning departments and committees, play a central role in this transformative process. A proactive attitude, which includes the evaluation of current open spaces and direct investment in visible projects, can catalyze community engagement and encourage business leaders. The resulting ripple effect, spurred by intentional investment, has the potential to drive broader adoption and influence more favorable price points through economies of scale.
Essentially, the nation is at an unprecedented crossroads and has a unique opportunity to perform much-needed repairs to infrastructure. The use of policy and financial incentives, such as the 45X production tax credit and the investment tax credit, offers a way to create a modern, efficient, and functionally diverse amalgamation of multiple technologies. This approach, rooted in fair use, has the transformative potential to reshape urban landscapes and make them more sustainable, more economically vibrant, and more technologically advanced.
Innovative solar canopies are emerging as a key player in the range of transformative clean energy possibilities. The impetus to create and shape the various paths to such a reality lies directly with investors and policymakers. It requires a collective commitment to envision and implement a future in which economic growth, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation seamlessly converge for the benefit of all.

The investment will represent 20% of the outstanding fully diluted shares of Recurrent Energy on an as-converted basis. Canadian Solar will continue to own the remaining majority shares of Recurrent Energy after the closing of the investment.
“The infusion of capital from our partner BlackRock, who is also Canadian Solar’s largest institutional investor, will provide the resources needed to further scale the Recurrent Energy platform and meet record clean energy power demand across the world,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO, Canadian Solar.
The investment, which Blackrock made through a fund managed by its Climate Infrastructure business, will provide Recurrent Energy with additional capital to grow its project development pipeline. It will also enable Recurrent to transition from a pure developer to a developer plus long-term owner and operator in select markets in the U.S. and Europe.
“Recurrent Energy is emblematic of our strategy of investing in leading renewable power generation assets and transition-enabling infrastructure, and we are pleased to make this first investment commitment from the fourth vintage of BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure fund franchise,”  said David Giordano, global head of climate infrastructure and chief investment officer of transition capital, BlackRock.
Recurrent Energy reports that it has built approximately 9 GW of solar and 3 GWh of battery storage power plants across six continents since 2009. As of Q4 2023, Recurrent Energy had a global development pipeline of 26 GW in solar and 55 GWh in storage, of which 13 GW and 12 GWh respectively are projects with interconnections. The company anticipates having 4 GW of solar and 2 GWh of storage in operation in the U.S. and Europe by 2026.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/23/u-s-made-optimizers-to-maximize-manufacturing-tax-credits/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 23, 2024",U.S.-made optimizers to maximize manufacturing tax credits,"Enteligent, maker of solar power optimizers and solar electric vehicle charging solutions, is relocating its manufacturing operations to the United States. The move is primarily driven by the desire to maximize the benefits offered by the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45x Advanced Manufacturing tax credit, thereby enhancing the offerings for their inverter partners.
Sean Burke, the CEO of Enteligent, discussed with pv magazine USA the details of this transition, emphasizing its role in optimizing the available tax incentives under the IRA.
Burke underscored the financial incentives tied to the move, explaining, “when U.S.-based inverter manufacturers sell their hardware fully integrated as a full system solution, then those companies can claim the IRA 45x $0.11/W transferable tax credit.” Without the inclusion of the optimizer, residential solar inverters secure a credit of $0.065/W, and commercial units a lesser $0.02/W.
This strategic shift aligns with industry trends, notably First Solar’s recent sale of $700 million in tax credits to fund the development of its solar panel manufacturing operations in the U.S.
Highlighting its specialized niche in the market, Burke noted, “We are the only supplier of power-line communication module-level power optimizers that can be integrated with a DC-coupled PV inverter system.”
Burke candidly shared the operational hurdles this transition entails. The shift demands a comprehensive capital investment, covering not just the physical factory and manufacturing lines but also the human resources required for operation. This also marks a shift from their prior business model, which had primarily focused on design, sales, and marketing, and outsourced manufacturing.
Enteligent is actively collaborating with prominent industry partners like Sol-Ark and Solis. Their 0900-80V optimizers are already integrated into Sol-Ark’s residential and commercial units, and both Sol-Ark and Solis incorporate Enteligent’s transmitters. 

The units, boasting Sunspec certification, adhere to industry standards ensuring interoperability and secure communication. They offer rapid shutdown capabilities, along with module output optimization to mitigate issues like shading, and provide detailed module-level data. This granular data is relayed to inverter manufacturers, allowing seamless integration into their user-facing inverter information interfaces.
Enteligent also streamlines the installation process with an app designed for quicker commissioning of systems.
Currently, the hardware production is situated in the Philippines, following a relocation from China. Enteligent anticipates having U.S.-manufactured units ready for their partners by the second quarter of 2024. The core technical components, such as microprocessors, are already sourced from U.S.-based Texas Instruments, while other components like capacitors, cables, connectors and miscellaneous items are produced globally.
Burke did not provide specific insights on the potential impact of these domestically produced units on the 10% domestic content tax credit, a significant consideration for stakeholders in the solar power sector.

Industrial conglomerate Johnson Controls introduced a water-to-water screw heat pump intended for use in small commercial buildings and district heating.
The company said its new York YVWH Water-to-Water Dual Variable Speed Screw Heat Pump is the first of its kind using the R-1234ze refrigerant in North America.
“R-1234ze is a refrigerant with an ultra-low global warming potential (GWP) of 1, enabling the YVWH to go considerably beyond the refrigerant regulations that go into effect starting January 1, 2025, as currently proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,” the company said in a statement.
The new product is currently available in a version with a 200-ton cooling capacity. It offers 703 output for cooling and 1,186 kW for heating.
The company said the system has a combined coefficient of performance of 4.1. It may also use the R-515b refrigerants and can reportedly provide a water temperature of up to 176 F or 80 C, which the manufacturer is the highest ever reached for screw heat pumps.
“At that temperature, the unit can provide 4,050 thousand British thermal units (BTUs) per hour of heating while simultaneously providing 200 tons of chilled water cooling at 5 C,” the manufacturer said. “The YVWH also features variable-speed drive and has excellent turndown that allows it to run with as low as 25% of the design-heating load.”
The heat pump can be operated for heating or cooling separately or for simultaneous heating and cooling.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/23/solar-and-storage-accounts-for-one-third-of-transferable-tax-credit-market-in-2023/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 23, 2024",Solar and storage accounts for one-third of transferable tax credit market in 2023,"Crux, a marketplace for buying and selling transferable tax credits, released a survey detailing the 2023 and 2024 transferable tax credit market.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced the ability to transfer solar project tax credits from the project owner to other commercial entities with tax liabilities. Previously, tax equity models required the future owner of the tax credits to share in the project’s risk. The new transferability option simplifies the process significantly, eliminating the need for the tax credit’s new owner to be a partner in the solar project; they only need to be able to utilize the tax credit.
Crux estimates that, propelled by the IRA, roughly $7 billion to $9 billion in transferable clean energy tax credit transactions occurred in 2023. The report indicates a particularly strong growth in the transferable sector specifically, which already accounts for one-third of the entire tax finance market, estimated at $23 billion in 2023. Looking ahead, Crux anticipates the potential for over $80 billion in solar tax finance by 2031, with a significant portion of this growth expected to stem specifically from transferable tax credits.
Crux estimated that solar and solar-plus-storage capacity contributed to approximately one-third of the entire 2023 transferable credits.

The “Transferable Tax Credit Market Intelligence Report,” is based on responses from 150 out of the 2,000 organizations contacted by Crux, and indicates that the marketplace is in its early growth stages, with many respondents still getting familiar with the sector.
The report highlights several significant transfers, notably First Solar’s monetization of about $729 million in manufacturing tax credits, resulting in approximately $700 million from sales of just over 4 GW of solar modules. Crux believes that recent guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury, coupled with market participants’ efforts to navigate legal complexities, will lead to the announcement of many more significant transfers once the legal details are ironed out.
In 2023, transactions within the $11 to $25 million bracket were most prevalent, followed by a substantial number of deals under $10 million. Both of these categories surpassed the combined total of all transactions ranging from $51 million to $1 billion. The $25 to $50 million range also saw a significant volume of transactions.

Crux points out that the high volume of deals below $50 million showcases the advantage of the new transferability options, which previously made it challenging for smaller deals to gain market attention. The market’s diversity in project types, including manufacturing, energy storage, biofuels, and electric vehicle infrastructure alongside wind and solar projects, hints at a potential large expansion in transferable transactions. Wind and solar growth in this report is expected to be undercounted, as many large projects likely had pre-committed funding from tax equity partners, leaving no credits available for the transferable market.
The market, still in its infancy, shows varied intentions among participants. According to Crux’s data, “The majority of sellers (55%) indicated that they are planning to begin monetizing transferable tax credits in 2024; 36% of them were expecting to transact in 2023 or had already done so.”
A smaller segment (9%) is not yet ready to enter the market, opting to first deepen their understanding. On the buyers’ side, 43% either completed transactions or expected to do so in 2023, with an additional 21% targeting 2024 to commence trading. The remaining 36% are still contemplating their entry into the market.

Buyers and sellers face distinct challenges in navigating the fledgling transferable tax credit market. Buyers contend with the complexities of pricing and the rigorous nature of due diligence, while sellers point to market transparency as a key challenge. Interestingly, a third of sellers perceive buyers as having unrealistic expectations, a sentiment that Crux notes is mirrored by the buyers’ views on robust pricing.
Intermediaries, such as banks and brokers, cite market transparency and the complexity of due diligence as significant obstacles. However, they expect that market expansion could naturally follow an increase in transaction volume and positive industry feedback. Moreover, they suggest that additional regulatory guidance and enhanced transparency could further catalyze market growth.

To safeguard transactions, buyers are adopting insurance policies and sponsor guarantees as mitigation measures against a range of risks, including recapture, qualification issues and various potential errors and omissions. These strategies also address financial liabilities like penalties and interest, and ensure the accuracy of representations and warranties, aiming to maintain compliance and protect the financial interests involved in the deal.
The settled prices for tax credits have generally ranged between 92 and 94 cents per dollar, although Crux acknowledges that factors such as the size of the deal, the type of credit and technology, the project’s location, the timing of service delivery, and prevailing market demand can influence the closing price. Notably, First Solar clinched 96 cents on the dollar in its major $729 million deal. On average, commercial and industrial solar projects closed at 90.7 cents on the dollar, utility-scale solar transactions settled around 92 cents, and energy storage projects achieved closing prices at 94 cents on the dollar.
