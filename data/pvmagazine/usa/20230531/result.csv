https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/31/community-solar-developer-nexamp-secures-over-400-million-in-financing/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 31, 2023",Community solar developer Nexamp secures over $400 million in financing,"Boston-based community solar developer Nexamp announced it has secured over $400 million in tax equity and debt commitments from U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance and Mitsubishi UFJ Finance Group (MUFG).
The financing arrangement is expected to support Nexamp’s construction of 49 solar and battery energy storage projects spanning six states in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and Midwest regions. Over 2,390 construction and operations jobs, often in rural communities, are expected to be created by the project portfolio.
The community solar and storage projects are expected to contribute nearly 250 MW of solar capacity, enough to power up to 40,000 households. Community solar enables customers to opt-in and subscribe to capacity from the project, receiving credits on their utility bills for production from the facility.
Customers of the projects enabled by the financing round are expected to save a combined $6.5 million in annual utility bills, with ratepayers saving an average of 10% to 20% on their traditional utility bills. Nexamp’s business model involves no customer credit checks, up-front fees or long-term commitments.
Rural communities in Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Minnesota and Illinois are planned to host the projects, which extend access to solar for customers who are unable to install it on their homes. New York, Massachusetts and Minnesota are notably three of the top five largest markets for community solar, though California, the nation’s top solar market overall, recently passed laws to enable the market, and proposed a $400 million fund to spur growth.
“In order for the U.S. to overcome its reliance on fossil fuels and an outdated power grid, we must invest in affordable and sustainable clean energy solutions that are accessible to all Americans, no matter where they live,” said Zaid Ashai, chief executive officer, Nexamp.
Nexamp said the investment was encouraged by incentives within the Inflation Reduction Act, which in 2023 will begin the rollout of bonus tax credits for projects located in traditionally marginalized communities. Learn more about the 10% Energy Community tax credit here.
“Community solar projects are playing a vital role in the energy transition, providing a diverse set of communities with access to participate in this societal effort,” said Takaki Sakai, managing director, MUFG.
Nexamp will provide development, engineering, construction, operations and customer management services for the entire portfolio. The company first launched its subscriber-based community solar project in 2015, and today services over 60,000 customers with a portfolio of over 1 GW. The developer said its assets are capable of powering over 155,000 households, and it has several more GW of capacity in development across 20 states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/31/global-battery-market-forecast-to-grow-186-by-2025/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 31, 2023",Global battery market forecast to grow 186% by 2025,"Over the last year, North America has become the fastest growing region for planned battery cell manufacturing capacity. Much of the growth is buoyed by federal incentives of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, according to an industry report by Clean Energy Associates (CEA).
CEA’s Energy Storage System (ESS) Supplier Market Intelligence Program (SMIP) offers a biannual market report about the leading global lithium-ion battery cell manufacturers and energy storage system integrators.
As the U.S. ramps up to become a major battery cell supplier in at least two more years, China remains the largest global supplier of lithium-ion batteries at year end 2022. CEA forecasts a two-year 186% growth rate on the 1,706 GWh of batteries produced in 2022.
Contemporary Amparex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) was the largest Tier 1 battery cell supplier in 2022, with its 387 GWh of batteries supplied representing the largest portion (30%) of the 75% market share held by Tier 1 suppliers. Following CATL were LG Energy Solution (198 GWh) and BYD (149 GWh) among major Tier 1 suppliers.
Tier 1 companies produced 1,270 GWh of 1,706 GWh of lithium batteries last year. Tier 1 is a designation for companies that supply more than one multinational original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or EV producer outside of China, with capacity of greater than 10 GWh per year. Tier 2 suppliers are not yet qualified to supply multinational automotive OEMs or EV companies, while Tier 3 suppliers are not yet qualified to supply EV end markets and annual capacity is less than 1 GWh per year.
CEA notes that industry fragmentation between the different tiers is expected to increase in the coming years due to global expansion of the Energy Storage systems market, as specialized companies emerge among the stationary storage market, such as Pylontech (7 GWh) and Hithium (15 GWh), the only two suppliers to appear on CEA’s top suppliers chart that focus exclusively on the storage market.
Future onshored North America battery supply is being driven by multi-year financial incentives for domestic content under the Inflation Reduction Award and Department of Energy-led grant funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 for sourcing advanced materials for battery production in the U.S.
Recent planned battery cell capacity in the U.S. driven by the IRA include:
CEA’s Supplier Market Intelligence Program recognizes ten battery systems integrators of lithium-ion batteries used in the utility-scale storage market. Evaluating the integration of battery cells, modules, racking, enclosures, inverters, battery management and energy management systems to engineering and construction functions, CEA found that Tesla is the only company that is currently developing a battery cell supply chain for the utility storage market.
CEA, an Intertek company, is a market intelligence company that provides product consulting support to buyers and long-term owners of solar and energy storage equipment. The company has consulted for project developers, power producers, engineering groups and investors, executing on more than 160 GW of solar and 15 GWh of storage projects to date.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/31/california-targets-over-400-growth-in-clean-energy-by-2045/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 31, 2023",California targets over 400% growth in clean energy by 2045,"California has made major strides in the energy transition from carbon-based fuels to a power supply that is 100% emissions free by 2045. Governor Gavin Newsom released an annual report highlighting this progress, remarking that the state is “on pace” to reach the goal of 100% clean energy by 2045. 
The transition is well underway, with nearly 35 GW of renewable resources already providing power to the grid, 9 GW of which came online in the last three years. In just over 20 years, the Governor’s office projects a need for an additional 148 GW to meet California’s clean energy demand. 
This represents a growth of 400% over the next two decades, a tall order, but one that is achievable for the frontrunner in clean energy technologies nationwide. Already, California surpassed targets of a 33% share for renewable energy, has reduced emissions below 1990 levels, and has sold over 1.5 million electric vehicles. 
As of 2021, 59% of the state’s electricity comes from zero-carbon sources. Traditional renewables, including solar and wind, represent 37.2%, while large-scale hydropower carries a 10.7% share and nuclear energy supplying 10.8%. California seeks an interim target of 90% emissions-free electricity by 2035. 
“Many of the ambitious goals we have set for ourselves have already been reached – some earlier than we expected. Building on that progress, California remains committed to leading the fight against climate change and will take the necessary actions to protect energy reliability during the clean energy transition,” said Governor Newsom.
Solar is expected to provide the largest share of electricity in the state, preferred for its low cost and ability to be built in a variety of designs, from smaller built environment distributed projects to large utility-scale solar facilities. The projected generation mix for 2045 is seen below.
“We can do even more to take advantage of the existing built environment on the large rooftops of warehouses and superstores, along highways and over parking lots to get to our goals even faster, while protecting our open spaces,” said Laura Deehan, state director, Environment California.
California is also working to tackle the issue of equity in the energy transition. It recently passed laws to establish a community solar market that requires at least 51% of the capacity serve low- to moderate income residents. The program helps extend access to lower-cost renewable energy to renters and other residents who are otherwise unable to invest in rooftop solar.
Energy insecurity is a persistent problem across the United States, and California is no exception. Over the last two years, California distributed $1.6 billion to address household energy debt that accrued as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These investments have provided utility debt relief to more than 3 million customers, said the report. The state is investing nearly $1 billion to support building decarbonization with a prioritization on low- and moderate-income households, as well as disadvantaged communities.
The state also passed Assembly Bill 205, which establishes a new voluntary environmental review permitting process for clean energy resources under the purview of the California Energy Commission (CEC). The CEC will hold environmental review processes for carbon-free generation to a maximum of 270 days, and its approval will stand in lieu of most local, state, and regional permits. The review process also requires projects to include skilled and trained standards for workforce, community benefits, and local fiscal benefits.
Electrification, transmission, storage
To meet this steadily increasing supply of intermittent and diverse energy sources, energy storage will be needed to supplement generation. The buildout has leapt from only 250 MW in 2019 to an expected 5,000 MW by the end of 2023, a growth of 2,000% in four years. The report said a mix of distributed battery storage and grid-scale long duration energy storage will be needed to support a reliable supply of electricity.
CEC has implemented a long duration energy storage program that is providing $140 million to ignite growth in this area. The California Public Utilities Commission has also ordered the procurement of 2 GW of new long-duration energy storage projects and 2 GW of clean firm electric resources like geothermal by 2028. The 2022-23 State Budget Act dedicated $2.8 billion to new clean energy technologies like offshore wind, long-duration energy storage, industrial decarbonization, and hydrogen and battery energy storage.
Along with more clean electricity generation, the state targets increased electrification of appliances and HVAC systems, dropping gas consumption by 94% along the way. The 2045 transition is expected to create 4 million new jobs, cut air pollution by 71%, and save Californians an estimated $200 billion in health costs due to reduced pollution.
Electrification of transportation is another core element of California’s plan. The state banned the sale of new internal combustion engines by 2035. Already, over 21% of California’s new car sales are zero-emission vehicles, rising sharply from 6.8% in 2019.
 By 2030, electric vehicle charging is expected to account for less than 5% of the state’s peak demand, and EVs are showing promise for being participants in smart grid programs like vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home power export, which can further help balance the daily mismatch between power generation and evening energy demand.
Upgrades to California’s transmission grid will be needed to support the wholesale change to electrification as well. In May 2023, the California ISO Board of Governors approved the 2022-2023 10-year transmission plan which approved the largest tranche of new transmission in the California ISO’s history.
The plan includes 45 projects, totaling $7.3 billion in new investments in the transmission grid. The plan also reflects a more proactive and strategic approach to studying and recommending new transmission by establishing the zones targeted for resource development and proactive transmission development that will shape future resource interconnection and procurement.
“Harnessing the innovation, drive, and tenacity our state is known for, California is well-positioned to build on our early successes and deliver clean, reliable, affordable energy for all Californians for generations to come,” concluded Governor Newsom.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/31/new-standard-for-ultra-low-carbon-solar-modules-released/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 31, 2023",New standard for ultra-low carbon solar modules released,"The Global Electronics Council (GEC) has unveiled the ‘Criteria for the Assessment of Ultra-Low Carbon Modules.’ This set of criteria aims to ‘establish a framework, standardized methodology, and performance objectives to incentivize manufacturers and suppliers to design and manufacture low embodied carbon photovoltaic (PV) modules.’
The GEC developed two levels of emissions standards: low carbon and ultra-low carbon (ULCS). To meet the low carbon standard, a solar module, including its frame, must have an embodied carbon footprint equal to or less than 630 kg CO2e/kWp. To meet the ULCS standard, a module’s footprint must be at or below 400 kg CO2e/kWp.
In their analysis, GEC created charts estimating the carbon intensity of power grids in various countries involved in solar panel production. They then calculated a “Global Warming Potential” (GWP) coefficient for each solar panel subcomponent.
By adding up the GWP values for all subcomponents, they calculate the total CO2 emissions during solar panel and subcomponent construction. Finally, they divide the total emissions by the wattage of the solar panel (kWp) to determine whether it meets the 630 & 400 kg CO2e/kWp thresholds for certification.
To confirm the inputs for each solar panel and obtain certification from the GEC, independent third-party inspectors must verify the inputs. Much of the GEC’s documentation covers the third-party verification process.
The developer Lightsource BP commented on the standard, stating, “Reducing the embodied carbon in solar farm equipment can bring the emissions payback period for solar assets from 1-3 years, depending on local energy mix, to under 1 year in many locations, accelerating the positive impact that solar energy development has on climate change.”
Stakeholder organizations involved in this initiative include First Solar, Hanwha Q Cells, Hemlock Semiconductor, NREL, NorSun, REC Solar Norway Fraunhofer, Meyer Burger, and Wacker Chemie.

JinkoSolar recently announced a ‘zero carbon’ 56 GW manufacturing campus for most solar module components – ingots through module assembly. Ingot and wafer manufacturer Norsun purchases all of their electricity from hydropower sources.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/31/strong-policies-expand-the-solar-industry-creating-more-resilient-future/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CANADA,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 31, 2023","Strong policies expand the solar industry, creating more resilient future","Solar energy has become a significant player in the race to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to several factors. The cost of solar panels has plummeted in recent years, making them more accessible and affordable. Technological advancements have also made solar systems more efficient and reliable, enhancing their appeal as a sustainable energy solution.
Canada and the United States have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. President Biden has set an ambitious target of achieving 100% clean electricity in the U.S. by 2035. To attain this goal, the Biden administration has proposed various measures, including tax incentives, investments in renewable energy infrastructure, and the promotion of community solar projects.
Many companies have stepped up to take advantage of these incentives and to help businesses and organizations achieve net-zero emissions. One key advantage for these companies is the availability of financial incentives for solar and renewable energy projects. In the U.S., federal tax incentives exist for residential and commercial solar installations. The most significant incentive is the solar investment tax credit (ITC), which provides a credit of 30% of the installation cost for solar projects in residential and commercial properties. State-level tax credits are also available in many states. New York is particularly attractive for solar developers due to its state tax credit of up to $5,000 for commercial solar installations.
The shift toward net-zero also presents opportunities through community solar projects. These initiatives enable multiple households or businesses to benefit from a single solar project, allowing individuals with space or resource constraints to access solar energy. Community solar projects can also extend the benefits of solar power to low-income households and communities that may otherwise struggle to access renewable energy, leading to long-term cost savings.
Renewable energy credits (RECs) are another avenue for supporting the shift towards net-zero. RECs provide businesses and organizations with a means to support renewable energy projects without directly purchasing the generated electricity. Whenever a renewable energy project produces electricity, it generates RECs, which can be sold to entities seeking to offset their carbon emissions. This creates an additional revenue stream for renewable energy projects, facilitating their continued growth and expansion.
The political momentum toward achieving net-zero targets has profoundly impacted the solar energy market, positioning it as a central player in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Canada and the U.S., in particular, have demonstrated their commitment to these targets through various measures, including tax incentives, community solar projects, and the utilization of RECs. Notably, the responsibility for electricity falls under the jurisdiction of states and provinces in both countries. This means that the demand, supply, and formulation of electricity-related policies and regulations primarily originate at the state and provincial levels. While federal-level incentives, such as the ITC, exist in both countries, reducing federal income tax liabilities for solar system installations, there are also state and provincial incentives specific to each region.
New York sets an example
In the U.S., for example, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers financial incentives for installing renewable energy systems in non-residential, large commercial, industrial, and single-family residential projects within the state. These incentives aim to promote the adoption of renewable energy technologies, including solar.
Similarly, Canada has introduced its own initiatives to support clean technology projects, including solar. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Canadian government has unveiled a 30% investment tax credit for investments in clean technology projects. This tax credit serves as an incentive to stimulate investments in solar and other clean energy projects.
From a policy perspective, solar projects are generally welcomed at the federal level and in select states and provinces. For example, a solar developer can access the NYSERDA grant in upstate New York once the project has obtained full permits and the grid interconnection fees have been paid.
While awaiting further details on the implementation of the IRA, solar companies can generally access funding opportunities at the federal and state levels. The availability of funding for renewable energy projects is relatively straightforward, providing a favorable environment for the growth and expansion of the solar industry.
As an avid traveler, I often engage in discussions about the visible impacts of global warming and the urgent need for action. Among the most frequently mentioned concerns are rising sea levels, intensified hurricanes, devastating floods, and the alarming retreat of glaciers. I had a profound encounter with the effects of climate change when I flew over Greenland in October 2022. Witnessing vast stretches of exposed rocky terrain that were once blanketed with ice and snow was a stark reminder that the ice continues to melt at an alarming rate. These firsthand experiences serve as undeniable evidence that climate change is a tangible reality.
Beyond my personal observations, there are numerous other examples of the visible effects of climate change that people can witness around the world. One prominent illustration is the increased frequency and intensity of wildfires. In regions such as California, Australia, and the Amazon rainforest, devastating wildfires have become more prevalent, destroying vast areas of land, displacing communities, and releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, further exacerbating climate change.
Another visible consequence of climate change is the bleaching and deterioration of coral reefs. These vibrant and biodiverse ecosystems, found in tropical and subtropical waters, are subjected to warmer ocean temperatures and acidification due to higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. As a result, coral reefs are experiencing widespread bleaching, leading to their decline and the loss of critical habitats for marine life.
Furthermore, changing weather patterns, including more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and extreme precipitation events, are evident in many parts of the world. These extreme weather phenomena disrupt ecosystems, harm agriculture, and food production, and pose significant risks to human health and well-being.
It is crucial to recognize that while the effects of climate change are already visible, there is still hope for meaningful action. By collectively embracing sustainable practices, transitioning to renewable energy sources, implementing effective policies, and promoting conservation efforts, we can mitigate the impacts of climate change and work towards a more sustainable and resilient future for our planet.

NREL is one of the U.S. Department of Energy’s 17 national research laboratories and the only one dedicated to renewable power sources. Based in Golden, Colo., NREL fills its main campus with offices, laboratories, product test sites, solar parking canopies and, now, the recently added Research and Innovation Laboratory (RAIL).
Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was on hand for the recent ribbon-cutting ceremony, who marked the official opening of the new building with Colorado Governor Jared Polis.
The new lab, which will provide “wet” lab space for chemistry experiments, will be home to research aimed at moving the nation toward the goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
“NREL, with its goals of getting to net zero, is amazing,” Granholm said. “We have real-world impacts that come out of this lab, and it’s only getting better thanks to the expansion that we’re here to celebrate.”
The current buildings on the 178-acre campus are dedicated to advancements in batteries, biofuels and solar, among other carbon-free technologies. The RAIL laboratory is the first building in a planned expansion, adding about 15,000 square feet to the campus.
NREL plans to expand the campus further, and recently took ownership of the former Camp George West site, which was used 120 years ago as training grounds for the Colorado National Guard. The portion of Camp George West acquired under a land swap with Jefferson County was most recently a correctional facility.
NREL intends to transform the 6.6-acre site into the South Table Mountain Energy Park (STEP), which will serve as an incubator for clean energy companies. The state of Colorado intends to build the Global Energy Park directly adjacent to NREL as a hub for the cleantech industry.
The Global Energy Park is expected to house young companies working in the clean technology space. Development of the site will start later this year, with a projected opening date in early 2026.
“We have never had a lab envelope so big that it could entertain a collaboration exchange. Most of the time, those labs are very limited,” said Michelle Slovensky, Intelligent Campus program manager at NREL. “This is unique, and we’re going to see what that exchange produces.”
In addition, NREL received $150 million in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which will enable additions and improvements to its facilities.
“Thanks to the historic IRA, we will be able to make vital upgrades to lab infrastructure and enable clean energy research and development that is imperative to addressing the climate crisis,” said Martin Keller, director of NREL. “The funds will accelerate three-plus years of planned capital investment to modernize research infrastructure supporting Department of Energy clean energy research and development activities, critical laboratory renovations, and deferred maintenance.”
NREL’s IRA funds have been designated for the following priorities:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/31/terrain-following-tracker-with-a-pneumatic-twist/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 31, 2023",Terrain-following tracker with a pneumatic twist,"What sets Sunfolding’s terrain-following tracker apart from other designs is pneumatics, a 360-year old technology that converts power into movement.
Traditional trackers are mechanically more complex, which can make installation and maintenance  costly. Sunfolding developers discovered that pneumatics offered a simpler approach with advantages in certain solar designs. Some of those advantages include a reservoir (or bladder) for air storage so they can continue operating through loss of power.
They can also operate through loss of air and can run continuously without threat of overheating. Read more about solar and pneumatics in Sunfolding’s white paper. Without batteries or metal drive components, the pneumatic technology is also able to withstand extreme low temperatures where traditional trackers have had issues.
As noted by Chip McDaniel in Industrial Equipment News, pneumatics offer the advantage of simplicity, low cost and reliability, providing “a quick path to motion,” providing significant force in a small space.
The patented AirDrive technology used by Sunfolding was invented by Leila Madrone, company founder and chief technology officer. Madrone is a roboticist, having received both her bachelors and masters in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT, with a focus on robotics and mechatronics. Early in her career she worked on automation for the genomics industry and the commercialization of NASA robotics hardware. Founded in 2012, Sunfolding was spun out of MIT’s Otherlab. In 2016, the company won a $4.2 million ARPA award for its “pneumatically-actuated PV tracking system.”
The AirDrive system
At the heart of its tracking system is the AirDrive. Based on Madrone’s invention, it consists of flexible bladders (shown above) enclosed in a metal housing with a bladder to the east and one to the west. When the bladders are pressurized to different levels, one side expands and tilts the solar structure in the opposite direction. AirDrive X actuators in the Sunfolding system reportedly weigh less than 50 pounds. Wes Fuller, vice president of sales and strategic partnerships, told pv magazine USA that two people can lift them and attach them to posts anchored in the ground. The automotive-grade pneumatic harnesses connect with the supply air system—one for each 5 MW. These systems come pre-assembled and can be dropped into place on site.
The pneumatic system has fewer critical points of failure than traditional mechanical systems, dramatically reducing maintenance costs, according to Sunfolding. The AirDrive X actuator uses advanced polymers supplied by DuPont, helping them weather exposure to wind, heat, rain and snow.
Sunfolding’s first product was the T29 tracker, which reportedly changed the tracker landscape with its use of pneumatics, is installed in 39 projects in 12 states including sites in California, Colorado, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Texas.
The TopoTrack, introduced in September 2022, is designed for varied terrain. Like the T29, it uses the AirDrive technology, but has mechanically independent, scaled down tracker rows.

The company reports that TopoTrack’s rows are 10 times shorter than traditional trackers, and that they can provide 20 degrees of variation between trackers, thus improving slope tolerance between the rows and allowing for articulation in terrain, including complete directional change in terrain if needed.
The design uses two posts, two actuators and two purlins. As a result of the tracker’s flexibility and simplicity, Sunfolding says that the tracker’s footprint across a project site can be increased when tracker-to-tracker spacing is reduced. Fuller noted that TopoTrack can reduce the need for grading by an estimated 97%, thus resulting in further cost savings.
Headquartered in Alameda, Calif., Sunfolding’s posts, actuators and purlins are made in the U.S. The company partners with auto industry component suppliers to manufacture the AirDrive, and reports that 90% of its bill of materials are sourced from a 250-mile radius of its manufacturing facility in the Midwest, enabling short lead times and reducing procurement risks.
TopoTrack was recently deployed on a site with strict environmental protections in place.  This site featured complex terrain in a high snow load location. TopoTrack technology reportedly enabled the customer to perform zero grading on this site, greatly minimizing the cost of handling complex terrain and permitting risk.
