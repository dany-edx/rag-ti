The project is set to be constructed on 710 acres of privately owned cultivated farmland southeast of Calgary. Development began in early 2020, while construction is anticipated to begin in August 2022.
Construction of the project is expected to create up to 360 jobs, most of which Westbridge said will be for local Alberta workers.
If seen through to commercial operation, Georgetown would become one of Canada’s largest solar projects, joining the planned 400 MW Travers Solar project, also set to be constructed in Alberta.
While Canada is a relatively nascent solar market compared to the United States, the country’s commitment to solar has grown recently, and Canada ended 2020 with a total solar capacity of roughly 3,000 MW, with 70 MW installed in 2020.
That number is expected to grow pretty significantly, however, as the Canadian Renewable Energy Association expects close to 2 GW of wind and solar projects to begin construction or complete installation before the end of the year. The country is also seeing a rise in geographic diversity of projects; early Canadian installations were mostly contained to Ontario.
A June 2021 report from Clean Energy Canada and Navius Research, The New Reality, forecasts that by 2030 clean energy jobs in Canada will grow almost 50% to nearly 640,000 under the federal government’s new climate plan. Canada’s clean energy sector currently employs around 430,500.
Alberta is forecast to see 71,700 jobs in its clean energy sector by 2030, a 164% increase over 2020 and the greatest increase of any Canadian province.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/15/tracking-the-sun-report-offers-insight-into-distributed-solar-trends/,"COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2021",Tracking the Sun report offers insight into distributed solar trends,"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) released its annual Tracking the Sun report, a review of project-level data for nearly 2.2 million solar systems installed through year-end 2020. The report digests pricing and design trends for the sector.
LBL found that PV systems continue to grow in size. Average sizes in 2020 reached 6.5 kW for residential systems, and 42 kW for non-residential systems. Twenty percent of non-residential systems were sized at greater than 200 kW in 2020.
Module efficiencies have risen over time, as well. In 2002, median module efficiencies for the residential sector were 13.4%. Now, they are  19.8%.
Battery storage attachment rates for the residential market have been on a steady upward trend, reaching 8.1% of the full data sample in 2020. Non-residential attachment rates were a bit lower, and have fluctuated over the years. 
Module-level power electronics (MLPE) such as microinverters or DC optimizers have gained share, and 94% of residential systems were found to be using MLPE. Small non-residential solar was equipped with MLPE in 71% of installs, and large non-residential systems used MLPE at a rate of 26%.
Third-party ownership, such as a solar lease or power purchase agreement, has been on a decline in the residential group, having reached a peak in 2012 at 59%. In 2020, the percentage had fallen to 35%. In general, LBL said that states with richer incentives typically had a higher rate of third-party-owned solar systems.
Over the long run, U.S. median installed prices have dropped by roughly $0.4/W per year, but that price decline has tapered off since 2014. The rate of decline has eased to about $0.1 to $0.2/W each year. Between 2019 and 2020, median prices for residential systems remained relatively flat at $3.8/W. Non-residential projects recorded a price drop of $0.2/W over that same period.
The interval between 2019 and 2020 also experienced a slight uptick in soft costs, reversing the trend of an annual reduction on the order of $0.1 to $0.2/W. On a state-by-state basis, price variations ranged widely. For example, there was a $0.5/W soft cost rise for Wisconsin and a $0.3/W drop in Delaware.
The U.S. has some catching up to do in price reduction, as median prices were nearly double that of other countries. The $3.8/W price well exceeded Germany and Australia, which have $1.6/W and $1.2/W median prices, respectively.
Installed prices within each customer segment varied depending to a large extent on system size. LBL reported a difference of $1.1/W in median prices between the smallest and largest residential systems, and $1.9/W between the smallest and largest non-residential systems.
Ground-mounting was shown to have a notable effect on installed price, adding an average of $0.40/W. The report said, however, that this solution is relatively uncommon in the residential sector. Other price effects included premium efficiency modules (+$0.14/W), microinverters (+$0.14/W), DC optimizers (+$0.24/W), and new construction (-$0.08/W).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/15/heres-how-states-recovered-from-power-outages-caused-by-hurricane-ida/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,LOUISIANA",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2021",Here’s how states recovered from power outages caused by Hurricane Ida,"Hurricane Ida knocked out power for up to 1.2 million electricity customers across eight states, according to reports from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER).
The hurricane initially caused more than one million customer outages in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama after it made landfall as a Category 4 storm on August 29. As the storm continued toward the Northeast, it caused outages in several northeastern states on September 1.

CESER’s situation reports showed that at least 232,000 customers lost electricity service in five northeastern states (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts).  Most of those customers had power restored within 24 hours.
Service to customers in Mississippi was almost entirely restored by Tuesday, September 7. At that point, about half a million customers in Louisiana were still without power. As of the morning of September 13, CESER estimated that power had been restored to 85% of Louisiana customers.
Entergy, the investor-owned utility that serves customers in multiple states including Louisiana and Mississippi, estimated that Hurricane Ida damaged 30,000 utility poles. That was nearly as many as the combined effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (17,000 poles) and Hurricane Laura in 2020. By the utility’s estimates, power may not be restored to certain southeastern Louisiana parishes until near the end of September.

Efforts have been under way in Louisiana to deploy emergency solar resources. For example, PosiGen Solar said it teamed up with the Footprint Project to deploy 12 solar power stations at disaster supply sites in Hurricane Ida-damaged areas in Louisiana. A dozen firehouses, churches, and community centers damaged or destroyed and left without power because of the storm have lights, fans, refrigerators, and cell phone charging stations powered by solar energy.
The Footprint Project has worked to bring clean energy to areas of climate disasters and humanitarian emergencies since 2017. Volunteers in southeast Louisiana said this is their largest response operation to date.
And Schneider Electric said it worked with Footprint to set up a solar powered phone-charging station and two “Solar Packs” with continuous charging at full irradiation at United Houma Nation HQ in Houma, Louisiana. Schneider also delivered two solar trailers for Operation Blessings equipped with solar panels that fold out for charging with one to power flood lights.

Rochester Community Power will now automatically enroll 57,000 Rochester residents and small businesses into the program, providing them with guaranteed savings on their electric bills from a community solar installation, rather than installing solar panels on their home or property. Participants are free to opt-out and leave the program at any time.
As with the opt-out community choice solar programs in the New York villages of Brockport and Lima, Joule Assets served as the program administrator and managed the competitive bidding process to secure a fixed rate for the next 24 months. This protects residents and businesses from volatile market prices. Joule is currently the sole program administrator with approval from New York State to integrate community solar and electricity supply in a community choice offering.
Like Brockport and Lima, Rochester has committed to starting its own opt-out community choice solar program, which is expected to launch in early 2022. According to Joule, once the opt-out community choice solar program is live, Rochester will be used as a benchmark example for other municipalities looking to leverage their buying power and provide their residents and businesses access to guaranteed electricity bill savings.
As of now, it has not been shared how many community solar projects will be needed to feed Rochester’s expected demand. In Brockport and Lima, six community solar farms will supply more than 3,800 households and small businesses with roughly 28 million kWh of electricity annually for the next 25 years. Rochester Community Power is set to supply customers with more than 300 million kWh of renewable energy each year, and that figure doesn’t include the upcoming opt-out program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/15/how-long-do-residential-solar-inverters-last/,"QUALITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2021",How long do residential solar inverters last?,"In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we examine residential solar inverters in their various forms, how long they last, and how resilient they are.
The inverter, a device that converts the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, can come in a few different configurations. 
The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters. In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE) called DC optimizers. Microinverters and DC optimizers are generally used for roofs with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientation (not south-facing).
The technology ensures that each panel produces its max capability real-time and isn’t limited to the weakest link in the chain or “string.” String inverters are subject to the “Christmas light” effect where if one panel is not performing or is shaded, the rest of the panels connected in series will be limited to that panel’s production level.
Some string inverters are equipped with a bypass diode, a technology that prevents the “Christmas light” effect from taking place altogether, shown here by Fronius.
In applications where the roof has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
In a string inverter, there is generally less complicated wiring and a centralized location for easier repairs by solar technicians. Typically they are less expensive, said Solar Reviews. It said that inverters can typically cost 10-20% of the total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly aging components. A common source of failure in inverters is the electro-mechanical wear on the capacitor in the inverter. The electrolyte capacitors have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralized residential string inverter will last about 10-15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life.
String inverters generally have standard warranties ranging from 5-10 years, many with the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring through the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.

Microinverters have a longer life, EnergySage said they can often last 25 years, nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Usually, these inverters have a 20–25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfill its 20+ year promise.
The same goes for DC optimizers, which are typically paired with a centralized string inverter. These components last for 20-25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.
A study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of solar array failures occur at the inverter level. There are numerous causes of this.
According to Fallon Solutions, one cause is grid faults. High or low voltage due to grid fault can cause the inverter to stop working, and circuit breakers or fuses can be activated to protect the inverter from high-voltage failure.
Sometimes failure can occur at the MLPE level, where the components of power optimizers are exposed to higher temperatures on the roof. If reduced production is being experienced, it could be a fault in the MLPE.
Installation must be done properly as well. As a rule of thumb, Fallon recommended that the solar panel capacity should be up to 133% of the inverter capacity. If the panels are not properly matched to a right-size inverter, they will not perform efficiently.
To keep an inverter running more efficiently for a longer period, Those Solar Guys recommended choosing a cool, dry place with lots of circulating fresh air. It also suggested avoiding installing in areas with direct sunlight, though specific brands of outdoor inverters are designed to withstand more sunlight than others. And, in multi-inverter installations, it is important to be sure there is proper clearance between each inverter, so that there isn’t heat transfer between inverters.
Those Solar Guys said it is best practice to inspect the outside of the inverter (if it is accessible) quarterly, making sure there are no physical signs of damage, and all vents and cooling fins are free from dirt and dust.
It is also recommended to schedule an inspection through a licensed solar installer every five years. These standups typically cost $200-$300, though some solar contracts have free maintenance and monitoring for 20-25 years. During the checkup, the inspector should check inside the inverter for signs of corrosion, damage, or pests.
In the next installment of the series, pv magazine will examine the life of residential battery energy storage applications.

The land is designated the Milford Flats South Solar Energy Zone.
Generally, tens of millions of acres of BLM land is designated as available for certain types of development, but developers are responsible for choosing locations and submitting a bid. By contrast, Milford Flats is available as a result of the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260), which aims to deploy 25 GW of solar, wind, and geothermal production on public lands no later than 2025. It may be the first piece of pre-vetted land offered for bidding by the BLM.
The Milford Flats project page contains maps, bidding directions, and an early-stage environmental analysis. The BLM released a video of the site, with panoramas set to a techno/dance beat.
A 60-day bidding period started on September 10. The BLM said it believes that the three parcels in the zone could host up to 600 MW of solar power. It also speculates that development would create 200 construction jobs and 15 long-term operations positions. Beaver County is home to around 6,700 people and is around 230 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.
The preliminary environmental analysis by the BLM suggested that as many as 11 mammals and birds might be affected by any project development. However, it stated that it chose the land based on what it said was a low probability of environmental, cultural, and other potential side effects.
Grazing must also be considered in any applications.  BLM specified that solar developers would have to bid at least 20% more than the going rates of $8.76/acre/year from local ranchers. The current minimum bids for annual grazing on the three parcels range from $2,718 to more than $23,000. These bid numbers don’t necessarily represent the full amounts the site leaseholders will pay.
Eight ranchers with former grazing rights on the land could be affected by the development. Leaseholders would be expected to build new fences to keep the solar allotments and grazing land separated.
BLM said the site will need transmission upgrades. Its data suggest that after the solar project’s onsite transformers step up the voltages from the inverter to the grid, developers will need to connect to Rocky Mountain Power’s existing Sigurd to Red Butte 345 kV transmission line. The lines will likely cross public and private lands to reach the point of interconnection, and could be anywhere from two to seven miles in length.

The company reported a gross profit of $210.5 million, up 0.1% from the first quarter but down 10.2% from the same quarter of 2020. Net income fell nearly 80% year-over-year to $10.3 million. The company said the decline was largely due to the impact of convertible senior notes.
The Shangrao, China-based company released unaudited financial results for its second quarter that ended June 30.
Xiande Li, JinkoSolar’s chairman and CEO praised the company’s performance despite “very challenging” market conditions. He said that as prices along the supply chain remain high but relatively stable, “we see overall acceptance of price increases continuing well into the second half of the year.” Li said that demand for modules is “gradually resuming” and that JinkoSolar’s module production volume has “increased remarkably” month-over-month in the third quarter.
Xiande Li said that demand for modules is “gradually resuming” and that JinkoSolar’s module production volume has “increased remarkably” month-over-month in the third quarter.

The company said it also “further improved” its traceability system for procurement and production.
In a emailed commentary on the earnings statement, analyst Gordon L. Johnson II said that JinkoSolar disclosed a roughly $25.124 million Chinese government subsidy along with a tax rate of -4% due to a non-recurring tax benefit.

By Johnson’s calculation, JinkoSolar lost roughly $0.44 a share versus a consensus estimate of around -$0.15 a share. And he noted that module sales fell from 4.562 GW in the first quarter to 3.976 GW the second quarter, the first such decline since early 2019. He said that shipments may worsen due to U.S. Custom and Border Patrol action that began in June.
In mid-August, reports emerged that solar module shipments to the U.S. were being detained by Customs and Border Protection agents as part of an enforcement action aimed at banning the import of solar equipment containing components provided by a Chinese company suspected of using forced labor. Reports said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents. Analysts said that Jinko may not ship hundreds of megawatts of capacity to the U.S. as long as the customs inquiry is in process.
Johnson said of the company’s second quarter results,  “At risk of stating the obvious, these are not good numbers, and look set to actually get worse.”
At the end of June, the company’s in-house annual mono wafer, solar cell, and solar module production capacity was 27 GW, 12 GW (940 MW for N type cells), and 31 GW, respectively.
For the third quarter, the company said it expects total shipments to be in the range of 5 GW to 5.5 GW (solar module shipments to be in the range of 4.5 GW to 5 GW). Total revenue for the third quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.24 billion to $1.37 billion. Gross margin for the third quarter is expected to be between 12% and 15%.
For full year 2021, the company estimated total shipments (including solar modules, cells and wafers) to be in the range of 25 GW to 30 GW.

By September 2022, the partners plan to install the system for testing.
The companies that signed the memorandum of understanding include OCI Solar Power, a utility-scale solar energy developer; CPS Energy, the electric and natural gas utility serving San Antonio, Texas; and Hyundai Motor Group, the South Korean  mobility company.
The energy storage system (ESS) will be developed by Hyundai. OCI Solar Power will secure at least some of the ESS components and supervise construction, and CPS Energy will operate the system. The partners pledged to share data from the project.
In announcing the agreement, the partners said that after 7-10 years, a lithium-ion battery used in an EV may no longer be as efficient as needed for that use. However, the same battery may be recycled for use in an energy storage application.
Through the program, Hyundai Motor Group will test the effectiveness of the ESS business model in North America. It said it plans to graft hydrogen energy to the battery system to provide greater flexibility against volatility in the U.S. electricity market.
In August, global safety science leader UL and Hyundai Motor signed a memorandum of understanding to help further the safe deployment and use of second-life battery energy storage systems.

The company claims the tracker can withstand winds up to 120 mph.
The Voyager+ tracker is designed for modules 550 watts and higher, uses nearly 50% fewer foundation piles than comparable alternative systems, according to the company. It also enables a roughly 2% higher energy density than its 1P competitors.
In developing the tracker, FTC Solar collaborated with RWDI and Engineered Power Solutions (EPS) on data analysis and wind tunnel testing to independently validate the product’s structural stability. Through this testing and design modification, FTC said it created a tracker that can withstand winds equivalent to a category 3 hurricane, but also operates well in low wind speeds, an environment that has long been a hurdle for trackers.
Typically, high wind speeds come as part of a major storm in which case the solar system’s mitigation strategy would be utilized. Part of such strategies includes adjusting trackers to stow modules at an angle that is less susceptible to wind stress than the standard production angle.

You can’t, however, pack up an entire installation every time the wind picks up, and 2P trackers have historically struggled to mitigate things like vortex shedding and torsional galloping that occur at lower wind speeds. The greater surface area of the orientation and increasingly-larger modules make wind effects even more pronounced.
As the solar industry moves toward large-format modules of 600 watts or higher, traditional one module-in-portrait tracking systems have difficulty supporting these new sails, said Nagendra Cherukupalli, CTO of FTC Solar. “Because the static and dynamic wind loads are much greater on the structures, there is an ongoing need for improved tracking designs,” he said.
From FTC’s wind testing, the company developed a  dampener design, similar to a shock absorber. The design delivers a dampening ratio three times higher than traditional systems.
Currently, FTC has an installed and under-contract Voyager+ capacity of more than 1GW.
To get a more detailed look at the innovation employed in the new Voyager+ tracker, as well as to learn more about the module safety concerns associated with the effects of low wind, tune in on Wednesday, September 15, at 11 AM EDT/8 AM PDT when FTC Solar joins pv magazine for a webinar; “Extreme damping – A new wind mitigation strategy for trackers.”
