Holding its inaugural class over the fall semester of 2022, the college’s Solar Installer Certificate Program features an entry-level solar curriculum coupled with a paid externship and job interview process upon graduation of the 50-hour program.
The next term for the solar certification program begins March 28 on SCCC’s Michael J. Grant Campus, in Brentwood, N.Y., and upon completion graduates will receive OSHA 10 and OSHA Fall Prevention Safety certification. The program spans for four weeks and costs $850 to enroll, with scholarships available.
The solar certification program was initiated to prepare students for careers in the solar installation market.
A key differentiator for Suffolk County’s certificate program is the 16 hours spent working alongside different levels of field personnel on job sites. This includes working through all types of weather on rooftop solar projects and becoming familiar with safety procedures.
Integrated with OSHA safety training is knowledge of tools, job site protocol, and related products. Following the 16 hours of field work, students will have experience of a typical work day under their belt and can decide if they choose to move forward with a solar career, along with receiving feedback from their instructor on skills and personal drive.
“Suffolk is in the business of serving business,” said Dr. Ed Bonahue, president of SCCC. “When a company like Sunation comes forward with an urgent and significant workforce need, we will find the win-win partnership that provides students with the training that leads to good jobs and companies with the talent they need to grow.”
In the program’s inaugural fall 2022 term, training materials were gathered with Sunation vice president of special projects Brian Karp instructing a class of 15 students, for which all passed the certification course.  Of the graduates, five are now employed by Sunation, while the other students were offered positions elsewhere.
“Dr. Bonahue’s team really stepped up to the plate and remain highly motivated to continue this public-private partnership,” said Scott Maskin, chief executive officer, Sunation. “It was a simple pitch. The students are the crops, I’m the farmer, and SCCC is the field. Let’s grow a new way of building a workforce.”
The solar certification program was a central theme for local business authority the Hauppauge Industrial Association of Long Island (HIA-LI), of which Sunation and the college are active board members. The Long Island Innovation Park represents over 55,000 employees in all sectors and drives $13 billion in regional revenue.
“The HIA-LI applauds Sunation and Suffolk County Community College for developing this collaborative approach to workforce development specifically focused on augmenting Long Island’s energy sector,” said Terri Alessi-Miceli, president and CEO of the HIA-LI. “By embedding on-site field work into the students’ program, employers will have greater confidence that they’ll be bringing new hires who’ll truly be committed to the job. HIA-LI is pleased to be able to foster cooperative initiatives like this one.”
Based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., Sunation is a Pineapple Energy subsidiary that provides residential, commercial and community solar installation solutions throughout New York. The contractor was formed in 2011 and is a New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) recognized Gold status solar installer.  The company also provides GAF Energy roofing products and Tesla Powerwall storage solutions.
The goal for the installer program is to offer three to four courses annually. Enrollment for the spring class, beginning March 28, 2023, is already filling and registration information can be found on SCCC’s website.
Solar apprenticeships shine
Apprenticeship programs across the country, such as Rethink Electrical Advanced Program in Illinois, are seeing record numbers of students learning the in’s and out’s of solar installation.  The apprenticeship requirement of the Inflation Reduction Act requires that any U.S. taxpayer who employs four or more people must also employ at least one qualified apprentice. And, depending on when construction begins on a project, a certain journeyman to apprenticeship ratio must be met.  New apprenticeship programs are springing up in the Northeast and Midwest.

ERCOT and other U.S. grid operators, known as RTOs and ISOs, are shown in the nearby map from Sustainable FERC Project.
The mid-continental grid operator MISO reported signed generator interconnection agreements for 5 GW of solar projects in 2022, as shown in its public database.

New York’s grid operator NYISO completed final interconnection studies for 1.6 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of storage during the year. Grid operator SPP, serving several Great Plains states, completed facilities studies for 2 GW of solar in 2022, a spokesperson said.
California’s grid operator CAISO, halfway through its Cluster 14 interconnection study process for 38 GW of solar projects and 94 GW of storage projects, completed Phase 1 studies for the cluster last year, a spokesperson said.
ERCOT’s speed in completing interconnection studies has been partly attributed by Johannes Pfeifenberger, a principal with The Brattle Group, to its “connect and manage” approach.
Relative to its population served, ERCOT completed solar interconnection studies last year at a rate about five times that of SPP, MISO or NYISO.
Grid operators PJM and ISO-NE did not provide data in response to a request regarding their solar and storage interconnection progress in 2022. PJM had 189 GW of solar, storage, and solar-plus-storage projects in its interconnection queue at year-end 2021, according to a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Last year, all 13 states in the PJM grid region called for PJM to make faster progress on interconnection.
In total, almost 700 GW of solar and more than 400 GW of storage projects were waiting in interconnection queues in the U.S. at year-end 2021, according to the Berkeley Lab study.
Trade groups SEIA, AEE and ACP have said that interconnection studies “could be completed in months instead of years,” in comments last year in a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proceeding.
Reducing interconnection time to one year is a draft long-term goal of the U.S. Department of Energy’s i2X initiative.
Amazon has proposed that artificial intelligence can enable faster and more accurate modeling for interconnection studies. Tesla has said it could estimate a project’s interconnection costs in two weeks if it had access to grid models. And a law professor has said that to speed interconnection, public control of grid operators may be helpful, noting that CAISO is publicly controlled. These proposals and others are described in a 2022 year-end story on recommendations for solving interconnection delays.

Array Technologies says it will establish a manufacturing facility in Australia, after being tapped to supply locally manufactured trackers to the 102 MW Glenrowan solar farm.
The massive solar project is being developed by Pacific Partnerships, a subsidiary of Sydney-based construction firm Cimic Group. The company said its Australian factory will initially supply ground-mounted tracker systems for the Glenrowan array, but will eventually provide trackers for other new solar installations in Australia.
Array Technologies Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hostetler said the factory will bolster the company’s presence in the Australian marketplace and help spur economic growth in the region.
“This decision will help us meet the growing demand for renewable energy utilities, expedite project schedules, and have long-lasting economic benefits for Australia,” he said.
The Glenrowan solar farm, which is being developed on a 245-hectare site, is one of six large-scale energy generation and storage projects to have won supply contracts under the state’s second renewable energy target auction (VRET2). Together, the projects will deliver 623 MW of new generation and up to 365 MW/600 MWh of new energy storage.
Array Technologies said it is the first tracker supplier to win a contract under the VRET scheme, which is designed to grow renewable energy manufacturing capacity in the state and help the Victorian government meet its commitment to power all of its operations with renewable energy by 2025.
The VRET2 scheme is part of the state government’s plan to drive significant investment in all six renewable energy zones located across Victoria. The Victorian government has estimated the scheme will support the creation of 920 direct jobs and attract AUD 1.48 billion ($1.02 billion) in new renewable energy projects in the state.
“Generating new investment in renewable energy will have lasting benefits for Victoria’s economy, making energy delivery across the state more reliable and affordable,” said Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio.
The construction of the Glenrowan solar farm has already started, with the project expected to commence operations by the end of 2023. It will connect to the existing nearby Glenrowan Terminal Substation. It is expected to generate electricity equivalent for approximately 45,000 Australian homes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/06/rapidly-growing-u-s-microgrid-market-achieves-10-gw-in-2022/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,CALIFORNIA,CONNECTICUT,NEW ENGLAND,NEW JERSEY,NEW YORK,RHODE ISLAND,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 6, 2023",Rapidly growing U.S. microgrid market achieves 10 GW in 2022,"The U.S. microgrid market reached 10 GW in the third quarter of 2022, with more than 7 GW in operation and the rest in planning or construction stages, according to latest analysis from Wood Mackenzie’s Grid Edge Service.
Microgrids are groups of distributed energy resources, such as solar modules on a home, connected to a battery system, that can disconnect from the grid and operate independently during a power outage.
“Despite the global COVID-19 pandemic and associated macroeconomic challenges causing a two-year slowdown in the U.S., the microgrid market is developing at a rapid pace and 2022 is on track to be a record year for installations and scheduled pipelines,” said Elham Akhavan, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
Akhavan noted that microgrids are installed across various customer segments, with commercial and industrial leading the way. Microgrids are embraced in industries such as department stores and manufacturing, “indicating a rise in demand for an uninterrupted service,” he said, adding that the government sector takes second place, followed closely by residential and education sectors.
Military microgrid installations will likely grow as a result of the U.S. Army’s resiliency goal to install a microgrid on every installation by 2035. These will include renewable generation and large-scale battery storage, with the goal being able to “self-sustain its critical missions” on all Army installations by 2040.
According to Wood Mackenzie data, the U.S. microgrid market saw a 47% increase in solar and storage capacity additions in 2022 compared to 2017 levels. Moreover, the data shows that more than 175 solar projects and solar-plus-storage microgrids have been in active development and were scheduled to come online by the end of 2022.
“There’s been a significant shift in technology type, in particular the rise of solar and storage demand among microgrid customers, largely driven by corporate ESG goals,” Akhavan said. He noted that there’s been an uptake of “multi-distributed energy resource (DER) microgrids,” which may include a fossil fuel generator that acts as a backup power generator in cases where solar and batteries alone cannot mitigate long-duration outages.
Business models
The microgrid-as-a-service (MaaS) business model is projected to experience continued growth across various non-utility customer segments, and according to Wood Mackenzie’s data, the share of MaaS deals grew 25% from 2019 to Q3 2022, while the percentage of microgrids owned by end-users dropped 31% from 2019 to Q3 2022.
“While third-party financing in general is not a new model, MaaS is evolving beyond PPA contracts, which often involves procurement from a single DER to an affordable solution for financing the construction, operation and maintenance of multiple DERs, tailored to the customer’s energy objectives,” Akhavan added.
Wood Mackenzie data shows that there are 28 states with utility microgrids, with approximately 35 MW of projects expected to have come online in 2022. This implies total utility microgrid capacity of over 1.1 GW.
“Although utilities typically look to rate-base microgrids, some are partnering with developers to offer microgrids to their customers under MaaS agreements,” said Akhavan said. “For example, Enchanted Rock announced a utility partnership program in early 2022 that enables utilities to offer comprehensive ‘resilience-as-a-service’ to its customers.” Enchanted Rock deploys commercial-scale microgrids that use natural gas and renewable natural gas (RNG) to reduce carbon emissions and pollutants found in traditional diesel generators.
Akhavan estimates that we will see more than 20% growth in annual capacity installation of microgrids, if the market continues on its current trajectory. The industry has seen growth in the Northeast where a range of competitive grant programs are supporting resilience projects for critical facilities.
“The West Coast, led by California, is growing substantially, with a strong pipeline due to go into operation by 2024. This is followed closely by the Southwest market, which has expanded more than three times since 2019. Texas is the frontrunner, with two of the leading developers in the region, PowerSecure and Enchanted Rock, having installed all capacity so far in 2022,” Akhavan added.

This represents 70% of the 54.5 GW of new U.S. generating capacity forecast to enter the grid this year.
In the EIA’s latest Monthly Update to Annual Electric Generator Report, or EIA-860M, following delayed 2022 utility-scale solar projects due to trade issues from the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), the solar market is forecast to rebound this year with 29.1 GW of new installations. If all the new capacity comes online as planned, 2023 will have the most new utility-scale solar capacity added in a single year, more than doubling the current record of 13.4 GW deployed in 2021, the EIA notes.
U.S. utility-scale solar capacity has been rising rapidly since 2010. Despite its upward trend over the past decade, additions of utility-scale solar capacity declined by 23% in 2022 compared with 2021. This drop in solar capacity additions was the result of the UFLPA trade issues amid broader supply chain disruptions and other pandemic-related challenges.
In 2023, the EIA forecasts the largest new solar development queues to come from Texas (7.7 GW) and California (4.2 GW), which together account for 41% of new planned capacity.

Energy storage development has grown rapidly over the last few years, with that market currently eligible to start receiving its own 30% standalone storage investment tax credit under the IRA guidelines. In 2023, U.S. battery capacity will likely more than double, according to EIA estimates. Developers have reported plans to add 9.4 GW of battery storage to the existing 8.8 GW of battery storage capacity accounted in recent years, the EIA reports.
Energy storage is rapidly increasing as paired with utility solar and wind projects. Batteries can store excess electricity from wind and solar generators for later use based on daily intermittent patterns from wind and solar generation. In 2023, the EIA expects 71% of the new storage capacity to also come from California and Texas, states with significant solar and wind resources.  Arizona Public Service and Florida Power & Light, a NextEra Energy utility, are two of the largest offtake parties of storage for the year ahead, with battery systems ranging from 16 MW to 50 MW per project, while AES and Hawaiian Electric are procuring energy storage systems of 30 MW and 36 MW, respectively.
Top 5 largest projects
Enel Green Power’s Roseland Solar project (500 MW) in Falls County, Texas, and Blue Jay Solar (210 MW), in Grimes County, Texas, are among the top five largest projects set to enter commercial operations in 2023. Intersect Power’s IP Radian (300 MW), in Brown County, Texas, 25 Miles Creek Solar (250 MW) in Oklahoma, developed by Enel Green Power, and SR DeSoto I (162.5 MW), developed by Silicon Ranch in Georgia, round out the list of the largest projects to enter COD this year, according to the EIA’s monthly database.
The EIA’s Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory includes a comprehensive list of power generators that retired since 2002, with data culled since March 2017. The list can be found on the ‘Retired’ tab of the datafile. Starting with March 2018 data, the monthly data also includes project information from Puerto Rico for existing, retired, and proposed generating units with combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW or larger.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/06/price-responsive-demand-can-accelerate-renewable-generation/,"EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"FEBRUARY 6, 2023",Price-responsive demand can accelerate renewable generation,"At times of “surplus” renewable generation, customers with flexible demand for electricity can use more electricity that would otherwise be curtailed, says a paper from the Energy Systems Integration Group, a nonprofit group.
In a grid the size of Texas, at 15% renewable generation flexible demand could yield $3.3 billion in annual net savings for all consumers, including those with non-flexible demand, says the ESIG report by Michael Hogan, citing a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory study.
About 80% of cost reductions yielding those annual savings would result from avoided costs of investing in infrastructure—generation capacity, transmission and distribution hardware.
With increasing adoption of “inherently flexible loads” such as EVs and heat pumps, there is a growing potential for price-responsive demand, according to the report. To avoid unnecessary infrastructure investments and capture the cost savings, the ESIG calls for progressively assessing and incorporating expected demand elasticity into long-term capacity planning and procurement, at both the bulk system and distribution levels, among other measures.
The savings from flexible demand are “anything but inevitable,” because incumbent market actors including system operators tasked with balancing supply and demand, are “strongly biased” in favor of supply-side investments—principally fossil fueled generation but also grid-connected batteries—“even when empowering” demand-side flexibility would be less expensive.
Price-responsive demand faces discrimination and market pre-emption, as “embedding outdated assumptions about the inelasticity of demand overstimulates supply-side investment, which in turn undermines the value of empowering demand flexibility.
Providing two examples to make his point, Hogan said that market actors suppress market price signals to flexible consumers “by shifting compensation” to out-of-market capacity procurement, and also pre-empt the market by “centralizing commitments to pay for uneconomic capacity years in advance.”
As a result, “customers lose” because the transition to a decarbonized grid “becomes far more expensive than it needs to be,” Hogan said.
Price-responsive demand requires retail electricity prices that go up and down with the wholesale price of electricity, a concept known as Real-Time or Dynamic Pricing.
Hogan called for creating “safe” options for customers to select real-time retail electric pricing because “direct exposure to real-time pricing is unlikely to gain traction with most small consumers.” He added that regulators should allow third-party load management services at the distribution level, among other measures.
At the wholesale level, Hogan proposed measures to reduce or eliminate the discrimination and market pre-emption of price-responsive demand.
California has approved or is considering eight real-time pricing pilot programs, and the state’s public utilities commission is evaluating whether to expand those programs, as part of a proceeding aimed at achieving flexible demand through dynamic pricing.
Hogan’s paper is titled “Tapping the mother lode: Employing price-responsive demand to reduce the investment challenge.”
