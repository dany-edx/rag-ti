The contract, which Cubic reports is valued at approximately $1 billion, establishes a commitment for an annual supply volume by OCIM, providing Cubic with the polysilicon it needs in order to begin manufacturing at its U.S. plant
One year ago CubicPV announced plans to establish 10 GW of conventional mono wafer capacity in the United States. Driven by incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, Cubic reports that the wafers produced by the new facility could fill a void in the domestic supply chain as well as create 1,500 new direct jobs.
The silicon supply from OCIM reportedly satisfies U.S. law, helping CubicPV to produce domestic silicon wafers to serve the U.S. solar industry. Cubic reports that during the past six months it has produced “significant wafer volumes” using OCIM silicon, which meet or exceed customer specifications.
“This agreement with one of the world’s foremost leaders in polysilicon production is testament to our manufacturing capabilities and the progress against our U.S. manufacturing plans,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO, CubicPV. “OCIM’s high-quality, U.S. compliant silicon is in extremely high demand, and we are fortunate to lock-in our supply with a trusted supplier,”
Under the terms of the agreement, OCIM will begin to provide silicon in 2025 from its manufacturing facility, which OCIM reports is powered by clean, hydroelectricity. 
CubicPV was formed from the merger of Hunt Perovskite Technologies and 1366 Technologies, a company that was founded in 2008 and headquartered in Bedford, Mass. 1366 Technologies was known for its direct wafer technology, which forms wafers directly, using molten silicon, instead of silicon ingots sawn into wafers. The advantage is less loss because it uses a kerfless wafer production that does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers, a time-consuming process that wastes material as silicon dust. Instead, 1366’s technology forms wafers directly, using molten silicon.
CubicPV intends to produce M10 and G12 n-type wafers in its facility in the U.S. The exact location has not yet been disclosed.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/18/38-solar-growth-pushing-wind-solar-dynamic-duo-past-coal-in-2024/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",38% solar growth pushing wind-solar dynamic duo past coal in 2024,"The U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that the combined electricity generation from wind and solar power will surpass coal in 2024.
The EIA predicts a 38% increase in solar electricity generation in 2024 from its 2023 level, alongside 6.7% growth in wind energy. Overall, wind and solar are expected to generate 90 billion kWh more than coal in 2024, amounting to 688 billion kWh, while coal’s generation is projected at 599 billion kWh.

This transition is driven by two primary factors:
Wind generation is expected to rise from a forecasted 430 billion kWh in 2023 to 459 billion kWh in 2024, following a projected decrease in 2023 from the 434 billion kWh generated in 2022. Meanwhile, utility-scale solar generation is forecasted to grow from 143 billion kWh in 2022 to 165 billion kWh in 2023, and then surge to 228 billion kWh in 2024.
Small-scale solar energy is also showing growth, with a projected output of 85 billion kWh in 2024. This represents a 16% increase from 73 billion kWh in 2023, building on the previous year’s robust growth of nearly 20% from 2022’s 61 billion kWh.
Wind and solar together are expected to account for over 16% of all electricity generation next year. Specifically, wind energy alone is anticipated to provide nearly 10.3% of all electricity generated, with the remaining percentage attributed to solar power.
The expansion in solar generation is driven by a considerable increase in capacity. In 2023, utility-scale solar installations are estimated at 23 GW. Including all project sizes, suggests a total addition of 33 GW between industrial, community, commercial, and residential solar sectors. For 2024, the EIA expects 37 GW of utility-scale installations, which when combined with small scale capacity – we may see the national total reach nearly 50 GW.
As of September 2023, solar electricity generation has risen by 16% for all of 2023. Maintaining this growth rate through the end of 2023 would result in solar accounting for approximately 5.4% of the year’s total electricity generation.
In November, the EIA projected solar electricity generation would overtake hydroelectricity by 2024 due to solar capacity’s rapid growth, averaging 44% annually from 2009 to 2022. While hydroelectric capacity grew modestly at just under 1% per year, the actual output from hydroelectric sources has seen a slight decline.

Overall, the EIA projects the total electricity generation for 2024 to be 4,231 billion kWh, a 1% increase from the predicted 4,188 billion kWh in 2023, but slightly down from 2022’s 4,279 billion kWh.
Despite significant electricity price increases in 2021, 2022, and 2023, prices are expected to stabilize or decline in 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/18/not-a-very-special-year-canada-solar-expert-mulls-2022-slump/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CANADA",ANGELA SKUJINS,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",‘Not a very special year’: Canada solar expert mulls 2022 slump,"From pv magazine global
On Aug. 25, 2023 the Government of Alberta in Canada announced it had directed the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) to “pause” approvals on renewable energy projects until the following February, the Minister of Affordability and Utilities Nathan Neudorf said in a statement at the time.
According to a government factsheet, the pause would allow the AUC to conduct an inquiry into policy issues as well as future renewable deployment, with 13 projects – comprising 4.6 MW – suspended. Along with potential policy reform, the inquiry’s scope covers exploring renewable energy’s impact on “Alberta’s pristine view spaces” and “electricity system reliability.”
Alberta is one of the country’s most solar-rich regions and clocked in over 1.1 GW of PV installed capacity in 2022, according to the AUC.
Yves Poissant, renewables research manager at Natural Resources Canada’s CanmetENERGY, told pv magazine that the moratorium has impacted developers. And although they are still at the table, he said they are “impatient to get the projects off the ground.”
“They [the government] wanted to look at what would be the best practices in order to evaluate the regulations regarding solar PV on farmlands, and also sort of the grid integration of variable renewables on the grid.
“We’re looking at this, and hopefully, we’ll find a more appropriate approach to approve these projects and that they are more organized, because most of the growth right now, most of the installed capacity, is in Alberta.”
Poissant said years ago the state shifted away from oil and gas – another abundant local natural resource – and shut down its fossil-fuel generation capacity to usher in “clean energy”. This is why the pause in Alberta, a renewable energy pioneer, has impacted the whole country. “That’s where most of the growth in solar in Canada comes from currently. In Alberta,” Poissant said.
Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA) CEO Vittoria Bellissimo said in August the moratorium was a “mistake” that would impact ratepayers, investors and municipalities.
The comments follow the Paris-based International Energy Agency releasing its survey report of Canadian PV applications in 2022. According to the report, which Poissant co-authored, Canada’s cumulative national installed solar capacity from that year was 4.32 GW – a 12% growth from the year before. Ontario saw the most installations with 2.7 GW, followed by Alberta with 1.3 GW and Saskatchewan with 73 MW.
“To be honest, when I look at the international statistics I have a hard time finding some exciting things to say about Canada. Canada is a very small market,” Poissant said, adding that 2022 was, “not a very special year.”
“There are more than 70,327 PV systems grid-connected in Canada currently. It’s a relatively slow growth but we do see a transition happening.”
Things that helped development, according to the report, include technology advancements being made mainstream, such as the sale of 117,994 electric vehicles. Competitive module prices also helped, with the average price for a standard module crystalline silicon module last year being CAD $0.63 kWh ($0.47) – a jump from the 2021 $0.46 kWh price. The average cost for household electricity was $16.26 kWh with the highest price recorded as $20.98 kWh.
According to the Government of Canada’s sustainable development goals, renewables and non-emitting resources must generate 90% to 100% of electricity by 2030 with coal-fired electricity completely phased out by 2035. “Where we are now?” Poissant asks.
“Most of our electricity in Canada, 60%, is produced by hydroelectricity, which is non-emitting, we have another 15% that’s produced by nuclear, so some provinces like Ontario, and there’s also another nuclear plant in New Brunswick, but mainly Ontario.”
The authors state in the report that solar and wind comprise most of the added electricity generation, with falling prices and capital costs, climate change mitigation policies, and increasing consumer demand making PV one of the most attractive renewable energy options on the market.
“However, PV installations remain variable across the provinces and territories based on their current energy mix and climate change mitigation plan,” according to the report.

Recently three justices in Canada ruled that the youth who brought the case are deserving of a trial to determine if Canada is protecting children’s constitutional rights to life, liberty and security of the person.
The justices acknowledged in their decision that climate change is a current and consequential problem and that “it is also beyond doubt that the burden of addressing the consequences will disproportionately affect Canadian youth.” The justices also noted that climate change has had a serious effect on indigenous peoples, “threatening the ability of Indigenous communities in Canada to sustain themselves and maintain their traditional ways of life.”
Saying that climate change could qualify as “special circumstances,” the justices stated that a trial is needed to determine if such circumstances call the government to affirmatively protect the youth plaintiffs. Read the justices’ decision here.
“This decision contains very clear language that a trial is needed to hold Canada to account for its failure to limit GHG emissions,” said Catherine Boies Parker, a lawyer for the youth plaintiffs. “While the Court found that the claim must be amended to more specifically identify the provisions that lead to excess GHG emissions, the Court confirmed the right of these children to challenge Canada’s actions and inactions as causing significant harm to their security of the person.”
The lawsuit joins the list of actions that young people have taken against governments across the U.S. Backed by Our Children’s Trust, a public interest law firm founded in 2010 on the idea that courts are vital to democracy and empowered to protect our children and the planet. In addition to the case in Canada, La Rose v. His Majesty the King, Our Children’s Trust recently filed a federal constitutional climate lawsuit against the EPA. In June the Trust brought a case against the State of Montana. Not only was this the first constitutional climate trial in U.S. history, but the plaintiffs received a landmark ruling declaring Montana’s laws to be unconstitutional.
The Montana case, Held v. State of Montana, was filed three years ago by 16 youth plaintiffs who were not seeking monetary compensation, but sought to declare state laws unconstitutional that permitted agencies from considering climate change or greenhouse gas emissions when permitting fossil fuel activities.
Montana is a state that traditionally has been heavily dependent on fossil fuels. It contains the largest coal reserve in the U.S., amounting to 30% of the U.S. total. According to the Energy Information Administration, Montana obtains 43% of its electricity from coal, 41% from hydro, 12% from wind, and 2% from natural gas and 3% from hydropower. Through Q4 2022, Montana was ranked 44th in the country for solar installations, with only 133 MW of installed capacity, or enough to power 17,410 homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. 
Read 50 states of solar incentives: Montana.
On December 13, 2023 the Montana judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in Held v. State of Montana, agreeing that the fossil-fuel dependent state violated their rights to equal protection, dignity, liberty, health and safety, and public trust, predicated on their right to a clean and healthful environment.
The 103-page decision by Judge Seeley sets a new legal precedent for the rights of youth including:
Called a game changing ruling by Julia Olson, chief legal counsel and executive director with Our Children’s Trust, she said “this marks a turning point in this generation’s efforts to save the planet from the devastating effects of human-caused climate chaos”.
“Today, for the first time in U.S. history, a court ruled on the merits of a case that the government violated the constitutional rights of children through laws and actions that promote fossil fuels, ignore climate change, and disproportionately imperil young people,” said Olson.
The legislative and executive branches in Montana are now responsible for conforming their practices around fossil fuels to the judge’s ruling, including the admonition that “[e]very additional ton of GHG emissions exacerbates Plaintiffs’ injuries and risks locking in irreversible climate injuries.” The State has 60 days to decide whether to appeal the decision to the Montana Supreme Court.
Future cases include a federal constitutional climate lawsuit, Juliana v. United States, in which Our Children’s Trust represents the 21 youth plaintiffs based on the question of whether the federal government’s fossil fuel-based energy system, and resulting climate destabilization, is unconstitutional. The Trust also has a case against the Hawaii Department of Transportation, another in Utah and another in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/18/brenmiller-energy-commissions-thermal-energy-storage-demonstration-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",Brenmiller Energy commissions thermal energy storage demonstration project,"Thermal energy storage developer Brenmiller Energy has finished commissioning a bGen thermal storage-based co-generation station at the State University of New York (SUNY) Purchase. It is expected to slash around 550 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year.
The project was developed along with the New York Power Authority and partially financed by a grant from the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation. Brenmiller intends to hand over the system to the university after training in mid-January. 
The company’s thermal energy storage system essentially uses crushed rocks to store the energy from renewables or the grid, Gideon Sharir, managing director, U.S., at Brenmiller Energy, told pv magazine USA. The system heats this energy to up to 1200°F, via internal heaters, and stores it until it is ready to be discharged on-demand in the form of clean steam, hot water, or air, Sharir said. 
The SUNY system is part of a combined heat and power system. The project charges using electricity via embedded electric heaters and waste heat from the microturbine’s exhaust, and discharges to heat SUNY Purchase’s recreation center, which is one of the campus’ most energy-intensive buildings. 
The project, which “charges” using both exhaust gas and electricity, is a demonstration site that showcases the full array of thermal energy storage capabilities, including its ability to charge with electricity and recovered heat, according to Sharir. It is distinct from the other projects in Brenmiller’s pipeline, which are designed to charge using only electricity from renewables or the grid. As a demonstration project, the SUNY system is relatively smaller in size – 450 kW/400 kWh – although Brenmiller’s other projects typically range from 10 MWh to 100+ MWh. 
Turning over the operation of the project is a huge milestone for the company, said Avi Brenmiller, Brenmiller’s chairman and CEO. 
“The benefits of our bGen, once demonstrated through this project, could enable broader adoption of our thermal energy storage systems in New York and across the U.S.,” Brenmiller said. 
Thermal energy storage can play a massive role in the clean energy transition, according to Sharir. 
Industrial heating demand accounts for about 12% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Because thermal batteries can reach extremely high temperatures at a cost that is competitive with natural gas, and are mature and reliable, industrial manufacturers are increasingly looking at them as a decarbonization solution, he said. 
“As these technologies continue to gain traction, the thermal energy market is expected to yield trillions of dollars by 2040,” Sharir added. 
However, the technology does face certain challenges to scaling up, including complex and outdated grid policies and supply frameworks, he said. On the one hand, market structures must be updated to take advantage of the benefits of thermal energy storage to reduce stress on the grid. On the other hand, regulators must allow thermal energy storage to participate in wholesale markets and access spot prices, he said. 
“Overcoming both of these barriers will ensure that [thermal energy storage] can provide flexibility to the grid and cost-effectively enable industrial decarbonization,” said Sharir.
