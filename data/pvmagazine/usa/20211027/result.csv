The tower will be charged with solar photovoltaic energy. The dispatched storage will support the creation of renewable hydrogen, biogenic based, synthetic aviation fuel, and diesel fuel.
The agreement is estimated to provide Energy Vault with $520 million in revenues across three projects. The first, a 500 MWh storage tower in Louisiana, is expected to commence in mid-2022. Additional projects are planned in British Columbia and Ohio.
Energy Vault’s design includes a six-armed crane tower that lifts composite blocks using an electric (solar-powered) motor. The lifted blocks are stacked, which creates potential energy. As the blocks are lowered, the energy is harvested and dispatched for use.
The tower is controlled by computer systems and machine vision software that orchestrate the charging and discharging cycles. A range of storage durations from two to 12 hours or longer is achievable, said the company.
Energy Vault said the tower’s design is based on the physics of pumped hydroelectric energy storage. However, as a solid “mobile mass,” the composite blocks do not lose storage capacity over time. The company said the tower has an 85% round-trip efficiency and a 35-year-plus technical life.
The composite blocks can be made cheaply, said the company, using excavated soil from the construction site, waste materials like mine tailings and coal ash, and even fiberglass from decommissioned wind turbines.
DG Fuels will deploy the storage systems to power its carbon conversion fuel process. The company said it is targeting a 93% carbon efficiency rate for its aviation fuel. It will also use the tower’s energy to power water electrolysis for both hydrogen and oxygen feedstock production.

The settlement agreement was developed jointly with the state’s consumer advocate agency, the Florida Office of Public Counsel, as well as the Florida Retail Federation, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.  Vote Solar, The CLEO Institute and Federal Executive Agencies also signed the agreement.
Under the new rates, which will be phased in rather than immediately introduced, FPL’s typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill is expected to grow from 2021-2025 at an average annual rate of 2.8%, with FPL maintaining that the growth will still keep bills “well below” the national average. Typical FPL business customer bills are also expected to remain below the national average and grow from 2021-2025 at an average annual rate of 1.6% to 3.4%, depending on rate class.
FPL shares that new rate plan directly supports the company’s “30-by-30” plan to install 30 million solar panels in Florida by 2030. In doing so, the agreement will also expand the company’s SolarTogether program.
SolarTogether is billed as one of the largest community solar programs in the country, though calling it a true community solar program may be a bit of a misnomer. The program is one piece of the utility’s larger 30×30 program, and is described by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy as 30×30’s “backbone.”
The program was initially set to total 1.49 GW in capacity, spread out across 20 projects. While FPL has not shared specifically how the new capacity enabled under this rate structure will be divvied up, the approved settlement agreement supports the development of 16 million solar panels across more than 50 new sites.
This is where the phrasing gets tricky. Each of the projects within the SolarTogether program will be 74.5 MW in capacity, the general maximum size for utility-scale solar installations in Florida. True community solar installations, however, are considered to be in the 1-5 MW range, with some outliers pushing the boundary at 20 MW.
Moreover, SolarTogether subscribers don’t pay to directly receive the energy generated by any particular project. Instead, customers buy a subscription that helps to pay for the 20 solar energy centers FPL has built across the state. In return, the customers receive credits that eventually lower their electric bills. Subscribers are expected to achieve a simple payback on their subscription within seven years.
In addition to solar energy, the approved agreement supports FPL’s green hydrogen pilot project in Okeechobee County, as well as the FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center, the world’s largest integrated solar-powered battery system, set begin serving customers later this year. The agreement also supports investments in resilient infrastructure projects to help ensure reliable service in good weather and bad.
The agreement will also unify the rates and tariffs of FPL and Gulf Power, the utility which legally merged with FPL on Jan. 1, 2021. The settlement agreement will implement a transition rider/credit mechanism to address the price differences in what the utility describes as “a reasonable manner for all customers.” The transition rider/credit will decline to zero over a five-year period, at which point rates would be fully aligned by Jan. 1, 2027.
Under the approved settlement agreement, a typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill in Northwest Florida is projected to be lower at the end of 2025 than it is today.

The patents cover shingled solar modules and a process for separating photovoltaic strips from solar cells for use in shingled solar modules.
The judge assigned to oversee Solaria’s lawsuit against Canadian Solar issued an Initial Determination finding that Canadian Solar violated section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 in their importation of shingled solar modules.
Solaria said in a statement that the initial finding demonstrated that Canadian Solar “utilized Solaria’s innovations and technology without permission and in violation of U.S. patent law.”
Solaria said it was confident that the ITC will move to issue an exclusion order preventing Canadian Solar from importing and selling shingled modules in the U.S.

Sunnova said that EVs in the home increase annual energy demand from 50% to 100%, depending on the owners charging behavior. By bundling a solar system and an EV charger in a single purchase, Sunnova said that customers will be able to properly size and install the right equipment to meet their needs.
The two plan to embed ChargePoint software in customers’ Sunnova portal, which they said would help optimize car charging with other home energy needs.
ChargePoint markets Home Flex, a 240V Level 2 home charger capable of delivering up to 50 amps of power. It said that most drivers will use 32 or 40 amps, but up to 50 amps are available for fast charging. That extra capacity requires hardwired installation and may require electrical upgrades, the company said at its web site.
