https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/23/esa-completes-first-phase-of-3-6-mw-cannabis-growers-solar-farm/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RACKING,FLORIDA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 23, 2023",ESA completes first phase of 3.6 MW cannabis grower’s solar farm,"In Central Florida, ESA Solar this week announced completion of a first 1.2 MW phase of a 3.6 MW ground-mounted solar project for a cannabis grower utilizing indoor growing facilities.  The three-phase solar farm project is part of ESA’s ongoing expansion efforts to provide pathways to decarbonization for companies and communities in new markets and regions, including recreational cannabis.
The solar farm uses Q Cells Q-Peak Duo XL bifacial double glass solar modules mounted to Terrasmart Glide racking hardware, a design built to provide maximum efficiency and stability, an ESA Solar spokesman told pv magazine USA. The array’s panels are strung together using 62.5 kW Sunny TriPower Core 1 inverters from SMA Solar, he added.
A 2022 report from the United Nations’ Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated climate control measures represent more than 80% of the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production. On-site solar systems can reduce costs for growing operations, as electricity can add up to 30% to 50% of the cost of cannabis production.
Cannabis production represents over 1% of U.S. electricity demand, said the National Conference of State Legislatures, presenting a large opportunity for renewable energy adoption.
According to the State of the Cannabis Cultivation Industry report of 2021, 54% of growers solely operate indoor facilities, while upwards of 80% operating an indoor facility in addition to a greenhouse or outdoor facility. Related to energy consumption, 150 kWh is used annually per square foot in an indoor grow facility. This equates to less than 750,000 kWh of annual energy use for small facilities and over 5 million kWh for large growers.
Various recreational cannabis market growers have turned to on-site solar and energy storage systems to offset their energy consumption in addition to using energy efficient LED lighting systems designed to operate at daily intervals when power is less expensive on the grid. Such practices have in turn saved an additional 50% or more on energy consumption.
ESA’s three-phased solar farm will be used to support all the electricity needs on-site for the Floridian greenhouse cannabis grower. The solar farm project will help cut electricity costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create a more reliable source of electricity, and promote clean energy across the central Florida region, the developer said.
“We are happy to already be wrapping up phase one of this new solar farm project near our home base of Central Florida,” said Justin Vandenbroeck, executive vice president of ESA Solar. “Working alongside local agricultural leaders to promote sustainable energy practices is how we help them meet their growing energy needs. This project will power a cannabis facility, one of the fastest growing sources of new electricity consumption, rivaling data centers and EVs.”
The second phase of the solar farm is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, opening a path for more on-site solar for cannabis facilities in the coming years, the developer said.
Founded in 2017, ESA is a Maitland, Fla.-based commercial, community and utility scale solar developer which has developed projects in more than 10 states. Collectively its team has developed over 3 GW of projects over their career.
Elsewhere in the U.S., Santa Barbara, California-based Canndescent boasts more than 100,000 square feet of indoor cultivation space and produces close to 17 tons of cannabis per year. In 2019, the grower installed a 282.5 kW solar system at its facility in Desert Hot Springs, Calif. The grower’s solar system offsets 25% to 35% of the company’s electricity consumption, depending on the time of year, senior director of compliance Andrew Mochulsky told pv magazine in April 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/23/new-jerseys-agrivoltaic-program-moving-forward-fighting-interconnection/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,NEW JERSEY",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 23, 2023","New Jersey’s agrivoltaic program moving forward, fighting interconnection","New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) has authorized the Dual-Use Solar Energy Pilot Program. This 200 MWdc agrivoltaic pilot program will run over a span of three years and will be jointly executed by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture and Rutgers University’s Agrivoltaics Program (RAP).
While the governor granted approval to the program in 2021, it is still in the early stages of development. A detailed straw proposal is slated for release in summer 2023, marking the beginning of a “robust public engagement process.”
RAP disclosed details about its R&D agrivoltaic systems under development at three New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station Farms this spring. These facilities include the Rutgers Animal Farm in New Brunswick, the Rutgers Agricultural Research and Extension Center (RAREC) facility in Bridgeton, and the Snyder Research and Extension Farm in Pittstown.
The Animal Farm facility will feature 170 kWdc vertical bifacial solar panels. The construction plans include ZnShine 450 solar modules featuring a backside bifaciality rating of 70%. The facility has not yet started construction, but is expected to be completed by July of this summer.

At the southern end of the solar plant will be animal shelter and water facilities, as well as handling infrastructure. The researchers will be testing the performance of forage crops for beef cows and also tracking their movement in and around the rows of vertical bifacial panels.
The RAREC facility, the size of which could vary between 40 kWac and 211 kWac depending on interconnection availability, is undergoing a full 255 kWdc system installation. Crop experiments will be conducted regardless of whether the panels are fully connected.

David R. Specca, head of Rutgers Agrivoltaics Program Lead, told pv magazine USA:
We will be researching the impact of single-wide and double-wide single axis trackers along with the necessary control blocks to provide the statistical analysis need for our trials at RAREC. The crops we are planning to grow at RAREC for the first three years will be spinach, broccoli, and lettuce in the spring season; tomatoes, peppers and eggplant in the summer/fall season; and cover crops during the winter season. We will also use a portion of the trial area for soybeans.
The Snyder Farm, a single axis tracker facility, has 94.5 kWdc of modules but is restricted to 82.4 kWdc due to restrictions on the size of the existing transformer. The state board’s ruling limits the solar facility to delivering 104,424 kWh per year to three off-take customers. The Snyder solar facility will be used for hay production for its first three years.  
 
In the Dual-Use Solar Energy Pilot Program, each project is capped at 10 MWdc. The pilot program is expected to last three years, offering a total capacity of 200 MW, with an option for a five-year extension and a total capacity of 300 MW. The NJBPU hopes to choose projects following a competitive process that includes both “price and non-price terms”, as well as a wide range of crops on unpreserved farmland.

The program mandated that 30% of new projects be reserved for low-income subscribers, creating economic benefits to ratepayers across the state’s utility jurisdictions as the 21st U.S. state to adopt community solar.
This week InClime Solutions, a veteran-owned business that vets U.S. renewable energy and energy efficiency incentive programs, announced 200 MW of projects selected for inclusion in the next slate of New Mexico’s community solar program out of 1.7 GW of project submissions.
Six projects are in the El Paso Electric service area, which includes the Las Cruces, Hatch, N.M. and west of El Paso, Texas region of New Mexico. Another 10 projects were selected in the Southwestern Public Service Company service area, toward the southeast of the state. Elsewhere, 29 projects were selected to be developed in Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM Resources) territory, a broader territory that includes the major cities of Albuquerque and Santa Fe, as well as Rio Rancho, Alomogordo and Cliff, N.M. in other parts of the southwestern state.
Project developers have a June 21 deadline for project submission to the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (PRC). Selected projects must pay a $2,500 per MWac project fee within 30 days of receiving notification of selection.
The PRC received more than 400 community solar project applications totaling more than 1.7 GW of clean energy capacity..
Select projects, developers or engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors and locations advancing in the program include:
El Paso Electric bids
Southwestern Public Service bids
PNM bids
Each New Mexico utility’s service territory has a waitlisted queue of more than 205 MW of projects should the selected developers not commit to the project deadline going forward. About 30.7 MW of projects are queued in El Paso territory, 45.75 MW of projects in Southwestern territory, and about 129.5 MW of projects in PNM’s territory.
The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission is contracted with InClime to oversee the community solar program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/23/pvel-releases-ninth-edition-of-pv-module-reliability-scorecard/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 23, 2023",PVEL releases ninth edition of PV Module Reliability Scorecard,"PV Evolution Labs (PVEL), an independent test lab for the downstream solar industry and member of the Kiwa Group, published its 2023 PV Module Reliability Scorecard. This year’s Scorecard names 250 model types of PV modules from 35 manufacturers as Top Performers in PVEL’s testing, the most in the company’s history.
The Scorecard summarizes results from the PV Module Product Qualification Program (PQP), a testing regime established by PVEL in 2012 to provide empirical data for PV module benchmarking and project-level energy yield and financial models.
Now in its ninth edition, the Scorecard provides more than just module testing, while its current iteration includes additional factors such as frames, glass, cells, backsheets, encapsulants and junction boxes. In the backsheet category, for example, 24 backsheet models were tested, 47% of which used a backsheet and 53% used rear glass to cover and protect the back of modules.
In terms of module technologies, p-type PERC is still the dominant technology across the Top Performers, TOPCon is also rising to the top. This year there are 37 TOPCon model types listed as Top Performers, up from just one in 2022. Heterojunction (HJT) is also on the rise, with nine HJT modules rated as a Top Performer, compared to just two last year.
Manufacturers of the thirteen top rated modules have had Top Performers for three years in a row. JinkoSolar and Trina Solar have been Top Performers since 2014, while Qcells and REC Solar since 2016.

The 2023 PV Module Reliability Scorecard shows Top Performers for six PQP test categories. To earn the rank of Top Performer, the modules must have < 2% power degradation following the particular test, a threshold that PVEL has used since 2018. For that reliability test they must not have experienced a wet leakage failure, a ‘major’ defect during visual inspection, or a diode failure.
“Solar technology and the manufacturer landscape continue to evolve rapidly, and with module supply issues persisting, buyers need guidance on how to procure the best possible modules for their projects,” said Tristan Erion-Lorico, VP of sales and marketing at PVEL. “Our 2023 Scorecard features a truly global list of module manufacturers. For buyers worldwide looking to understand the critical differences across cell technologies and module designs, our Scorecard provides many key insights and an easy way to search through the best commercially available options for developers.”
While it could seem that overall quality has improved because of the increasing number of Top Performer manufacturers and models, the percentage of manufacturers that experienced a failure also increased. Additionally, almost one third of the bills of materials (BOMs) tested suffered at least one failure during testing, and 15% of BOMs had a failure before stress testing.
Modules tested for the 2023 Scorecard were manufactured in 12 different countries, with sales worldwide. Also included in this year’s Scorecard are case studies from the factory and the field, showing how real-world performance is addressed through reliability testing.
Participation in PVEL’s PQP and Scorecard is voluntary for manufacturers and only top-performing module model types are named in the Scorecard. To date, PVEL has tested over 500 BOMs from more than 60 manufacturers for the PV Module PQP.
The Scorecard is publicly accessible in digital format, and includes a searchable and exportable database. Top Performers can be filtered by PQP test, cell technology, factory location, power class and more. Search results can also be downloaded and exported directly from the site.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/23/powin-signs-manufacturing-agreement-with-jabil-to-produce-2-gwh-u-s-storage-systems/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,FLORIDA,MEXICO,OREGON,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 23, 2023",Powin signs manufacturing agreement with Jabil to produce 2 GWh U.S. storage systems,"According to Wood Mackenzie, the U.S. energy storage market installed a record 4.8 GW in 2022, with installations expected to surpass 75 GW by 2027 based on the standalone investment tax credit (ITC) and onshoring manufacturing efforts from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021.
To meet this growing demand, Tualatin, Oregon-based Powin, a modular energy storage systems distributor, has selected Jabil as its manufacturing partner to produce Powin’s Stack750 Centipede energy storage systems. Beginning in Q4 2023, Jabil will produce an initial annual capacity of 2 GWh, with plans to ramp up to 4 GWh per year of the lithium-ion battery systems.
The partnership is designed to address Powin’s expanding U.S. customer and project base based on increased demand for energy storage projects. Previously, Powin sourced battery components for its modular systems from China and Southeast Asia, Danny Lu, senior vice president, Powin, told pv magazine USA.
Jabil will leverage its power engineering, global manufacturing footprint, and supply chain experience to accelerate the production of American-made Powin’s Stack750 systems.
Powin selected Jabil due to a combination of the company’s high-level assembly techniques, deep energy storage prowess, and commitment to environmental health, social equity and sustainable practices.
“Jabil’s flexible business model enables Powin to scale quickly and efficiently to meet high industry growth,” said Stuart Bolland, chief operating officer, Powin. “Our collaboration with Jabil not only reflects our pledge to safety and operational excellence, but more importantly our commitment to building a domestic energy storage supply chain.”
The collaboration will not only reduce supply chain risk by increasing capacity to directly serve the U.S. market, but it also reportedly supports Powin’s customers in meeting the domestic content requirements that are currently being set by the Inflation Reduction Act.
The Stack750 storage system is a 750 kWh DC lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery that is rated to provide two to four hours of battery discharge over a cycle life of 7,300 cycles. The battery system’s calendar life is 20 years and the battery’s tested round-trip efficiency is 93% to 95%, with the four-hour discharge battery providing the higher efficiency. The storage system requires half the time to procure and deploy, and uses 30% less space onsite, while reducing lifecycle costs compared to atypical modular storage systems.
Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (CATL) and EVE Energy have been Powin’s suppliers of the LFP battery cells.
Jabil, headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, manufactures energy storage system (ESS) products using its high-level assembly (HLA), power engineering and global manufacturing operations. Jabil’s energy storage experience includes lithium-ion-based uninterruptible power systems (UPS) and air-conditioned cabinet assemblies for DC battery racks and modules. The company has produced storage systems from at least eight countries, including the U.S., Mexico and Brazil.
Powin’s systems have been deployed in close to 1.4 GWh of standalone storage and renewable energy paired storage projects in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Taiwan and Israel, according to its project website. The company has over 6 GWh of systems in operation and advanced development, and an additional 11 GWh of projects under contract.
Besides partnering with Jabil in the U.S., Powin signed a January 2022 agreement with Celistica, a Mexico-based contract supplier, for the “nearshoring” fabrication of additional Powin Centipede systems. That partnership addressed near-term demand for the modular storage systems in North America. Mass production of the Centipede storage system took place in mid-2022.
Powin is exhibiting at Booth #4015 at the CleanPower Conference & Exhibition 2023, a national power and renewable energy industry conference taking place from May 23 to 25 at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/23/origami-solar-develops-lighter-weight-solar-module-frames-made-of-steel/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 23, 2023",Origami Solar develops lighter weight solar module frames made of steel,"Origami Solar, based in Bend, Oregon, was awarded the grand prize in the 2022 U.S. Department of Energy’s American-Made Solar Prize competition, recognizing the disruptive value and market potential of the company’s steel module frame.
The patent-pending steel frame is said to lower cost and improve module performance. The company reports that the frames are made of “green” recycled steel, thereby reducing greenhouse gases by up to 93%, representing a reduction of 80 kg per module or 200 metric tons per MW.
Origami Solar was founded by Eric Hafter and Jack Patton to try to bring innovation and cost reduction to solar module production. The founders noticed that in 20 years, the cost of other module components had come down but not that of the aluminum frame, which had become a significant part of the cost. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), the aluminum frame costs roughly 2.23 cents per watt based on a total cost of 8.9 cents per watt for everything except the cell, with the frame representing 25% of the cost.
Hafter and Patton were also concerned about the greenhouse gases that result from aluminum manufacturing, so instead they looked at recycled steel. According to Origami Solar, using aluminum for module frames contributes more than ten times the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than its steel frames. The company said emissions are 14 kg of per 1 kg of aluminum, whereas steel production results in about 1.2 kg of GHGs for every 1 kg of steel. Recycled steel produces even less GHGs.
“Our Gen 2 frames are lighter, stronger and ideally suited to provide superior support to the new large-format modules coming to market,” said Gregg Patterson, CEO of Origami Solar. “In collaboration with steelmakers and precision roll formers, we have designed the Origami steel module frame to match the fit, form and function of industry-standard frames, making the transition from aluminum to steel seamless for module manufacturing and field installation.”
After working on the process for 12 years, Origami developed a patent-pending frame design that is manufacturable using a steel roll forming process. The company reports that the frames meet structural requirements and have a projected module lifespan of 30 years.
The second-generation frames are undergoing tests by third-party labs and module manufacturers and are now available for evaluation testing by module makers and key partners.
“Our goal throughout this process has been to support Origami Solar to ensure that any solar panel producer will be able to rapidly integrate and scale these frames with virtually no changes to their production processes, in both the U.S. and Europe,” said Thomas Welser of Welser Profile, a global manufacturer of roll-formed steel products. “Together with Origami Solar we have optimized the design and are working on further innovations that will address future industry needs.”
Origami Solar is sourcing steel and plans on producing frames regionally, thus eliminating supply chain constraints. The company reports that the frames are 100% U.S. made and will enable solar modules to qualify for the bonus tax credit.
“Steel is an earth-abundant resource that can be manufactured on every continent, the use of which in trackers, racking, mounts, and tubes is already widely accepted by the solar industry,” said Mathew Arnold, CEO of Unimacts, a Boston-based manufacturer with production facilities in Nevada, Mexico and Spain. “We are excited to collaborate with Origami Solar to rapidly facilitate the shift from imported aluminum to domestically made steel frames.”
