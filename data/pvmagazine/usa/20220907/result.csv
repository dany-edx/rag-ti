The project was conducted in partnership with University of Colorado, Boulder, and the University of California, San Diego. 
A new architectural structure enabled the perovskite solar cell to demonstrate a certified 24% efficiency, while retaining 87% of its original output capability after 2,400 hours of operation at 55 degrees Celsius. 
Perovskites are defined by their crystalline structure. They are actively being researched worldwide for their ability to be manufactured at scale as readily printable materials that can be deposited as paper-thin solar cells.  
The flexible, lightweight cells are hailed for their numerous uses, like on low-load roofs, in aviation, wearables, and rapid delivery and rollout in disaster situations. Perovskites are naturally occurring minerals, but they also represent lab-made crystalline structured materials that imitate the natural minerals’ shape. 
Perovskites have made leaps and bounds in their efficiency, growing from 3% in 2009 to over 25% today. However, the material currently struggles with stability, in part because temperature sensitivity causes them to degrade relatively rapidly. The earliest perovskites worked for only a few minutes or hours, but today they have a lifespan of several months.
This research project employed the use of an “inverted” architecture, rather than the latest architecture that has unlocked record efficiencies. The inverted structure is achieved by using a different layering technique in the glass substrate the perovskite crystals are deposited into.
The team also made use of a new molecule on the surface of the perovskite, 3-(Aminomethyl) pyridine (3-APy). The molecule reacted to the formamidinium within the perovskite to create an electric field on the surface of the perovskite layer.
“That suddenly gave us a huge boost of not only efficiency but also stability,” said Kai Zhu, senior scientist in chemistry and nanoscience at NREL. The newly introduced molecule boosted efficiency from under 23% to over 25%.
Zhu described the results as “state-of-the-art levels of efficiency and operational reliability.”
The project was funded by the Center for Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Semiconductors for Energy (CHOISE), an Energy Frontier Research Center within DOE’s Office of Basic Energy Sciences, and from the DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO).
In-line defect detection
SETO is also funding a project run by University of Arizona to develop a new method for identifying defects in perovskite solar cell development during the manufacturing process.
The University of Arizona is developing a method to detect the creation of defects not after the perovskites are made, which is the traditional operation, but rather during the manufacturing process.
The project uses what lead researcher Erin Ratcliff describes as” an in-line characterization tool.” The aim of the tool is to perform quality control assessment in the exact moments the perovskite cells are made. “This quality control method is also an indication for the long-term stability of the materials you’re making.”
“Large-scale manufacturing of these robust, high-quality perovskite-based photovoltaics will require low-cost and practical quality control methods that can be integrated into an operating line,” said Laura Silva, senior licensing manager for the College of Science at Tech Launch Arizona. “Ratcliff’s approach is overcoming these challenges and making the technology much more attractive in a marketplace that’s demanding higher and higher performance.”

The solar array, located near the state’s capital of Augusta, is expected to generate electricity equivalent to the demand of 1,050 Maine residents.
The system was built on land purchased by Syncarpha’s partner Acadia Energy on roadside land owned by the Maine Department of Transportation. About 10 acres of the 30-acre purchase was donated to the Sportsman Alliance of Maine.
Central Maine Power customers are able to subscribe to local community solar projects with Syncarpha with no upfront cost. The company said the program saves customers 15% on electricity while supporting Maine’s renewable energy transition.
“This has been a great project for our team to be a part of and we have truly enjoyed our work in the City of Augusta,” said Michael Atkinson, director of development at Syncarpha Capital. “It is always a great feeling for us to see residents and the environment benefit from the transformation of unused space. We are fortunate to have partnered with Acadia Energy and are happy to be a part of helping Maine reach its clean energy goal of being 100% renewable and look forward to seeing more community solar throughout the state.”

National community solar efforts
Earlier this year, the National Community Solar Partnership, a Department of Energy (DOE) program, set an ambitious goal of enabling enough community solar projects to power the equivalent of 5 million households, and achieve $1 billion in combined energy bill savings. This goal aligns with the DOE’s greater target of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and places a focus on ensuring that American citizens can meaningfully access the benefits of the energy transition.
DOE reports that by year’s end 2020, about 3GW of community solar in the US was active, enough to power about 600,000 homes. The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. This target would entail a jump from 3GW installed capacity to 20GW by 2025.
The community solar market in the United States will add at least 7 GWdc in existing markets over the next five years, according to a recent report by Wood Mackenzie and the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).
“There continue to be significant tailwinds for the community solar industry as legislators in existing and new states look to community solar as a way to achieve energy policy goals,” said Jeff Cramer, CEO of CCSA. “The numbers released by Wood Mackenzie represent a conservative forecast of what’s in the pipeline for the next few years. We call on all federal and state policymakers to help remove the barriers and incentivize deployment of community solar to cut energy costs and give more people access to these programs.”
Report findings also highlighted that community solar-plus-storage can provide grid flexibility, but regulatory models do not currently recognize how these projects can manage load.
“As community solar becomes an increasing share of non-residential projects, developers are contending with high grid upgrade costs to manage this new load on the distribution end of the grid. Community solar-plus-storage could help manage this load and provide grid flexibility, but so far, its scope is limited to a few states, and current rules do not necessarily value storage for its grid resilience capabilities,” said Goldstein.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/07/50-states-of-solar-incentives-north-carolina/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH CAROLINA",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: North Carolina,"The pv magazine USA tour of solar incentives state by state now takes us to our fifth stop in the south Atlantic states: North Carolina.
North Carolina currently has nearly 8 GW of solar installed or enough to power nearly one million homes. Its ranking of fourth in the nation in terms of capacity deployment (according to the Solar Energy Industries Association—SEIA) is up from eighth in 2021. The state is currently getting more than 8% of its electricity needs from the sun.
One reason that the state has leapfrogged other states is due to its Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (REPS), established by Senate Bill 3 in August 2007, which required all investor-owned utilities in the state to supply 12.5% of 2020 retail electricity rates from eligible energy sources by 2021. Municipal utilities and electric cooperatives must meet a target of 10% renewables by 2018.
Other laws have also influenced the growth of solar in the state. For example, a 2017 law, HB589,  authorized solar leasing, which gave a much-needed boost to residential solar companies and offers consumers more options to control their energy use. This past summer the Supreme Court of North Carolina has issued an order affirming homeowners’ right to install rooftop solar, even if previously prohibited by a Homeowners association (HOA). The decision was based on North Carolina’s 2007 solar access law, which states that HOA’s cannot ban solar explicitly or effectively, and that it can only bar front-facing solar arrays if it explicitly lists them in its community rules.
North Carolina is also one of many states that offers net metering. HB 589 was signed into law in 2017 and requires, among other things, that each investor-owned  utility must file revised net meterting rathes with the North Carolina Utilities commission. The rates must be “nondiscriminatory and established only after an investigation of the costs and benefits of customer-sited generators.” The new rates also must ensure that net metering customers pay their full fixed cost of service, which may include fixed monthly energy and demand changes Customers who own their own systems and already on their utility’s net metering tariff may stay on that tariff program until 2027.
While North Carolina is only required to revisit the current net metering structure some time before 2027, the state’s current rebate program is set to expire this year, which has created an environment of urgency for clean-energy focused groups hoping to avoid the industry-harming effects that even a couple of weeks of incentive uncertainty can have on the residential solar market. Duke Energy and a collective of some of the largest rooftop solar installers in North Carolina came to terms on a modified version of Duke Energy’s Solar Choice Net Metering proposal, and it will now go before the North Carolina Utilities Commission for final approval. Once approved, the new net metering tariffs, known as the ‘Proposed Bridge Rate’ will go into effect for customers submitting applications through December 31, 2026, subject to annual capacity caps. Customers who choose to enter a residential solar installation into the Proposed Bridge Rate may do so for up to 15 years, subject to certain limitations. The settlement also includes a provision under which it can be discontinued if state regulators approve a package of incentives equivalent to at least 60 cents per watt. According to Duke, the Proposed Bridge Rate will allow the company more time to develop the incentive package.
Community solar
Community Solar in North Carolina is also governed by House Bill 589. The participating utilities must file a plan with the Commission to offer a community solar energy facility program for participation by its retail customers. Each community solar facility must have at least five subscribers and no single subscriber 40% interest. Duke Progress and Duke Energy must make this available on a first-come first-served basis until the total nameplate generation of its community solar facilities is at least 40 MW. In addition, community solar projects may have a nameplate capacity of up to 5 MW. Each subscription to the project shall be sized to represent at least 200 watts of the community solar facility’s generating capacity and to supply no more than 100% of the maximum annual peak demand of electricity of each subscriber at the subscriber’s premises.
Property tax abatement
In August 2008, North Carolina enacted legislation that exempts 80% of the appraised value of a solar installation from property tax. A memorandum sent to County Commissioners in February 2011 clarified that residential PV systems that are not used to generate income or in connection with a business may be entirely exempt from property taxes as non-business personal property.
Landmark solar installations
In January of this year Duke Energy announced two recently completed projects added just over 70 MW to the company’s ever-growing utility-scale project portfolio. The projects are the 50 MW Broad River Solar power plant and the 22.6 MW Speedway Solar power plant.
Construction of the Broad River project began last March, with Swinerton physically constructing the facility. Located on roughly 500 acres, the project is comprised of more than 170,000 solar panels and created more than 100 jobs during peak construction.
Construction on Speedway Solar also began in spring 2021, with efforts officially beginning in May. The project’s 185-acre site features 77,000 Jinko bifacial modules mounted on single-axis trackers. During peak construction, the project created roughly 70 jobs, and Duke awarded a $5,000 grant to the Cabarrus County Education Foundation to increase internet connectivity for students in Midland and Mt. Pleasant, N.C., much like the company did with the Broad River project.
Last time, the pv magazine tour of the 50 states of solar took us to Virginia, and next we will continue to travel through south Atlantic, stopping off in South Carolina.
