The projects are the Bear Creek solar project, a 50 MW installation being built in Richland County,west of Madison; the North Rock solar project, another 50 MW installation in Rock County near the Illinois border; and the Wood County solar project, an aptly-named 150 MW installation west of Green Bay.
The projects will require a peak construction labor force of almost 400 people, and Burns & McDonnell expressed a commitment to keeping jobs local. The company said it will subcontract portions of the civil construction and electrical installation to the local Wisconsin workforce.
Once completed, the projects will represent a greater than 50% increase in the state’s total installed solar capacity, which currently sits at 450 MW. A significant portion of the state’s upcoming solar capacity will be coming from Alliant, as state regulators recently approved the company’s proposal to construct 675 MW of solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/09/making-sense-of-the-trade-triple-threat-to-solar/,"GUEST POST,LEGAL,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021",Making sense of the trade triple-threat to solar,"The issue of trade and tariffs has likely been at the top of everyone’s mind over the last few weeks. We’ve seen two formal petitions filed to extend the Section 201 tariffs, detainment of modules by United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the filing of an Antidumping and Countervailing Duties (AD/CVD) circumvention case.
Whether you’re a local residential installer; a utility-scale developer; an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm; or you’re buying a solar module in the foreseeable future, all of these events will likely impact you directly or indirectly. It’s crucial to comprehend and track what’s going on.
It’s important to understand that although this article is providing a brief explanation of each major trade action, these are highly complex and technical matters that deserve consultation with professional counsel.
At the beginning of August, two manufacturers, Suniva and Auxin Solar, filed a petition asking the International Trade Commission (ITC) to investigate extending the Section 201 (s201) tariffs for another four years. Three days later a second petition was filed by Hanwha Q Cells, LG Electronics, and Mission Solar, which also included an ask that the Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) be increased to 5 GW (from the current 2.5 GW).
The s201 tariff is imposed on all solar modules imported into the U.S. that don’t meet exemption status as published in the Federal Register. The current s201 tariff is 18% and, if the tariff is not extended, would drop to 0% in February 2022.
As per trade law, if the ITC grants an extension of the s201 tariff it will last no longer than four years and cannot be extended again. The rate must also drop annually.
Timing: The ITC is currently collecting data to investigate the asks by the manufacturers, and a hearing will be held this fall with a report and recommendation delivered to the president by the ITC in December 2021. Results should be known in advance of the expiration of the first s201 tariff.

Key takeaway: Module prices will not go up as a result of the s201 tariffs being extended, as the tariff rates cannot increase from their current levels. However, they obviously won’t drop if the tariff is extended. Larger developers and EPCs that are forward-procuring modules can likely work with manufacturers to negotiate price adjustment clauses based on the outcome of the tariff. For residential and smaller buyers of modules, the suggestion would be to carry forward module pricing provided to you; if the tariff rate drops substantially or is not renewed then you can treat this new module price as upside.
At the end of June, CBP announced that imports containing silica from a Chinese company called Hoshine would be banned due to concerns of forced labor. By industry analyst estimates, Hoshine provides roughly 60% of the world’s metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) used in the solar industry. MG-Si is at the very top of the upstream solar sector, providing the feedstock material used in the polysilicon refining process.

Since the announcement, the industry has been feverishly working toward traceability and providing documentation and assurances that their supply chain is free of material from Hoshine. In August, reports started to circulate that CBP was detaining product that they suspected contained material from Hoshine and subject to the Withhold Release Order (WRO).
Next steps: According to trade experts, CBP enforcement of the WRO will evolve over time. So a module that was successfully imported yesterday might be stopped tomorrow. Although the quantity of modules detained seems to be relatively targeted in scope and scale at first, it has sent shock waves through the entire industry as buyers scramble to find replacement modules and as concerns grow about who might be next in an enforcement action.
It is also widely expected that this fall the Forced Labor Prevention Act will be signed into law. It  would effectively ban any import containing material from the Xinjiang (XUAR) region of western China. This would broaden the scope from Hoshine to several other MG-Si suppliers as well as polysilicon capacity that exists in the region.
Key Takeaway: The quarantining and detention of solar modules by CBP is having significant near-term implications throughout the industry. It’s important to continue to monitor the situation and work with vendors that have perceived lower risk of CBP action by reviewing Supplier Codes of Conduct, upstream supply chains through third-party traceability audits, and those without direct ties or facilities in the XUAR region.
In mid-August a group of companies under the banner of “American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention” filed three petitions asking the U.S. Department of Commerce to investigate whether imports from named companies exporting from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam are circumventing the established AD/CVD and whether AD/CVD rates should apply to imports from those companies and countries (which represent approximately 80% of imports into the U.S. from those countries). If you’ve been in the solar industry for a while, you’ll probably remember the AD/CVD cases originated in 2012. The rates are reviewed periodically and currently range from roughly 90% to almost 240%; they are significant.
Next steps: The market is digesting the implications and merits of this case. Commerce has 45 days to initiate an investigation based on the petitions and can issue a preliminary determination at that time, which may trigger the collection of AD/CVD tariffs. Final determinations can be expected next summer (300 days after filing). It’s important to pay close attention to the preliminary determinations, expected at the beginning of October.
Key Takeaway: While this filing was missed by many in the industry due to the noise related to the detainment of modules by customs, it is worth paying close attention to. Supply chains can and will be altered, but moving entire factories will take time, significant capital, and run the risk of further trade action.
For buyers of solar modules, the list of companies involved in the AD/CVD circumvention case are known and theoretically others aren’t involved.
Everyone has deep-seated and passionate views about these trade actions and cases on both sides. For nearly a decade the solar industry has dealt with tariffs and trade actions, and we’ll undoubtedly be dealing with them for the foreseeable future.
As an industry the best way to ensure a constant supply of high-quality, cost-efficient products is to invest in a domestic supply chain. In June, Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA) introduced the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act (SEMA), which would provide a tax credit for domestically produced solar products and encourages investment in full value-chain manufacturing.
This is legislation that every solar industry professional should get behind. Today, downstream jobs are at risk and at the mercy of a foreign supply chain.
Let’s invest in a domestic supply chain to protect every U.S. solar job and create hundreds of thousands more.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/09/making-the-right-buy-lcoe-of-monofacial-vs-bifacial-modules/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021",Making the right buy: LCOE of monofacial vs bifacial modules,"When do the benefits of bifacial modules outweigh the typical cost advantages of monofacial options?
In an attempt to answer this commonly asked question, Clean Energy Associates (CEA) released a case study that compares the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for bifacial and mono PERC modules and outlines scenarios where each makes the most sense.
The crux of the issue is that bifacial modules promise an energy yield 6% to 10% or greater higher than traditional mono PERC modules. But they come with a higher dollar-per-watt module cost, as well as increased expenses for balance of system (BOS) and installation.
Image: Silfab
The answer to which design to choose often depends on project location and size, as well as the other hardware being used, specifically trackers. Capturing bifacial’s value and its impact on a project’s bottom line over a 25 to 30-year life cycle begins with the basic LCOE formula, (life-cycle cost of the project divided by lifetime energy production) however a litany of factors can change the values in both cost and production.
To make a base evaluation, CEA, a PV and battery storage quality assurance, supply chain management, and engineering services firm, used PVsyst to model optimized layouts for the modules and locations being analyzed. After that they priced all equipment, labor, design and engineering, permitting, overhead and margin, and other costs–except the module.
The created formula also inputs the estimated annual kWh generated, the power purchase agreement (PPA) price, the investment tax credit, and operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. Variables in the equation include the longer life cycles of bifacials – 25 to 30 years – and their higher BOS and installation costs. For the sake of simplicity, degradation and O&M are set at about 0.5% per year.
Once the full gauntlet of factors are accounted for, a “hurdle price,” or price below which a bifacial panel will provide additional value based on the LCOE of a sample single-face system, can be established. The hurdle price is then used to back-calculate the price-per-watt module value for one or more bifacial panels.
CEA prepared a hypothetical comparison between monofacial Module A, and two bifacials, Module B and Module C, calculated for projects in Massachusetts and Mexico. For this hypothetical, the goal is to see if purchasing a large supply of one of the selected bifacial panels will make financial sense for the two locations.
Even with the large differences in production and base LCOE related to location, the option known as Bifacial Module C delivered higher and comparable module value.
CEA said that this model still has room for improvement. For example, it does not yet incorporate comparisons for the increasingly-popular large-format modules that have hit the market. Larger modules require wider row spacing, which in turn could mean longer wire lengths and a resulting voltage drop. An LCOE module comparison can reveal the positive or negative value of these tradeoffs.
Another point not addressed by this comparison is that as bifacial module prices continue to come down, the bifacial boost in production needed to offset higher upfront costs will also fall. While the increased production of bifacial panels is generally estimated at 6% to 10% per year, the team at CEA said that a much lower percentage could be needed to cover the upfront costs, though this figure will depend on a project’s location and other factors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/09/no-credit-solar-lease-improves-reach-to-underserved-communities/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,CONNECTICUT",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021",No-credit solar lease improves reach to underserved communities,"Low- and middle-income homeowners (LMI) in Connecticut have had the opportunity since 2015 to sign up for no-upfront-cost solar leases, with no credit requirement.
Now, the Department of Energy’s Berkeley Labs has completed a case study on the program’s effectiveness. It found an increased rate of payment delinquencies, but noted that repayment rates were reasonable, and that the program achieved success in reaching a wider LMI customer base than typical solar lease programs.
The program is backed by Connecticut Green Bank (CBG) and PosiGen, and provides homeowners with a 20-year term with no downpayment, and no price escalator. Single-family homeowners are provided with a first-year savings guarantee, in case the PV system does not deliver the anticipated level of production.
Additionally, home energy efficiency measures were offered at a flat rate of $10 per month, covering upgrades such as insulation, advanced air sealing, and duct sealing. This began as an opt-in service, but now is included in all CBG/PosiGen LMI leases.
The Berkeley Labs report found that a majority of participants (58%) lived in census tracts having a median income of less than 80% of the area median income. By contrast, around 9% of other conventional CBG lease and loan programs lived in similar census tracts. Furthermore, 56% of CBG/PosiGen customers were reported as having “non-prime” credit scores of less than 670, compared to 2% in other programs.
Overall, the study found that payment delinquency and annualized losses were higher in the PosiGen program than for other CBG programs. It said that credit score, not income, was the prime driver. All told, 2.3% of PosiGen participants were delinquent in payments, vs. 1.4% of conventional CBG lease and loan customers. Annualized losses for PosiGen amounted to 0.9%, vs. 0.1% for other programs.
The study found also that 44% of PosiGen participants would not qualify for standard loan or lease terms, a clear indicator of the program reaching a new pool for solar customers.
The report said that PosiGen’s program performed well when compared to benchmarks of other sub-prime loan providers. For example, the Kroll Auto Loan Index reported that customers with FICO scores below 640 have annualized gross loss rates of over 8%, and 30-day delinquencies of nearly 14%.
PosiGen is a private company that operates and manages solar leases. It serves as the managing member of a holding company (HoldCo) that owns the systems. Tax equity investors also own shares in the HoldCo in order to monetize the tax benefits.
CBG extends below-market-rate debt to PosiGen and pays production-based incentives (PBI) to the HoldCo. PBI is higher for LMI customers; it is paid $0.081 per kWh, according to the Berkeley Labs report.  
Private investors also extend debt to PosiGen and subordination of CBG’s debt attracts these investors.
HoldCo then pays back revenues to PosiGen and tax equity investors from customer lease payments and incentives. PosiGen is the primary risk-bearer in terms of customer non-payment. CBG is not affected unless PosiGen is unable to service the CBG debt.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/09/toshiba-claims-15-1-power-conversion-efficiency-for-perovskite-solar-module/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021",Toshiba claims 15.1% power conversion efficiency for perovskite solar module,"From pv magazine Global
Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba has announced a 15.1% power conversion efficiency for a 703cm2 polymer film-based perovskite solar module. The result is claimed by the company to be the highest efficiency yet reported for any large, polymer film-based perovskite photovoltaic module.
The device was fabricated through a one-step coating method that uses improved ink, film drying processes, and production equipment to form a uniform perovskite layer. The process is said to halve the steps for deposition of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer. The coating speed is said to reach six meters per minute on a 5×5 cm2 module, which the company defined as a rate that meets requirements for mass production.
Toshiba had previously developed a two-step coating process that first applied a layer of lead iodide (PbI2) ink to a substrate, followed by a layer of methyammonium iodide (MAI) which formed the MAPbI3 layer. “However, this multi-step approach had a low coating rate and often left unreacted sections in the perovskite layer,” it further explained. “The alternative is a one-step process that applies MAPbI3 ink directly.”
Toshiba’s printing technology for the production of film-based perovskite solar cell modules involves forming the substrate with a resin film, such as polyethylene terephthalate. It uses a planar inverted structure that can be produced at a temperature below 150 degrees Celsius for the cell structure.
The company managed to form a uniform thin layer of methylammonium lead iodide by utilizing a meniscus printing technology that it developed by conducting research on organic thin-film solar cells. It said that this improves the efficiency of panels by lowering the degree to which the cells vary from each other. 
The flexible and lightweight panel is indicated by Toshiba as suitable for locations where it is difficult to install conventional crystalline silicon modules, such as low-load-bearing roofs and office windows.
“Toshiba estimates that the new perovskite photovoltaic modules would generate power equivalent to two-thirds of the annual power consumption by homes in Tokyo if installed on a roof area of 164.9km2, roughly equal to the roof surface area of all buildings in Tokyo,” the manufacturer said.
Looking forward, the company said it wants to enlarge the module area to 900cm2 and to achieve efficiency close to 20%. It said that achieving these targets will cut the manufacturing cost of perovskite photovoltaic modules to around $0.14/W.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/09/california-looks-to-speed-up-energy-storage-deployment/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2021",California looks to speed up energy storage deployment,"The California Energy Commission (CEC) is looking to speed up the energy storage development process in order to meet aggressive installation requirements.
The CEC said that the state faces an energy supply shortfall of up to 3,500 MW in 2021 and up yo 5,000 MW for the summer of 2022. It blamed climate change for threatening the state’s energy supply and limiting the amount of energy that can be imported to meet daily demand.
And while the state has managed to reach around 2 GW/8 GWh of energy storage that is connected to the power grid over the past year, groups have voiced concerns over long wait times for projects in the development queue.
One state agency seems to be aware of these concerns, and is moving to correct the situation.
On September 8, the CEC began discussing improvements to the approval process. The proposed order would establish a process aimed at expediting licenses for battery storage systems of 20 MW or more and that the commission determines are capable of discharging for at least two hours. Systems would need to deliver net peak energy by Oct. 31, 2022. In exchange, license approval would be granted in less than 45 days from when an application is filed.
Evidence suggests that California, when pressed, will be able to install the much needed capacity on schedule.
After the Aliso Canyon methane methane gas leak in 2015, the state installed multiple lithium-ion battery energy storage facilities in just a few months after an emergency was declared.
Three battery manufacturers – AES, Tesla, and Greensmith – brought online 70 MW/280 MWh of power at multiple hour ratings each within six months.
The volume of energy storage being installed in 2015-2016 was massive. At the time, it was roughly equal to all of the lithium ion energy storage installed in the entire United States. As a result of the single procurement, the United States’ deployed battery capacity doubled in six months.
Again, in 2019, state utility regulators pushed to increase the amount of juice hitting the grid as expected electricity shortfalls brought renewed attention to the topic.
As a result of the projected shortfalls, the state implemented aggressive procurement requests requiring facilities to come online before Aug. 31, 2021. The procurement goals were met by facilities including one of the world’s largest lithium ion facilities – Vistra’s Moss Landing 400 MW/1,600 MWh – and LS Power’s 250 MW/1,000 MWh.
In early September, the first phase of the Moss Landing facility was forced offline when an unspecified number of batteries overheated. News reports said that first responders instead found battery racks that had been scorched and wires melted.
In a statement, Vistra said that the storage facility experienced “an overheating issue with a limited number of battery modules.” The incident affected the facility’s Phase I 300 MW /1200 MWh system.
The CAISO grid broke 1 GW of instantaneous output in July, and has recently peaked just shy of 1.5 GW of output. More than 3 GW is expected to come online before the end of 2021.
More broadly, the U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report said that 345 MW of new energy storage systems were brought online across the United States during the second quarter of 2021. That was an increase of 162% over the same quarter in 2020, making the quarter the second-largest on record by megawatts. The report said that market momentum continues to build, with an “unprecedented volume” of storage expected to come online in the second half of the year. Storage projects representing over $5 billion of investment are expected to come online this year.

Heathlands has a long-term power purchase agreement with an investment-grade offtaker. Terms were not disclosed.
The project is Greenbacker’s largest solar asset in Michigan and, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, would rank as the state’s third-largest solar facility.
The facility was designed to include an option to add co-located battery energy storage systems. Construction is expected to begin early next year, with commercial operations planned for fourth quarter 2022.
The project joins Prism’s 12 MW pre-operational solar plant that Greenbacker also bought earlier this year. The two also had a transaction for 19 MW Electric City project in 2019, also in Michigan.
As with the Electric City project, Greenbacker plans to plant pollinator-friendly vegetation below the panels, a practice that it said improves the site’s soil stability and reduces storm water runoff.

Chinese solar panel makers JinkoSolar, Longi and JA Solar have released a joint statement to announce they have reached a consensus on the standardization of PV modules produced with 182mm (M10) wafers.
The three manufacturers agreed that 54-cell panels will have to measure 1,722×1,134mm and have a mounting hole spacing of 1,400mm and that 72-cell products must have a size of 2,278×1,134mm and the same mounting hole spacing as 54-cell modules. Furthermore, they agreed that 78-cell panels will have to measure 2,465×1,134mm and have a mounting hole spacing ranging from 400mm to 1,500mm.
“Since the joint launch of the M10-type wafer standard by JA Solar, Jinko Solar and Longi Solar, in June 2020, the wafer size has been gaining widespread recognition and acceptance in the PV industry,” the statement read. “However, due to the differences in the technical roadmap, design concept and installation mode followed by different manufacturers, the standards of the same type of modules vary in their lengths, widths and mounting hole spacings despite being based on the same M10 wafer technology.”
The new parameters are aimed at standardizing component specifications to reduce manufacturing costs and simplify design and installation in the downstream business, the three companies stated. In mid-June, they jointly published a white paper intended to show what they believe are the advantages for developers of large scale PV projects of using photovoltaic modules manufactured with M10, 182mm wafers. In November 2020, the three manufacturers stated their combined production capacity of PV panels based on 182mm wafers would reach 54 GW in 2021.
The three manufacturers emphasized the increasing reliability risks associated with larger and more powerful products and reiterated the well-known saying “bigger is not always better,” heard in recent months from all those companies that decided not to bet on 210mm wafers and modules with a power output exceeding 600 W.

That was an increase of 162% over the same quarter in 2020, making the quarter the second-largest on record by megawatts. The report was released by the Energy Storage Association and Wood Mackenzie. It said that market momentum continues to build, with an “unprecedented volume” of storage expected to come online in the second half of the year. Wood Mackenzie said that storage projects representing over $5 billion of investment are expected to come online this year.
The pace of energy storage deployment had slowed in the first quarter as 910 MWh was brought online, following a blistering final quarter of 2020 when around 2,000 MWh was deployed. Even so, the first quarter 2021 performance was an increase of more than 250% over the same quarter a year ago.

During the second quarter, the residential battery storage market slipped in the second quarter, its first decline in nine quarters reaching back to the fourth quarter of 2018. The report said that equipment constraints, including an ongoing Tesla Powerwall shortage, is hampering the segment’s growth despite a “proliferation” of new residential storage players.
The non-residential segment, made up of onsite storage and community-scale storage, reported a 31% quarter-on-quarter growth in deployments, driven in particular by the growth of the community storage market in Massachusetts.
The report said that the front-of-the-meter (FTM) market deployed 218 MW/729 MWh in the second quarter. California, Texas, and Arizona led the segment. The report said that Arevon/Capital Dynamics’s 100MW/400MWh Saticoy Energy Storage peaker plant replacement in Ventura County, California, contributed most of the megawatts for the quarter. Solar-plus-storage projects in Texas and Arizona also lifted the quarter’s FTM capacity.
The report said that policy support continued to build in the second quarter, with several new state incentives introduced for residential and non-residential storage.

The Toronto-based company previously planned three North American spoke facilities; its Kingston, Ontario and Rochester, New York locations are operating; and a Gilbert, Arizona, facility is being built.
The company said the southeastern U.S. is emerging as a critical region for the lithium-ion battery supply chain, as battery manufacturers and automakers set up operations in the region.
Univar Solutions Inc. will be an anchor battery feed supply customer for the Alabama facility, following on Li-Cycle’s previously announced on-site partnership with the company to provide waste management for electric vehicle and lithium-ion battery manufacturing.
The facility will be able to process entire vehicle battery packs, without dismantling.

The Tuscaloosa site is also being developed to accommodate a future, second 5,000 ton processing line, which would increase capacity at the Tuscaloosa site to 10,000 tons per year. The Alabama plant is projected to enter service by mid-2022 and is expected to create an initial 30 jobs.

The company also reported that its revenues grew to around $3.0 million for the first nine months of 2021. That compared to roughly $0.3 million in the prior-year period. It said the increase was due to increases in recycling services and product sales as processing at its Kingston and Rochester facilities grew and as new battery supply customers were acquired. It said nine-month revenues from product sales were $2.7 million, while revenues from recycling services were $0.3 million.
The company’s nine-month net loss widened to $21.6 million, up from a loss of $4.8 million in the prior-year period.
The company’s Arizona facility will have two processing lines and a total recycling capacity of 10,000 tons of lithium-ion batteries per year. Li-Cycle said it expects the first processing line there to enter service in early 2022, with a second processing line to commence operations during 2023.
