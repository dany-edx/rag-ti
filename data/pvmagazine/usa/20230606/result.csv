The Milken Institute and the Motsepe Foundation announced 20 teams would receive semifinalist prizes for the Milken-Motsepe Prize in Green Energy, with $20,000 in initial awards and the potential for five teams to compete for a $1 million grand prize.
Selected teams will now have four months to create a demonstration project to show the effectiveness of their proof of concept.
Since launching in November 2022, more than 3,800 candidates from over 120 countries have registered in the competition. Over 160 of the registrants representing 36 countries submitted technical design and business model proposals. From the proposals, judges from the California-based Milken Institute and Johannesburg-based Motsepe Foundation selected the 20 most transformative concepts.
Clean energy projects are being evaluated by three main criteria based on their ability to generate off-grid electricity using green energy sources; provide affordable and reliable electricity to energy-poor communities, including in rural areas; and develop a technological and business approach that is scalable across Africa.
Among top five semi-finalists from North America and Europe include:
“Access to electricity is vital to transforming societies—from health care to education to economic growth,” said Dr. Precious Moloi-Motsepe, co-founder and chief executive officer of the Motsepe Foundation. “As recently proven by the winners of the Milken–Motsepe Prize in AgriTech, innovators have the power to create transformative solutions to challenges once thought to be impossible.”
In May 2024, the judges will award a grand prize to the leading technology provider, with a $250,000 runner-up prize awarded.
“The innovation competition encourages entrepreneurs to be creative and expansive,” said Dr. Emily Musil Church, senior director at the Milken Institute’s Center for Strategic Philanthropy. “By allowing field tests anywhere in the world in the first round, the competition allows flexibility for teams to take strategic risks. This is the heart of the innovation competition model: to reward innovators who take bold action.”
The Milken Institute is a California nonprofit think tank focused on accelerating measurable progress on financial, physical, mental, and environmental health gains.
The Motsepe Foundation was founded in 1999 by Dr. Patrice Motsepe and wife, Dr. Precious Moloi-Motsepe, to contribute towards eradicating poverty and sustainably improve living conditions and standards of life of poor, unemployed and marginalized communities across Africa and other parts of the world.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/06/shoals-files-patent-complaint-for-solar-connectors-and-wire-harnesses/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,LEGAL,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,NORTH CAROLINA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 6, 2023",Shoals files patent complaint for solar connectors and wire harnesses,"Shoals Technologies Group, a leading provider of electrical balance of system components for solar, storage, and electric vehicle charging equipment, filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for alleged patent infringements. The complaint is filed against Hikam America, Inc., based in Chula Vista, California, and Voltage, LLC, based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The complaint also applies to the mentioned companies’ foreign business counterparts. 
Shoals components are invented and manufactured in the U.S. under the “Big Lead Assembly” brand. Its push connectors and wire harnesses are installed above-ground, preventing the need for extensive and expensive wire trenching.  
The company claims a 43% lower installation cost and 20% less materials requirement when compared to conventional designs that rely on combiner boxes, and 83% fewer connections to inspect and maintain. BLA won the pv magazine award in 2019 for Balance of System components. 
Shoals has requested that the ITC investigate infringements under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to bar the importation to the U.S. of the alleged infringing components. The company also filed complaints against the Hikam defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, and against the Voltage defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina for the same alleged infringements. 
The complaint relates to potential unlawful imports of PV connectors and other components on patents owned by Shoals. The company requested that the ITC issue a limited exclusion order and a cease-and-desist order against Hikam, Voltage and related entities to bar imports to the U.S. 
Jeff Tolnar, interim chief executive officer and president of Shoals released a statement: 
“Shoals has invested millions of dollars over our 27-year history to develop innovative products and technologies to reduce installation costs and improve reliability and safety for the utility scale solar, storage and EV charging markets. While we welcome healthy competition – especially that which betters the industry – we take our patents very seriously and will defend them vigorously to protect our intellectual property. As a U.S.-based company with design and manufacturing in Tennessee, Alabama, and California, we hope the ITC will protect our IP and support domestic manufacturing and job creation by banning the import of what we believe are infringing products from entering the U.S. market.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/06/solar-hydrogen-racing-yacht-to-circumnavigate-the-globe/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 6, 2023",Solar-hydrogen racing yacht to circumnavigate the globe,"The yachting community is soon to see a new entrant that will change the way boats are propelled across the water. OceansLab, a cleantech accelerator, is developing a racing boat powered by solar and hydrogen.
The racing yacht will be skippered by Phil Sharp, inventor of the boat’s on-board hydrogen power module and a specialist in recyclable composites. Sharp has stated a mission to race around the globe non-stop in the world’s first hydrogen electric yacht, potentially adding to more than his previous 25 podium visits in Transatlantic and coastal races.
OceansLab announced it has found a supplier in Maxeon Solar Technologies to provide its solar cells to cover the surface of the yacht. Maxeon’s SunPower brand interdigitated back contact (IBC) cells, sporting a 24.8% efficiency, will cover 16 square meters of boat surface, adding on-site power generation to the boat.
The panels will provide an output of more than 3.6 kW, about half the size of a typical rooftop residential solar array, charging on-board batteries. A total of 1,000 Maxeon IBC cells will be installed and encapsulated in a protective film to ensure resistance to saltwater and impacts.
“We are pleased to be involved in such an ambitious project. Sailing the oceans requires an unprecedented level of performance and durability, making our unique solar cell technology the sole and best choice for OceansLab,” said Bill Mulligan, chief executive officer, Maxeon. “The boat features the same high efficiency, high-reliability cells as those found in our record efficiency solar panels powering homes, businesses and utility-scale power plants on land, worldwide – a true testament to our innovation as a global solar leader.”
A 15 kW Genevos marine hydrogen fuel cell will propel the boat, and the fuel cell company will develop the power management strategy and integration of the system in-line with marine safety standards. Oceanvolt, a Finnish electric boat motor manufacturer, will provide the boat’s 48 V electric propulsion system.
“This collaboration will provide valuable insight and data that will assist in the further development of OceanVolt’s unique electric propulsion systems compatibility with hydrogen fuel cell technology. The ultimate goal is to bring increasingly sustainable and reliable solutions to the market specifically designed for racing purposes,” said Tommi Lassila, chief exeuctive officer, Oceanvolt.
The boat is slated to participate in several international races, emitting nothing but water as a by-product along the way. The race boat will compete in the IMOCA Globe Series races. Key events include Transatlantic races, the Transat Jacques Vabre, the Route du Rhum, and around-the-world races the Vendée Globe, and The Ocean Race.
“The OceansLab programme allows us to showcase the performance and durability of this technology in the toughest environment on earth. With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change targets for shipping emissions required to be reduced to zero by 2050, and the requirement for most vessels built from 2030 to be zero emissions, this campaign will be an important demonstration of how we can meet this target,” said Sharp.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/06/u-s-clean-hydrogen-roadmap-released/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 6, 2023",U.S. clean hydrogen roadmap released,"The Biden-Harris Administration released the U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap, a framework for accelerating the production, processing, delivery, storage, and use of clean hydrogen.
Produced with net-zero carbon emissions, clean hydrogen will be key in the emerging clean energy economy and will help toward achieving the President’s goal of a 100% clean electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
“Accelerating the deployment of hydrogen is key to achieving President Biden’s vision for an affordable, secure clean energy future,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “That’s why DOE worked alongside our federal partners to develop the U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap that will lay the foundation for a strong and productive partnership between the public and private sectors and will guide government and industry to realize the full potential of this incredibly versatile energy resource.”
Solar and hydrogen
Electrolysis, the process that creates hydrogen fuel, requires large amounts of electricity. The electricity demand presents a great fit for coupling solar energy and hydrogen production.
Clean hydrogen has many uses and can play a vital role in reducing emissions from some of the most energy-intensive sectors of our economy, including industrial and chemical processes and heavy-duty transportation. Hydrogen produced with carbon-free electricity can also support the expansion of variable forms of renewable power by providing a means for long-duration energy storage and offers flexibility and multiple revenue streams for all types of clean power generation including renewables.
Clean hydrogen can help reduce harmful air pollution and decarbonize industrial, chemical and other polluting sectors, which will benefit disadvantaged communities, because they are often in the most industrialized areas and have suffered disproportionately from local air pollution. The DOE’s National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap and President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative serve as pillars driving the energy justice efforts by Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office (HFTO) and the Hydrogen Program.
In addition to releasing the roadmap, the Biden Administration has earmarked billions of dollars of funding for investing in the advancement of clean hydrogen. In 2021, Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This legislation authorizes and appropriates $9.5 billion for clean hydrogen. Furthermore, in August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law, which provides additional policies and incentives for hydrogen including a production tax credit that has further boosted a U.S. market for clean hydrogen.
Clean hydrogen offers substantial economic benefits and will help create tens of thousands of new, good-paying jobs across the country, particularly in underserved communities. By enabling the development of diverse, domestic clean energy pathways across multiple sectors of the economy, clean hydrogen will strengthen energy independence and accelerate the manufacturing boom in the U.S.
“President Biden understands that growing America’s clean hydrogen capability can spur good-paying union jobs, support local economic development, and help decarbonize industries long seen as ‘hard to decarbonize,” said Ali Zaidi, assistant to the President and national climate advisor. “This roadmap will align the private and public sectors on a shared path to drive faster toward a cleaner, more secure energy future.”
The Strategy and Roadmap provides a snapshot of hydrogen production, transport, storage, and use in the United States today and a vision for how clean hydrogen will contribute to national decarbonization goals across multiple sectors in the future. It examines future demand scenarios—with strategic opportunities for the domestic production of 10 million metric tonnes (MMT) of clean hydrogen annually by 2030, 20 MMT annually by 2040, and 50 MMT annually by 2050.
The Strategy and Roadmap identifies three key strategies to ensure that clean hydrogen is developed and adopted as an effective decarbonization tool, including:
The U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap was released in draft form for public comment in September 2022. The final version released reflects feedback from stakeholders in industry, academia, and the non-profit sector, as well as state, local, and Tribal governments. It also incorporates findings from DOE’s March 2023 report, Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Clean Hydrogen. The plan is for the Strategy and Roadmap to be updated every three years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/06/hydrogen-power-collaborator-not-competitor/,"GUEST POST,HYDROGEN,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 6, 2023","Hydrogen Power: Collaborator, not competitor","Hydrogen power comes with quite a resume. The International Energy Agency (IEA) called hydrogen one of the “biggest innovation opportunities” for driving carbon dioxide emission reductions by 2050. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 made significant investments in clean energy including $369 billion investment in climate and energy policies. Many specifically for hydrogen production and use. Goldman Sachs named hydrogen as “the ultimate decarbonization tool.”  By 2030, the hydrogen industry could account for $140 billion in revenue and 70,000 jobs. By 2050, it is expected that hydrogen could generate $750 billion in revenue and 3.4 million jobs.
But that does not mean hydrogen is poised to knock off—or even compete with—solar and wind. Instead, if done correctly, hydrogen might help drive further adoption of wind and solar.
Without diving too deep into the science behind hydrogen production, understand that it takes energy to produce hydrogen, with one of the most popular methods using water and electricity. When the electricity comes from a renewable source like wind, solar, hydroelectric or geothermal, green hydrogen is produced—with virtually all facets carbon free.
It’s only natural, then, to understand that as hydrogen grows in use, solar and wind energy can benefit as well. That’s why we believe we are better as collaborators—not competitors. But, to be true allies, everyone must play their part in promoting safe hydrogen production, distribution, transportation and storage.
Growing together
A hydrogen-based economy can fuel power generation, air transport, shipping, mobility and infrastructure. Already hydrogen fuel cells are becoming more accepted in vehicles, with more than 7,500 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles currently on the road. More than 25,000 hydrogen fuel cell material handling units—like forklifts and buses—are in use. While currently more expensive than gasoline, hydrogen is expected to reach parity with gasoline prices by 2025.
There are other uses as well. Earlier this year, a drone manufacturer introduced a hydrogen-powered drone for commercial and defense use, including emergency response, last-mile delivering and long-range intelligence gathering missions. Industrial applications include food production, aerospace, laboratories, and chemical production.
Still, typical hydrogen production relies on fossil fuels—negating any potential climate benefits as an alternative fuel. According to U.S. Department of Energy data from 2020, 99% of hydrogen production in the U.S. uses fossil fuels. Globally, about 76% of hydrogen uses fossil fuels in its production.
While there are huge possibilities, hurdles remain. Currently, hydrogen production using solar and wind is among the most costly production methods. The U.S. Department of Energy put the cost of wind electrolysis at $5.96 per kilogram of production. Solar electrolysis tops $8.00/kg.
Seeing the potential in Clean H2, the Department of Energy announced in late 2022 that it would issue $750 million in funding to accelerate the development of clean H2, producing hydrogen with net-zero carbon emissions. Renewables, nuclear energy and natural gas with carbon sequestration are all up for funding.
Safety: Mutual self interest
Bought into the idea of the potential but concerned about safety? That’s a valid issue—and one that the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) shares. As more and more newcomers see the potential in hydrogen and enter the market, we’re concerned that shortcuts might be taken.
We believe in treating hydrogen—and any other industrial gas—with respect. That means setting standards and following protocols, something CGA has been doing for more than 110 years.
We’ve recently launched the Safe Hydrogen Project to drive development of this game-changing energy source—while protecting those who are involved in its production, distribution and use. CGA also launched a CGA Hydrogen Membership, ensuring that perspectives from all segments of the hydrogen economy are represented as we continue to publish safety standards for this rapidly expanding industry.
Solar plants or wind facilities that supply a hydrogen facility can work with CGA to ensure that hydrogen producers do so in a safe manner by following CGA standards. CGA currently has standards that apply to the production, transportation, storage and use.
We welcome the interest of many newcomers to the market, but we want all of us to be safe. Any hydrogen incident has the potential to set the industry back decades—and potentially slow adoption of this critical technology.
That is our ultimate goal: to drive development of this new fuel while ensuring that everyone does so safely—and we need the wind and solar industries to be our partners. CGA itself is made up of many companies devoted to one common purpose: safety. We invite the solar and wind industries to see the opportunities in hydrogen—and to join us in ensuring that we can realize its potential without harming the environment or its users.

Paul Pflieger is director of marketing and communications for the Compressed Gas Association. Founded in 1913, the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) is dedicated to the development and promotion of safety standards and safe practices in the industrial, medical, and food gases industry.
