The grant funds a 1.75 MW solar array at the university, which will serve a case study site for students learning about how various horticultural and agricultural practices can mutually pair with solar.
DOE’s funding comes via a program called Foundational Agrivoltaic Research for Megawatt Scale (FARMS). The $8 million program issued six different research grant awards.
Iowa State University’s research team is led by Ajay Nair, associate professor of horticulture, Matt O’Neal, professor in plant pathology, entomology and microbiology, and Anne Kimber, director of the electric power research center.
The project is a result of a partnership between the university and Alliant Energy, the utility that owns and operates the array that sits on land leased from the university. Waldinger Corporation served as general contractor for the project, which held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on October 19. Ideal Energy was subcontracted for design of the array, which was designed with input from Iowa State researchers. Shive-Hattery, Inc. Provided civil and electrical engineering services for the project.
“As renewable energy grows, it’s important to find opportunities for these projects to benefit people, beyond just providing renewable electricity. There’s good work to be done on this front, and we hope this research and demonstration will help identify the potential for communities to benefit from agrivoltaics,” said Anne Kimber, co-principal investigator.
The solar array was built in two parts. One part is an 811 kW fixed-tilt array facing south. Six fixed-tilt rows have a standard leading edge of two feet off the ground in front and three rows have a leading edge height of five feet to test to see if higher solar arrays create better growing conditions.
The second array is a 946 kW single-axis active tracker array, which is the most common configuration for utility-scale solar projects being built today. Eighteen of the active-tracker rows are a standard five to six feet above the ground while five rows are eight to nine feet above the ground. All solar panels on the site are bifacial, meaning they generate power from both sides.
The research team plans to explore which crops thrive under a solar microclimate. The team will plant vegetables, fruits, and pollinator habitats. The project will also study how solar array maintenance effects cultivation.
“Growing these types of crops under and around a solar farm on a scalable basis is different than just growing them. We want to demonstrate that’s possible,” said Ajay Nair, lead principal investigator.
Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.
The paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland. At a global scale, it is estimated that 1% of all farmland could produce the world’s energy needs if converted to solar PV.
Agrivoltaics can represent a win-win for farmers and solar developers. Research firm Allied Analytics suggests that the agrivoltaic market can reach $9.3 billion by 2031, growing at an annual rate of over 10%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/20/residential-solar-is-getting-crushed-by-high-interest-rates-and-regulatory-changes/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 20, 2023",Residential solar is getting crushed by high interest rates and regulatory changes,"People working in residential solar are familiar with the “solar coaster;” an experience of boom and bust the industry has experienced as market and regulatory changes cause wild oscillations in business results. The residential solar sector is currently suffering a deep drop on the “solar coaster.”
A few macro forces are crushing the sector today. High interest rates have worsened the attractive loan packages made available to homeowners, and loan dealer fees have skyrocketed. Utility electricity prices have stabilized and even lowered from last year, making the prospective savings for a rooftop solar customer murkier.
Major residential solar stocks have shed 30% or more of their value in a single day following a foreboding Tesla earnings call, and reports of bankruptcy filings have surfaced.
Most installers are increasingly moving towards a third party-owned lease or power purchase agreement model as loan terms have become increasingly unattractive to customers.
What’s more, California, which represents about half of the United States’ residential solar market, essentially set its residential solar market on fire with its new net metering rules. As the backlog of customers who rushed in to secure legacy Net Energy Metering (NEM) 2.0 rates dries up, the devastation of NEM 3.0 has begun to reveal itself.
NEM 3.0 slashed compensation for delivering local, clean electricity generated by a rooftop solar array to your neighbors. Rates paid by the utility for exporting solar were cut by about 80%. Installations have pulled back by 40% to 80% in California following the decision.
The onslaught may continue for California, as its commission mulls enabling investor-owned utilities to assign income-based fixed charges to its customers. It is also weighing a decision to limit the value of multi-family rooftop solar installations, despite spending the past two years justifying NEM changes based on a desire to make solar more accessible to renters and low-income customers.
Bernadette del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) said that the state’s utility commission has taken the approach of “the beatings will continue until morale improves” for residential solar.
Dan Javan, chief executive officer of installer Suntuity appeared on a Roth Capital Partners webinar, revealing that over 100 residential installers filed for bankruptcy over the past few months. This is six times the amount of bankruptcies filed by installers in the last few years.
Javan warned that the regulatory changes like the ones seen in California may just be the beginning of an assault on residential solar-supportive policies nationwide. Major markets like North Carolina, Arizona, and many others are already moving anti-rooftop solar policies through their regulatory commissions.
The “solar coaster” of residential solar is showing its downside under the unfriendly rate and regulatory environment. Ohm Analytics expects a 10% downturn in residential solar in 2024. For an industry that is buoyed by high valuations based on massive growth projections, a reversal of growth can spell doom for investors.
Following the Tesla earnings call, Tesla stock is down over 15%, major microinverter provider Enphase is down 25%, and SolarEdge fell over 30% in a single day. The two major inverter providers have fallen over 70% from their peaks last winter.
While the residential solar sector has survived the highs and lows of the “solar coaster” in the past, the hundreds of bankruptcies an unfortunate casualty of state commission boards like the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)  
During last week’s pv magazine Roundtables US 2023, Del Chiaro issued a warning to other states to not follow California’s leadership in the instance of rooftop solar regulation as the fallout from an aggressive and anti-consumer NEM 3.0 policy begins to reveal itself.

Alexis Issaharoff, the chief renewable energy officer for Jubaili Bros, said that the sustainable solar house is designed to teach children and adults about sustainability and renewable energy.
Issaharoff, a renewable energy expert with more than 16 years of executive experience and a board member of sustainability and environmental foundations, also contributes to the United Nations magazine “UN Today.”
He developed the project to educate children and adults about renewable energy, sustainability, regenerative agriculture, and water conservation through the construction of a LEGO kit.
“How could we get parents and kids to learn about something that would benefit them both? By playing together,” he told pv magazine.
After 11 months of work, Issaharoff brought the Sustainable Solar House to life with 4,100 virtual pieces. He entirely developed the project with LEGO Ideas software.

The house is designed to be self-sufficient, producing its own food, water, and energy, making it a ‘Net Zero Plus’ House that generates more energy than it consumes. It achieves this through a rooftop solar array featuring bifacial modules with a tracking system and integrated solar modules on the house’s facade (BIPV).

The house incorporates a solar cooker, a rooftop solar thermal system to supply hot water, and micro wind turbines. It uses a heat pump for air conditioning.

The house features a battery system, and its exterior and street lighting operate on solar power. It includes rainwater collection, wastewater recycling, a biodigester, and a recycling center.


The roof demonstrates the cooling mechanisms of the house through its use of solar modules (heat absorption), gardens and farming (heat absorption and utilization), and white paint (heat reflection, reducing heat absorption by the house).

The project also includes an organic solar tree, a solar delivery drone, and a solar robot, all integrated into the design.

The absence of a car in the house is due to the expectation that cars will become self-driven in the next decade. They will be readily available 24/7 on the road, as depicted by the red car in the image. There is also a dedicated lane for self-driven electric school buses and cars equipped with wireless electric chargers on the side. To accommodate alternative transportation, there is also a designated lane for bikes, electric bikes, and electric scooters.
The project has undergone actual wind environment studies by environmental design and engineering firm Neapoli.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were also used to analyze indoor and outdoor conditions in the LEGO house, optimizing ventilation and natural cooling for the summer season.

If ‘The Sustainable Solar House’ receives 10,000 votes, LEGO will evaluate the possibility of producing it as a real kit. There are more 100 days remaining for voting.

Ecoflow has launched a “retrofit” residential battery solution that it claims can be easily integrated with existing rooftop PV arrays.
“Unlike conventional DC-coupled or AC-coupled battery systems, PowerOcean DC Fit uses EcoFlow’s PV-coupling technology to directly connect with existing home solar energy systems on the PV side – meaning users don’t need to install additional storage inverters,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The battery uses lithium iron phosphate (LiFePo4) as the cathode material and is based on a self-adaptive algorithm that the manufacturer said makes the system compatible with most of the existing solar single-phase and three-phase inverters that are already in use in existing PV installations.
“Using EcoFlow’s unique PV-coupling technology, the PowerOcean DC Fit connects its batteries directly with solar panels. Users can leave the AC wiring as it is and don’t have to apply for an on-grid permit,” the company stated.
The storage system measures 680 mm x 183 mm x 479 mm and weighs 59.2 kg. It has a capacity of 5 kWh and is expandable to 15 kWh. It also features an output voltage range of 150-800 V and a maximum output current of 20 A.
The new product is IP65-rated and reportedly has a lifecycle of more than 6,000 cycles.
“Each battery pack is connected parallelly and equipped with the EcoFlow BMS (Battery Management System) to prevent one battery’s issues from affecting other packs,” the manufacturer said, noting that the new product comes with a 15-year warranty.

Granholm announced $3.46 billion to fund 58 projects across 44 states to strengthen electric grid resilience and reliability across America.
As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, these projects will leverage more than $8 billion in federal and private investments. The funding is managed by the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program, and is intended to prepare the grid for extreme weather as well as to ensure delivery of affordable, clean electricity to all communities across the nation.
All of the projects support the Justice40 initiative, which has a goal of delivering 40% of overall benefits of federal climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other investments to marginalized, disadvantaged communities that are overburdened by pollution. The funding will help bring more than 35 GW of new renewable energy online, invest in 400 microgrids, and maintain and create good paying union jobs. Most of the projects (86%) contain either labor union partnerships or will involve collective bargaining agreements.
“Extreme weather events fueled by climate change will continue to strain the nation’s aging transmission systems, but President Biden’s Investing in America agenda will ensure America’s power grid can provide reliable, affordable power,” said U.S Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Today’s announcement represents the largest-ever direct investment in critical grid infrastructure, supporting projects that will harden systems, improve energy reliability and affordability—all while generating union jobs for highly skilled workers.”
The announcement of up to $3.46 billion in funding represents a first round of selections under the broader $10.5 billion GRIP Program, also part of the Investing in America agenda.
Spencer Pederson, senior vice president, Public Affairs National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) sees these awards as a major step in grid modernization and resilience:
This funding targets transmission grid expansion, enabling integration of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar, hardens the grid to make it more resilient against extreme weather, and will help build microgrids to serve critical facilities like hospitals and emergency facilities. All of these elements have a place in NEMA’s vision for a more electrified and connected economy and actions like these from DOE move us closer to realizing this ambition that benefits us all.
The selections announced today for award negotiations under the GRIP Program include projects in the following states:
The funding will also support several projects anchored by inter-regional collaboration that will expand transmission across multiple states. Examples include:
Earlier this year, DOE announced $95 million in federal funds from the program to strengthen the grids in Hawaii so that they can better withstand severe weather-related events.
The Grid Deployment Office will hold an informational webinar on October 24 at 2:30 p.m. ET. Registration is required, register here.
Selection for award negotiations is not a commitment by DOE to issue an award or provide funding. Before funding is issued, DOE and the applicants will undergo a negotiation process, and DOE may cancel negotiations and rescind the selection for any reason during that time.
