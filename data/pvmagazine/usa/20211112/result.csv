The company will become a subsidiary of CES, assuming leadership of CES’s renewables division.
Soligent distributes a variety of models of solar panels, inverters, energy storage solutions, racking, charge controllers, and monitoring equipment. It carries products from SolarEdge, Enphase, Canadian Solar, Trina, Hanwha and more across the U.S.
The transaction follows CES’s acquisition of Segen, a wholesale distributor of residential and commercial rooftop PV systems with operations in the UK, Germany, and South Africa.
CES and Soligent said their combined strengths will further support the companies’ 50% growth rates.
High growth rates for solar distribution may continue, as the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) targets moving solar from 3% of all generation today to over 40% by 2035. DOE said this level of deployment would entail a three-to-four times increase in current deployment rates.
Such investment in solar may lead to as many as 500,000 to 1,500,000 solar industry workers by 2035, said DOE, effectively multiplying the current workforce of 231,000. Notably, the industry peaked employment levels in 2016 at 260,000, but increases in workforce productivity and the COVID-19 pandemic have slowed jobs numbers in recent years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/12/reuse-or-replace-iea-pvps-analysis-considers-all-options-for-underperfoming-pv-modules/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",Reuse or replace? IEA PVPS analysis considers all options for underperfoming PV modules,"Repairing and reusing a solar module that is not complying with its expected lifetime provides for more environmental benefits than replacing the underperforming unit with a new and more performant PV module. The reuse option, however, still has several challenges to overcome in terms of economic viability, with only a limited number of positive business cases being available under current market conditions. It may become competitive in the future, however, if PV panels achieve higher efficiencies and costs are further reduced.
These are the main conclusions of the report, “Preliminary Environmental and Financial Viability Analysis of Circular Economy Scenarios for Satisfying PV System Service Lifetime,” published by the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power System Programme (IEA-PVPS).
In the paper, the agency’s experts said the main goal of their efforts was to understand to which extent a circular economy approach could be applied to the PV industry. Their analysis was conducted through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and assuming a solar panel has a 30-year lifetime. “The functional unit metric is therefore defined as the total lifecycle environmental impact of the PV system divided by the total amount of electricity produced by the system over 30 years,” they explained. “The lower the metric value is, the more favourable it is for the environment.”
The researchers initially quantified the environmental impact of recycling, repair, and reuse of PV systems under different scenarios and found that the frequent replacement of panels with newer and more performant panels increases the environmental impact. The higher efficiencies provided by the new products do not offset the environmental footprint of additional panel production, they added. “Moreover, our sensitivity assessment shows that, even if maintaining the 30-year service life requires junction box repair and/or transporting the panel for long distances, keeping panels in use is the more environmentally favorable solution,” they emphasized. “In other words, it is better for the environment to keep a panel in use for 30 years instead of replacing it with new, more efficient panels.”
In the second part of the study, the IEA-PVPS group focused on the financial viability of the lifetime of prematurely decommissioned solar panels from a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) perspective and, for rooftop PV, it ascertained that satisfying the 30–year service lifetime of PV panels may be financially competitive with replacing the modules under certain conditions. “This is the case for relatively young panels (up to around 10 years old) with few or no defects,” it explained. “Although we do not account for testing and recertification costs, these costs could be a determining factor for the success of the reuse business case.”
As for utility-scale solar, the repairing or reusing options were not found to be financially viable due to surface–area restrictions, lower remaining power density, and the limited remaining lifetimes of prematurely decommissioned panels. “In addition, our analysis of PV as a utility-scale investment — using net present value as the key performance indicator — suggests that new panels are more attractive than prematurely decommissioned panels in this context as well, without and especially with surface-area limits.”
The experts cautioned that their analysis was limited to polycrystalline panels and that the reusing option should be further assessed under different geographical locations and solar irradiation conditions. “The financial viability of the reuse business case is influenced by additional country- and case-specific parameters, such as the grid tariffs that drive revenue and can fluctuate substantially,” they concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/12/yotta-energy-pushes-the-smart-grid-closer-to-rooftop-solar-panels/,"OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",Yotta Energy pushes the smart grid closer to rooftop solar panels,"Yotta Energy raised $13 million from a group of investors to further develop its rooftop energy storage solution. This is at least its second cash raise, as Yotta gotta lotta money in August of 2019 as well. The company noted a 12-contract deal signed with EcoBuild of Louisiana, which started with an 87 kW solar+Yotta project.
Yotta Energy has evolved from offering only a battery on the roof to partnering with a microinverter manufacturer. It also offers a solution which comes with their own wireless gateway including battery management software.
Its refined offering distributes the smart grid one degree further.
Long ago, the first grid-edge intelligence was found in the charge controllers combined with offgrid inverters. We then saw those smarts arise in inverters installed in high solar density Hawaii, which no longer allows solar power to be exported to the grid from a residential location. Of course, batteries can now provide any service that the grid needs.
Yotta Energy’s lithium-iron-phosphate battery is a 1 kWh unit that accepts up to four solar panels. The company says the system can scale to 1 MWh of battery, meaning 1,000 units.
Each battery can be wired with up to four solar panels, although two panels are considered optimal. The 1.2 kW microinverter can handle up to four 440W+ solar panels, with one battery per panel. The unit has a 10-year warranty by default, and there is a 15-year extension available.
The energy storage solution is designed to be installed on flat roofs. On its website, Yotta states that its product integrates into Panel Claw’s clawFR. The company’s software suite has grown to standardize integrated features which had previously been considered advanced for a battery inverter. These include the ability to dispatch electricity, which can be based either on price signals or on the more standardized time-of-use electricity tariffs which often affect commercial and industrial customers.
The software also can be coupled to third-party tools, which suggests that it has the ability to offer broader grid services.
Yotta says that its pricing competes with a centralized larger battery due to significant reductions in installation labor, cranes, concrete pads, wiring, permits, and so on. Attaching an extra component to the racking system is relatively simple compared to installing large cabinets and shipping containers.
Of course, the elephant in the room is battery temperature: These batteries are located on top of the hottest part of the building. Yotta’s website provides a white paper analyzing the product’s temperature on a commercial rooftop in Los Angeles during a heatwave.
As shown in the graph above, the temperature soars to just over 140°F up on the building’s roof, but the battery temperatures stayed cool, under 100°F. Looking at the white paper, we see that battery temperature correlates more closely with battery utilization than with roof temperatures.
The key technological innovation that this author sees is how this product brings a new class of intelligent hardware to the very edges of the power grid, right next to solar panels. Whether this form factor offers more (or even less flexibility) to our power grid compared to a centralized battery inverter sited at a customer’s building remains unknown. However, these devices have greatly increased the number of sites eligible for battery integration. That, in and of itself, adds a significant value.
The grid aware inverters in Hawaii and utility scale batteries offering ancillary services blazed the trail. Now we’re seeing even more components join the big dance.
Electric panels are getting smarter, with groups like SPAN offering circuit level intelligence. Sunrun announced that it would bring Ford electric vehicles into the house as battery backups. Additionally, Enphase has finally launched its IQ8 inverter, which allows your home to run on pure solar during the daytime–even if the grid goes down–without a battery.
 
These tools are part of the same revolution driving companies like Sunrun, Tesla, and electricity utilities that are directly integrating residential solar plus energy storage systems into the big power grid via virtual power plants.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order 2222 mandates that the wholesale energy markets of the United States integrate distributed energy resources (like customer sited solar and batteries). This means that the portfolios of distributed energy in most of the United States will be allowed to bid into power grid markets, not just the few key leading states like California, Massachusetts, and Texas.
According to analysis by Vibrant Energy, there’s an opportunity for a quarter of our future power grid to become distributed. This could save ratepayers hundreds of billions of dollars if these resources are fully taken advantage of. We already have evidence that distributed resources and efficiency have saved California billions in power grid upgrades.
However, we’ve really only touched on the beginning of distributed value. A recent analysis in Connecticut suggests that the state can get 85.5% of the northern state’s electricity from rooftop and carport solar alone.
Tools like Yotta Energy’s rooftop distributed battery, combined with modern inverters, electric panels, vehicles, and – of course – solar power, will allow individuals and businesses to purchase the resilience needed to defend against power grid challenges like we’re seeing in California, and those which led to hundreds of deaths in Texas during last February’s winter storm.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/12/group-asks-that-entergy-improve-its-resource-planning/,"MARKETS,POLICY,ARKANSAS",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",Group asks that Entergy improve its resource planning,"The solar prices Entergy Arkansas used in its resource plan are too high, said a stakeholder group report, as the utility buys power from a 100 MW solar plant at a price “nearly 40% lower” than the solar costs used in its resource plan. The group also cited similar low solar costs in Georgia and Kentucky.
And although Entergy is building a solar and battery hybrid project, the group said the utility did not model solar-battery hybrids in developing its plan. “This is a mistake,” the group said, pointing to the federal tax credit for battery storage charged by solar power, the added capacity value of pairing solar with storage, and the decision of a New Mexico utility to replace a coal plant with solar and storage hybrids.
The stakeholder group consists of solar firms Stellar Sun and Scenic Hill Solar, trade groups Southern Renewable Energy Association and Arkansas Advanced Energy Association, and four nonprofits: Union of Concerned Scientists, Alliance for Affordable Energy, Sierra Club, and National Audubon Society.
The utility told stakeholders that its planning model could select both solar and battery resources “if a combination is the most economic resource alternative,” and that “once a specific need is determined,” the utility would consider factors such as co-location and the potential for a battery to receive a federal tax credit. The utility’s base case includes 2.4 GW of “solar + battery” capacity, with installations beginning in 2032.
The stakeholder report asked the utility to “continuously improve its resource planning process.”
Entergy plans to add 300 MW of solar and 200 MW of wind by 2025 under its preferred “Sensitivity Portfolio 4.” Those amounts reflect the utility’s existing renewables RFP, said Simon Mahan with Southern Renewable Energy Association, a stakeholder group member.
Yet “Sensitivity Portfolio 4 isn’t very good,” said Mahan. He favors Sensitivity Portfolios 1, 2, and 3, which would add comparable amounts of renewables by 2029, and also shut down coal plants earlier, as shown in an Entergy slide deck. All of the sensitivity portfolios would omit a 650 MW gas unit that’s included in the utility’s base case scenario.
The earliest coal unit retirements would come under Sensitivity Portfolio 1, which Entergy found would cost $6 million more than its base case scenario. “That $6 million, though, assumes the higher priced wind and solar resources,” Mahan said, “so they didn’t get it right.”
While cost should be the “primary” concern in selecting a preferred portfolio, the stakeholder group said the utility should also “evaluate and score” the public health impacts of each portfolio.
The stakeholder group’s report was included as an appendix of the utility’s resource plan.
Entergy Arkansas used the Aurora capacity expansion model to prepare its resource plan. The utility serves 722,000 customers across 63 of Arkansas’s 75 counties. Its parent firm also operates Entergy utilities in Texas, Louisiana, New Orleans, and Mississippi.
