The company operated with GAAP gross margins of 42.2%, net income of $114 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.80 ($1.25 non-GAAP). The company has a free cash flow of $179.1 million, and ending cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $1.42 billion.
The report shows that Enphase has continued its remarkable growth story, operating with strong financial health. This strength has only been emboldened by the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is set to provide manufacturing incentives for its products, including the flagship IQ8 microinverter. The IRA includes an 11 cents per AC Watt production-based tax credit for domestic manufacture of microinverters.
Enphase CEO Badri Kothandaraman said on the call that the company has signed letters of intent with new manufacturing partners and said the company will extend partnerships with existing ones. Enphase plans to open four to six manufacturing lines in the US by the second half of 2023 to meet sharply rising demand.
“The logic is we are anyway growing fast as a company. We have to build extra lines somewhere. And therefore, these lines that I invest in, they’re not going to be wasted. They’re not going to be extra. They will probably be required. You can think about it as I’m accelerating them by a few months,” said Kothandaraman on the call.
The company said it has many questions to be answered about the implementation of the IRA as it relates to domestic manufacturing, and it is currently working with industry partners and stakeholders to provide comments to the Department of the Treasury.
“We are going to iron out those details, hopefully in the next three months, and things will be a lot clearer. But for now, we are investing in it,” Kothandaraman said.
IQ8 microinverters constituted approximately 47% of all microinverter shipments during the third quarter of 2022. Q8 Microinverters can form a microgrid and provide “Sunlight Backup” during an outage, even without a battery. With the company’s Sunlight Jump Start feature, IQ8 Microinverters can restart a home energy system using sunlight only after prolonged grid outages that may result in a fully depleted battery. This eliminates the need for a manual restart of the system.
The company also expects to continue expanding its international presence. Revenues in Europe increased 70% over the previous quarter, which followed 69% growth from Q1 to Q2. Enphase currently works with contract manufacturers to build its products at sites in Mexico, India, and China, with plans to introduce another site in Romania to service the EU market in 2023.
Looking ahead
For its Q4 outlook, Enphase said it expects Revenue to be within a range of $680 million to $720 million, which includes shipments of 120 to 135 MWh of Enphase IQ batteries. It projects GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 39.0% to 42.0%; non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 40.0% to 43.0%, excluding stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization.
Enphase forecasts GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $152.0 million to $156.0 million and Non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $87.0 million to $91.0 million, excluding $65.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges for site consolidation, and acquisition related costs and amortization.
ROTH Capital Partners said IRA value could be higher than expected for Enphase, and reiterated a “buy” rating with a $310 price target for Enphase shares.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/26/semi-solid-flow-battery-tech-promises-to-lower-production-costs-by-up-to-40/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 26, 2022",Semi-solid flow battery tech promises to lower production costs by up to 40%,"From pv magazine global
24M Technologies, based in Cambridge, Mass., says it has simplified lithium-ion battery production with a new design that requires fewer materials and fewer steps to manufacture each cell. Its solution is a semi-solid flow battery in which the gooey electrodes are mixed directly into the electrolyte.
According to 24M, its SemiSolid cell manufacturing process and chemistry-agnostic platform can reduce manufacturing costs by up to 40%.
24M’s gooey electrode mix eliminates the energy-intensive process of drying and solidifying the electrodes in traditional lithium-ion production. The company says it also reduces the need for more than 80% of the inactive materials in traditional batteries, such as copper and aluminum.
The SemiSolid electrodes and unit cell construction are said to offer superb abuse tolerance, whereas their binder-free structure eliminates the need for hydro- or pyrometallurgical processes for battery recycling. According to the company’s website, 24M’s lithium-ion cells have energy density between 400-500 Wh/kg, specifically those made for the aviation industry.
In January of this year, 24M received a grant from the Department of Energy’s ARPA-E program to develop and scale a high-energy-density battery that uses a lithium metal anode and semi-solid cathode for use in electric aviation.
After being spun out of A123 Systems in 2010, 24M went on to acquire a renowned customer base, including license agreements with Volkswagen Group, Fujifilm Corporation, Kyrocera Corporation, Lucas TVS, Axxiva and FREYR. The last three companies are planning to build gigafactories based on 24M’s technology in India, China, Norway and the United States.
“The SemiSolid platform has been proven at the scale of hundreds of megawatts being produced for residential energy-storage systems. Now we want to prove it at the gigawatt scale,” says 24M CEO Naoki Ota.
More recently, 24M has entered a joint development agreement with ASX-listed graphite producer Volt Resources. The agreement will focus on coated spheronised purified graphite and also nonspherical graphite products to enhance lithium-ion battery performance.
The ongoing test work is being undertaken by Volt’s technology partner in the US, American Energy Technologies Co. (AETC), and progressing to support 24M’s commercialization activities in multiple markets, including electric vehicles, stationary storage and electric aviation.
At a later stage, the companies will be looking to enter into a binding offtake agreement that will leverage AETC’s inverted LIB anode materials flowsheet design to produce graphite products sourced from Volt’s 70% owned Zavalievsky Graphite business in Ukraine and future supply from its Bunyu Graphite Project in Tanzania.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/26/a-globalized-supply-chain-is-key-to-cutting-costs-in-solar-module-manufacturing/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 26, 2022",A globalized supply chain is key to cutting costs in solar module manufacturing,"The world is deploying renewable energy at an unprecedented speed in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions that are driving climate change. According to a recent report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, total global solar deployment is approaching 1 TW installed and on track to install an estimated 250 GW of solar capacity this year alone.
Solar will likely play a crucial role in achieving a sustainable, low-carbon energy future, especially if the price of production continues to decline as it has over the last 40 years. A new study published in Nature supports this concept. Findings from the paper reveal that the globalized supply chain of solar saved countries $67 billion in solar module production costs. The study also found that if domestic policies limit the free flow of goods, talent and capital, solar module costs will be much higher by 2030.
Nature reports that this is the first study to quantify the cost savings of a globalized value chain for the solar industry, and it comes at a time when many countries have introduced policies that would nationalize renewable energy supply chains in a bid to benefit local manufacturers. One example are the tariffs imposed in 2019 under the Trump administration when the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) announced increases on tariffs imposed on Chinese goods, including an increase from 25% to 30% on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports.  The study found that such policies could complicate efforts to accelerate deployment of renewables like solar by raising the cost of production. In June of this year the Biden administration announced a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam
“Our research shows international collaboration is key to address global climate change,” said Gang He, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Technology and Society in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University and the paper’s corresponding author. “Nationalistic policies hurt every country and risk missing pressing climate targets. International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain, however, it is important to introduce complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding-out.”
According to the team’s findings, He said that unit solar module prices in 2030 would be approximately as much as 25% higher in each country if relying on domestic manufacturing, compared to a future with globalized supply chains.

The study looked at historically installed capacities as well as input material and sales price data for solar module deployment in the U.S., Germany and China, the three largest solar exporters. The research team estimated that a globalized solar supply chain saved the countries a combined $67 billion: $24 billion for the U.S., $7 billion for Germany, and $36 billion for China from 2008 to 2020. Had each of the three countries adopted strong nationalistic trade policies that limited cross-border learning over the same time period, solar panel prices in 2020 would have been significantly higher: an estimated 107% higher in the U.S., 83% higher in Germany, and 54% higher in China. According to He, cross border learning, which is the free flow of information, capital, and talents that contribute to the “learning-by-researching” and “learning-by-doing” of manufacturing a product, in this case, PV. “The result is that the more we produce, the more efficient it gets, and the cheaper it becomes,” said He.
He told pv magazine that if we were to rely on a national market, “then we can only learn from a domestic scale of production, which is much less than a global scale of production, and therefore delayed our learning and cost reduction”.
“What this study tells us is if we’re serious about fighting climate change, policymakers need to implement policies that promote collaboration across global value chains with regard to scaling up low-carbon energy technologies,” said John Helveston, lead author of the study and assistant professor of engineering management and systems engineering at the George Washington University. “While this study focuses on one industry—solar—the effects we describe here are applicable to other renewable energy industries, such as wind energy and electric vehicles.”

TotalEnergies is a multi-energy company with over 100,000 employees in oils and biofuels, natural gas, renewables and electricity operating in more than 130 countries.
“With this agreement, Saint-Gobain North America will dramatically reduce its CO2 emissions while sending a strong signal to the market that the manufacturing industry is ready to commit to green electricity,” said Mark Rayfield, CEO of Saint-Gobain North America.
The 200 MW PPA is expected to reduce Saint-Gobain’s North American carbon emissions from electricity, known as scope 2 emissions, by 210,000 metric tons annually. This represents a 33% offset of the company’s scope 2 emissions. The agreement is expected to start at the end of 2024.
This is the second major power purchase agreement made by Saint-Gobain, following a wind energy project in Illinois. Together, the two projects are expected to equate to a 62% reduction in Saint-Gobain North America’s scope 2 emissions.
“Our ambition in the U.S. is to become a key partner for corporate players committed to achieving carbon neutrality by offering them innovative and cost-effective renewable solutions to decarbonize their electricity consumption,” said Marc-Antoine Pingnon, managing director, TotalEnergies Renewables USA.
A year ago, lawmakers called on the Department of Environmental Services to shut down Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics in New Hampshire after a September 2021 test conducted by the state showed the company is still emitting toxic PFAS chemicals into the air. The Department of Environmental Services (DES) found several deficiencies at the facility, most stemming from an unauthorized bypass stack that Saint-Gobain built without the state’s permission.
The problem is part of a six-year saga that has placed Saint-Gobain under scrutiny for its environmental practices. It highlights the need for decarbonization and improved environmental stewardship in the construction and industrial sectors.
Saint-Gobain has made several efforts to improve its sustainability in recent years, including:
As for the newly-signed 200 MW solar PPA, Rayfield said, “This renewable energy project is critical to meeting Saint-Gobain’s commitment to reduce scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by 33% by 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/26/california-requires-utilities-to-develop-and-post-hourly-retail-electric-rates/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 26, 2022",California requires utilities to develop and post hourly retail electric rates,"The California Energy Commission (CEC) has set new standards requiring the state’s five largest electric utilities to develop retail electricity rates that change at least hourly, to reflect locational marginal costs. They must also post those rates to a state database known as MIDAS.
The new load management standards aim to help customers shift electricity consumption to periods when renewable generation is high and wholesale prices are low, and help “support the carbon-free grid of the future,” said the CEC in its load management rule.
Hourly retail pricing of electricity is a form of dynamic pricing, which is also known as “sending prices to devices.”
Technologies that respond to price signals to automatically shift electricity consumption to lower-cost periods are seen as key to the success of dynamic pricing. “We have device manufacturers and other parties that are already starting to use MIDAS, and more are being added all the time,” said CEC staff.
The CEC standards require utilities to educate customers about both time-dependent rates and automation technologies, through their existing customer education and outreach programs.
The CEC has not required utilities to offer hourly rates to retail customers, because the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has the jurisdiction to approve utility rates. Instead, the CEC can require utilities to develop rate proposals that are in alignment with its load management standards, and then the utilities would file the rate proposals with the CPUC for review, said Terrie Prosper, Director of the CPUC’s News and Outreach Office.
The CEC’s requirement for utilities to post and update their rates at least hourly on the MIDAS database takes effect on April 1, 2023. Utilities must post to MIDAS “only existing and any newly adopted time-varying rates,” said CEC staff.
California’s largest electric utilities are already working on dynamic rates on an opt-in basis, said Jin Noh, policy director for the California Energy Storage Alliance. He cited dynamic rate pilot projects by utilities SCE and PG&E, and requests utilities have filed with the CPUC for approval of dynamic rates.
Finely grained dynamic rates, which could change every five minutes instead of hourly, and account for cost factors beyond the locational marginal price for wholesale power, have been proven to work in a pilot project completed in 2020.
A Pacific Northwest National Laboratory modeling study found that such real-time pricing could save $33 billion per year across the U.S.
The CEC said its new hourly pricing standards would yield net benefits of $243 million over 15 years, based on an analysis (PDF) prepared by CEC staff.
