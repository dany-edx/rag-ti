https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/19/climate-leaders-call-for-emissions-cuts-to-accelerate-climate-goals/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021",Leaders call for emissions cuts to accelerate climate goals,"Now that the United States has returned to the Paris Agreement, thousands of non-federal climate leaders–led by Michael Bloomberg, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, Charlotte, North Carolina, Mayor Vi Lyles, and CommonSpirit Health CEO Lloyd Dean–have launched America is All In, a coalition to drive a society-wide mobilization to bolster existing U.S. climate goals and align them with science-based targets, accelerating institutional and regional climate action.
The goal is to help the country meet a target of reducing emissions at least 50% from a 2005 baseline by 2030 and achieve net zero pollution by 2050.
The coalition describes itself as the evolution and combination of two existing climate action groups: We Are Still In and America’s Pledge. Over the last four years, We Are Still In has worked to unite cities, states, tribal nations, companies, colleges, health, faith and cultural institutions committed to ambitious climate action.
America’s Pledge is a Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative co-led by Rocky Mountain Institute and the University of Maryland Center for Global Sustainability with contributions from World Resources Institute, which has quantified and reported on member actions to drive down their greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
The analyses published by America’s Pledge have shown that non-federal actors have, in the past few years, created a significantly enhanced basis for a new, “All-In” climate policy, an all-of-society approach that, combined with federal policy starting this year, could deliver the emission reductions that the Biden administration is looking to achieve.
Further, America’s Pledge analysis show that the non-federal actors could drive emissions up to 37% below 2005 levels by 2030 entirely without new federal action. In a signal of support for this approach, America Is All In reissued a declaration signed by more than 1,700 non-federal actors committing to prioritize climate action in their own operations and work to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/19/u-s-renewables-persevered-set-records-in-a-pandemic-year/,"COVID-19,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021","U.S. renewables persevered, set records in a pandemic year","Despite the Covid-19 pandemic and sharp economic contraction, the U.S. achieved a record year for renewables in 2020, adding a combined 33.6 GW of solar and wind capacity.
That’s according to the Sustainable Energy in America Factbook, an annual joint report from BloombergNEF (BNEF) and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE).
Records were also set for each individual technology in 2020. The report said solar bested its previous 2016 high with 16.5 GW built, while wind had its strongest year ever with 17.1 GW added. The report further noted that utility-scale solar+storage projects are growing in popularity across the country.
BCSE President Lisa Jacobson explained, “Global supply chain disruptions, workforce protection measures, and policy uncertainty required adaptation across the industry.”
“In a year when so much went sideways, it was a blockbuster year for renewable energy build,” added Ethan Zindler, BNEF’s head of Americas. “Decarbonization of U.S. energy accelerated in 2020, and the benefits will be felt for years to come.”
Looking at the country’s overall power mix, the report also found that renewables’ contribution to the U.S. power grid set another record in 2020, rising 11% year-over-year. Renewable energy, including hydropower, generated a fifth of U.S. power last year.

The report said natural gas remained the largest source of U.S. power generation at 41%, but its 2019-2020 growth was slower than 2018-2019. Meanwhile, coal-fired power’s contribution slipped to 19% from 45% a decade ago. The report attributed coal’s decline to weak demand, continual plant retirements, and competition for lower-carbon power sources.
The report found the pandemic and resultant economic disruption in 2020 caused a massive drop in national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Energy demand for electricity and transportation fell by 3.8% and 14.4%, respectively, supporting the 9% year-over-year decline in GHG emissions for the U.S.

The report said this fall in emissions is the most significant on record and puts the U.S. on track to meet its 2025 Paris Agreement goals, to which President Joe Biden recommitted the U.S. on his first day in office.
The report acknowledged that energy demand and emissions are expected to rebound with widespread Covid-19 vaccinations in 2021. The positive impacts of cleaner energy, however, will persist.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/19/indiana-looks-to-establish-statewide-renewable-development-regulations/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIANA",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021",Indiana looks to establish statewide renewable development regulations,"Indiana legislators have advanced a bill that would standardize development regulations for wind and solar projects statewide, superseding any existing county or regional standards.
The bill, H.B.1381, passed 58-38 in the state House and will now move on to the Senate. The bill was sponsored by state Rep. Ed Soliday, a Republican from Valparaiso.
Most notably, the bill would open up development in the 32 Indiana counties that previously enacted bans on renewable power projects. Outside of that provision, the bill also includes setback and height requirements, a ground cover mandate, prefunding of decommissioning costs, and an obligation to minimize interference with roads and wireless signals.
According to Soliday, the bill was passed not in an effort to push more counties to develop renewable projects or to cut the state’s emissions, but to help Indiana establish a renewable market rather than force interested energy buyers to look to other states to fill their needs.
“This is not the Green New Deal, and you won’t see that coming from me,” Soliday told local press. “The Green New Deal sets renewable requirements; we’re not doing that.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/19/as-texas-recovers-report-warns-grid-operators-to-plan-better-for-extreme-weather/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,RESEARCH,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021","As Texas recovers, report warns grid operators to plan better for extreme weather","The head of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) said that climate change is prompting some grid operators to look at system planning and generators in a new way to better account for extreme weather-readiness.
Grid planning processes typically fail to consider extreme climate scenarios that a resilient grid needs to handle going forward, said EPRI President and CEO, Dr. Arshad Mansoor. “Traditional planning processes do not represent how resources actually perform under extreme conditions.”
That became clear this week as parts of the bulk power system faced challenges as winter storms moved through the U.S., impacting reliability in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) regions, in addition to millions of electricity customers in northern Mexico. Storms also led to outages along the East Coast, including areas served by Dominion Energy-Virginia.
ERCOT was particularly hard hit as tens of thousands of megawatts of thermal and renewable generating resources were unavailable even as demand for energy soared and temperatures plunged. Some customers lost power for days. And even as electric service was restored late in the week other problems arose, including water supply issues as water treatment plants were disabled across the state.
“Extreme weather events have adversely impacted all generation types, some more than others, relative to the output that was expected in the ERCOT resource adequacy planning,” Mansoor said.
Extreme weather events and limitations on natural gas availability are occurring more frequently, EPRI said in a statement. And weather is causing “significant changes” in the correlated output of variable energy resources like solar and wind.
The week’s headline-making power woes coincided with the release of a report from EPRI that categorizes and reviews the sources of supply disruption, including extreme weather events, cyber/physical risks, and fuel supply constraints. The report addresses what its authors described as a “critical gap in current metrics and approaches” that do not focus on the impact on multiple resources of “common mode events” that are often weather-related and that can cause significant disruptions in supply.
The report said that the electric industry “systematically understates” the probability and depth of many high-impact common mode events. It said that extreme weather events are rising in frequency, intensity, geographic scope, and duration; that the impact of weather is non-linear and rising much faster than frequency; and that a 10-year historical calculation of extreme event probability “understates the likelihood of an extreme event in a changing climate.”
Because renewable resource availability and output are closely tied with weather, the report said that other resources are required to rapidly respond to significant changes in renewable energy production. Natural gas is often viewed as one such resources. The report warned, however, that although natural gas-based generation is generally assumed to be an “available resource,” operational and regulatory issues can and do lead to that capacity being unavailable.
The EPRI report said that interaction between the natural gas and electric power markets needs to be restructured to remove the operational inefficiency that exists today due to the “nonalignment of the daily and longer market cycles” of the two industries. This recommendation echoes the findings of a task force assembled a decade ago to look into a similar February storm that froze gas supplies and disrupted electric power generation across ERCOT.
The report also called for “broader interconnection” with other systems through new transmission as a way to increase access to diverse resources and fuel supplies. It said that such interconnection is a “critical piece of a resilient grid” that can accommodate more low-carbon resources.
That may be tough for ERCOT to swallow. For decades the grid that serves 90% of Texas has lacked robust ties with neighboring grids. The separation was by design, in part as a way to keep federal power regulators out of the state. Agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have no jurisdiction over the state’s grid.
Meanwhile, MISO and SPP last fall kicked off a year-long collaboration designed to identify transmission projects that offer comprehensive, cost effective, and efficient upgrades. Both grid operators said they want to solve historical challenges facing generation interconnection customers in areas where their boundaries connect, also known as seams.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/19/sunrise-brief-bundled-rooftop-solar-from-sunnova-wins-bid-to-join-new-england-bulk-market/,"BATTERY,EV,PROCUREMENT,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021",Sunrise brief: Bundled rooftop solar from Sunnova wins bid to join New England bulk market,"Sunnova Energy won a bid to provide 85 MW of aggregated rooftop solar energy through the recent Independent System Operator-New England Forward Capacity Auction. The company bundled thousands of rooftop solar systems to arrive at its bid.
The company said its commitment priced at nearly $3/kW-mo across the region. It expects the first-year value to be around $2 million, and the gross value across the delivery term to be roughly $38 million.
The final pricing was up from prior years, with systems in the Northeast Massachusetts and Boston, Southeast Massachusetts, and Rhode Island area securing $3.98/kW-mo. Connecticut and Western Massachusetts cleared at $2.61/kW-mo, and New Hampshire priced at $2.48/kEV batteryW-mo.
As a market participant, Sunnova’s residential solar portfolio will offer renewable energy capacity to the regional grid that serves New England. The company expects to begin participating in June 2024.
Battery weight means a lot when it comes to how far an electric vehicle can travel on a single charge. Romeo Power and Ecellix Inc., developer of micro-porous silicon anode battery materials, will work together on technology that could reduce the weight of a 1 MWh battery pack by up to 9,900 pounds. That reduction is equal to cutting the weight of a battery-electric Class 8 truck by up to 25%, adding as much as 660 miles of range on a single charge.
The two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to cooperate in the development, validation, and launch of Ecellix’s battery technology, which aims to replace lithium-ion technology in commercial vehicles.
The partnership will combine Ecellix’s eCell technology with Romeo Power’s battery packs, modules, and battery management system. Exellix’s technology is claimed to add up to 50% more energy to current-generation lithium-ion batteries.
Complete Solar recently acquired Current Insight, an engineering company that provides CAD designs, structural engineering stamps, and electrical engineering stamps to solar companies. Terms were not disclosed.
Current Insight will continue to deliver CAD and engineering services to the solar industry. The companies said the acquisition augments Complete Solar’s offerings with three new products, creates new revenue opportunities, and further establishes its position as a sales, fulfillment, and services platform for the solar industry. Complete Solar currently serves 14 states and is based in San Ramon, California.
Nearly three years after regulators gave their OK, Pacific Gas and Electric said that the first public, electric vehicle (EV) fast chargers installed through its EV Fast Charge program are now open at a single 7-Eleven location in West Sacramento.
Drivers can charge their vehicles at the four 125kW-capable EV fast chargers. The convenience store is open 24 hours a day and owns and operates the charging station. PG&E said it is working with the company to install fast chargers at other locations in the coming years.
In May 2018, state regulators approved $22.4 million for PG&E to install infrastructure that supports Direct Current Fast Charging for electric vehicles. Starting in early 2020 and continuing through 2025, PG&E will pay to install infrastructure at qualifying customer sites to support the expansion of publicly available fast charging stations for light-duty vehicles.
JinkoSolar Holding said it will sign a “strategic cooperation agreement” with Tongwei Co. to jointly invest in a high-purity crystalline silicon project with annual capacity of 45,000 metric tons, and a silicon wafer project with an annual production capacity of 15GW, as well as develop a more extensive industrial chain cooperation.
According to the agreement, JinkoSolar will own a 35% equity stake in the 45,000-ton high-purity crystalline silicon project, while Tongwei will hold a 30% equity stake in the 15 GW silicon wafer project. The production capacity and products of the joint venture for the high-purity crystalline silicon will be given priority to meet the production needs of the joint venture silicon wafer company. In addition, based on an earlier procurement contract for 93,000 metric tons of polycrystalline silicon, JinkoSolar will supply Tongwei with roughly 6.5 GW of silicon wafer products for three years.
