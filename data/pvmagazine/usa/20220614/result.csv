What’s next?,"On June 5, the Biden administration announced a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
The move comes as a direct response to the industry-wide uncertainty that has unfolded since the Department of Commerce (DOC) March 28 announcement that it would act on a petition filed by California-based solar module manufacturer Auxin Solar requesting that DOC review solar panel imports from Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, announcing that it was launching an antidumping investigation into those companies. 
Tariff risk for solar goods sourced from the four nations exceeded 50% to 250%, creating an untenable level of uncertainty that cascaded into cancelled and delayed projects. The impact was so stark that it led the Solar Energy Industries Association to cut its project deployment forecast in half for the year. 
Paul Wormser, vice president of technology with Clean Energy Associates (CEA) told pv magazine USA that buyers and suppliers were essentially at a standoff, where neither the buyer nor the seller wanted to accept the risk. Neither party felt they could win in a negotiation, but both had something to lose if they didn’t negotiate. 
Wormser said the executive action will be impactful in removing a piece of that uncertainty in the near term. “Most people feel this was a positive move and very helpful to managing some of the challenges on the table right now,” he said. 
The move paves the way for supply contracts to get signed, prices to get better estimates, and factories and shipments from the four nations under investigation to get back on track. 
As for the latent impact from the investigation, Wormser said that projects did not go away entirely. “We did not see ‘demand destruction.’ The demand is still there, it is just unfulfilled. Instead of projects disappearing, a number of projects just changed their schedules. There will be a catch-up in deployment in what we had hoped to see in 2022, but that catch-up will take quite some time,” said Wormser. 
Other threats to supply 
“Unfortunately, there’s still going to be a dip in US deployments this year, versus what most of us would have predicted at the beginning of the year,” said Wormser. “There are ongoing issues with WRO (the Hoshine Withhold Release Order), there are new issues looming with UFLPA (Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act), and even though this particular issue of AD/CVD was ‘solved’ on Monday, it’s substantially towards the middle of the year before we had that solved.” 
Wormser said the UFLPA implementation is something to watch in the coming weeks. The act intensifies the burden of proof on importers, as they must prove that their goods must have no connection to the Xinjiang region of China, which has credible allegations of forced labor to the nation’s Uyghur community. 
He said that Xinjiang is the “center of gravity” for the world polysilicon supply chain, with a little less than half of the global polysilicon supply coming from the region. However, there is little to no wafer or cell manufacturing in the region, and there has never been a lack of absolute supply of polysilicon globally. China has made numerous announcements to move polysilicon production into other regions, so the UFLPA may not be as disastrous to solar module supply as it first appears. 
The WRO has led to the US detaining hundreds of MW of solar modules that were headed for US projects, but Wormser said that this pressure will continue to ease as module suppliers are now aware of what supply chain documentation is needed to clear Customs. 
The glut of undelivered products as a result of the triple-threat to US solar trade may take quite some time to reach US project sites. Wormser said the industry may be playing catch-up with this unserved demand into 2024. In the meantime, jobs have been lost, new jobs haven’t been created, and projects have been delayed. While it won’t be an overnight success, the softening of this trade triple-threat over time will lead to a steady supply flowing again, with US jobs and projects following. 
US manufacturing 
Concurrent with the two-year halt of solar tariffs on major Southeast Asian panels suppliers, the Biden Administration invoked the Defense Production Act and said it is using the full power of federal procurement capabilities to boost US-made solar. Master Supply Agreements will be put in place to enable domestic clean electricity providers to sell products to the US government rapidly, and US-made solar will be given “super preference” in federal procurement efforts. 
Christian Roselund, senior policy analyst, CEA, said the actions in total will likely not be enough to give a meaningful boost to US solar manufacturing. While every bit helps, running a solar module factory is much more costly in the United States than China, Southeast Asia, Turkey, or India, largely due to the wide gap in labor costs. Roselund said significant incentives to address the cost differential are likely the only path forward to make US solar competitive.
He added that CEA is still analyzing what the Defense Production Act means for US solar. He said that in the past, the act has been invoked to order US manufacturers to respond to crises, like making masks and respirators for Covid-19 response or munitions in wartime. 
“But I still haven’t seen anywhere in (the records), where the Defense Production Act has been used in a way that offsets higher operating costs. Because even if you provide grants and loans for the initial building of a factory, that doesn’t address the operating cost. It’s the medium to long term profitability that you have to worry about. What is needed is something to offset that price premium,” said Roselund. 
He said Jon Ossoff’s Solar Energy Manufacturing for America bill would do just that. However, it was tied up with the Build Back Better Act, which Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) shut down last December. Recently Democrats have voiced optimism that Manchin will cooperate on a climate bill, but Roselund said there is no guarantee anything meaningful will get by Manchin’s negotiations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/14/microsoft-to-purchase-power-from-a-100-mw-amplus-solar-project-in-india/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,INDIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 14, 2022",Microsoft to purchase power from a 100 MW Amplus Solar project in India,"Microsoft has ambitious climate goals. The tech firm is committed to being carbon negative by 2030, and by 2050 it plans to have removed all the emissions it has generated since its founding in 1975. To achieve the 2030 goal, the company plans to match 100% of its energy consumption with zero carbon energy purchases. In 2021, Microsoft signed new power purchase agreements (PPA) for 5.8 GW of renewable energy in ten countries, bringing its total to 8 GW procured through PPAs or long-term contracts.
Recently announced is the signing of a long-term renewable energy agreement with Amplus Solar to purchase power from a 100 MW solar project currently being developed in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The deal is part of Microsoft’s plan to source all its electricity to power its operations from renewable sources by 2025, including its data centers, buildings and campuses. The purchased power will likely offset that used by Microsoft Malaysia.
“Today’s announcement builds on our long-standing partnership that now extends into sustainable business transformation,” said K Raman, managing director of Microsoft Malaysia. “This strategic partnership will not only contribute to our own sustainability goals, but it also presents us the opportunity to apply the latest digital technology to support Petronas’ transition to a more sustainable future.”
Amplus is a member of the Petronas Group (Petroliam Nasional Berhad) based in Malaysia. It will work with Microsoft to develop an intelligent platform powered by data and artificial intelligence (AI) to support Petronas’ efforts to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Amplus Solar currently owns and manages a portfolio of 1 GWp+  of operational and under construction distributed solar assets comprising 400+ projects spread over across 24 states in India.
In its 2021 Environmental Sustainability Report, Microsoft noted that business revenue increased by 20% while reducing operational emissions by approximately 17% as a result of the company’s renewable energy purchasing. However, its Scope 3 emissions (comprising the company’s entire value chain) increased in 2021 by about 23% due to the carbon emitted from the generation of electricity needed to power its consumer devices as well as in the production of concrete and steel used in construction. The report points out that during the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a spike in the use of its Xbox and Surface devices, which combined accounted for nearly 30% of its Scope 3 emissions. The company notes that it has programs in place to lower these emissions including investing in carbon removal offsets.
Last month AES and Microsoft announced that the companies had entered into a 20-year agreement under which AES will provide renewable energy to power Microsoft’s California data centers, with AES partially matching the load of Microsoft’s California Data Centers with electricity generated from a portfolio of 110 MW of solar projects and 55 MW/220MWh storage projects, all set to be constructed in California. Four of Microsoft’s data centers are Zero Waste certified, with new certifications announced for data centers in Texas and Washington.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/14/vermont-expected-to-delay-long-term-changes-to-solar-net-metering/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,VERMONT",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 14, 2022",Vermont expected to delay long-term changes to solar net metering,"Net metering is a policy that has been critical to launching customer-owned solar across the nation, and that is no exception in Vermont. The state has seen steady growth in solar adoption, and impressively, over 16% of its electricity comes from solar. 
Net metering is the process by which the electric utility purchases excess customer-sited solar energy production that is exported back to the grid. It’s a key feature in the economic benefit of rooftop solar, and it’s a policy that has been part of high-profile fights in California and Florida in recent months. 
In Vermont, regulators at the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) have been actively considering changes that would reduce the payments made for net metering roughly one cent per kWh. Vermont reporter Howard Weiss-Tisman told Vermont Public Radio that he expects this provision to be passed at the PUC’s biannual ratemaking decision hearing. 
Currently, utility Green Mountain Power pays about $0.15 per kWh, and Vermont Electrical Cooperative pays roughly $.16 per kWh for excess solar generation. The one-cent drop would equate to the loss of about 6% or so in value. This loss in value would not affect solar energy that is customer-sited and self-consumed. 
Currently, the average price for electricity is $0.192 kWh in Vermont, so solar customers are paid roughly 80% of what the utility charges their neighbor for using the exported electricity. Some regulators and advocates are calling for a longer-term, more aggressive phasedown plan, but it appears that may not be achieved at this Summer’s biannual ratemaking decision, according to Weiss-Tisman.
The main justification for the reduction in payments is the concept that solar energy reduces utility profits, which thereby leads to electric rate increases. This, by effect, could lead to non-solar customers cross-subsidizing solar customers. 
However, sixteen state-level studies, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, have disproven the cost-shift argument, as has a national study, completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Berkeley found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar. More on this concept here. 
“Just looking at what’s the per-kilowatt-hour cost that you can buy from a utility-scale solar plant, and what’s the per-kilowatt-hour cost you’re getting from a net metering site? I don’t know if that goes deep enough. And I don’t know that it goes far enough,” said Jonathan Dowds with Renewable Energy Vermont, a solar developer advocacy group. “And from a climate perspective, we need as much of both as we can get, as quickly as possible. So, the last thing I think we should be doing as a state to hit our climate goals and our energy goals is slowing down the deployment of clean energy resources.” 
Citing complexities of the issue, the Vermont PUC has decided to not move forward with any kind of long-term plan to reduce net metering. Every two years, the PUC makes a ratemaking decision, so the issue may arise again, but it is not expected to be addressed in this year’s decision. Weiss-Tisman said the state will likely look to the developments in California around net metering for guidance on Vermont’s plan.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/14/solar-landscape-brings-1-3-mw-of-community-solar-to-asbury-park-school-district/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW JERSEY",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 14, 2022",Solar Landscape brings 1.3 MW of solar to Asbury Park School District,"Community Solar developer Solar Landscape announced that it has completed and energized a 3,300-module series of solar installations located on the rooftops of four schools across the Asbury Park School District in New Jersey.
In total, the project has a capacity of  1.3 MW, and all of the electricity generated will be used by the school under a 15-year, no-cost power purchase agreement. The generation is expected to meet 52% of the electricity need for Asbury Park High School, Thurgood Marshall Elementary School, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Upper Elementary School, and Bradley Elementary School.
Solar Landscape is also in the process of collaborating with the Board of Education to provide renewable energy instruction to Asbury Park students, including student education on the benefits of green energy and green energy career opportunities that are available to them. All of this is being done as a part of Solar Landscape’s Green Ambassador Program, which also issues scholarships to students, and works with New Jersey community colleges, technical schools and nonprofits to introduce students to careers in the solar energy industry.
“As an Asbury Park-based company, being a good partner to our local community – especially students and educators – is a driving force behind our mission and is a core reason that our 100-plus employees come to work every day,” said Solar Landscape CEO Shaun Keegan. “Together with Asbury Park School District, we are lowering emissions and doing our part to combat climate change by accelerating the transition to renewable energy. So when we can do it in a way that directly benefits our neighbors by saving them money and creating jobs and educational opportunities, it is even more rewarding.”
The addition of the installations across the Asbury Park School District further establish Solar Landscape as one of the leading solar developers in New Jersey. In March, the company energized the final project of the 20 total MW it was awarded under New Jersey’s Community Solar Pilot Program Year One. Solar Landscape’s 46 projects for year two of the program are now under construction and are expected to generate more than 50MW of power once operational.
Solar Landscape’s 50 MW portfolio represents roughly one-third of all capacity awarded under year two of the community solar program. In October 2021, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities announced that it would be making the program permanent, driven by the pilot’s success so far.

Residential battery capacity in Puerto Rico and other US territories is growing steadily with forecasts estimating deployments will nearly double by the end of 2026, according to the most recent US Energy Storage Monitor report from the Energy Storage Association and Wood Mackenzie. Installers of Enphase products in Puerto Rico have seen growing deployments of Enphase Energy Systems powered by IQ Microinverters and IQ Batteries, with the grid experiencing frequent outages and climate experts forecasting above-average hurricane activity this year.
“Homeowners in Puerto Rico are increasingly motivated to switch to solar and battery storage in order to manage the all too frequent grid outages and the increasingly high electricity prices,” said Brad Spernak, Pro Solar chief technology officer, an Enphase Platinum level installer.
IQ8 Microinverter-based systems can provide Sunlight Backup during an outage, even without a battery. For homeowners who choose battery backup, the Sunlight Jump Start feature in IQ8 Microinverters can restart a home energy system, eliminating the need for a manual restart of the system.
“The industry-leading home solar and battery system from Enphase means that Puerto Rico homeowners can put blackouts in the past,” said Enrique González, CEO of Power Solar, an Enphase Platinum level installer. “IQ8 Microinverters and IQ Batteries enable homeowners to have peace of mind with a clean energy source to keep their lights on when the grid goes dark.”
Since 2017 when Hurricane Maria caused major devastation, leaving 1 million people without power for three months, Puerto Rico has been on a path to 100% renewable energy. With the passage of Senate bill 1121 last year, Puerto Rico became the fifth state-level jurisdiction to establish a 100% zero-carbon and/or renewable energy mandate. With plenty of sun, researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL reported that Puerto Rico has 40 GW of solar potential, with half of it coming from distributed installations.
“With the abundant sunshine in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico is well-suited to harness solar energy,” said Dave Ranhoff, Enphase Energy chief commercial officer. “It’s critical that homeowners in this region also have reliable backup power due to more frequent hurricanes.”
