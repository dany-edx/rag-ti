The AgriSolar Clearinghouse is taking a national tour of operational agrivoltaic operations, sharing knowledge, and bringing attention to a practice with numerous (and perhaps unexpected) benefits.
The clearinghouse features a library of peer-reviewed information, videos, podcasts, news, and a forum for agrivoltaics discussion. More than 30 partners and stakeholders in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, national energy laboratories, the Smithsonian, and leading universities participated in its creation.
The first stop on the tour is the agrivoltaic array at Biosphere 2, a research center run by the University of Arizona. Biosphere 2 is nothing short of incredible, it is a 3.14-acre laboratory in the middle of the hot, dry Sonoran Desert that is referred to as the world’s largest earth science experiment. Contained inside the massive facility is a climate-controlled environment, complete with ocean, rainforest, mangrove, desert, and savanna-simulating conditions.
Outside the Biosphere is an area with solar PV on raised structures. And below the panels are crops: kale, tomatoes, Swiss chard, and more. The facility is meant to serve a similar function to Biosphere 2, aiding researchers in understanding the various effects climactic conditions create.
Dr. Greg Barron-Gafford, director of food, water, energy research at Biosphere, runs the agrivoltaic system. He uses a portable handheld device equipped with the same climate controls as the Biosphere, which he calls the “mini-Biosphere”, and measures sunlight irradiance, temperature, moisture levels and other climate variables.
When Barron-Gafford started the project he was focused on was challenges with renewable energy production in high-heat conditions. “At the same time, we want to produce food out here in the West, but water resources are becoming more scarce.” Shifting climates have made rainwater less predictable and more intermittent, so water management will become an increasing part of food production.
A simple, but important benefit the Biosphere team found was that the shade provided by the photovoltaic system reduced evaporation, meaning that water would stay on the surface longer and better feed crops than open-air land-based agriculture. Not only does this save water, but it makes the plants grow stronger, leading to a better crop yield. Additionally, the shaded space provided by the panels causes plants to spread out, searching for sunlight. Barron-Gafford shared an example of an open-air leaf versus an agrivoltaic one from the same species of plant, and the agrivoltaic leaf was at least double the size.
The agrivoltaic array has mutual benefits for crop growth and energy production. In dry climates like the one that surrounds Biosphere 2, there can often be too much light and heat for plants to grow properly. The panel’s shade helps create better conditions for the plants. The same goes for solar panels, which produce less power at high temperatures. A conventional solar facility may remove all vegetation below, which, in large solar arrays, causes a studied effect of a heat island.
(Read: “Could agrivoltaics feed our demand for clean energy?”)
Excess sun energy that isn’t converted to electricity can leave the area in two ways: either as latent heat or sensible heat. Sensible heat is the type that we can feel, and the type that is damaging to solar PV production. Latent heat is the energy that is absorbed by nearby water, evaporating into vapor. By adding crops below in a dry climate, you are adding more latent heat absorption, taking heat pressure off the panels, and boosting production and lifecycle.
Dry-climate farmers may enjoy working with agrivoltaics, too. Preliminary data from the center suggests skin temperatures are about 20 degrees Fahrenheit lower than open-air farming.
“We found that rooftop solar will not be enough for all our energy needs. So you have to move solar into larger chunks, and it costs quite a bit to move that energy around. You don’t want to put it out in complete nowhere. A lot of times you can push it to city edges. And what is in that periurban edge around the cities? That’s where are historic farms are,” said Barron-Gafford.
Barron-Gafford’s team is now exploring ways that food production can be re-introduced into conventional dryland PV arrays.
Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said. The paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland. At a global scale, it is estimated that 1% of all farmland could produce the world’s energy needs if converted to solar PV.
The AgriSolar Clearinghouse is set to continue its journey through the nation’s agrivoltaic centers, making stops in Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, New York, and more over the next two years.
“AgriSolar allows us to harvest the sun twice. As America’s appetite for sustainably grown products and renewable energy continues to increase, agrisolar has the potential to provide both resources,” said NCAT Energy Program Director Dr. Stacie Peterson. “The Follow the Sun Tour will visit agrivoltaic sites around the country that are seeing success with things like co-located grazing, habitat rehabilitation, crop production, and cutting-edge research. Our national network of partners includes the world’s leading agrivoltaic experts and we are excited to connect the public with partners like Dr. Greg Barron-Gafford and provide the opportunity to tour his research sites.”

Hostetler will succeed Jim Fusaro, who previously announced his intention to retire by the end of the year.
“Array Technologies is a company that I have admired for some time now,” Hostetler said. “Array is a great intersection of my deep experience in engineered products and actuation, and my passion for the environment. Array’s innovative products are key to important constituents across the solar industry… I look forward to working with our talented teams around the world to bring us closer to the future of solar and helping our planet decarbonize along the way.”
Prior to his appointment at Array, Hostetler served for four years as Chief Executive Officer at Rotork, a Financial Times Stock Exchange 250 company, where he led the company’s Growth Acceleration Program which drove improved margins, capital efficiency and commercial excellence.
“We are excited to welcome Kevin as Chief Executive Officer to lead Array through its next phase of growth,” said Brad Forth, chairman of Array Technologies. “Over the past few years, the Array team, led by Jim Fusaro, built a strong foundation which doubled the size of our business. As we look toward the future under Kevin’s leadership, Array will focus on executing on our long-term strategic initiatives and integrating the STI Norland business.”
Array Technologies acquired STI Norland, another leader in the global tracker space, in January 2022 establishing an outfit that Array is touting as the largest tracker company in the world. Prior to the acquisition, Array was the second largest supplier of trackers worldwide, behind NEXTracker.
Different tracker vendors have different engineering approaches and Array’s one motor per-MW design has allowed for significant price reductions, which the company has credited as being critical to attaining its market share. Concurrently, STI Norland made a name for itself with its dual-row tracker system, a solution which is well-suited for installation on irregular terrain and in regions with low wind and/or snow load requirements.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/05/seia-speaks-on-potential-devastation-of-the-solar-anticircumvention-investigation/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 5, 2022",SEIA speaks on potential devastation of the solar anticircumvention investigation,"The solar industry is on the precipice of an unprecedented disruption and harm, as the US Department of Commerce (DOC) continues its investigation into solar cell and module manufacturers in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam potentially using parts produced by Chinese companies, therefore circumventing existing antidumping and countervailing (AD/CV) tariffs on Chinese goods and the vast majority of the country’s module supply hangs in limbo.
To provide clarity on the investigation process, timeline, and perspective on the potential impacts across the solar industry, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) held a webinar this afternoon, where the organization also revealed the some preliminary findings of its survey for solar workers and companies already affected by the investigation.
Reiterating the point that he has made since Auxin Solar first submitted its petition to DOC, John Smirnow, vice president of market strategy and general counsel with SEIA called the investigation the “Biggest threat I’ve seen in my 15 years in the industry.” Following Smirnow, President and CEO of SEIA, Abigail Ross Hopper, voiced her anger and disbelief that DOC and the Biden Administration at large would continue an investigation founded upon “baseless claims from a single petitioner, one which has previously made contradictory claims regarding the difficulty and logistics of American module manufacturing, the protection of which is what Auxin claims its petition is aimed at.
To prove circumvention under US law, the work to create a product in a particular country must be minor and insignificant. The countries listed in the petition have invested billions of dollars to establish a manufacturing base. Fabricating solar cells and panels is a major and significant operation that SEIA asserts will take years to establish in the United States.
Behind the pervasive uncertainty of how much damage the investigation and possibility of tariffs could have on the US solar industry was an air of disbelief that the Federal Government would pursue such an action, one which threatens to pull the rug out from underneath the renewable energy platform that President Biden leaned on so heavily in his campaign.
And while the full scope of damage potential has yet to be realized, the preliminary results of SEIA’s survey show that some harm is already being felt.
Since launching the survey on April 1, SEIA has garnered more than 200 responses from companies operating across the entire solar value chain, as of April 5 at 8:00 a.m. EST, including those in residential, utility, commercial and industrial (C&I), community solar, domestic manufacturing, importers, distributors, those in finance, and others. Across each of those segments, at least 90% of respondents shared that the investigation alone will have a severe to devastating impact on their business in 2022 alone. 
Just under 75% of respondents report that they are already experiencing cancelled or delayed module shipments, while 11% have not yet been notified of delays, but expect them to come. What these delays have led to is half of all respondents sharing that 80% their 2022 pipeline is at risk, with that figure including already-completed projects.
Two-thirds of respondents shared that 50% or more of their workforce is at risk of layoffs or termination, while one-third said that their entire workforce is at risk. For additional perspective, Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research with SEIA shared that both of these figures are considerably higher than similar survey results taken in early 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid shutdowns and stay-at-home orders. 
The impacts are not just contained to solar, either. SEIA shares that more than 60% of respondents expect a severe or devastating impact on the energy storage industry, as most energy storage projects are paired with solar, a pairing that s required for them to reap their maximum incentive potential.
SEIA now sees its earlier projection that the investigation will lead to a module import shortfall of roughly 8GW as hopeful, rather than expected, with the potential for a much worst-case scenario rising.
The conclusion of the webinar was all about uncertainty. Nobody knows how DOC is going to rule on the investigation. While a clear timeline exists for each step of the investigation, any step could be subject to an indefinite delay, further extending the issue. Hopper also asserted that tariffs historically lead to little to no positive impact to US manufacturing, while propagating palpable harm, adding that that the only way to grow manufacturing is policy and long-term certainty

The company is known for producing monocrystalline PERC PV cells and monofacial and bifacial modules. It is now working on several R&D projects, in collaboration with three universities in Vietnam and one university in China.
It is working on a new N-TOPCon cell technology, which it claims is more efficient and stable. It is also working on a second R&D project to integrate N-TOPCon cells into 600W+ modules. The modules will feature advanced casing and will benefit from a low temperature coefficient, low attenuation, and higher double-sided ratios, said Boviet.
In addition, Boviet Solar  is targeting heterojunction (HJT) cell technology. It said it expects HJT to become the next-generation mainstream technology, with an efficiency rating of 27.5%.
New name
Separately, Boviet Solar has renamed its modules after stars. The monofacial modules are now called the “Gamma Series,” while the bifacial modules are called the “Vega Series.”
“We think Vega and Gamma are the perfect images for our highly efficient mono- monofacial and bifacial PV modules with their industry leading power output. Furthermore, star names make sense because our own Sun is of course a star – a star that makes solar energy possible here on Earth,” said Sienna Cen, president of Boviet Solar USA.
Boviet is not the only company switching to TOPCon. The world’s major solar manufacturers can be expected to switch from industry-standard PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) products to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology “within the next few years,” according to one US analyst.
The technological shift prompted by manufacturers nearing PERC’s conversion efficiency threshold of 23.7% – for commercially produced products – is one of the predictions made by Denver-based Clean Energy Associates (CEA) in its survey of the solar manufacturing industry during the last three months of 2021.

If solar electricity generation keeps up the year over year growth rates of the last ten years – 33% – for another ten years, then solar will without a doubt be pulling its weight in mitigating CO2 emissions. The report suggests that solar “only” needs to grow at 24% over the next decade to meet its goals.
Giddyup!

The analysis found that solar electricity generation rose by greater than 23% last year, and that wind grew by 14%. The two sources officially surpassed 10% of global electricity generation last year, and when combined with other clean electricity sources (nuclear and hydro being the other two largest), they hit 38%. Combined, this means they passed the world’s largest electricity generation source – coal – at 36%.
Globally, 50 countries now meet 10% or more of their electricity demand with wind and solar. Three countries dramatically surpassed that target: Denmark, Luxembourg, and Uruguay produced 52%, 42%, and 47% of their respective electricity supply using only wind and solar power. The current global leaders in solar power are Yemen, at ~15%, Chile at 13%, and Australia at 12%.

But the news isn’t all roses. Coal consumption ramped up last year as a result of China’s continued growth, as well as the recovery of the global economy and related electricity demands. In absolute terms, the global electricity demand increases of 2021 were the largest ever observed. Unfortunately, growth in wind and solar — also the largest ever observed — supplied only 29% of that increased demand for electricity.
In a related document, Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report stating that wind and solar power represent our two least expensive tools for lowering CO2.

The graph from the IPCC report (above) shows that by 2030, solar and wind are each expected to mitigate roughly four gigatons per year of CO2 emissions, with an upper limit as high as six gigatons each, per year. The carbon savings from either one of these clean energy sources is expected to be on par with the emissions that would be saved by ceasing the destruction of forestland. The blue on the bar graph suggests that at least four gigatons of these global CO2 reductions (wind and solar combined) will cost less than we’re paying for energy today.
Within that report is a combination graph that should look familiar to readers of pv magazine: the growth rates of various clean technologies, along with their associated cost decreases.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/05/solar-the-energy-workhorse-in-latest-gloomy-ipcc-verdict/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",MAX HALL,"APRIL 5, 2022",Solar the energy workhorse in latest gloomy IPCC verdict,"From pv magazine global
The latest doom-laden report issued by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has highlighted solar as having the biggest potential for energy sector emission reduction this decade.
The “Climate Change 2022 Mitigation of Climate Change” document published yesterday by the IPCC estimated solar panels could reduce carbon emissions by 4.25 gigatons per year this decade, with more than half that potential at a lower cost than reference electricity prices, rising to an additional $50 to $100 per ton of CO2 abated. The report noted, however, that estimate does not include the cost of integrating solar into electric grids.
That carbon emission reduction potential compares to around a billion tons per year abated by industrial materials efficiency; 750 million tons per year from each of building-hosted renewables, such as rooftop solar, and light-duty electric vehicles (EVs), such as passenger cars; and around 250 million tons from heavy-duty EVs, including e-buses.
Reiterating the 85% price falls seen for solar in the last decade – and the tenfold rise in deployment volumes – the report stated renewables will remain the best-cost option for generation this decade but will require greater sector coupling and use of energy storage, smart grids, demand-side management, and green hydrogen and its derivatives to fulfill its potential to drive down energy sector carbon emissions.
Only supporting policy, technology availability, finance, and public and political support will enable the ironing out of global imbalances which, for instance, have seen such low take-up of solar in sub-Saharan Africa, the IPCC noted.
The critical importance of the energy sector’s workhorse role in limiting global temperature rises this century was emphasized by the authors of the 64-page policymaker summary of the full, 3,675-page report. “In modeled global pathways that limit warming to 2 C … or lower, most remaining fossil fuel CO2 emissions until the time of global net zero CO2 emissions are projected to occur outside the power sector, mainly in industry and transport,” they wrote.
Low-carbon transport
The study estimated transport will be unable to hit net-zero this century, despite the low-carbon contributions of EVs, green hydrogen and derivatives such as ammonia and synthetic fuel (synfuel). That means negative carbon emissions will have to be found in other sectors, including from the direct capture of carbon from the air, which the IPCC said would make a contribution of less than 1% to the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts in its renewables-heavy future scenario.
While green hydrogen and its associated fuels will have to come down in price, the report stated: “Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity offer the largest decarbonization potential for land-based transport, on a life cycle basis.” The document added, more will have to be invested in EV infrastructure, and raw materials supply fears will have to be addressed by resource diversification, circular materials flows, and energy and material efficiency improvements.
While electrification can make a contribution to carbon reduction from short haul shipping and aviation, the sector will need to have much more ambitious climate change aims and governance to do its part, the IPCC stated.
The crucial role to be played by low-carbon electricity and energy carriers in reducing the CO2 footprint of global transport is a notable example of the sector coupling called for by the UN body.
Demand management, materials and energy efficiency, circular material flows, and hydrogen will all be needed to decarbonize industry, with synfuels, ammonia and heat pumps making a contribution in light industry, mining, and manufacturing, the report stated.
The IPCC also noted the potential for renewable energy resource-rich areas of the globe to claim new chemicals and steel industry facilities, as has been noted by African commentators who oppose the idea of exporting all African hydrogen.
Building sector
Solar can also play a part in reducing the carbon footprint of buildings, through retrofitting in established global cities and as stipulated in building codes which could green the building materials supply chain in emerging urban centers. The report stated: “The 2020-2030 decade is critical for accelerating the learning of knowhow, building the technical and institutional capacity, setting the appropriate governance structures, ensuring the flow of finance, and in developing the skills needed to fully capture the mitigation potential of buildings.”
The IPCC reiterated a familiar refrain, that the world must invest three to six times more on climate change mitigation and adaptation to stay below a two-degree temperature rise this century, depending on the scenario modeled. The biggest funding shortfall in such measures concerns the agriculture and forestry sector, the report noted, an industry where more intensive farming and production for less meat-intensive diets could free up more sites for solar and wind plants.
Carbon price
The study said carbon pricing has proven useful to drive emission reductions from low-cost technologies but less so for the more expensive measures needed for hard-to-abate sectors such as industry. The report’s authors did take encouragement, however, from a lack of evidence emissions trading schemes had led to carbon leakage, thanks to their design.
As far as paying the bill to stave off catastrophic climate change, pushing the developed world to meet its commitment to provide $100 billion per year to developing countries would be a start, as would sharing, and thereby reducing, investment risk in developing markets, the IPCC added.
And the cost of not coughing up? According to the study, the policies in place around the world at the end of 2020 have us on target for a 3.2 C average temperature rise this century.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/05/county-wide-community-solar-campaign-launches-in-new-york/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 5, 2022",County-wide community solar campaign launches in New York,"New York state recently became the top community solar market in the United States, edging out Minnesota, with the completion of a 7.5MW project in Schenectady County,
“Reaching this nation-leading milestone – with more than one gigawatt of community solar installed – is a testament to New York’s aggressive pursuit of clean-energy alternatives that will supercharge our economy and bring us one step closer to a carbon-neutral future,” Governor Kathy Hochul said.
New York’s distributed solar pipeline is comprised of more than 708 community solar installations, in pursuit of achieving 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and the governor’s goal to achieve 10GW of solar by 2030. Neighborhood Sun is hoping to further increase installations with the launch of a county-wide community solar campaign. The campaign plans to not only educate and spread awareness of community solar, but it is promoting equitable access to clean energy across Columbia County, New York.
In December 2021 Neighborhood Sun merged with Astral Power, a New York-based provider of access to locally produced clean energy, and the company is now partnering with OYA Solar, a solar developer and independent power producer, and the Columbia County Climate Smart Communities (CSC) task force on the educational campaign. CSC is a New York State program that helps local governments take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing climate.
To stimulate sign ups, subscribers will receive a $100 sign-up bonus and Neighborhood Sun will also make a $100 donation to the county’s sustainability fund in their name.
” We need community solar because only about 30 percent of people can have their own panels,” said Angus Eaton, Chair of the Town of Chatham CSC.

Unlike with rooftop solar, anyone can participate in community solar because it doesn’t involve any installations, costs, or fees for subscribers. Consolidated billing means that subscribers receive only one monthly electric bill, making billing more convenient and increasing equitable access for low- and moderate-income residents. Annual electricity costs can be reduced by up to 10% with the clean energy credits from community solar, according to Neighborhood Sun.
Columbia County residents, businesses, and organizations can through Neighborhood Sun’s SunEngine, the community solar software platform that it acquired in the merger with Astral Power.
New York stands behind its community solar market by incentivizing people with reduced electricity bills for participating in their community’s transition to clean energy. All public utility ratepayers in New York pay a System Benefit Charge (SBC) on their utility bill to support the Clean Energy Fund.
“The CSC Task Force has taken the guesswork out of community solar for its citizens by making it a wasted opportunity for residents and businesses who don’t subscribe,” said Cara Humphrey, VP Strategic Sales, Neighborhood Sun.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/05/solar-investments-are-scaling-up-but-inefficient-om-is-weighing-them-down/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 5, 2022","Solar investments are scaling up, but inefficient O&M is weighing them down","As solar investments boom across North America, project developers and asset managers alike are under increasing pressure to deliver ever-higher returns, making long-term O&M strategies a necessity for ensuring optimal performance. But while the growing number of asset owners choosing to outsource solar operations and maintenance to third parties is a sign of the industry’s maturation, many attempt to save costs by picking the cheapest service provider – or limiting contract scopes to fit whatever’s left in the project budget.
These short-sighted sacrifices often end up costing asset owners more in the long run, and costs like this can grow exponentially when scaling up a business. As O&M services for solar power plants become more complex, less sophisticated third-party providers seeking to cut costs themselves may end up creating inefficiencies throughout the project lifecycle. And as O&M challenges inevitably emerge from weather events or equipment issues, asset owners opting for bare-bones O&M contracts may face unanticipated expenses for necessary services.
Borrego understands this challenge from both sides. While we’re typically thought of as a project developer and EPC, we’ve also become one of the leading third-party O&M providers in the country, with over 75% of the 1.4GW we manage built by other companies. Here’s what we’ve learned about how to keep O&M offerings ahead of the curve.
O&M services for solar power plants is a lifecycle job

The industry has learned a lot of hard lessons since its early days when solar was considered to be practically maintenance-free other than occasional module cleaning and equipment checks. On the contrary, successful O&M requires continuous engagement across a variety of concerns throughout the project lifecycle, from due diligence during project development and construction to day-to-day operational performance and additional rounds of due diligence when buying or selling an asset.
For example, during the project development and construction phase, lenders may require third-party inspections, and in some cases, asset owners may need repair work for EPC build issues discoverable during the first year of operations such as poor underground cable installation or loose bolts. Projects then typically see growing needs for solar maintenance services to address system underperformance and equipment failures from year five onward. And as we see systems operating beyond 15 years, it often pencils out for asset owners to repower their systems (and potentially replace central inverters with string inverters).
Of course, unexpected O&M challenges can also occur at any time during a project’s life, often due to various forms of weather damage. These diverse and regionally-specific issues can include water damage from storms, misaligned equipment from erosion, panel damage from lightning, hail and wind damage, and soot from wildfires. Many if not all of these events have become increasingly common over the past decade, and climate change is virtually assured to increase their frequency given the decades-long lifespan of the solar assets being built today.
The hidden costs of inefficient solar operations & maintenance
Addressing any of these issues, whether owners discover them during regular operations or after a hurricane, can require O&M providers to conduct performance engineering analyses, site investigations and equipment upgrades or replacements.
Unfortunately, while system outages caused by aging equipment or weather damage are among the most common issues encountered by asset owners, these corrective steps may fall outside the scope of typical preventative maintenance packages. Yet many asset owners make the mistake of choosing O&M providers based on price alone – for instance, awarding a contract to an EPC offering a discount to close a follow-on O&M contract, or flexing down contract scope to match whatever’s left in the project budget – and end up incurring unplanned additional expenses to address issues on a case-by-case basis.
Process inefficiencies can also subtly erode returns. Many “national” O&M companies may not actually have the ability to quickly dispatch technicians in a given project region, leading to slow responses to outages and expensive downtime from delays in restoring service. Conversely, trying to juggle multiple local or regional O&M providers can become time-consuming and hard-to-meet quality standards as companies scale across geographies.
Further inefficiencies can emerge from poor technology and IT adoption. Companies of all sizes may fail to properly integrate IT capabilities across their business, leading to slow service or friction between different software tools. And when an O&M provider doesn’t provide real-time and adequate transparency in their data communications and reporting, they leave asset owners in the dark as these costs mount.
These additional costs potentially hidden in some O&M contracts are coming back to haunt a growing number of asset owners. Research from kWh Analytics found that US utility scale solar assets are underperforming their financed performance projections by 6.3% – and those single-digit production shortfalls today can compound into 40% reductions in equity cash flows over a decade. While underperformance isn’t always due to poor O&M services, cutting O&M spend and hoping for the best is a recipe for a vicious cycle that exacerbates shortfalls.
Poor financial performance is particularly problematic for organizations seeking to scale up their solar investments. Financing providers – who expect PV assets to deliver predictable cash flows – are demanding more precise modeling and becoming more careful in their scrutiny of operations, and persistent underperformance can impact access to capital for growth. Not surprisingly, all of these challenges multiply when project developers and owners seek to add battery storage, which promises increased project returns but also increased O&M complexity and new safety concerns.
How to recognize solar operations & maintenance done right
Sophisticated asset owners look for experience, communication and accountability, high standards and technology innovation in an O&M partner they can trust to support them in scaling up their solar and storage investments.
Experienceis understandably high on the list of O&M provider qualifications, but when asset owners are scaling up their solar investments, it’s experience with the entire project lifecycle, a deep technology bench and work across the full range of installation types and product manufacturers, and across geographies that has the most bankable impact. Experience across the entire project lifecycle helps to avoid inefficiencies of coordinating work across different companies and having the same provider who has been operating your plant for 15 years saves time and money when it’s time to repower. And an O&M partner with experience deploying teams across regions and working with diverse product manufacturers can help owners follow opportunities to grow in new market segments or regions.
Communication and accountability are key for any long-term partnership, and it’s absolutely essential when maximizing the performance of a complex asset with a 30-year lifespan. Having a provider that owners can trust to be proactive and transparent in their communications is table stakes for winning a contract, but some O&M providers will pitch cheaper packages to win deals while minimizing the likelihood of higher long-term costs. The best O&M providers are up front about the true lifetime costs of different contract options and will deliver detailed, timely reporting of maintenance service and operational performance across all of the projects in a portfolio.
High standards for quality of service should go without saying, but unfortunately, some O&M providers fall short on this. Rigorous standards need to be set for all O&M functions with safety at the top of the list, and providers must put in place processes geared to achieve total compliance across a customer’s entire portfolio. Responsible asset owners also demand a “trust but verify” approach. It’s important to have full transparency into what these standards are as well as the O&M provider’s level of performance against them as part of regular reporting.
Technology innovation is also a key differentiator for O&M providers, with a wide range of potential applications. Data-based decision-making tools quickly diagnose and remedy performance issues or even anticipate them before they become a problem; CMMS software ensures real-time responses to customer issues with consistent and efficient follow-up; and real-time asset monitoring dashboards deliver a steady flow of actionable data across project portfolios. That said, a company’s ability to smoothly integrate all of these tools into their daily operations is critical to take advantage of all these new capabilities without creating additional process inefficiencies, particularly as their customer base grows.
Scaling up O&M business alongside the industry
These insights about the factors that elevate leading providers of solar operations and maintenance guide how we are developing and scaling our own O&M business. Looking to maximize returns but ease their worries, savvy asset owners and investors scaling up their project portfolio can find value in an O&M provider that offers an owner’s mindset and the willingness and ability to scale with them, but the decision to invest in O&M must be made early in the financial analysis process. Like any other long-term relationship, successful solar O&M partnerships are built on trust, communication and a shared vision of the future.
