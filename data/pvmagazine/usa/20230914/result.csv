The IRA sets two requirements for the domestic content bonus of its tax credits. First, all structural steel in new products must be U.S.-made (the “steel and iron” test). And second, 40% to 55% of the cost of manufactured products in solar, battery, and wind installations – including the labor costs required to make them – must relate to U.S.-made products (the “manufactured product” test).
Treasury guidance
The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance for taxpayers to access new investment tax credits (ITCs) and production tax credits (PTCs) and bonuses.
On May 12, the Treasury published interim guidance which will apply until a final rule is set down. While some aspects of domestic content bonuses remain unclear, the Treasury clarified which parts of solar, battery, and wind systems fall under the manufactured product test and which the steel and iron test.
For example, while modules are unambiguously manufactured products, solar trackers comprise complex machinery with a structural solar project role but are made of steel. The Treasury considers trackers manufactured products but fixed-tilt steel racking is deemed steel and iron.
The Treasury listed the manufactured-product components in crystalline silicon PV modules, which will determine domestic content bonus eligibility under the manufactured product test, but did not list equivalent components for trackers or inverters.
The Treasury also specified that subcomponents – the parts and materials that go into making manufactured-product components – will not be counted in the manufactured-product test. For example, the location a solar cell was manufactured will be considered in the test but the region the wafer subcomponent was made in, will not.
For the manufactured-product test, the Treasury requires a calculation of the direct cost of manufactured-product components. This definition, of “direct cost” is a very specific and limited portion of total costs and the party claiming the IRA tax credit will need to provide accounting of the direct cost for every manufactured-product component.
This is perhaps the most challenging part of the domestic content bonus, as many manufacturers consider direct costs to be confidential and are not prepared to share them with their customers.
The treasury guidance left many questions unanswered. Is aluminum racking considered in the steel and iron test, the manufactured-product test, or not considered at all? What are the manufactured-product components that the treasury will consider for inverters? And finally, will electrical balance-of-system (BoS) components be considered manufactured products? If so, which parts of the electrical BoS will be considered manufactured product and which components?
These questions are likely to be addressed in the final rule the Treasury issued a notice of intent, on May 12, to introduce. In the interim, however, the lack of clarity on these details presents challenges to parties attempting to claim tax credits.
Accessing credit
CEA has run many scenarios to see how a PV project owner could claim an ITC or PTC. For those projects using crystalline silicon modules, by far the most direct way to reach the 40% to 55% threshold is to use a module with a domestic cell, as the cell represents the highest cost of all the manufactured-product components.
This is easier said than done, however. There are, currently, no crystalline silicon PV cell factories in operation in the United States. Several are planned or under construction but it will be more than a year before the first US-made cells roll off the production line. Even when manufacturing does begin, there is far smaller production capacity planned for domestic cell factories than there is for US module fabs.
There are other ways to access the domestic content bonus. One is to use thin-film solar; however, U.S. manufacturer First Solar is sold out for many years ahead, which limits the ability of many buyers to take that route.
Tax-credit-bonus applicants could attempt to reach the domestic content threshold via other materials, such as trackers, inverters, or electrical BoS equipment. This is also very challenging, however. While several of the largest tracker suppliers have ample domestically produced components available, there are very few inverters suitable for utility-scale solar applications which are made in the United States.
Evolving ruleset
Ultimately, there are many hurdles between buyers and the domestic content bonus, under the current rules issued by the Treasury. Beyond the challenge of getting all suppliers of manufactured product to share their direct costs, there is the problem of accessing U.S.-made cells, thin-film modules, or sufficient other domestic components to meet the 40% to 55% threshold.
CEA is looking forward to reviewing the final rules that the Treasury implements for the domestic content bonus. There is broad anticipation that these will address some of the gray areas in the current guidance. There is also the possibility that the Treasury will move away from its “direct-cost” construct.
Either way, CEA will be guiding clients on how to comply with the complexities of the new tax credits to help expand the U.S. solar industry on both the manufacturing and deployment fronts.

IEA-PVPS has published a new guidebook to standardize Technological Innovation System (TIS) analysis across different countries for BIPV.
The TIS approach is used to investigate new technological fields and industries in and beyond the context of sustainability transitions. It seeks to understand the dynamics of an innovation ecosystem surrounding d a specific technology and is often used to identify shortcomings and define recommendations for the design of policies in support of a specific technology.
“This Guide for Technological Innovation System (TIS) Analysis BIPV offers hands-on support on theory and methods for those who want to analyze the innovation system for BIPV in their country,” the organization said. “This document can also be used as a template for a final TIS-analysis report – using the same (sub-)chapters, tables, and graphs.”
The handbook presents the rating of the performance of eight functions of the TIS related to BIPV, on a scale of one to five. The functions mentioned are knowledge development, knowledge dissemination, entrepreneurial experimentation, resource mobilization, development of social capital, legitimation, guidance of the search and market formation.
The authors of the report also provided indicators and assessment questions to better produce a well-argued paper. In addition, the report assists the users with setting country-wide targets for the development of BIPV, and also helps them formulate recommendations for overcoming issues, targeting both policymakers and industry actors.
“For those functions that are not fulfilling the target requirements, guidance is given on how to identify systemic problems that either relate to actors, institutions, interaction between actors, or infrastructural deficits,” the report notes.
The report also offers guidance on how to define BIPV correctly, how to analyze historical and technological information, and how to conduct a structural analysis of the specific target country. In addition, it looks at the available technical and knowledge solutions in the relevant market, from early concept development to a fully mature market.

Sharp has developed new n-type monocrystalline bifacial solar panels based on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cell technology. The NUJC420B double-glass module features 108 half-cut solar cells based on M10 wafers and a 16-busbar design.
The new panels measure 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 20.7 kg. They can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V and an operating temperature between -40 C and 85 C.
The IEC61215- and IEC61730-certified panel also features a power conversion efficiency of 21.51% and an operating temperature coefficient is -0.30% per degree Celsius.
The company offers a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. The 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 85% of the nominal output power.
“The use of round conductors in the 16-busbar system enhances power gain for each cell and reduces vulnerability to microcracks, which improves module reliability,” the manufacturer said. “The half-cell module has three small junction boxes, each equipped with a single bypass diode. This design reduces heat transfer to the cells above, thus increasing module longevity and overall system performance.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/14/strengthening-the-solar-supply-chain/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2023",Strengthening the solar supply chain,"We can’t predict disruptions caused by unexpected events like global pandemics. But we need consistent policies to promote domestic manufacturing and ensure that we have the supply we need to deploy the solar we need.
Legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) can help. Passed just over a year ago, the law is already fueling a domestic manufacturing boom. Since its passage, the IRA has attracted over $100 billion in private investment, with more than 100 new domestic clean energy manufacturing facilities or expansions announced, representing over 155 GW of solar supply chain capacity additions. Of course, announcements don’t guarantee that factories will be built, and those that are built may take years to come online. The good news is that 70% of the factories recently announced plan to be operational by the end of 2024.
This represents significant progress — and we still need much more. All of the factories and expansions that have been announced thus far would not be enough to supply the expected clean-energy boom.
Given the long lead time to build factories and the complexity of the IRA, it could take some time for the law to ease supply chain issues.
In addition to the standard 30% tax credit for solar projects, the IRA offers a 10% adder for domestic content, intended to stimulate U.S. manufacturing. However, it’s currently very challenging to qualify for this adder.
The Treasury Department recently issued guidance for the Domestic Content Adder. While the guidance clearly defines eligibility and how to qualify, it’s also clear that it will be difficult to meet its requirements under current market conditions.
For a project to qualify for the 10% Domestic Content Adder, the components of the project must be manufactured in the U.S. But it’s not enough for, say, the panels to be manufactured here. The components of the panels, as well as of other components of a project, must also be manufactured domestically.
As the following image shows, solar panels are made with a number of components, including cells. Currently, few if any cells are manufactured in the U.S., which means that no panels are 100% U.S.-made.
 

 
Fortunately, the Treasury guidance stipulates that if 40% of the components in a project are manufactured in the U.S., the project will qualify for the Domestic Content Adder (the exception to this is steel or iron, such as that used for solar carport structures, which must be 100% U.S.-made). That percentage will go up in future years, but by then we will presumably have more domestic solar manufacturing.
While a specific component of a project, such as the panels, may not be eligible for the domestic content adder, a combination of components might make the project eligible. The following example shows how this could work — in this hypothetical example, 40% of the components of the products used for the project are made in the U.S.

As is clear from this example, the Treasury guidance for this adder is complex and will make it challenging for projects to qualify today. However, this is just initial guidance; the actual regulations are still forthcoming and expected by the end of the year. It is further expected that the regulations will include additional changes. Hopefully these revisions will give the solar industry more flexibility and time to build up domestic manufacturing. Already, the new guidance has resulted in announcements of solar cell manufacturing, but it will take time for that production to come online.
Local manufacturing
Most of the solar panel factory announcements to date have been for very large factories that tend to be concentrated in a few states, like Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. These gigafactories benefit from economies of scale but don’t address issues of equity.
Another model, which is emerging in various locations across the U.S., is to deploy more distributed factories at a smaller scale — with a capacity of 40 to 60 MW rather than 500 MW. Factories like these provide good local jobs and other economic stimulation for communities, as well as easier access to supplies for local solar installers. They can also provide education about clean energy to community members and schools.
One company working at this scale is Crossroads Solar, a solar panel manufacturer in South Bend, Indiana, that employs justice-involved individuals (formerly incarcerated) who are reintegrating into society. Instead of taxpayers paying for people to be incarcerated, Crossroads employees are now contributing members of society who pay taxes and spend the money they earn in their communities. They are also extremely dedicated, engaged employees who give Crossroads Solar a competitive advantage with high productivity, strong commitment, and dedication to the company’s mission.
Now that Crossroads has created a successful micro-factory model for domestic solar manufacturing, the company is interested in replicating their model. This could include expanding beyond employing justice-involved individuals to include neurodiverse talent (such as individuals with autism), communities on Tribal lands, and others with barriers to employment. The Crossroads model provides a blueprint for domestic manufacturing that incorporates worker equity and workforce development opportunities. Replicating this model in communities across the U.S. would promote environmental equity and justice while strengthening local solar supply chains. Another benefit of these factories is that they can be deployed more quickly and cost-effectively than the gigafactories now being announced.
In solar, we often talk about distributed generation: smaller solar installations located in communities, near where people live and work, which provide local environmental and economic benefits. Large, remote power plants, though they also have their place, can’t provide these benefits and require many miles of expensive transmission lines. Distributed solar factories are similar in that they provide communities with benefits that larger, remote factories can’t provide.
Distributed manufacturing can also go a long way toward strengthening solar supply chains. The time is right to expand this successful model across the U.S.
