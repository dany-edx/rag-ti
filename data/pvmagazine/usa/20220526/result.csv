The letter takes direct issue with previous instances of political and industry leaders calling for the Department of Commerce to swiftly end its investigation, referring to these petitions as “well-funded, overwhelming special interest political pressure seeking to undermine an independent, quasi-judicial investigation.” The letter also alleges that such petitions are being pursued to undermine the integrity of trade enforcement laws and the independence of the federal workforce.
The letter also suggests foul play, with regard to influencing public opinion, within the solar industry, saying that it is “troubling that corporate lobbying against a simple investigation would reach this level of mass hysteria if there was not some concern over what career civil servants at DOC may uncover.” The letter calls out the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) by name as the party spearheading a campaign “advertising and lobbying to urge political interference in the trade enforcement process.”
A matter of security
Outside of a baseline support for the health of the US solar manufacturing industry, the letter also raises concerns around national cybersecurity in an environment where China dominates module supply.
Solar energy is vulnerable to cyberattack through solar photovoltaic inverters and microchips or microcontrollers embedded into a module’s junction box, which can be programmed. These smart modules look virtually identical to a traditional photovoltaic module. By relying on Chinese-made solar panels, we jeopardize America’s energy security well beyond this administration.
The issue of Chinese cyber attacks via solar inverters is one that comes up frequently in conversations of national security, and one where money is already being directed to mitigate the threat. Alan Mantooth and his team at the University of Arkansas’ National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission have been given $3.6 million in grant money from the US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office to develop sophisticated yet low-cost tools to protect the power electronics housed within inverters.
“Inverters represent a vulnerability in the sense that we have to communicate with them,” Mantooth told pv magazine in a 2021 interview. The point of contact that enables that two-way communications to occur also means “the grid is vulnerable” to a potential attack.
Inverters are essentially Internet of Things devices that share their electronics DNA with devices like smart thermostats, TVs, and refrigerators. Mantooth looks at the problem of hardening a solar inverter against a cyber intruder as involving both hardware and software. If no one inserts a hardware trojan horse, then the device can be considered protected, he said.
Software presents a different case. Here, he and his research team assume that a bad actor can access the software that operates an inverter’s power electronics and can manipulate the software to cause harm.
Inverter functionality is addressed under the IEEE 1547 standard, which was revised in 2018 and is currently being rolled out in a range of regulatory rules that cover grid interconnection. Underwriters Laboratories also modified its inverter certification and standard to require voltage ride-through, frequency ride-through, anti-islanding, volt-var, and frequency-watt functionalities, all aimed at improving grid resiliency.
Import freeze fakeout 
The letter also alleges that the freeze on solar module imports that the US has experienced since the beginning of the investigation is “a conscious choice by Chinese manufacturers to temporarily constrain supply on the American market to exert more political pressure on this administration.”
If anything, there seems to be a deliberate exploitative use of this investigation as an excuse to break American contracts and divert product to the European Union, where prices for solar products have skyrocketed in recent months due to the war in Ukraine.
Due to the investigation and freeze on solar module imports, SEIA has lowered its solar installation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 by 46%. SEIA has predicted that the case will result in a drop of 24 GW of planned solar capacity over the next two years, which is more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021.
SEIA’s survey, with over 700 responses current to April 26, 83% of respondents that purchase or use modules reported cancellations or delays in their module supply agreements. 13 states had 100% of respondents share that they were experiencing delayed or canceled module supply. Responses have outlined to SEIA that a total of 318 utility scale projects accounting for 51 GW of solar capacity and 6 GWh of attached battery storage are being cancelled or delayed. What’s more is that a large percentage of delayed projects could move into the realm of cancelation, as developers don’t know when they might be able to get modules and som delays may drag on to the point of project failure.
Vocal minority
Today’s letter stands alone as the most visible and vocal support for a continued investigation. On May 3, 22 US Senators composed a letter, sent to President Biden, urging the president to review the investigation “swiftly” and make an expedited preliminary decision, one that they hope will consider “the significant policy ramifications on American businesses, workers, and ratepayers.” Signers of the letter include Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Tim Kaine (D-VA).
Just over two weeks later, on May 19, 85 members of the House of Representatives signed a petition to President Biden expressing “grave concern for the economic and environmental impacts” of the inquiry.
The petition reads: 
A recently released survey of over 700 solar companies found that 83% of respondents were experiencing delays or cancelations from their CSPV suppliers. A project-level survey found that more than 50 gigawatts of new solar projects are currently canceled or delayed because of the Commerce inquiry. Modeling suggests that these cancellations and delays could cost the industry more than 100,000 jobs and increase CO2 emissions by an additional 364 million metric tons of CO2 between now and 2035, which is the equivalent emissions of 97 coal-fired power plants.
The petition continued that the signees are strong supporters of the domestic solar manufacturing sector, but that this inquiry would not benefit the industry, outside a few select firms. It noted that the majority of US solar manufacturing jobs are involved not in creating modules, but in producing mounting, racking, trackers, and other balance of system components, so the probe does little help to boost existing US companies.
The petitioners suggested that instead conducting of this investigation, which likely won’t meaningfully benefit domestic manufacturing, enacting legislation like the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act and a long-term extension of the solar investment tax credit would pave the way for a US supply chain.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/26/duke-energy-nort-carolina-solar-installers-compromise-on-net-metering/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 26, 2022","Duke Energy, North Carolina solar installers compromise on net metering","Duke Energy and a collective of some of the largest rooftop solar installers in North Carolina have officially come to terms on a modified version of Duke Energy’s Solar Choice Net Metering proposal, one which pushes the utility’s proposed time-of-use rates for net metering customers down the road until at least 2026.
The settlement agreement now means that this finalized version of Duke Energy’s Solar Choice Net Metering proposal, which was originally filed on November 29, 2021, will now go before the North Carolina Utilities Commission for final approval. Once approved, the new net metering tariffs, known as the ‘Proposed Bridge Rate’ will go into effect for customers submitting applications through December 31, 2026, subject to annual capacity caps. Customers who choose to enter a residential solar installation into the Proposed Bridge Rate may do so for up to 15 years, subject to certain limitations.
The settlement also includes a provision under which it can be discontinued if state regulators approve a package of incentives equivalent to at least 60 cents per watt. According to Duke, the Proposed Bridge Rate will allow the company more time to develop said incentive package.
“Duke Energy knows that customer-sited solar is an important part of the future growth of solar in North Carolina,” said Lon Huber, Duke Energy’s senior vice president of pricing and customer solutions. “We believe this phased-in compromise will help the installer industry navigate market changes and adapt to the long-term rate design of Solar Choice.”
The delaying of time-of-use rates for net metering customers, with different net metering rates for peak periods (times when projected electricity demand, and, as a result, costs, are high) and discount periods (times when projected electricity demand, and, as a result, costs, are lower), has been promoted as the big win of the compromise. In practice, the initial proposal would lower net metering rates from between $0.05 and $0.20 per kWh, as it stands today, to around $0.03/kWh. The reason for such a large variance in current rates is that the full retail rate is based on time of use and critical-peak pricing, which fluctuates, depending on the time of day and time of year.
The compromise is a timely one, as the state’s current rebate program is set to expire at the end of the year, even though North Carolina is only required to revisit the current net metering structure some time before 2027. The potential of a five-year gap in net metering policy served to create an environment of urgency for clean-energy focused groups hoping to avoid the industry-harming effects that even a couple of weeks of incentive uncertainty can have on the residential solar market.
The compromise was initially triggered by the intervention of Sundance Power Systems and other North Carolina residential solar installers, all of whom objected to the proposed time-of-use rates. These same groups have said that they will support the incentives being developed by Duke, so long as the incentive package includes the consideration of customer-generated renewable energy that is consumed on site as a demand-side energy resource.
While the compromised proposal has brought on board three of the state’s largest solar installers and previous versions already garnered the support of a coterie of clean energy advocates, including the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, the Solar Energy Industries Association, and the Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of Vote Solar and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, there are still voices in the state’s energy landscape that see the compromise as too favorable to Duke.
Among these voices is NC WARN, a group that represents the interests of and public opposition to Duke by more than 70 solar companies and pro-solar nonprofits, says that, because the compromise came without a cost-benefit analysis regarding the net benefit that higher penetration of residential solar systems brings to non-solar customers (the inverse of the infamous utility cost-shift argument), the proposal is incomplete and still harmful to solar customers.
“After months of public and legal pressure, Duke Energy was forced to seek a compromise,” said NC WARN Executive Director, Jim Warren. “If approved, however, the new proposal would still be a step backward for the solar industry and leave Duke executives trying to lock in a high-carbon, climate-wrecking future, even as the North Carolina Utilities Commission faces a year-end deadline to plan for drastic cuts in emissions. Only in the alternate universe inhabited by utility executives can carbon reduction efforts be achieved while limiting solar power and massively expanding the use of methane gas. We understand that our solar company allies felt the need to compromise with Duke Energy in order to protect their businesses in the near term. Duke has long threatened that if its original settlement with other parties was not adopted, it would force through even worse changes to net metering.”

There were also inverters, racking, cabling, monitoring, engineering, finance, media, and an abundance of other products and services that are vital to the industry. As we close our Intersolar 2022 Munch coverage, keep in mind that these vendors represent only a fraction of the industry.
Jurchen’s PEG’s high density racking system was on display, and it was as understated as it is cost effective.

While we didn’t get a chance to talk to the folks running the booth, seeing these products at the show was a good reminder that we at pv magazine USA would like to write a piece highlighting the product’s ability to resist wind speeds up to 185 miles per hour. Jurchen has been emphasizing this engineering feat in recent publications as it develops projects in high risk, higher wind regions.
For almost the exact opposite reason that we are drawn to the PEG system’s efficient material usage, we were drawn to single axis tracker racking manufacturer Ideematic – it’s a big, chunky, solid piece of metal.

Ideematic has recently begun deploying hardware into the US market.
Solid cables just look cool, and this cross section cut really catches the eye. With costs of everything increasing rapidly, seeing these cables in person felt more like looking at gold and silver rather than ‘non precious’ metals.
Top Cable (shown at top) said they’ve designed their solar cable line to be able to withstand the elements for decades on end. The product comes with a 30-year warranty that includes UV protection and general abrasion protection from movement that might occur outdoors. Customers can also request products that are rodent and critter resistant.
While they might not be as visually appealing as solar panels or moving single axis trackers, the inside of inverters and transformers are always packed with interesting looking gear. The manufacturer, Europower Enerji, showed off their transformers and other power grid voltage hardware.

Due to an ingrained fear of high voltages, and the knowledge that certain components retain power long after they are shut down, some attendees hesitated to approach this unit, which was in no way connected to the power grid.
This author cut his teeth in the South Florida solar thermal market, so it was nice to still see some solar hot water systems on the floor. And on a call with a customer just yesterday, there was a request for a solar thermal system to help lower gas usage in a condominium structure.

Amusingly, when I asked the representative about the volume of water this unit holds, I was told that SolarInox doesn’t make this unit, and that it was fake. SolarInox was there marketing their special films that absorb and move the heat energy, as well as many other products to serve the solar industry.
And with that, I left Munich and began my journey by FlixBus back to Amsterdam for some coffee and a walk, followed by a plane ride to the United States. As the sun set, the solar farms lining the highways began to shut down, while off in the distance, wind farms continued spinning.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/26/trackers-vs-the-elements-part-two-working-with-wind/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 26, 2022","Trackers vs. the elements, part two: working with wind","As was highlighted briefly in the first entry in this series, high wind speeds, especially since the advent and subsequent adoption of large-format modules, are one of the critical variable factors limiting the overall impact that trackers can have on the solar industry.
High wind can mean sustained gusts over the course of hours – known as static wind loads – or short bursts of incredibly high-speed wind – known as  dynamic wind loads. Both can be part of development considerations, and you will seldom find a site that is subject to one but not the other.
Unbending resolve
In March, FTC Solar co-authored a whitepaper with wind engineering experts RWDI and structural engineering firm Engineered Power Solutions (EPS) to highlight how the zero-degree wind stow position and proprietary dampening technology used in FTC’s Voyager SAT alleviates the effects of static and dynamic wind loading, preventing catastrophic failure and revenue loss.
Traditionally, dynamic and static load consideration has been tackled by using modest amounts of damping to raise the natural frequency that the unit can sustain above the level excited significantly by the wind by stiffening the structure known as underdamping, and to stow at a higher angles, typically 30 degrees. In an underdamped system adding more damping beyond a certain point does not have much impact on stability and the authors state that conventional wisdom has been that only a combination of stiffer structure and stowing at higher angles along with modest damping will ensure stability.
The paper found that much larger amounts of damping, overdamping, than traditionally considered create an unexpected result. This amount of damping essentially makes it impossible for practical tracker designs to become unstable even when stowed flat.
While extra damping measures increase overall structural stability, stowing modules in a flat or horizontal position during a wind event has the advantage of reducing normal static wind loads. With the solar panels held flat, the lateral forces acting on the foundation are much smaller than if that panel were vertical or at an angle tilted toward the wind. This means less force on the system overall and it substantially reduces the loads on the modules.
In a similar vein, another industry stalwart, Arctech Solar, released a new white paper outlining the opportunities presented by stowing modules at a zero-degree angle in high-wind scenarios, a solution made possible by the advent of rigid trackers, like the company’s SkyLine II 1P Tracker, developed to be rigid enough for zero-degree stowing in instances of high wind.
In the white paper, Arctech claims that a zero-degree stow angle enable projects to expand geographically into higher-intensity wind zones while preventing energy losses that would be incurred by other stow strategies and increasing energy generation and revenue a “considerable” extent.
In order to remain structurally stable during a high wind event, traditional trackers needs to be stowed at a steep tilt angle, with the tracker nose down and the front panel surface facing the wind. The wind speed threshold that triggers this reaction is called the wind stow speed, and that trigger speed has to be lower than the known point of speed where structural damage and potential for catastrophic loss is initiated.
With the onset of LFMs, trackers got longer and wider, lowering rigidity and bringing the critical wind speeds down for all tilts. As a result wind stow thresholds declined to near 12 meters per second, a relatively common speed. If trackers are forced into stow functions at such a relatively common wind speed, modules will have less tracking time, meaning less energy will be generated and levelized cost of electricity, a critical metric for the financial viability of solar projects, will be raised. For SkyLine II and any similarly-constructed rigid tracker, the the critical wind speed sits at 22 m/s, nearly doubling the parameters for wind a project can operate under.

In testing, Arctech found that its rigid tracker, stowed at zero degrees, spent just 15 hours, 0.17% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing 204 MWh in that time, roughly 0.09% of projected generation, for a financial loss of just over $5,700. A traditional tracker with a wind threshold of 16m/s and a 30-degree stow angle spent 243 hours, 2.77% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing 1,711MWh in that time, roughly 0.77% of projected generation, for a financial loss of almost $48,000. A hypothetical worst-case scenario with a wind threshold of 12m/s and a 45-degree stow angle spent 1,288 hours, 14.7% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing nearly 9,300MWh in that time, roughly 4.17% of projected generation, for a financial loss of over $260,000.
Tailored solutions
Like terrain, Terrasmart sees the issue of wind load as another issue that is more than just black and white, again choosing to tackle the variable with a project dependent, site specific approach.
“I think it all comes back down to these core driving metrics for any one person or any one site, and certain people will prioritize certain things over another,” explained Dean Vukovic, the General Manager of Terrasmart’s ground mount division. “For us, with this technology and platform agnostic approach, whatever those core drivers are, we can work with you, and rapidly model out ‘Okay, here’s option B, if we prioritize low O&M costs, or option C with an extreme weather event that has a certain preference to one technology over the other.’ We can quickly model that, understand what the annual power production looks like, and then have option B and Option C, side-by-side and see what our overall impact is with various scenarios. That’s where we work on the upfront design engineering process one on one with the customer.”
Developing a system to be wind-resistant is only half the battle, however. Everybody has a plan to mitigate the wind until it starts whipping up. As Vukovic explains it, the issue is as much one of monitoring and upkeep once a project is live as it is one of modeling during development.
“We can design a system to meet whatever specific requirements are afoot,” he said. And the controls can factor into that if there’s a particular site that is experiencing some strange weather phenomenon. The software itself can be dialed to make the system operate slightly differently for certain periods of time. Maybe, during hurricane season, there’s a system down in the Carolinas that’s really proactive, and they want to throttle everything back to make sure that everything is good. We can do that over the air update pretty rapidly.”
Wind, like uneven land, is another area where Vukovic admits that using tracker may not always be the optimal solution. Because of Terrasmart’s variable mounting solutions and seemingly endless potential development scenarios enables by the company’s project modeling software, there are plenty of scenarios where racking makes the most sense.
If you’re in an area like Florida, where you have to achieve stability in 140 mile per hour wind speeds, modeling can show that fixed-tilt racking might be the better solution there. The system may lose a little bit of generation on the average day, in terms of not tracking the sun, but won’t lose on the non-average day, where 140 mile an hour winds are ripping through.
It all comes back down to these core driving metrics for any one person for any for any one site,” said Vukovic. “Certain people will prioritize certain things over another. For this technology- and platform-agnostic approach, that’s okay. Whatever those core drivers are, we can work with you and absorb those”

Expected to come online as early as the first half of 2023, Qcells’ total production capacity in the United States will exceed 3 GW, or approximately one-third of the current US solar module production capacity.
“Our additional investment in Dalton will help Qcells better serve the needs of U.S. customers with increased local manufacturing capacity,” said Justin Lee, Qcells CEO. “Georgia has become the clean energy manufacturing heart of America, and we are proud to contribute to the state’s advanced manufacturing economy.”
The new facility will produce 1.4 GW of TOPCon solar modules per year, a high-efficiency tunnel oxide passivated contact technology.
“We are excited to see Qcells continue to expand in Georgia. The state of Georgia and Korea have enjoyed an outstanding partnership for decades, supported by a dedication to relationship building. We have been focused on bringing jobs and opportunities to hardworking Georgians across the state,” said Brian Kemp, Governor of Georgia.
Qcells’ expansion in Dalton is expected to bring 470 new jobs to Whitfield County, and with more than 750 staff employed at the existing factory, total local employees will exceed 1,000 when the expansion is complete. Groundbreaking is planned for fall 2022.
“I appreciate Qcells’ sustained and growing investment in Georgia and the working relationship we’ve built to create more jobs and opportunities for Georgians. I will continue working to make Georgia a world leader in renewable energy innovation and manufacturing,” said Senator Jon Ossoff.
In March, Hanwha Solutions, parent corporation of Qcells, announced that it was stepping up efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products when it became the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, a major US manufacturer of polysilicon. Following its initial $160 million acquisition to acquire a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha announced that it was acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons in a deal valued at around $44 million. This investment will help American manufacturers secure the raw material critical to the solar supply chain.
Hanwha’s US initiative supports the Biden administration’s efforts to increase solar power generation by 40% and to decarbonize all electricity by 2035. Hanwha sees the enactment of the Solar Energy Manufacturing Act (SEMA) as critical to a US-based solar supply chain. While Hanwha had stated that it would “…implement a multi-phase, multi-billion-dollar expansion across the full solar energy supply chain” once SEMA was passed, the expansion has begun.

US-owned Wood Mackenzie issued a note this week which also estimated China will add 75 GW of the 110 GW of new solar to arrive in the Asia-Pacific region in 2022.
The world will pass a terrawatt of solar generation capacity this year, the Edinburgh-based company added, and North America will see its share of the world’s new solar capacity double from the 11% recorded last year.
How much?
It was not clear from the note whether the project capital cost rise predicted would apply solely to the US.
The analyst said it had observed a “substantial amount of [solar] module volumes for utility scale projects” postponed after Californian manufacturer Auxin Solar in February lodged an anti-circumvention petition to the authorities.
Auxin has claimed Chinese companies are manufacturing products on home soil and only putting the final touches to them in Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia before labeling them as made in the latter-named nations to get around US anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
An anti-circumvention investigation is under way and Wood Mackenzie said the development is also prompting some manufacturers to shift “importer of record” responsibility onto panel buyers.
Germany will lead the European push for solar this decade, Wood Mackenzie predicted, because of a new governing coalition and the nation’s dependence on Russian gas.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means the Russia and Caspian Sea regions will add no new solar capacity this year, the analyst said.
Solar manufacturing
Rising solar costs will be partially offset by plans to add, this year, production lines sufficient to produce an extra 200,000 metric tons of polysilicon per year, plus 1 GW more cells, 1 GW more wafers, and 500 MW more modules.
The analyst noted moves by India this year to tax solar imports and bolster domestic production would also “shift the pricing and supply dynamics in the US and India.”

While battery owners from utility scale down to homeowners provide needed power to the grid in many places around the world, Texas is not one of them. Tesla hopes to change that, and recently filed a request for a rule change (OBDRR) with the Electric Council of Texas (ERCOT) that would clear the way for utilities to bid on capacity stored in batteries.
Tesla would like to operate the distributed energy assets generated in its Powerwall batteries as a virtual power plant, and it is to that end that the company has launched a virtual power plant demonstration project. The company ran a similar virtual power plant (VPP) project last summer in California. In the Texas demonstration, Tesla plans to prove to ERCOT that a Powerwall fleet can provide these services in Texas by setting up a Virtual Power Plant comprised of volunteer Powerwall owners.
By opting in to the Tesla ERCOT Demonstration, Powerwalls will be used in tests and demonstrations with the Texas utility to establish the capabilities of the Powerwall fleet. What’s in it for those Powerwall customers that participate in at least 80% of the tests is a $40 Tesla gift card, and they also may gain the satisfaction of participating in something larger than meeting their own energy storage needs. They may prove to ERCOT that a band of Powerwalls has benefits.
In the demonstration project Tesla will control the participants’ Powerwalls including charging, discharging and configuring the device to automatically respond to grid conditions, and to support tests that demonstrate grid services. In the agreement Tesla promises to not draw the battery below 20% of its capacity, so that the Powerwall can be used for backup. Except for this limitation, Tesla may charge or discharge the Powerwalls at any time and to any extent.
The caveats in the agreement include that the total liability for any kind of damages will not exceed $500; that participants are encouraged to consult a tax professional regarding any potential impact on the Investment Tax Credit that the customer may have claimed on their Powerwall; the customer acknowledges that their Powerwall may have a reduced charge; and in the event of a power outage during the project, Tesla is not liable for any loss of power that the customer may experience.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/26/the-making-of-a-clean-energy-prosumer-part-one/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 26, 2022",The making of a clean energy prosumer: Part one,"This article series describes my journey from a standard consumer to a prosumer and from owning a gasoline-powered vehicle to owning an electric vehicle (EV). I was led to making these two decisions to lower my ever-rising electric and gasoline bills, to enhance the resilience of my house to power outages, and to promote clean air. The report includes economic analysis behind the decisions, explains what it took to implement them, and provides the results during the time that has elapsed since I became a prosumer and EV driver.
Introduction
My career as an energy economist ran from 1978 to 2021 and focused on enhancing the energy efficiency of consumption. During this time, I was fortunate to work utilities, regulators and stakeholders on all six continents.
I had entered the field as a graduate student at the California Energy Commission. The focus of my work there was on forecasting the demand for energy in California’s industrial sector. Then I moved to EPRI. There, I worked on a variety of topics, including demand forecasting, rate design, demand-side management, electrification, and retail choice. Later, I worked with several consulting firms on these topics and dug deep into the design of dynamic pricing experiments.
During all these years, I was also a consumer of energy. In the late eighties, we switched houses. The new house had an extra bedroom and bathroom and larger by 600 square feet. Our energy bills rose. A few years later, I switched to time-of-use (TOU) rates for electricity to lower my bills. I had to pay an extra four dollars a month for an interval meter but it was worth it.
In the late 2000’s, a digital smart meter was installed at my house. I remained on TOU rates. But my electric and gas bills kept on rising. In 2015, two of my monthly bills hit $500. That was a tipping point for me. I began to investigate alternatives for enhancing the energy efficiency of my house.
In 2016, I made a significant investment in energy efficiency and participated in the local utility’s whole house energy upgrade program.
The bills, as discussed later in this chapter, went down by about 20% but were still above $200 a month. So, in 2019, I have made another significant investment: I installed photovoltaic (PV) panels on my roof and paired them with a stationary battery. I also traded in my gasoline-powered car for an electric vehicle (EV).
The lure of energy efficiency
In 2015, my electric and gas bills hit the $500 mark twice, first in the summer and then again in the winter. That pushed me over the edge. We were empty nesters living in a four-bedroom two-story house. After exploring several options, we invested a good sum of money in the local utility’s home energy upgrade program. The process was pretty smooth. We contacted an independent expert at the utility-funded program who reviewed our choices with us and then directed us several contractors who did such work. We hired one of these who specialized in equipment made by Carrier.
This involved replacing the SEER 11 air conditioner with a SEER 18, the 80% efficient gas furnace with a 97% efficient gas furnace, adding attic insulation and sealing the ductwork so the leakage went down from 56% to 8%. We did consider installing a heat pump but it was not cost effective given the electric rates. The contractor told us that they were only being installed in homes with solar panels.
Then came the hard part. Estimating how much the bills had gone down, on a weather normalized basis. A friend helped me do the necessary econometric work using bills going back to 2003. The result: 19%. That yielded a very long payback approaching 20 years.
I wrote a long paper for a trade journal about our experience while my wife and I published an op-ed in the LA Times. And, of course, we shared our news with many friends and neighbors. A few said we should have gone with solar. And one said we should have done both. But that was going to be a huge investment. And I was keen on doing energy efficiency first, believing the cleanest kWh is the one that is not generate.
With all the energy efficiency investment, my average monthly electric bill went down from $250 a month to $205 a month. That was still a lot higher than I wanted it to be.
So, in July 2019 I decided to go solar. The system is designed to make me self-sufficient on a net basis with the 8-kW system (comprised of 25 panels rated at 320 watts each) with a payback of 7 years. The utility’s website was quite helpful in estimating system size and savings.
Investing in a battery storage system
I also went ahead and ordered a 9.8 kW battery to make my prosumer experience more fulfilling. That turned me into a prosumer. The combined payback period for solar plus storage is 9 years but the battery does provide enhanced reliability and it has come in really handy during the five power outages I have had in the past nine months. It powers five essential circuits inside the house, including the refrigerators and freezers, lights, and the internet router.
