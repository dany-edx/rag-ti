Pivot Energy will install nine rooftop solar arrays on Extra Space Storage facilities, adding new clean energy capacity across a commercial building portfolio producing about 20 million kWh of renewable energy per year, the equivalent of powering 2,500 homes.
To date Pivot Energy has developed 150 solar systems in 12 states along the East Coast,  California and Colorado for Extra Space since the companies first formed a partnership in 2018.
“Solar has helped Extra Space Storage realize significant cost savings, but more importantly, it’s the right thing to do,” said Steve Potter, project manager at Extra Space Storage. “Working with a certified B-Corp such as Pivot Energy has been crucial to pursuing our own ESG goals.
In addition to Pivot, Extra Space has partnered with Safari Energy, Solar Landscape and Core Development Group to deploy solar systems around the country. Its most recent deployment with Solar Landscape in Neptune, N.J., provides additional capacity to up to 700 low-and-moderate income residents under a local community solar program.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association’s “Solar Means Business 2022 Report,” Extra Space Storage was ranked the 14th largest corporate user of solar energy by total number of system installations, with 67 solar installations deployed on buildings to date.
Extra Space’s solar investment strategy was to first add PV systems in markets with the greatest tax incentives for installations, such as New Jersey and the Northeast. Then the company sought expansion into areas where electric costs are high, such as Hawaii.
According to an Extra Space blog post, the company’s solar process takes three to five months and follows a 10-step process:
Based in Salt Lake City, Extra Space Storage is an integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust. As of June 30, 2018, the company owned and/or operated 1,568 self-storage properties with over 1 million units across 119 million square feet of storage space.
According to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority’s distributed energy resource database, a sample 126 kW Extra Space rooftop solar system in Gowanus, Brooklyn generated 1,057 MWh of electricity over a seven-year capacity study from October 2013 to November 2020.  The study found the facility’s capacity factor of 13.4% ranked third in utility Con Edison’s Zone J region of New York City, with solar facilities owned by Big Geyser Inc. and Marjam ranking higher with a 13.6% capacity factor.

The project will be located less than 100 miles from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and easily accessible to highways and railroads.
Element Resources expects to produce 20,000 tons of renewable hydrogen annually through its first phase, which is one of the largest green hydrogen projects in the state. This facility will also be one of the anchor projects in the City of Lancaster’s Eastside Overlay, which will be the site of the city’s clean energy portfolio.
Commercial operation is expected to begin in early 2025. The facility will use dedicated solar to power Element’s electrolyzers to produce zero-emission, renewable hydrogen. The project will create about 250 jobs during the construction phase, and 36 permanent jobs.
“The City of Lancaster is excited to expand our partnership with Element Resources on the largest renewable green hydrogen production project in the U.S.,” said R. Rex Parris, Mayor of the City of Lancaster. “Lancaster is building a robust hydrogen production capacity to enable regional decarbonization. We believe municipalities can lead the fight against climate change from the bottom up by unleashing businesses’ innovative capacities by removing barriers to market.”
The Lancaster Clean Energy Center will serve southern California markets and beyond.

“The opportunity with the City of Lancaster is nothing less than a World Class Green Energy Center serving the Western United States and perhaps reaching into Asian Markets as well,” said Steve Meheen, CEO of Element Resources.
The increased hydrogen production capacity will serve the growing demand for clean mobility fuels as well as clean energy for manufacturing. Produced with net-zero carbon emissions, clean hydrogen such as that produced at the Lancaster Clean Energy Center, will be key in the emerging clean energy economy and will help toward achieving the President’s goal of a 100% clean electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Element Resources Inc. is a Houston-based development company focused on production of green hydrogen. Element also selectively invests in hydrogen-related technologies that enable production of zero carbon fuel, and it holds patents for large capacity, low-cost underground hydrogen storage, and advanced, lower-cost hydrogen electrolyzer catalysts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/24/solar-property-insurance-product-launched-by-kwh-analytics/,"INSURANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 24, 2023",Solar property insurance product launched by kWh Analytics,"kWh Analytics, an insurance provider for zero carbon assets,  announced the launch of a property insurance product in partnership with Aspen Insurance. The offering covers physical damage to solar and other renewable energy assets.
A spokesperson for kWh Analytics told pv magazine USA that the product is expected to be primarily used for utility-scale solar assets. The company has a database of over 300,000 operational renewable energy assets informing its property risk assessment capabilities. kWh Analytics has insured over $4 billion in assets to date.
“The shift to a decarbonized economy is the largest macroeconomic revolution of our generation, and insurance will play a critical role in securing its future,” said Jason Kaminsky, chief executive officer of kWh Analytics.
Asset owners have suffered from reduced limits and substantial cost increases in recent years, presenting a need for new solutions to managing and underwriting risk. The new product is aimed at mitigating the risks in a changing market and intensifying climate, enabling financing for new projects.
The property insurance offering joins the company’s solar revenue put production insurance, which protects against downside risk and helps unlock improved financing terms.
In addition to its underwriting services, kWh Analytics leverages its data to develop resilient design practices. Through the evaluation of operational data, the company identifies the most relevant failures in PV asset operations. The findings are incorporated with the new property insurance underwriting and will be distributed to the company’s clients and broadly to manufacturers, operators, carrier partners, and investors to reinforce the further development of sustainable solar projects.
“[The energy transition] requires a new approach to pricing, managing, and ultimately mitigating the new risks of the clean energy asset class, kWh Analytics is committed to underwriting products that enable the financing of renewable assets,” said Kaminski.
Aspen Insurance commended kWh Analytics’ data-driven approach to underwriting. For the year ended 2021, Aspen reported $13.8 billion in total assets, $7.6 billion in gross reserves, $2.8 billion in total shareholders’ equity and $3.9 billion in gross written premiums.
Asset data
Last month, kWh Analytics shared findings from its operational asset database in a solar generation index report. The study found broad underperformance in the field when compared to forward-looking performance estimates.
On average, projects constructed after 2015 have generated 7% to 13% less electricity than P50 production estimates. P50 means there is a 50% chance in any given year that production will be at least a specific amount. If an array has a P50 production level of 500 kWh, it means that on any given year there is a 50% chance that production will be at least 500 kWh.
The report concluded that as the gap between actual and expected generation grows, underperformance risk jeopardizes investor returns and the industry’s ability to achieve sustainable growth.
The underperformance trend is a nationwide phenomenon, said kWh Analytics. Under 10 years of operational data, average lifetime performance ranged from 5% to 10% below initial P50 estimates across seven major US regions. The report also evaluated system performance based on project capacities and mount types and found no underperformance trends isolated to any specific group of projects.
Formed in 2012, kWh Analytics is based in San Francisco and has raised $26.8 million in equity to date. Its most recent raise in February 2022 brought in $20 million in Series B funding from Lacuna Sustainable Investments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/24/wyoming-laws-seek-to-kill-net-metering-and-evs/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,WYOMING",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 24, 2023",Wyoming laws seek to kill net metering and EVs,"Legislators in the State of Wyoming have introduced two laws against clean energy, with a stated purpose to protect the state’s fossil fuel based revenue.
The first law, SJ0004, lists reasons to avoid the “misadventure of electric vehicles”. For example, one passage notes that the “vast stretches of highway, coupled with a lack of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, make the widespread use of electric vehicles impracticable for the state.” The legislation also claims that EV batteries are not easily recycled, and would require the development of new waste management techniques. Additionally, the document states that the vehicles contained limited “critical minerals” (rare earths) that put the nation at risk.
Interestingly, coal deposits, which Wyoming has in abundance, are often rich in rare earth deposits. The state has known about its rare earth resources since the middle of the 1900s, but they remain undeveloped.
SJ0004 states a “goal” of phasing out the sale of new EVs by 2035 in Wyoming. The legislators continued nursing their grievances in the final words of the bill, adding a requirement for a copy of the bill to be sent to the Governor of California. (The governor recently announced that California will phase out gasoline-powered cars by 2035).
The second law, SF0092, has a stated purpose to kill off net metering. The proposed legislation first renames “net metering” customers as “small generators”. This appears to be an attempt to reclassify behind the meter rooftop solar power owners as power plant owners; thus opening them up to a new raft of potential regulations and costs. The law specifically notes that these parties are not “public utilities”.
The law states that Wyoming will develop a new set of regulations to compensate these small generators by April of 2024, and that they will be structured so as to “prevent rate subsidization of customer‑generators by other customers of an electric utility.”
The state has a history of introducing problematic laws in reaction to clean energy.
For instance, in 2021 the state enacted HB0207, which set aside $1.2 million of taxpayer funds “for litigation to challenge laws or other actions that impede the export of Wyoming coal or the continued operation of Wyoming’s coal-fired electric generation facilities, including early retirements of those facilities”.
A few months later, Wyoming was denied a chance by the Supreme Court of the United States to override the State of Washington’s permit denial for a coal export facility in 2017. Wyoming lawyers argued that Washington State was limiting the landlocked state’s ability to practice interstate commerce.

The mobile EV charging system called Currently Fleet contains lithium ion batteries, operating independently from the grid. It’s designed as a fleet services solution and is part of the company’s Charging as a Service (CaaS) lineup.
Sparked by incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, more businesses are planning to electrify their fleets, and SparkCharge offers fleet owners and operators what the company calls turnkey service. Fleet owners don’t have to install fixed charging infrastructure, because Currently Fleet is mobile and battery powered, thus eliminating the need to connect to the grid.
To use Currently Fleet, owners and operators who use the service can log into the Currently portal, enter their address, select the vehicles that need to be charged, and select a date and time for the vehicles to be charged. Currently Fleet is a concierge service, and it will come to the vehicle that needs to be charged at the scheduled time.
Currently Fleet debuted at CES in Las Vegas earlier this month. SparkCharge’s mobile CaaS for fleets is currently available in Los Angeles, Calif.; San Diego, Calif.; San Francisco, Calif.; San Jose, Calif.; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Mass.; and Washington, D.C. It will launch in additional cities in 2023.
The company also sells the Roadie Charging System, which is available to registered businesses. It’s a battery-powered, portable, modular charging solution that can be stored in the back of the vehicle for DC fast charging whenever it’s needed. The Roadie V3 is a Level 3 DC fast charger.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/24/statevolt-acquires-land-for-54-gwh-lithium-ion-battery-gigafactory/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 24, 2023",Statevolt acquires land for 54 GWh lithium-ion battery Gigafactory,"Statevolt was launched by Lars Carlstrom, founder and CEO of Italvolt, which is building a 45 GWh battery factory in Italy and Britishvolt, which is building a 30 GWh battery factory in the UK. Statevolt announced last April that it intended for its 54 GWh U.S. Gigafactory to be one of the largest in North America.
At full operating capacity, the Gigafactory will be one of the largest in North America, with plans to produce batteries for 650,000 electric vehicles a year.
Motivated by the Inflation Reduction Act, Statevolt intends to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and storage applications and said it will source materials entirely in the U.S. Controlled Thermal Resources will supply lithium to the plant, which will be located near the Salton Sea—estimated to contain between 1 and 6 metric tons of lithium. A team from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is leading a research project to profile the concentration of lithium in the geothermal field beneath California’s Salton Sea, and to explore the most environmentally benign way to extract it.
According to the Department of Energy, U.S. manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles stood at 55 GWh/year in 2021 and is projected to grow to nearly 1,000 GWh/year by 2030, or enough to supply the manufacture of approximately 10 to 13 million EVs per year. Since the landmark Inflation Reduction Act passed in August, auto makers and battery companies, such as Statevolt,  plan to spend $54 billion across 37 dedicated EV battery manufacturing facilities.
“The Inflation Reduction Act has opened up new opportunities and incentives for strategic sectors like ours, helping the U.S. establish itself as the global leader in clean energy solutions,” said Carlstrom.
Two key provisions of the IRA are boosting manufacturing in the US. The first, the advanced manufacturing production credits (AMPC), for US-made renewable equipment. The second provision is the incentivization of developers of US renewable energy projects to purchase domestically sourced equipment with an additional tax credit if they meet domestic content requirement or domestic content requirement thresholds. To qualify, 40% of all equipment must be American-made for projects installed before 2025.
Statevolt said it is committed to supporting growth and regeneration in the area, and it intends to provide employment for up to 2,500 people in the Imperial Valley community. The company’s business model will ensure its batteries are sourced and manufactured in a way that will support the Biden Administration’s ambition for clean growth and well-paid, high-quality jobs.
“The Statevolt project and its significant investment will be a monumental boost and rebirth for our local economy,” said Sean Wilcock, vice president of Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation (IVEDC). “The diversity of occupations offered at this new facility will provide never seen before opportunities for all skill levels. Imperial Valley has been at the forefront of the green economy decades before anyone coined such a phrase, now we’re back again leading the nation in the clean transportation industry. We can’t thank Statevolt enough for their investment in Imperial Valley.”
Since announcing the launch of the project in April, with the assistance of  IVEDC, the Statevolt team conducted an audit of potential sites, landing on the Salton Sea as a prime area for development. After acquiring the site, Statevolt has engaged AECOM Technology Corporation, a infrastructure consulting firm, to undertake due diligence including environmental and traffic analysis, ensuring that the planned site is suitably linked to strategic roads and highways for access.
Addendum: Britishvolt went into administration (bankruptcy) on Jan. 23, 2023.

The partnership includes an agreement to purchase 1.2 TWh of renewable energy per year. It will include 400 MW of new solar and wind power and 100 MW of battery energy storage, starting in 2026. This output will be supported by 300 MW of existing natural gas resources.
The wholesale power purchase agreement spans 20 years. The co-op said this partnership will “signal CORE’s transformation to a fully independent electric utility with control of its power supply future.”
CORE said the new agreements will supply the bulk of its wholesale energy needs. The company has set a target of reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. It has also stated plans to create more flexibility by implementing additional battery storage and other technologies in the future. The portfolio is expected to stabilize CORE’s costs to keep members’ rates among the lowest in Colorado for years to come, said the company.
The partnership with Invenergy “demonstrates that the transition to a clean and reliable energy future can be done without sacrificing affordability for our members,” said Jeff Baudier, chief executive officer of CORE Electric Cooperative.
“CORE is competitively positioned to support native growth and aggressively pursue new business.” The cooperative is member-owned, providing power to nearly 180,000 customers in a 5,000 square mile service area along the Colorado Front Range.
Chicago-based Invenergy is a big player in the Colorado utility-scale solar market. In 2021, the company announced a 127 MW power purchase agreement (PPA) with Guzman Energy for the Boutique Solar project in Montezuma County, Colorado, in the state’s far southwestern corner. The project will generate enough electricity to power 25,000 homes and is expected to be operational at the end of 2025.
Colorado sources about 6.2% of its electricity from solar, higher than the national average. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports 2.3 GW of operational solar in the state through Q3 2022.
SEIA estimates $5.1 billion has been invested in the technology in Colorado, while prices have fallen 52% over the last decade. An additional 3.6 GW of solar is expected to be built over the next five years, ranking the state 13 in terms of deployment projections.
“Colorado, with over 300 sunny days per year, has tremendous solar potential and was one of the first states in the U.S. to have a Renewable Energy Standard. There are multiple solar programs in Colorado for rooftop solar, community solar and utility-scale solar. SEIA is engaged in legislative and regulatory discussions to encourage renewable energy growth and deployment,” said SEIA.

The facility consists of a $250 million term loan and $300 million letter of credit that will be collateralized by the developer’s 35 GW multi-year development pipeline and its minority interest in storage business Hecate Grid, a joint venture between Hecate Energy and InfraRed Capital Partners.
Investec, Nomura Securities and National Bank of Canada led the debt financing, with Deutsche Bank and Generate Capital also coordinating lead arrangers. PEI Global Partners was Hecate’s financial advisor on the landmark transaction. Norton Rose Fulbright represented the lender group.
Proceeds from the loan refinanced an existing loan facility at a lower cost to Hecate, and the letters of credit facility enable Hecate to issue numerous grid interconnection and power purchase agreement letters of credit to achieve sales of 5 GW or more per year across its asset portfolio.
“Securing the letter of credit of this size against a pure play renewables developer’s active project development pipeline has never been done before,” Chris Bullinger, chief executive officer of Hecate Energy, told pv magazine USA. “This innovative debt facility package indicates a high degree of market confidence in Hecate Energy’s strong track record of successful renewables development.”
“We are leveraging our global financial and intellectual capital to provide funding and tailored financing solutions to companies like Hecate Energy, who are helping to fuel the energy transition,” said Vinod Mukani, global head of Nomura’s infrastructure and power group.  “Executing on this transaction is particularly exciting as Hecate Energy retains an experienced and talented team and an attractive business strategy which we are happy to support.”
Hecate Grid was formed in 2018 as a joint venture between Hecate Energy and InfraRed Capital. The business currently has an active portfolio of 5 GW of storage projects in various phases of development. Besides Texas and California, where it has 1.15 GW and 1.95 GW procured for development, respectively, the developer has projects in the works in New York, where its Swiftsure Energy Storage (650 MW) project in Staten Island remains in active development, according to a NYISO interconnection queue update.
Hecate Energy was formed in 2012 and in May 2021 received a minority investment by Repsol, a Spanish energy company, which acquired a 40% interest in the developer. With 1.5 GW of active or development-stage solar and wind projects, Hecate Energy is consistently named a top ten US developer.
The company is building the largest solar project in New York, the 500 MW Cider Solar Farm. Located on 3,000 acres in the towns of Elba and East Oakfield, N.Y., part of National Grid’s service territory, it received a permit from the N.Y. Office of Renewable Energy Siting (ORES) in July 2022 to build the project. Construction is on track to take place this year with 495 construction workers engaged in the construction.
Cider Solar is the first solar project application to receive approval under New York’s new Section 94-c law, which was designed to implement new solar projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/24/best-practices-and-guiding-strategies-for-playing-the-solar-procurement-game/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,RACKING,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 24, 2023",Best practices and guiding strategies for playing the solar procurement game,"In a volatile, supply-constrained environment, pricing and availability can change in an instant, sending buyers right back to the starting point. Ask a large energy buyer how to manage the solar procurement timeline, and the answer might go something like this: “Recently, if panels are available, we and our competitors are buying them within hours of hearing about the availability.”
The “buy first, ask questions later” strategy carries some risk. But so does almost every approach to solar procurement. Each step can take the buyer closer to a supply agreement that in turn leads to project profitability or deals a frustrating setback.
Experienced module buyers probably know the steps to take and the considerations to make, but as the graphic below suggests, procurement can sometimes feel like the children’s game, Chutes and Ladders. Even the most seasoned players can benefit from a refresh of the best practices and guiding strategies needed to navigate the ever-changing procurement process.

There are three key areas that impact a buyer’s success: visibility into the supply chain, buying power, and module value analysis. This article reviews the most important questions to ask at each step along the way.
How to play the procurement game
Data collection is the first step in the procurement process. Large-volume module buyers need to know which modules are available for purchase in line with their budgets and the timing for project development. They also need answers to questions such as:
There might be a procurement team responsible for data collection, or that work might be delegated to someone who has various responsibilities. Either way, most buyers have to contend with limited access to supplier data and poor data quality once their information is no longer up to date.
With a valid set of module data in hand, one can move to step two — data analysis. Some of the analysis can be completed in-house, such as verifying that equipment is compatible with the rest of the project components and overall system design. Other aspects of data analysis depend on third-party input, including the following:
If not, the module manufacturer may need to show allowable mounting options.
Wait times for responses from suppliers can vary, and it often depends on the supplier and the buyer’s relationship with the supplier.
Performance engineering, the third step in solar procurement, helps module buyers evaluate the impact that selected equipment will have on energy production. If a project is financed, as most are, the financier will want to see independent test results answering questions such as:
For each module, it can take days or weeks to get third-party reports if they exist, and then the results must be vetted until there is enough confidence to proceed with the project. This itself is a multi-step process.
Here are the steps to ensure an accurate performance model:
Leveraging buying power in procurement
The end of the procurement process is nearly in sight. But timeline management continues to be unpredictable and full of risk, which undercuts buying power for the module buyer.
The next step is vendor due diligence. In this fourth step, the questions to answer include:
It’s also important to account for legal and regulatory compliance, such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), a law enacted in 2021 to keep goods produced in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, including raw materials used in solar modules, out of the U.S. market.
Contracting, step five, might be the riskiest step of all. So many resources have been invested to reach this point. And yet, a shift in module pricing or availability could send the buyer back to the start.
Module buyers might have to wait several months before they have a negotiated and executed supply agreement. Once again, it depends on the supplier and the buyer’s relationship with the supplier. All the while, none of the procurement terms can be guaranteed until the contracts are signed.
The inherent risk at this stage can put module buyers at a disadvantage when negotiating terms with the supplier. At this point, the questions to ask are:
Using module NPV to optimize project value
If the data can be synthesized from each step in the procurement process, the value of different modules can be compared and that comparison can be used to optimize overall project value. The best way to do so is to determine each module’s net present value (NPV). NPV calculates an asset’s costs and projected income and assigns a present-day value, accounting for the fact that money has greater value now than it will in the future, a concept known as the time value of money.
Consider the purchasing terms learned during data collection. Terms that reduce capital costs will generally improve NPV. The data analysis performed in step two provides insight into labor and balance of system (BOS) impacts of a given module. Simple, streamlined installation processes also boost NPV.
Now it’s time to consider module degradation during performance engineering. As a general rule, NPV is higher when module degradation is lower. Degradation also affects project O&M. Higher degradation has the effect of driving down gross revenue.
Questions to ask to evaluate overall module value include:
Procurement solutions reduce risk 
It might seem easy to take a do-it-yourself approach for some steps in the procurement process for a couple of module options. But doing a deep dive into all the module options can be time consuming.
What’s more, taking the time to eliminate production model ambiguity and deliver a trustworthy model that financiers are more likely to accept can slow the time to get to the finish line. Having a reliable procurement solution means not having to risk starting the game over again if some of the checklist steps are missed, or if something goes wrong.

Aaron Hall is a solar veteran with 22 years in the industry. He is currently president of Anza, a Borrego business that is an optimized online marketplace where large-scale solar module and energy storage equipment buyers can quickly see a list of vetted, attractively priced options maximized for net present value based on project inputs.

U.S.-based tech startup Salgenx has unveiled a scalable saltwater flow battery for applications in renewable energy, telecommunication towers, oil well pumps, agriculture irrigation pumps, and greenhouse irrigation or lighting. The batteries are suitable for standalone storage or with solar or wind power.
“It is very suitable for solar power storage, with the added benefit of solar thermal storage in the salt water electrolyte tank,” CEO Gregory Giese told pv magazine.
The manufacturer said the new battery has an energy density of 125.7 Wh/L. It requires two large tanks filled with fluid electrolytes, one of which is saltwater and the other a proprietary electrolyte. The fluids are circulated through electrodes, which regulate the input and output of electricity from the battery.
The solution can be scaled by adding more electrodes and additional electrolyte tanks. Salgenx also offers the solution in 250 kW, 3 MWh, 6 MWh, 12 MWh, and 18 MWh configurations. The flow battery is membrane-free, unlike most redox flow batteries.
“The absence of the membrane saves huge upfront purchase costs, maintenance, and consumable expenses,” Salgenx says on its website.
The company claims that material costs of $5/kWh, $257kWh for system infrastructure, and a total system cost of $500,000, or $166/kW for the 3,000 kWh battery. The technology purportedly has a life expectancy of more than 25 years and a roundtrip efficiency of 91% at 10 mA/square centimeter.
The saltwater tank can be used simultaneously for thermal storage, in combination with a heat pump using carbon dioxide as a refrigerant.
“Typically the thermal savings using a heat pump and higher COP (coefficient of performance), may double that of electricity rate savings,” the company claims.
Salgenx develops the technology and sells licenses to third-party manufacturers to commercialize the solutions.
