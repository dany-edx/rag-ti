While total construction cost for solar approached $20 billion, the average construction costs for solar  systems decreased in the U.S. in 2021 compared to 2020.

The EIA data shows that solar construction costs fell 6% in 2021 over 2020, dropping to $1,561 per kW. The decrease was driven primarily by a 10% drop in the construction cost for crystalline silicon tracking panels, which fell to $1,423 per kW, their lowest average cost since 2014.
The report notes that the average construction cost for crystalline silicon fixed-tilt panels increased by 5% to $2,047 per kW. The average cost for cadmium telluride panels remained relatively stable, decreasing only 1% to $1,626 per kW in 2021. Fixed-tilt tracking systems automatically move to follow the sun as it moves across the sky. While they are the highest cost, they produce more electricity by continuously following the sun.
It’s worth noting that this follows a time when solar module prices had doubled primarily due to supply shortages during the Covid pandemic. In response to the shortage, many manufacturers increased production while developers stockpiled supply.
Since the pandemic began in 2021, module prices have continued to fall, hitting a two-year low globally in April 2023. In the first two months of 2023, average U.S. module prices were $0.36 per Wdc, down 11% quarter-over-quarter. Modules traded at a 57% premium over the global spot price for monofacial monocrystalline silicon modules.
Taking a regional view, the greatest growth in solar addition happened in the southern part of the U.S., with Texas leading the way. In 2021, Texas added 100 new plants for a total of 10,155 MW compared to just 2,347 added in Ohio.

While Texas still leads the nation in solar installations, the numbers look vastly different than two years ago. For example, a 36 GW buildout is expected by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) over the next five years, building on the roughly 16 GW that is active to date. Much of today’s investment in solar, which nears $20 billion, is going toward large solar facilities, often exceeding 100 MW in capacity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/03/new-website-provides-automated-engineering-stamps-for-residential-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 3, 2023",New website provides automated engineering stamps for residential solar,"Castillo Engineering, a solar installation company ranging from residential to mid-size utility-scale projects, announced it has launched SolarLetters.com to provide automated residential solar letters.
The company said it is the first in the U.S. to launch fully automated structural letters, professional engineer (PE) stamps and post-installation letters. It is compatible with all 50 U.S. states and some overseas markets.
The website utilizes a range of application programming interface (API) integrations, which the company said enables a 99% accuracy to rate to the documentation. It said that the website will further leverage artificial intelligence to speed the processing of solar letters and PE stamps. Currently, the website has the capacity to generate over 100,000 solar letters per month, said the company.
“The Solar Letters platform is a game-changer for LGCY,” said Ben Ogden, manager, design and engineering, LGCY Power. “It has simplified the structural and electrical engineering process and increased our turn times on stamped projects.”
Soft costs, permitting, and inefficient documentation processes are a persistent issue in the U.S. residential solar market. Soft costs represent any cost not tied directly to the cost of hardware itself. In the U.S., soft costs represent 65% of the project, said the Department of Energy (DOE). Shawn Rumery, senior director of research at SEIA, said since 2014, residential system costs have come down 25%, but soft costs have dropped only 15%. Customer acquisition and overhead costs have risen 31% in the same time period, Rumery said.
Many installation firms still use simple document or spreadsheet-based processes to file PE stamps and other letters.
“All of these methods have been tested and proven to be highly error prone, particularly with non-degreed engineers manually completing forty to fifty letters per day,” said SolarLetters.
The SolarLetters website incorporates data from over 40,000 authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ), and the company said it guarantees a 99% AHJ approval rate.
The company issues a full credit for any document that receives AHJ rejection and offers volume discounts through a Permit Partner Program. It also offers price matching to the lowest quote for its solar letter service.
“We are very excited to launch SolarLetters.com in response to the high demand for residential solar letters and PE stamps we are seeing globally,” said Christopher Castillo, chief executive officer of Solar Letters. “We look forward to providing the same elite customer service experience for SolarLetters.com clients as we do through Castillo Engineering. Helping solar installers drastically cut soft costs and mitigate project risks are necessary to ultimately enable solar energy to proliferate across the globe.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/03/building-not-your-average-dream-home/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,MINNESOTA,UNITED STATES",,"OCTOBER 3, 2023",Building not your average dream home,"Passionate about limiting climate collapse, I’ve worked in the energy transition, specifically in the solar industry, for a decade. But I always wanted my personal life to better reflect that commitment, specifically my home. So, after a decade of dreaming about living in a sustainable house, I’m now on my way to building one. During the next year, I will document this journey on pv magazine USA in a series called, “Not Your Average Dream Home,” which will include a wide variety of topics such as, designing with passivehaus elements, water recycling, energy production and management, and building materials. But before I can dive into those topics, I first needed to find a plot of land.
Since the climate is being rapidly changed, I was looking for a location that would be the safest, or maybe more accurately the least at risk from human-caused climate disasters over the next few decades. According to Core Logics’s Climate Change Catastrophe Report published in 2022, 1 in 10 homes (14.5 million) in the U.S. in the previous year were impacted by “natural” disasters, such as heat, drought, fire, flood, and storms, causing an estimated $56.92 billion in property damage.
This meant that I needed to eliminate the entire West due to drought and wildfires. Having lived in Colorado, I am well aware of the threat from the Colorado River drying up and not being able to provide enough water for the 40 million people who depend on it due to this historic and extended drought. I have also experienced summer, now known as wildfire season, in the mountains, when the smoke was so bad that I had to wear a mask outside and couldn’t open the windows to cool down the house at night since most places don’t have air conditioning. I had also gotten used to having a go-bag and an evacuation checklist in event of a forest fire.
The coastal regions were obviously off limits due to sea level rise, hurricanes and flooding. And I had to rule out the entire south due to heat. While states like Arizona, New Mexico and Texas suffered from record-breaking multiple consecutive 100+° days this summer, states like Florida, Alabama and Mississippi suffer from both heat and humidity. The combination of heat and humidity, known as the wet bulb temperature, when it comes to global warming is particularly deadly since it compromises our main cooling method, sweating. According to a study published back in 2020 in the journal Science Advances, heat and humidity in certain areas of the world were already testing the limits of human survivability. And despite the reaction by these GBN anchors, high wet bulb temperatures are incredibly deadly.
While I knew that I couldn’t completely escape the impacts of climate collapse (or the rising insurance costs and uninsurability that it is causing), there are a few areas that are considered the least risky in the continental U.S., such as a northern states in the Midwest and some areas close to the Canadian border in New England. And potentially, they may not have as fridged winters as they have in the past. But they are not without their own risk. The instability of the jet stream could cause more polar vortexes, and with them extreme snowfall and cold, as well as stronger tornados.
In the end, out of these very limited options, I landed on Minnesota, which has shown a commitment to fighting climate change. Earlier this year, Minnesota signed into law Senate bill SF 4, which established the ambitious goal of achieving 100% clean energy by 2040. In addition, SolarReviews, as published by pv magazine USA, ranked Minnesota #6 for solar due to its available tax credits, electricity prices, payback time, and more.
Even though I narrowed down the state, I still needed to find a plot of land that would fit my build. This was not as easy of a task as I had expected. There were several important considerations, such as level ground, land size, realistic budget, proximity to essential services, utility hookups (i.e. internet, electricity, water, etc.), zoning restrictions and more, that severely narrowed down my options. One particularly restrictive factor was avoiding home owner associations (HOAs) and other building limitations, that called for things like a 3,000 sq ft minimum build, a 3-car garage, or a certain type of building façade. All of which would have made the build that I was planning impossible. But after a year of looking, I finally found a piece of land where I can build not your average dream home. Stay tuned for the next steps of the journey of designing and planning a sustainable house.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/03/large-solar-projects-have-no-negative-impact-on-property-values-study-says/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 3, 2023","Large solar projects have no negative impact on property values, study says","Developers of large-scale solar projects located near residential areas are used to backlash from residents, who often claim that homes near utility-scale solar projects will diminish in value. This was found to not be the case, according to a study commissioned by Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation (CTEI) in partnership with the Advanced Power Alliance and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The residential market study was conducted in areas surrounding six utility-scale solar plants located in four Texas counties: Tom Green, Bell, Lamar, and Bee Counties. Sales were analyzed at varying stages of the project, including announcement and construction. The market trend analysis showed no evidence of negative market impacts for nearby residential properties, and revealed a robust and competitive market for homes near the solar plants both during construction and once they are operational.
“This first-of-its-kind study on solar energy and property values underscores what we know to be true in Texas – utility scale solar projects have a positive impact on our local economies,” said Matt Welch, State Director of CTEI. “As Texas continues to lead on renewable energy, it is crucial our leaders have access to objective data to help dispel misinformation and false narratives.”
To define what a utility-scale solar project is, the report authors turned to definitions from SEIA and the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). SEIA defines utility-scale as solar projects generating over 1 MW of solar energy and NREL’s definition is more than 5 MW of solar energy. The report authors also noted that utility-scale projects typically sell electricity directly to the grid as opposed to supplying electricity to an individual facility.
The study set out to look at sales metrics of homes in areas surrounding typical utility-scale installations. The sales metrics include price per interior square foot, sales to price list ratios and days on market and these were compared in areas close to the solar projects to sales located further from solar projects, and findings show that sales prices and marketing times of residential properties located near solar projects were generally consistent with residential sales further away.
“As the market for solar and other renewable energy production grows, it is important to understand how their presence impacts surrounding communities,” said Erin Kiella, PhD., lead author of the report. “Studying these projects using market data helps bring clarity on these issues.”
The study comes at a time when solar is booming in Texas, the state that is number one in solar development in the United States, with many large utility-scale projects coming online.. A 36 GW buildout is expected by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) over the next five years, building on the roughly 16 GW that is active to date.
