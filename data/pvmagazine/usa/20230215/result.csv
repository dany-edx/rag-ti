The Public Advisor’s Office (PAO) suggested that California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) deny solar and storage provider Sunnova from providing microgrid services in the state. The decision comes on the heels of the passage of NEM 3.0, which signals a deeper regulatory moat-digging around the centralized utility business model.
“Our application clearly outlines the reliability, rate, environmental, and other public interest benefits that community microgrids can provide. This proposed decision is troubling and disappointing for a state that has set such bold climate targets yet is struggling with making steady progress on them,” said Meghan Nutting, executive vice president of government and regulatory affairs.
Sunnova proposed the “micro utility” service in September 2022, seeking to equip new construction homes with solar and storage and aggregate them in a microgrid. Distributed energy aggregation is a proven more efficient way to supply resilient renewable energy than the centralized utility model. Read more about the wide set of promising benefits of aggregation here.
“It is curious and concerning that the PAO, a presumably independent division of the CPUC who is charged with representing the public interest, is seeking to dismiss our microgrid application before it gets any opportunity to be heard through a public hearing,” said Nutting.
The PAO proposed decision to deny can be found here. CPUC retains the authority to approve or deny the application regardless of PAO’s suggestion.
As stated on its website, the PAO is designed to represent the public interest, shielding it from unfair practices by utilities. “The office’s mission is to advocate for the lowest possible monthly bills for customers of California’s regulated utilities consistent with safety, reliability, and the state’s environmental goals. As the only State entity charged with this responsibility, the PAO represents utility customer interests before the CPUC,” said the PAO site.
Despite this, Sunnova argues that the PAO’s proposed decision to deny flies in direct contrast to its stated mission. The company said its project provides market-based rates, no diminishment in safety, consumer choice about how they obtain and use energy, greater reliability, and meaningful advancement toward the state’s environmental goals.
In its 2021 to 2022 transmission plan, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) announced 23 transmission projects at an estimated cost of $2.9 billion. These costs are pushed to homeowners in the form of electricity rate increases. A significant portion of these costs could be avoided if California instead pivoted to a decentralized model of energy.
“We see a future where communities, neighborhoods, and businesses can operate independently from the legacy grid with sustainable energy sources that provide uninterrupted power. We believe microgrids address a strong need in the market for more robust energy solutions and better connectivity. The Sunnova Adaptive Community will provide consumers with the ability to produce, share, and deliver power when it’s needed most,” said William J Berger, founder and CEO of Sunnova.

Additionally, the Governor intends to accelerate electrification efforts with grant funding for heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs). And he announced the plan to phase out combustion engine vehicles, ensuring that in 2035 and beyond, all new cars sold will be electric.
“These bold targets and carefully crafted initiatives signal our unequivocal commitment to swift and concrete climate action today,” said Governor Murphy. “We’ve turned our vision for a greener tomorrow into a responsible and actionable roadmap to guide us, and it’s through that pragmatic, evidence-based approach that we will ultimately arrive at our destination. Combined with our federal partnerships reinforced through the Inflation Reduction Act, these comprehensive initiatives will better protect and prepare every New Jersey community, including those on the front lines of climate change who have previously been left out and left behind.”
The six pillars that serve as the foundation for a cleaner, greener, and more resilient New Jersey include:
“Our deep affection for New Jersey and the people who call it home propel us to adopt policies and launch programs that help us address and adapt to the realities of climate change,” said “The climate change impacts we are already experiencing in our state demand that we take innovative, decisive action today to give future generations of New Jersey residents a chance at a good quality of life,” said Lt. Governor Sheila Oliver.
Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters noted that these policies will create new union jobs in “growing green industries” He added that “Other states looking to combat climate change, protect our environment, and create good local jobs that can’t be outsourced must now take their cues from New Jersey.”
“With today’s actions, Gov. Murphy is solidifying New Jersey’s position as a national leader in the clean energy economy as he boosts our renewables and building electrification targets and ensures that the energy of the future is cutting harmful air pollution and slashing consumer energy costs for New Jerseyans right now,” said Mary Barber, director, State Affairs at Environmental Defense Fund. “Cars and trucks will be cleaner and more affordable, and many of the measures announced today will be supercharged by the Biden administration’s landmark clean energy plan. Gov. Murphy sees the road ahead and is entrusting Garden State residents to make climate-friendly choices and put pedal to the metal in the 21st century economy.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/15/roypow-introduces-whole-home-backup-solar-battery/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 15, 2023",RoyPow introduces whole home backup solar battery,"RoyPow Technology is displaying its new “all-in-one” residential battery energy storage solution at Intersolar North America this week in Long Beach, California, booth 359. The company brings over 20 years of manufacturing experience in renewable energy and battery energy storage systems.
The latest product, RoyPow SUN Series, is a lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) home battery sporting up to 15 kW of power and 40 kWh capacity. It has a max efficiency of 98.5%. The high-power battery is a true whole-home solution, the company says, able to backup larger home appliances like air conditioners, washer/dryers, and pool pumps. The high-capacity storage is designed to offer homeowners an opportunity to maximize solar energy self-consumption, avoiding value loss from exporting energy to the grid.
Like many battery offerings today, the SUN Series is modular and stackable, allowing for what is reportedly an easy design and installation. Battery modules can be stacked from 5.1 kWh to 40.8 kWh. Up to six units can be connected in parallel, delivering up to 90 kW output.
The battery is IP65 rated, resistant to dust and moisture, and is UL certified for safety. The LFP chemistry negates the need for cobalt in the battery, a mineral tied to conflict mining and higher rates of battery fires in traditional lithium-ion batteries. The company reports that the switching time is less than 10 milliseconds, which makes the battery safer, but also allows for automatic energy transfers for on- or off-grid use without power disruption.
The SUN Series battery is paired with its namesake app, which can be used to monitor solar production in real time. The app enables preference-setting for optimizing energy independence, outage protection, or savings. The system can be controlled with remote access and instant alerts.
The new product will meet the emergent needs created by “the trend of rising energy costs and the need for greater energy resilience in the face of increasingly frequent grid outages,” said Michael Li, vice president at RoyPow Technology.
Li said the company will continue to develop products in the renewable energy storage space, targeting commercial and industrial solutions, vehicle-mounted and marine applications, and more.
RoyPow is founded in Huizhou City, Guangdong Province, China, with manufacturing centers in China and subsidiaries in the U.S., Europe, Japan, the U.K., Australia, and South Africa.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/15/energy-justice-lmi-solar-strike-a-chord-at-intersolar/,"COMMUNITY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 15, 2023","Energy justice, LMI solar strike a chord at Intersolar","Energy justice and solar deployments to disadvantaged communities were common themes during day one of the Intersolar North America and Energy Storage North America 2023 conference in Long Beach, Calif.
Over the last year following the Russia-Ukraine War, the energy burden on disadvantaged or low-to-moderate income (LM() communities has translated to more than 15% of disadvantaged households’ income devoted to paying for energy each month as the cost for electricity rises, compared to 2 to 3% that average income households typically pay for energy each month. Many LMI households have had to choose between paying their energy bill or providing food for their family each month, said a keynote speaker at Intersolar.
During a morning keynote session, Shalanda Baker, Director of the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pointed out that minority communities such as Black and Latino neighborhoods in urban environments suffer 56% and 63% more pollution attributable to industrial and power facilities than white communities. Such locations contribute to higher rates of asthma and health conditions, as well as children born with developmental disabilities.
Baker commended the work of the blossoming community solar developers in attendance at the annual trade show, adding that the energy justice adder and incentives under the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) should contribute to the rapid electrification of disadvantaged communities, with inexpensive solar available to more households that traditionally were unable to access clean energy.
Even before the IRA passed, Baker noted the Biden Administration’s passing of the Justice40 initiative, a policy in which 40% of domestic clean energy investment be devoted to minority and disadvantaged communities for solar, EV charging and other infrastructure improvements.
Baker noted that lately over 20% of DOE energy project applications are LMI community inclusive, and focused on growing that number to incorporate “place-based commitments” for solar and distributed generation resources.
Developers should note that the government is not just handing out rebates for projects that on paper look to be qualified LMI communities. The DOE diversity official noted that developers of community solar projects are required to procure letters and petitions from county and local businesses, residents and municipal groups in support of new project development.
During Baker’s presentation an image of downtown Austin, Texas was shown from February 15, 2021, when Winter Storm Uri created a prolonged grid failure event at the power transmission and distribution level in the state of Texas. The image taken by journalist Terri Gruca of KVUE showed the illuminated downtown Austin skyline with the University of Austin on the right side, with the lefthand side of the highway blacked out where lower income and minority communities live.
“Minority communities throughout Texas face longer outages times and fossil fuel exposure,” Baker said. “An equitable transition away from fossil fuels encapsulates a broad need for a just energy system.”
Energy justice seeks to correct damage done to people in low-income communities which have long suffered from fossil fuel pollution near their homes, lack of access to renewables-driven affordable electricity, climate change, and more.
The DOE has developed a method for designating disadvantaged communities based on 36 criteria related to energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, socio-economic vulnerabilities, and fossil-fuel dependence.
People living in these communities have several barriers to adoption. Many do not own the home they live in and are likely to live in multi-family housing units. Therefore, putting solar on the rooftop is not a viable option. Because such households are on low incomes, they often have low credit scores and cannot take advantage of the no-upfront-cost lease options on the market. Furthermore, their budgets are stretched thin – especially in the current economic climate – and they have little or no expendable income.
Community solar is especially applicable for those who can’t afford to “go solar” on their own, those who don’t own a rooftop, and those whose rooftops are not suitable for solar.  The IRA offers support in the form of tax incentives, with a 30% tax credit for the solar installation plus three adders that can add up to 70%. Additionally, the IRA includes the interconnection fee in that tax credit.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/15/interconnection-delays-slow-u-s-community-solar-growth/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 15, 2023",Interconnection delays slow U.S. community solar growth ,"U.S. community solar installed capacity was down 16% in 2022 compared to the previous year, primarily driven by interconnection delays in key state markets such as Massachusetts, Maine, and Maryland. Industry-wide supply chain constraints also pushed project timelines into 2023, according to the latest report released by Wood Mackenzie in collaboration with the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).
Community solar is a way for homeowners, businesses and other organizations to invest in the benefits of clean energy when they have unsuitable conditions for rooftop or on-site ground-mounted installations. The way it works is that, either through buying or leasing a portion of an off-site solar project, customers typically receive a utility bill credit for the electricity generated by their share of the community solar system, similar to the way rooftop solar net billing works. Community solar is also a way to ensure a more equitable energy transition, as people can opt to use clean energy even when they don’t own their own rooftop or may not have the credit needed for a full solar installation.
While installations of community solar contracted in 2022, Wood Mackenzie forecasts the U.S. community solar market to grow 118% over the next five years, with at least 6 GWdc expected to come online in existing markets between 2023 to 2027.
According to the CCSA, there are now 22 states with some form of competitive community solar policy, with new states like California and New Mexico coming online this year, and more poised to pass bills in the coming years. New York is a leader, currently holding nearly half of the U.S. market with around 500 MWdc installed in 2022, according to the report. Current total installed capacity for 2022 is estimated to be 5.27 GWdc.
CCSA’s new target of 30 GW of community solar by 2030, announced in January 2023, will require an acceleration of installed capacity in existing markets and continued establishment of new state markets.
“Any upside to our existing forecast will require strong policy and market reforms that release pipeline backlogs in existing markets, as well as additional capacity from new state markets. The newly passed state-wide program in California, for example, has the potential to yield a significant number of megawatts in the coming years,” said Caitlin Connelly, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

“The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is cause for optimism. Community solar developers are well-positioned to take advantage of the new and extended investment tax credits (ITC) once guidance is released in 2023, with many developers interested in qualifying projects for the low-to-moderate income (LMI) and domestic content adders,” Connelly said.
Connelly noted that the adders along with programs like the greenhouse gas reduction fund “will support growth in existing markets and create momentum for the creation of new state markets,” which Wood Mackenzie and the CCSA intend to monitor closely.
“To meet policymakers’ economic, social, and environmental goals, state legislatures and regulators must move community solar projects swiftly through interconnection queues and remove red tape to get as much capacity installed as possible,” said Jeff Cramer, CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access. “Doing so will move us closer to what we all want — jobs, economic development, and a decarbonized, cost-effective grid that works for all of us.”
If program proposals are enacted, new state markets will provide upside to the national forecast starting in 2024. Wood Mackenzie’s preliminary forecasts, which Wood Mac says are inherently conservative, project a 605 MWdc boost by 2027 from potential new state markets including Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

The report also found that as project portfolios grow, community solar developers are increasingly outsourcing subscriber acquisition and management services to third-party companies, with the top three subscriber companies now managing over 37% of the total market.
“The landscape for subscriber companies is becoming more competitive and complex. Developers seek partners that can successfully subscribe projects, form trusting relationships with subscribers, and manage these relationships throughout the lifetime of the project or program,” Connelly said.
The top three community solar developers secured 16.5% of the total market between 2017 to 2022, but competition remains stiff for newcomers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/15/enteligent-introduces-dc-to-dc-solar-ev-charger/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 15, 2023",Enteligent introduces DC-to-DC solar EV charger,"Enteligent unveiled its DC-to-DC-solar hybrid bi-directional EV charger this week at Intersolar North America. Powered by the sun, the EV charger can supply 25 kW of fast DC charging, charging three times faster than AC Level 2 EV chargers, the company reports.
With most EV chargers, which are AC-to-DC, there is lost energy and a longer charging time. But with DC-to-DC, according to Enteligent, the DC-to-DC charging results in up to 25% energy savings because the power does not have to be converted.
The EV charger operates at 200V to 500V output for CCS Combo EV connectors, providing 15 kW of power over a 25-foot cable. Using stringed solar modules at 15 kW plus 15 kW of batteries, when combined with 9.6 kW of AC power saved from having to convert to DC, the charger provides a power output of 24.6 kW over a 400V system, the company reports.
“Rapid growth in EV ownership and usage and the resulting demand for energy are putting increased pressure on an already stretched electricity grid,” said Sean Burke, founder, and CEO of Enteligent. “This first-of-its-kind technology will benefit consumers by enabling them to shift from night-time charging, which is dependent on the fossil-fuel powered grid, to clean, solar-based, daytime charging.”
Following the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the United States has supercharged its EV push. The IRA includes $10 billion in tax credits for a variety of manufacturing facilities, including EV and battery manufacturing facilities. In total, between both laws there is at least $145 billion of funding for which EV charging projects could be eligible, said Atlas EV Hub, an analyst firm that has found that roughly $860 billion has been raised to build out EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure. Nearly one fourth of this is represented by the United States, which has $210 billion in major automaker and infrastructure projects planned.
Earlier this month Enteligent closed a $7 million growth funding round from NOVA, an affiliate of global building materials company Saint-Gobain and Taronga Ventures, among other early-stage investors.
Founded in 2020, Enteligent is based in Morgan Hill, Calif., and including the round from NOVA and Taronga, has raised over $7.8 million in early-stage funding to date.
Enteligent also sells NMax photovoltaic module power optimizers that the company says uses smart digital technology to dynamically adjust when to optimize and provide panel-level monitoring data, resulting in reportedly greater rooftop yield, more energy harvesting and higher system reliability.
Entiligent is exhibiting in booth 2460 this week at Intersolar North America in Long Beach, Calif.
