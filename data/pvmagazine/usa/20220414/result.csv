Existing investors were joined by new investor Energy Transition Ventures. 
The funds are expected to increase Ohmium’s manufacturing capabilities four-fold from 500MW annually to 2GW by the end of the year. The company said its interlocking, modular proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers feature a safer, standardized, flexible, and easy to install and maintain alternative to customized electrolyzers. 
When charged by renewable energy sources, hydrogen is a prospective zero-carbon solution for a wide variety of applications, including iron and steelmaking, ground transport, long-duration dispatchable power, fertilizers, and more.
Ohmium’s Lotus Mark 1 Electrolyzer can produce 6kg per hour at 400 psi. The company said its purity is greater than 99.99%, with a less than 5 parts per million of oxygen present in the final product. It requires 480VAC / 415VAC, 60Hz / 50Hz of power, and is rated to operate between -13 degrees F to 122 degrees F. Each cabinet measures 6′ x 4′ x 6′. It is designed to Designed to UL 2264A standards.
“In a world where renewable power costs are cheaper than even the fuel for fossil power, green hydrogen is poised to transform energy and industrial markets,” said Craig Lawrence, partner, Energy Transition Ventures. 
The modular design means individual electrolyzers can be stacked, which Ohmium said will reduce installation and maintenance costs, while maintaining design flexibility. The company’s stack technology can sustain a differential pressure across the membrane without compromise, a feature that enhances cost-efficacy of operations. 
“The world has been waiting for cost-effective green hydrogen to usher in the hydrogen economy,” said Ahmad Chatila, of Fenice Investment Group and Chairman of Ohmium International. “Ohmium now has the resources and the manufacturing capacity to make it a reality today for customers worldwide.” 
Most hydrogen today is produced with fossil fuels, but the decreased cost of electrolyzers has opened the door for a decarbonized hydrogen economy. 
Ohmium is headquartered in Fremont, California, with manufacturing operations in India. Recently, India unveiled its green hydrogen policy as a step toward meeting the objectives of the National Hydrogen Mission launched by the prime minister last year.  
The National Hydrogen Mission aims to make India a green hydrogen hub, enabling the nation to meet its climate targets while reducing its fossil fuel import bills. It targets the production of 5 million tons of green hydrogen by 2030 and the related development of renewable energy capacity. 
In the US, the Department of Energy (DOE) targets reduced green hydrogen costs in pursuit of climate goals. The launched in 2021, Hydrogen Shot program has a “1-1-1″ goal, targeting costs of $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade. Currently, renewable energy-fueled hydrogen costs about $5 per kilogram, so this target represents a cost reduction of 80% in one decade.
DOE investment in green hydrogen is on the rise. In 2021, it supported $285 million in funding, and in 2022, the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request included the application for $400 million in funds for green hydrogen development.

According to the organization, the NY Energy Advisor website is being launched with a goal to keep the state on track to meet its specific low-income energy access goals under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, like delivering at least 35% of the benefits, with a goal of 40%, from clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities. NYSERDA developed the website alongside Central Hudson Gas and Electric, Consolidated Edison, National Fuel Gas, National Grid, New York State Electric and Gas Orange and Rockland, PSEG Long Island, and Rochester Gas and Electric in order to ensure easy and efficient access to energy programs and services, regardless of if those programs and services are offered by the state, or by the customer’s utility.
NYSERDA outlines that the website will specifically provide easy access to:
The site will also feature information on energy efficiency programs and services to owners of affordable property,  supporting residents of their properties with access to the full suite of energy incentives and programs at their disposal.
“As New York State addresses climate change and continues to move forward with its green energy transition, it’s imperative that low-to-moderate income residents are able to benefit from energy-saving programs and resources – and that means providing the tools needed to improve access and awareness to these incredibly important services,” said Doreen Harris, president and CEO of NYSERDA. “The NY Energy Advisor website reflects a partnership with utilities and a commitment to ensure all New Yorkers can directly benefit from energy-saving programs and participate in our clean energy future.”
Funding for NY Energy Advisor is included in New York’s nearly $1 billion investment to increase access to energy efficiency and clean energy solutions for disadvantaged communities, and the website’s launch builds on a recent $36 million initiative to support low-to-moderate income families to establish and support Regional Clean Energy Hubs as centers of outreach, awareness, and education.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/14/castillo-engineering-selected-to-provide-electrical-design-for-new-york-community-solar-portfolio/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 14, 2022",Castillo Engineering selected to provide electrical design for New York community solar portfolio,"Castillo Engineering, a design and engineering firm specializing in solar and energy storage design, engineering, and consulting services, announced it was selected by developer ClearPath Energy to  provide electrical design and engineering for a 38.25MW portfolio of six community solar projects in upstate New York.
The six projects range in capacity from 4.5MW to 7.5MW, and each of them is in the late stages of construction in central New York, with some having already achieved mechanical completion. According to Castillo, the company’s site optimization expertise resulted in over $200,000 in savings, on average, for each of these projects, which are scheduled to be operational in Q2 of 2022.
As part of Castillo design and engineering duties for the portfolio, the company handled equipment selection recommendations for the portfolio, with each project utilizing tier-one bifacial solar modules and an even split between projects using single-axis trackers and projects using fixed-tilt racking. According to the company, it is able to offer this service to developers due to its longstanding manufacturer relationships.
While the entire project portfolio will support the state’s mission to achieve its aggressive renewable energy goals, three of the projects in the portfolio will be making an immediate impact in their community, increasing the installed solar capacity of their home county by nearly 50%. In total, the six projects in this portfolio will generate enough clean energy to power 8,700 homes per year.
To date, Castillo has delivered design, engineering, and consulting services to over 300 utility-scale projects. The majority of these projects have been located in the Northeast US, namely New York and Massachusetts, though the company has participated in projects as far south as Puerto Rico.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/14/borgwarner-wins-4-million-prize-to-design-american-made-ev-fast-charger/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 14, 2022",BorgWarner wins $4 million prize to design American-made EV fast charger,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) is making efforts to accelerate US-based manufacturing of the energy transition. An important goal in this transition will be creating effective electric vehicle (EV) charging stations that meet American consumer expectations.
DOE granted BorgWarner, a sustainable mobility components provider, $4.09 million to create a 36-month fast-track for developing a US-made direct current fast charger for EVs. The company was one of the 25 awardees under the DOE program that is aimed at reducing vehicle emissions, supporting electrification, and boosting EV charging infrastructure.
The project aims to reduce DC fast charging costs by 20-30% while increasing power density, reducing losses, and shrinking the size of the station. BorgWarner’s chargers feature single-stage conversion and power module architecture that supports the charge of five vehicles at the same time. Each power module is 25kW, and projects can be scaled to 350kW or more.
DC fast chargers exceed the power output of prevailing Level 2 chargers. Rather than an AC charger, which requires multiple conversions, the DC charger can directly supply the vehicle’s battery, resulting in greater electrical efficiency. The high-power nature of the charger makes it readily adaptable to future EVs that may require higher voltages, said BorgWarner.
The company will partner with Michigan State University, eTransEnergy, Cityfi, the State of Michigan, and Barton Marlow to develop the technology. It will also receive components from Wolfspeed, Inc. The project launched in Q1 2022.
A full suite of EV charging components are already developed by BorgWarner, including battery systems, controllers, EV transmissions, electric drive motors and modules, power electronics, thermal management systems, as well as parts for conventional internal combustion engines.
“Our single conversion architecture, power module design and packaging, power electronic capabilities and module building block approach will be the factors that ensure a successful project launch for the EV market,” said Davide Girelli, president of BorgWarner Morse Systems.
A complete list of the DOE prize winners can be found here.
Two other DC fast charger developers won DOE awards, including Eaton Corporation, which will develop a solid state technology enabled, modular design aimed at reducing cost and footprint, and North Carolina State University, which will develop an “ultra low cost” silicon carbide-based power converter for direct connection to medium voltage distribution systems.

EDP Renewables North America developed and will construct, own, and operate Cattlemen Solar Park, to be built in two stages, which will represent capital investments of approximately $320 million and $220 million. These investments would disperse millions in cumulative payments to local governments through the life of the projects, the company reports. Hundreds of construction jobs would be created as well as multiple permanent jobs.will provide economic benefits by way of payments to local landowners, an estimated $55 million in taxes from Cattlemen I, paid to support local schools and other essential community services.
“Investing in local communities is important to us, and we are proud that this project is bringing new solar energy to the grid, providing construction jobs, and contributing to local water savings,” said Urvi Parekh, head of renewable energy at Meta
Cattleman Park will generate enough power for of more than 37,000 average Texas homes and save approximately 304 million gallons of water a year, which EDPR says is the amount of water that would be needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of capacity as the solar park.
EDPR and Meta have also collaborated on a 139MW PPA for the 200MW Headwaters II Wind Farm in Indiana and on the 200MW Randolph Solar Park, which will support Meta’s data center in Mesa, Arizona. Meta recently announced the collaboration with Silicon Ranch on the 70MW McKellar Solar Farm in Tennessee Valley Authority (TV) territory. Additionally, Meta has  partnered with Silicon Ranch on three projects in Georgia with a combined capacity of 287MW, another 120MW in Utah, 160MW of solar in Virginia, and has 475MW in total PV projects contracted under TVA’s Green Invest program.

The microgrid consists of 2.5MWof solar ppanels spread across numerous campus rooftops and parking garages, a 1.2MW/2.5MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system, and 4.5MW combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP) system.
Scale Microgrid Solutions will design, build, and operate this project with a consortium of industry-leading technology and contracting collaborators, including Urban Ingenuity, Schneider Electric, Mitsubishi, CHA Consulting, and New Columbia Solar.
The microgrid will meet much of the electrical needs of the campus and significantly reduce the university’s utility costs. Expected to go online by Fall 2023, the project will also provide clean power to the surrounding community.
“After several years of careful planning, we are excited that this transformational project is becoming a reality,” said Gallaudet University President Roberta J. Cordano. “The microgrid will help Gallaudet meet the energy challenges of the 21st century. Gallaudet has been an anchor in the District for 158 years, and we are proud to be building an energy system that will benefit the community.”
Gallaudet University, federally chartered in 1864, ensures the intellectual and professional advancement of Deaf, hard of hearing and Deafblind individuals through American Sign Language and English.
“We are thrilled to partner with Gallaudet University on a truly breakthrough system that not only will deliver valuable resiliency benefits for the university but also provide the surrounding community with access to cleaner energy,” said Ryan Goodman, Chief Executive Officer of Scale Microgrid Solutions. Scale is a vertically integrated distributed energy platform, with a core focus of designing, building, financing, owning, and operating distributed energy.
The system will work in parallel with the utility to power the campus and, in the event of a grid outage, the microgrid will enable campus operations to continue with minimal disruption. In addition, electricity generated by the solar arrays will be available as many as 1,500 area homes, nonprofit organizations, or small businesses through the District of Columbia community solar program.
“With this ground-breaking project, Gallaudet University is demonstrating that clean and resilient infrastructure offers a vital source of innovation and growth for the National Capital region and the nation,” said Bracken Hendricks, CEO of Urban Ingenuity, the microgrid architect serving as financial and technical advisor in developing this system. “As a flagship educational institution for Washington, D.C. and as a cornerstone of the global deaf and hard of hearing community, Gallaudet deserves tremendous credit for providing the vision and leadership required to build climate solutions, while ensuring a more just and resilient local community. We are honored to be part of this world-class team.”
Urban Ingenuity (UI) provides financing and development of clean energy projects that promote economic development and build just, green, and resilient neighborhoods. UI oversees the D.C. Property Assessed Clean Energy financing program for the D.C. Green Bank.
The project’s participation in the D.C. community solar program is made possible through collaboration with Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO). Typically, on-site community solar projects connect to the grid directly, skipping the home or building’s power infrastructure entirely. However, in this case, the electricity production from the solar panels distributed across Gallaudet’s campus is being tracked and allocated for community solar credits, despite being connected to the university’s own electrical infrastructure. This “virtual front of the meter” approach let Scale develop the project without the need for extensive cabling costs that would be required to aggregate these many distributed solar systems and connect them directly to PEPCO’s grid. Instead, they simply connect to the nearest power panel and PEPCO tracks the output through sensors and software.
