https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/25/utility-scale-solar-and-storage-project-updates-across-the-u-s/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 25, 2023",Utility-scale solar and storage project updates across the U.S.,"Solar deployment in the U.S. is expected to grow 40% this year, and by 2024, it is expected to reach 30 GW per year, or roughly 50% higher than 2022 totals. Much of this rapid growth in deployment will be carried by large, utility-scale projects, which the International Energy Agency expects to represent roughly three-quarters of the 30 GW annual total in 2024.
Utility-scale solar projects come in many shapes and sizes, from smaller sites near cities to large ones in remote areas. Below are five project and finance updates in the utility-scale sector.
Bowman 200 MW contract
Bowman Consulting group announced it has been awarded a $1.4 million engineering design contract by J. Ranck Electric, which primarily operates in Michigan. The deal builds on the $2.1 million in engineering contracts the company received from J. Ranck in late 2022.
The Midwest solar project will add 200 MW of solar capacity, making it among the largest solar facilities in the region. Bowman will provide civil design, electrical engineering for array design, and structural engineering for balance of systems equipment foundations.
The project site has flat topography, requiring Bowman to work closely with the local drainage commission to ensure compliance with regulations governing grading and drainage design relating to storm water management.
“Our extensive experience in utility-scale solar positions us to deliver these specialized services and keep pace with the market’s rapidly changing requirements,” said Dan Swayze, executive vice president of energy services, Bowman.
First Solar 279 MW order
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced it has secured 279 MW of thin-film solar panels from First Solar for a planned solar project in Alabama.
The project will be located in Lawerence County, Alabama and is expected to commence operations in 2027. The region will also be home to a new vertically integrated First Solar manufacturing facility, which is expected to reach operations in 2025.
“Through our work with First Solar, TVA will continue to integrate more renewable generation into our overall portfolio with solar technology developed and manufactured in America,” said Roger Waldrep, vice president, TVA Major Projects.
Designed and developed at its R&D centers in California and Ohio, First Solar’s thin film modules set industry benchmarks for quality, durability, reliability, design, and environmental performance. The modules have among the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV technology today. 
National Grid to donate $500,00
National Grid Renewables pledged to donate over $500,000 to the New Underwood, South Dakota school district, sourced from revenues from its 128 MW Wild Springs solar project.
Wild Springs announced construction in early 2023 and is projected to be the largest solar project in the state, once completed. Wild Springs is anticipated to avoid 190,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually – the equivalent to removing roughly 42,000 cars from the road for one year. The project also expects to produce nearly $12 million in new tax revenue throughout the first 20 years of operation.
“The New Underwood School District appreciates the pledge of $25,000 per year for 20 years provided by the Wild Springs Education Fund,” said Katie Albers, superintendent of the New Underwood School District. “The district will use these funds in a variety of ways to benefit our students, school and community.”
First Citizens Bank funds 200 MW project
First Citizens Bank announced its CIT division served as sole lead arranger on $211 million in financing for the 200 MW Oak Solar project in Gaston, North Carolina.
SunEnergy1 LLC stated plans to build the facility in two phases, selling 100% of the project’s electricity generation to the McDonald’s Corporation under a 17 year power purchase agreement. The financing package included a term loan, letter of credit and a bridge loan. The financing arrangement is yet another example of the boom of corporate solar procurement.
“SunEnergy1 is well known throughout the industry for its skill and experience in developing and operating utility-scale solar facilities,” said Mike Lorusso, managing director for the bank’s Energy Finance group. “We were pleased to support our client with a financing package that meets their business needs.”
Altus Power solar-plus-storage
Occupying a slightly different space than the above projects, Altus Power announced it added a 10 MW solar plus 15 MWh battery energy storage facility to its portfolio in Massachusetts. The project will deliver electricity under long-term agreements with a regional supermarket and community solar customers under the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources SMART program.
“Battery storage is an important tool for local utilities to ensure grid stability as they increase their reliance on renewable electricity,” said Gregg Felton, co-chief executive officer and co-founder, Altus Power. “In addition, we expect storage will increasingly be paired with Altus Power solar arrays for customers interested in clean, on-site backup power and electric vehicle charging.”
The Holliston project was developed in partnership with REA, one of Altus Power’s long-standing channel partners, and adds to the 116 MW of solar arrays owned and operated by Altus Power in Massachusetts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/25/ny-state-provides-additional-29-million-for-ev-infrastructure-and-rebates/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JULY 25, 2023",NY State provides additional $29 million for EV infrastructure and rebates,"According to New York State assembly member Didi Barrett, cost restraint and range anxiety are some of the biggest roadblocks to the state implementing and scaling its climate agenda, which calls for a clean energy transition that creates family sustaining jobs and fosters a green economy while directing 35 to 40% of clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities. However, Governor Hochul is actively working to change that. 
The Governor recently announced a $29 million investment for EV Level 2 charging infrastructure to bolster Charge Ready NY’s 2.0 initiative and increase financing for the Drive Clean Rebate program.
The funds will be divided as follows: 
This means public private and not-for-profit organizations that install Level 2 EV charging stations at offices apartments or municipal and state government-owned buildings, may get between $2000 and $4000 per charging port and an additional $500 for those installed in a Disadvantaged Community (DAC). 
Regarding rebates, landlords eligible business owners and government workers can add tax credits to their savings, resulting in installation reduction costs of up to 50% for charging stations where cars can get up to 25 miles of electric range for each hour they are plugged in. 
Charge Ready NY 2.0 plans to accept rebate and financing applications from eligible EV charger vendors until funds run out – and consumers may also qualify for help.
New York’s Drive Clean Rebate program has an additional $14 million intended to reduce the costs of buying or leasing a new EV. The public can receive a point-of-sale rebate of $500 to $2000 when getting a new car if they choose one or more of the 60 models eligible through the state’s participating car dealerships like Advantage Hyundai, Atlantic Toyota and Beck Chevrolet Co., Inc. 
NY State’s clean energy goals are to have a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, 70% renewable energy generation by 2030 and economy-wide carbon neutrality by the middle of the century. 
The state’s approach to achieving these goals by expanding access to EVs and charging infrastructure through financial incentives, especially in DAC’s, has been applauded by assembly members senators and stakeholders alike; a collaboration that’s been evident in NY State’s aggressive clean energy investments and ambitious zero-emission regulations. 
The state has invested over $35 billion in 120 large renewable and transmission projects, $6.8 billion to reduce building emissions, $3.3 billion to scale solar, more than $1 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $2 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. Initiatives that helped fund over 165,000 clean energy jobs in 2021 and have contributed to a 3,000-plus percent growth in the state’s solar sector since 2011.  
“Through solution-based investments in charging infrastructure and rebates, our green energy leadership is providing cleaner air – particularly in historically marginalized communities,” Hochul said. “This is an essential step to improving the state’s quality of life while building a more sustainable future for residents workers and visitors alike.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/25/the-potential-of-pumped-storage-hydropower-in-alaska/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ALASKA",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 25, 2023",The potential of pumped storage hydropower in Alaska,"Alaska, the nation’s largest state by area, is warming faster than any other U.S. state, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The state has unique energy needs due to its size, diverse landscape and remote, rural nature, and energy costs are high. In fact, Alaska has some of the highest electric rates (20.02 cents per kWh) per Energy Information Administration. A cost of living study by the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation revealed that utility costs in some cases are 33% higher than the national average.
Due to its size and rural nature, the state is not connected to large interstate energy grid like other states. Instead, Alaska has two larger transmission systems and more than 150 small, isolated systems serving remote communities.
Known for its oil reserves, Alaska relies on fossil fuel-based power. The state gets roughly 30% of its power from renewable energy, including wind, solar and water. While it has an insolation value close to that of Germany’s, Alaska has not embraced solar energy in a big way. With 18 MW of solar installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the state is ranked 49 in terms of total deployment capacity. While one deterrent to relying on solar may be the lack of sun in the winter, particularly in northern areas, they also have an equal number of days of sunshine. To fully embrace renewables in Alaska, energy storage would have to play a key role.
Scientists are looking at ways of integrating zero-carbon energy sources into the electric grid on a larger scale and are seeking cost-effective ways to store that energy to provide constant power. At the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory researchers studied the potential of pumped storage hydropower as an efficient way to store large amounts of energy and improve grid resiliency throughout Alaska.
Scientists at both labs collaborated on mapping and geospatial analysis to identify locations for pumped storage hydropower. According to the findings in the report The Prospects for Pumped Storage Hydropower in Alaska, about 1,800 sites in Alaska are suitable for the development of closed-loop pumped storage hydropower projects and many more are suitable for open loop pumped storage hydropower projects.
In contrast to conventional hydroelectric power, the way pumped storage hydropower works is it generates electricity when water is released from an upper reservoir through turbines into a lower reservoir. At night, when electricity is cheaper and abundant, the turbines are reversed to pump water back up into the elevated upper reservoir. Power is stored and released when needed.
“In Alaska, pumped storage hydropower has the potential to integrate more wind and solar into the power grid by storing excess renewable energy to balance intermittent periods of weather,” said Vladimir Koritarov, director of the Center for Energy, Environmental and Economic Systems Analysis (CEEESA) in Argonne’s Energy Systems and Infrastructure Analysis division. “We are not assuming that projects will be developed on all 1,800 sites, but there are plenty of locations available for potential development.”
The study focused on the pumped storage hydropower potential in Alaska’s integrated Railbelt system, which is an interconnected power grid made up of five regulated public utilities that runs from Fairbanks through Anchorage to the Kenai Peninsula. Currently about 80% of the Railbelt’s electricity comes from natural gas.
Argonne scientists created detailed models using A-LEAF (Argonne Low-Carbon Electricity Analysis Framework), an integrated national-scale simulation framework for power system operations and planning. They studied past and present energy transmission trends and analyzed growth expected in electricity demand over the next 25 years. A-LEAF also considered retiring existing generators as they reach their economic lifetime.
The findings showed that the Railbelt system will need both long- and short-duration energy storage, as pumped storage hydropower provides roughly 10 or more hours of energy storage. Lithium-ion batteries were identified as feasible for the short-term (four-hour) energy storage solution.
In addition to looking at the Railbelt area, scientists from the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) looked at the feasibility of powering remote areas with small microgrids in rural communities with at least 250 or more residents. The scientists used the HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables) model. The team identified 18 remote communities with potential for smaller pumped storage projects, although they found that pumped storage hydropower may not be economically feasible for remote areas due to the high investment cost of small-size pumped storage projects. They found that lithium-ion battery storage may be more economically beneficial in rural areas seeking to lower electricity costs, although this approach does not provide for long-term storage.
“In addition to identifying remote communities with optimal pumped storage hydropower resources and characteristics, the study included a sensitivity analysis of pumped storage hydropower capital costs and the price of diesel fuel,” said Rebecca Meadows, an NREL senior engineer.  “The goal was to determine at what point distributed scale-pumped storage hydropower projects could become economically viable.”
Meadows noted that in larger remote communities where diesel costs are high, the study found that pumped storage hydropower could be a cost-effective option depending on whether the site is conducive to renewable energy resources.
In addition to validating that pumped storage hydropower is a viable technology for use in Alaskan communities, the study offers guidance on developing clean energy policies and regulations and making investment decisions. As in the days of the Alaskan pipeline project, today’s pumped hydro projects can also pump dollars into the Alaskan economy. Developers are already inquiring about potential pumped storage hydropower developments in the state, Koritarov said.
