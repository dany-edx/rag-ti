The report highlights the New York City metropolitan utility’s Clean Energy Businesses investment of $400 million in renewables projects in 2022. As of December 31, the utility operated a total of 3.07 GW of solar and wind capacity assets.
With targets for distributed solar, energy storage and zero emissions vehicles, Con Edison utilities continue to work with state and federal policy makers and stakeholders to remove barriers to distributed generation (DG) interconnection.
In mid-2020, Con Edison and its Orange & Rockland County, N.Y. utilities published a five-year Distributed System Implementation Plan that serves as an Integrated Planning, Information Sharing and Market Services resource for residents and various stakeholders. The Implementation Plan is designed to encourage the stakeholder engagement process, and Con Edison expects to update the 2020 document in report due out in June.
Solar + EV adoption
The shift to electric vehicles is accelerating in New York and will play a critical role in the state’s integrated plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Con Edison’s PowerReady incentive program is among the largest of its kind in the U.S., offering utility support for new EV charging infrastructure. Just two years after its establishment, PowerReady has already reportedly supported the deployment of more than 2,600 EV chargepoints, with a goal of 19,000 chargepoints by 2025, and 400,000 by 2035.
Distributed solar is another market that is growing rapidly in New York City. Con Edison’s metropolitan customers, plus Westchester, Orange and Rockland counties have installed more than 60,000 solar systems to date, totaling 700 MW of capacity, adding new clean generation capacity. About 52, 000 distributed generation systems have been installed in Con Edison’s metropolitan territory, while more than 10,000 systems have been deployed in its Orange and Rockland county utilities’ service territory, the company said.
To complement New York’s growing distributed energy resources, Con Edison has installed smart meters across nearly its entire customer base. Smart meters allow customers to track their energy usage in near real time, while giving Con Edison deeper insight into its electric network, improving system efficiency and reducing the impact of service outages.
The author of this pv magazine USA report can confirm Con Edison has lived up to its distributed energy roadmap, having a smart meter installed into his apartment building in the borough of Queens just before the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020. He can also confirm the accessibility to procure community solar to offset his energy consumption via Con Edison from a rooftop warehouse solar generating facility in Long Island City, in the western terminus of the Queens borough.

Heat pumps
While residents and businesses continue to use natural gas and heating oil for heat and cooking throughout the year, Con Edison expects its deliveries of natural gas to decline significantly in the years ahead, as demand for electricity rises with the adoption of EVs and heat pumps.
The utility is supporting New York’s energy transition away from fossil fuel systems. The company has incentivized the installation of heat pumps and other clean heat technologies in more than 24,000 buildings, with a goal of electrifying 150,000 buildings by 2030.
Energy storage
Con Edison’s two main utility groups have a combined energy storage target of 1.5 GW deployed by 2025 and 6 GW by 2030, in line with the state of New York’s Energy Storage roadmap filed in December 2022.
With energy storage the utility anticipates storing energy produced by up and downstate wind and solar resources, which will allow for increased reliance on these clean but intermittent sources of electricity. Various storage assets will participate in NYISO’s wholesale market, the utility said.
Storage connected to distribution end points also provides opportunities to defer infrastructure build, such as non-wire solutions, enhance local reliability, support the deployment of EV charging, and help commercial and residential customers manage their bills.
Through 2022, Con Edison interconnected a total of 446 DG customer energy storage systems, totaling 24.6 MW of capacity, while its Orange and Rockland county utilities interconnected 403 projects with 19.1 MW of capacity.
BQDM storage RFP
Under the utility’s Non-Wire Solutions program, more than 4 MW of utility-scale energy storage systems were deployed through late 2022, with additional storage systems under contract for commercial operation in 2023 and 2024.
In 2022, Con Edison also announced incentives for customer-sited energy storage systems that provide demand relief in the Brooklyn-Queens Demand Management (BQDM) program area. The BQDM program is seeking project applications for up to 15 MW of grid-connected or load-following energy storage systems that will be in operation by summer 2026.
Con Edison has $69 billion of total assets under management and today traded for a $34 billion market capitalization. In March, Con Edison closed the divestment of its renewable energy division, Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, to German utility RWE AG in a $6.8 billion transaction.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/21/invested-in-our-planet-financing-the-clean-energy-transition/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 21, 2023",Invested in our planet: Financing the clean energy transition,"Earth Day was founded in 1970 as a call to protest the deterioration of the environment and to raise public consciousness of air and water pollution. At that time, the situation was dire as gas-guzzling automobiles took to the roads in record numbers, and oil spills, factory pollution, and wildlife extinction were accepted as simply a part of “doing business.”
Today, the adoption of electric vehicles and the transition to renewable energy is critical to reducing carbon emissions and fighting climate change—a societal and economic shift that has the potential to match the industrial revolution in scale.
A half-century later, the clean energy transition is more critical than ever. This transition will not happen on its own—it requires action.
The theme of this year’s Earth Day is “Invest in Our Planet,” something that feels particularly resonant in the context of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the single largest investment in climate and energy in American history.
As of January 1st, there is greater alignment between political will and institutional investment than ever before. The IRA allocated $369 billion to invest in energy security and combatting the climate crisis. It delivers a sea change for the energy storage sector because it provides an investment tax credit that covers 30% of the size of the investment—for the first time—to what is known as “standalone” energy storage. The tax credit can increase beyond 30% with various bonuses, including those tied to developing projects in low-income communities or using US-made products. Prior, energy storage was only eligible for the investment tax credit when paired with solar, also known as solar-plus-storage.
There has never been a more financially incentivized time to develop energy storage, which is the linchpin of the clean energy transition.
Money talks and plenty of it has already been put to work. According to Bloomberg NEF, a record $495 billion was invested in renewable energy in 2022, nearly $50 billion in the United States alone. From 2019 until the end of 2022, private-market equity investors launched more than 330 new sustainability, ESG, and impact funds, according to McKinsey. The cumulative assets under management in these funds grew threefold, from $90 billion to more than $270 billion.
At Convergent Energy and Power, we’ve experienced firsthand how the private sector has embraced—and continues to embrace—the clean energy transition. As recently as five years ago, energy storage, most often in the form of a battery energy storage system, was not on the radar of most businesses—or utilities—as a way to manage energy costs. Today, battery storage, often paired with solar generation (solar-plus-storage), offers organizations a proven way to reduce energy costs and support sustainability goals at the same time.
Convergent is proud to have developed energy storage systems with companies like Ford Motor Company and Shell New Energies to help reduce their electricity consumption during carbon-intensive grid peaks, which supports the long-term sustainability of the grid. We have also partnered with utilities including National Grid, which recognizes the value that solar-plus-storage provides to their customers.
We are invested in our planet. The dollars are there—now we need the sense. We need all stakeholders to recognize that energy storage is the linchpin of the clean energy transition. We need the consensus that the future of energy is already here.
While the threats to our planet feel imminent, so does the cleaner, healthier, and safer future that Earth Day inspired.
Johannes Rittershausen serves as Convergent’s chief executive officer and member of the board. Prior to co-founding Convergent, Johannes worked as a senior project manager in corporate strategic planning and the electric vehicle readiness unit at Southern California Edison from January 2007 to November 2011. Johannes holds a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, with a focus in Economics, from Pomona College and a Master of Arts from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Services.

Of the 1.7 MW, 660 kW will be mounted on a raised solar array that provides shaded parking space below. Electric vehicle charging ports will be integrated with the array.
Trimble, an industrial technology company serving architecture, engineering and construction services and geographic information systems markets, commissioned Namaste Solar to build the project, which recently commenced construction.
The 4.4-acre project will house 170 parking spots and 49 electric vehicle charging stations. The array is estimated to produce 2.57 million kWh of electricity per year, equivalent to burning 3,500 barrels of oil per year. It will also reduce strain on the grid by minimizing Trimble’s reliance on the grid during times of peak demand.
Trimble has committed to reducing its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, including emissions from the company’s facilities and vehicles, by 50% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline. It also targets 100% annual renewable energy sourcing by 2025. The two-building campus, which reportedly was built using Trimble’s advanced construction technologies, is LEED Gold and Silver certified.
Several of Trimble’s machines will be used for the installation, including robotic stations for surveying site layout and machine control for pile driving.
“We are committed to pursuing innovative renewable energy solutions in terms of their environmental benefit,” said Rob Painter, chief executive officer, Trimble. “This includes on-site generation of renewable energy from solar, which we are implementing or pursuing across a number of our global sites. Our goal for these projects is to generate our own renewable energy, and when possible, provide any excess energy production to the local electricity grid.”
Installer Namaste Solar is headquartered in Boulder, Colo., and is employee-owned, founded in 2005. The company has developed over 11,500 solar installations to date.
“We applaud Trimble’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint by investing in clean renewable solar energy,” said Rachel Mountain, co-owner and director of commercial and industrial sales at Namaste Solar. “Not only does this project advance Trimble’s clean energy goals, but it will also drive local economic growth and support over 50 good-paying green jobs in our community.”

As a result of this progress, Puerto Rico now ranks seventh among all U.S. states and territories in residential solar energy adoption per capita, according to net metering data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
Luma fully supports the growth of clean renewable energy; in fact, in a range of activities from connecting customers to rooftop solar, to interconnecting utility-scale renewable plants, to rebuilding and modernizing the electric grid, the over 3,000 men and women of Luma are accelerating the clean energy transformation for Puerto Ricans. Looking ahead, we are committed to working together with our customers, our regulator, elected leaders and other partners to establish Puerto Rico as a sustainable, clean energy leader for generations to come, said Wayne Stensby, president and CEO of Luma  
Luma Energy became the operator in Puerto Rico in 2021, replacing the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) in that role. The company launched an accelerated solar connection program that the company says provides customers with shorter wait times for approval. The program has increased customer connections to an average of 3,400 each month, Luma reports. In the 21 months since Luma assumed operations of the electric system, the company says that the number of interconnected residential solar customers has tripled compared to what was achieved in the previous decade, growing from approximately 24,000 to over 78,000 total solar connections.
“Luma has streamlined the net metering process, shortening average wait times to under 30 days. Luma’s centralized approach and collaboration with the solar and storage industry have driven steady growth in solar installations, ensuring energy resilience and savings for tens of thousands of Puerto Rican families. We look forward to our continued collaboration and expanding the adoption of renewable energy across the island,” said P.J. Wilson, executive director of the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico (SESA). 
In addition to advancing more home solar connections for customers, Luma reports it is working toward more than 1.3 GW of utility-scale renewable generation to Puerto Rico’s electric grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/21/u-s-warehouses-can-host-enough-solar-to-power-nearly-20-million-homes/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 21, 2023",U.S. warehouses can host enough solar to power nearly 20 million homes,"Nationwide, over 450,000 warehouses and distribution centers have 16.4 billion square feet of roof space. A report by Environment California and the Frontier Group estimates this offers the potential to generate enough electricity for about 19.4 million homes.
Generating this estimated 186 TWh of electricity would be equivalent to more than 112 million metric tons of carbon emissions avoided. This is equivalent to the emissions contribution of over 24 million gas-powered cars over the course of the year. It would also preserve an estimated 376,000 acres, nearly double the size of New York City, from being sacrificed for electricity generation.
California alone is home to over 66,000 warehouses and distribution centers with 1.5 billion square feet of roof surface area, soaking up sun, ready to be turned into distributed clean energy generation centers. The electricity demand of nearly 5 million California homes could be met by installing solar on these buildings.
The report noted that Florida, Illinois, Georgia and Texas have great potential, as well, and contains an interactive map for viewing each state’s solar warehouse potential.
Placing electricity generation closer to where it is needed reduces line losses, which occur when electricity travels along imperfect conductive wires. The Energy Information Administration reports that 5.2% of gross electricity generation is lost to transmission line losses. Furthermore, placing generation closer to demand centers reduces the need for expensive and land-intensive transmission infrastructure.
Altogether, the report estimates that warehouses on average could produce 176% of their annual energy needs, allowing them to export excess production to their communities.
The environmental organizations recommend that warehouse and distribution center decision makers investigate, catalog and report energy use and climate effects of their business. Wielding political influence, these industry leaders can advocate for supportive policies for solar on warehouses.
(Read: “New Jersey warehouse operator provides community solar access to 700 residents“) 
The report also recommends that political leaders at every level support legislation like net metering, feed-in tariffs, and value-of-solar payments to boost this market. Enabling financing tools like third-party and Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-OACE) financing can help remove barriers to adoption. Streamlining and lowering costs of solar permitting and interconnection costs would make the process easier and faster as well, it said.
Heading into Earth Day, Environment California will be joined by former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to host a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a rooftop solar array on a 180,000 square foot warehouse in Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger will ceremonially “plug in” the panels and speak about the benefits of such projects.
“Putting solar on warehouse roofs is not just a great environmental decision, it’s also a smart business decision. More warehouse owners should use these ideal spots to produce clean energy, avert harmful pollution, increase the value of their property, and save on their electricity bills,” said Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea at the Port of Los Angeles.

Designed to fit into a shipping container for ease of transportation, the system can produce up to 75,000 liters of clean water per day, and each system is designed to last for 20 years.
In designing the systems, the GivePower team approached Clean Power Research about using SolarAnywhere, a tool that provides satellite-based solar data. The company chose SolarAnywhere in part because it provides data across remote regions where ground-based measurements are unavailable. Its team uses the solar data to determine project viability and optimize water system designs for specific locations.
The company’s engineers have found that using the solar data can better size Solar Water Farms for specific requirements of each project, thus reducing costs while ensuring each water system produces clean water for the community year round.
Solar Water Farm Max specifications can vary depending on available modules as well as system energy needs, which can vary based on site specifics like depth of borehole and salinity of water. A basic system provides about 65 kW(DC) of power with 135 kWh of storage.

A system of this size produces about 75,000 liters of water per day, which can be delivered using a 10,000 liter water truck, or third-party distributors.  Customers can also just come to the water site to fill jerry cans manually. GivePower also has a smaller size system called Mobi that they use in smaller towns. The Mobi is sized between 10 kW and 13 kW(DC) with 27 kWH to 40.5 kWh of storage, capable of producing 10,000 to 15,000 liters of water a day, which is delivered by an 800-liter tuk tuk rickshaw in the local area.
To date, GivePower has helped deliver clean power and water to underserved communities in more than 26 countries across Africa, Asia, North America, and Latin America. Solar Water Farms have been installed in Kenya, Haiti and Colombia, among other countries.
In addition to providing water to remote areas, GivePower focuses on providing just renewable energy systems to underserved communities. The group developed the first indigeous-owned solar park. Working with Indigenized Energy, they launched a 300 kW solar farm on the Standing Rock reservation. The project began in 2016 during the pipeline fight, when GivePower provided systems to support the water protectors in the camps. They identified the need for more permanent renewable energy, and got to work on the solar farm.
The GivePower Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Austin, Texas, which is committed to extending the environmental and social benefits of renewable energy around the globe. Theresa Sweeney, senior engineering manager at GivePower, told pv magazine USA that one of the things that is important to her is how the Solar Water Farms empower people, as they not only bring fresh water to communities, but they hire and train people to help maintain the plants and sell the water, enabling people launch small businesses to help provide for their household.

Once installation is completed, the solar panels will provide approximately 90% of on-site energy usage at each store location in California, New Jersey and Illinois.
DSD Renewables, a New York-based commercial and industrial solar developer, is installing 85.3 MW of solar on top of 55 Lowe’s stores in California (42.17 MW) and 36 stores and three distribution centers in Illinois (43.13 MW). These projects are expected to generate 123.6 GWh per year of clean power.
Greenskies Clean Focus, a Connecticut-based commercial, municipal and utility-scale developer, will install rooftop systems at 52 Lowe’s retail stores and two distribution centers in California. The initial production for the combined 48 MW portfolio is projected at 76 GWh per year, providing 90% of the energy usage at each location.
Infiniti Energy, a New Jersey-based solar power developer and independent power producer, has installed solar on 20 Lowe’s stores in New Jersey to date, totalling 22.9 MW. Brought online last August, they have produced an average 11 GWh. Infiniti plans to complete installations at six additional Lowe’s stores this year.
This investment in rooftop solar continues Lowe’s recent sustainability progress, including achieving its 2025 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, relative to 2016 emissions levels. In addition, the installations will help Lowe’s reduce its operational emissions and reach its goal of having its operations powered with 50% renewable energy by 2030.
“At Lowe’s, we are focused on operating responsibly and reducing our impact on the environment,” said Chris Cassell, vice president of corporate sustainability at Lowe’s. “Investing in renewable energy lowers operating costs and is an important step in reducing emissions associated with our stores and distribution centers. This initial rooftop solar portfolio is one example of the collaboration we seek with partners as we work toward our long-term and interim net-zero goals.”

At a “flip the switch” event held in the Montana city this week, officials christened the municipal solar project, which Ameresco will maintain under a 25-year solar energy agreement that had zero upfront cost to the municipality, the companies said.
The solar facility consists of 948 ground-mounted panels and represents the largest behind-the-meter solar project in Montana to date. The facility is projected to produce 700,000 kWh each year of clean energy and offset about 20% of the wastewater treatment facility’s energy consumption, saving the city $7,000 per year in energy costs and 8,000 tons of CO2 emissions from being burned.
“Our city has a long track record of implementing forward-thinking conservation and climate change measures and the completion of the solar PV array at our wastewater treatment facility is another demonstration of our commitment to sustainability,” said Ross Mollenhauer, engineering manager for Missoula.
Construction of the facility began in the Summer of 2022 and completed in March 2023.
In January 2013, the Missoula City Council adopted the Conservation and Climate Action Plan (CCAP) with a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. As part of the CCAP, the city implemented a number of initiatives and projects to support citywide decarbonization.
As a non-export solar PV system, electricity generated by the solar system will be consumed on site, reducing operating costs and emissions associated with the wastewater treatment processes.
Montana is ranked 30th in the U.S. for renewable energy generation, with more than 1.5 GW of wind, solar and storage capacity reserves, while the state sees just shy of 15% of its electricity produced by renewables, according to American Clean Power. Yet through Q4 2022, Montana was ranked 44thin the country for solar, with only 133 MW of installed capacity, or enough to power 17,410 homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The state’s largest investor-owned utility, NorthWestern Energy, has historically fought the development of solar projects in excess of 5 MW to date, with developers typically embroiled in litigation over the cost imparted on the utility for distributed solar projects and small utility projects in the Big Sky state.
Ameresco, based in Framingham, Mass., is a 23-year old energy efficiency, renewable gas, solar and energy storage systems company which has built projects for the municipal and state governments, universities and hospital market. As of December 31, 2022, Ameresco owned or operated 132 solar and battery assets out of a 162 total power plant portfolio.
In 2022, Ameresco reported $1.82 billion in total revenue, up from $1.21 billion in 2021. The company reports about 7.4% of its annual revenue comes from the sale of solar products and systems as well as energy management solutions.
