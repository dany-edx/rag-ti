Analysts from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis (JISEA), and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) analyzed case studies of the first commercialization of four clean energy technologies: thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, wind turbines, dual-stage evaporators for refrigeration, and fuel cells for material handling equipment.
Findings across the case studies—published in a Frontiers in Energy Research article—revealed three components common to successful advancement to commercialization: (1) a good fit among public-private partnerships, R&D infrastructure, and the technology itself; (2) appropriate alignment of government regulations, R&D priorities, and market forces; and (3) the right timing between technology readiness and market opportunity.
“These findings can help inform clean energy investment decision-making, maximize benefits from R&D, and advance transition to a productive, low-emission future,” said Wyatt Merrill, DOE technology manager and co-author.
The thin-film solar case study focuses on First Solar, a U.S.-based manufacturer that benefited from DOE solar research, and directly received DOE funding in research partnerships from the 1980s to 2000s. The researchers credit First Solar’s early success to the fact that the company addressed regulatory needs within the thin-film PV technology’s first major market and established a proven product at a price and time for a market that was ready for it.
A notable advance in the early stages of thin-film research demonstrated a record (at the time) of 15.8% cell using a cadmium chloride (CdCl2) heat treating process. First Solar co-developed a high-rate vapor transport deposition manufacturing technique to produce CdTe-based modules at a larger scale, which was an alternative to the slower, costlier close space sublimation manufacturing process. With suitable device efficiency and scalable manufacturing procedures in place, the R&D focus shifted to testing and validation of product reliability. First Solar used testing standards, product quality certifications, and outdoor testing facilities funded by DOE and led by Arizona State University and NREL to prove by 2003 that its modules were ready to enter the solar market.
First Solar entered the strong Germany solar market in the 2000s. But first its modules needed to meet energy performance and regulatory requirements, which included electronic waste regulation and restrictions on the use of certain toxic substances like cadmium. A 2004 effort helped resolve concerns about emissions and recyclability of CdTe PV modules with independent, peer-reviewed studies. Later in 2004, First Solar secured its first contract for its compound thin semiconductor modules in the German PV market, which was a commercial turning point for CdTe PV. In 2005, First Solar announced a module takeback and recycling program to respond to evolving EU policy directives, an effort that helped communicate First Solar’s responsiveness to regulatory issues, and they addressed public perception of risk sufficiently to access key markets.
While CdTe modules are less efficient than silicon-based panels, they cost less to manufacture and achieved the lowest price per watt from the mid-2000s until the mid-2010s. At the same time, demand for PV products in Europe outpaced supply, and First Solar was able to capitalize on its technology.
“The thin-film PV case study shows the importance of addressing regulatory needs within the technology’s first major market,” said Marie Mapes, DOE technology manager and co-author. “In addition, establishing a proven product at a price and time when the market was ready for it led to its early success.”
The key findings in the thin-film PV case study identified the successful use of three key commercialization strategies: development of technology with many commercially relevant inputs through public/private partnerships, alignment of set technology cost goals and product development that achieved them, and timing compatibility of technology readiness and market opportunity. First Solar’s thin-film development benefited from government funding over decades, which enabled foundational materials research and consistent testing standards. What resulted was a prepared company with the right product at the right time. CdTe photovoltaics of proven reliability were a lower-cost replacement in a clean energy market with an open window of opportunity, allowing the early commercialization success of this solar technology.
The four case studies highlight how a good balance of technology, R&D, and public-private partnership—along with regulatory and market force alignment and the right timing—can lead to successful first commercialization of clean energy technologies.

Freepoint Energy Solutions announced in April that it will be offering electricity commodity supply to commercial and industrial customers in New York.  Customers located in the service territory of Con Edison, New York State Electric & Gas, National Grid, Rochester Gas & Electric, and Central Hudson are eligible to participate in solar procurement with the company.
According to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority’s solar map database, Greene County has just over 33 MW of installed solar capacity across approximately 55 residential rooftops and four commercial projects installed. The county boasts a local cost of solar energy of $1.78 per watt, $0.03 lower than the state average of $1.81 per watt.
Separately, Freepoint Solar finalized pre-construction development and closed on the sale of the 4.99 MW(dc) Woodville Solar project in Richmond, Rhode Island, to Brookfield Renewable Partners.
Woodville Solar will be comprised of approximately 12,600 solar panels installed on an abandoned turf farm. The project has received all permits for construction and operation. Rhode Island residents can elect to participate in the CSA program through the Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth Program, administered by Rhode Island Energy.
“The Coxsackie and Woodville projects are a subset of our 300 MW advanced development portfolio serving wholesale, utility and mass market customers throughout the Northeast,” said Peter Ford, managing director of Freepoint Solar. “We are pleased to provide our Central Hudson mass market customers with renewable energy service in addition to guaranteed savings off their utility bills.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/07/even-with-tariffs-in-place-theres-still-room-for-growth-in-solar-installations/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 7, 2022","Even with tariffs in place, there’s still room for growth in solar installations","On Thursday, December 2, the U.S. Department of Commerce released their preliminary opinion (long version) that certain Chinese solar cell and module companies used Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam to assemble solar modules, thus allowing their products to be imported to the United States without paying import tariffs.
The ruling is nuanced. Though it specifically pushes against solar cells from China, it leaves plenty of wiggle room for Chinese companies to comply. Four companies, three of which are clearly Chinese and use mostly Chinese polysilicon, were not found to be circumventing the ruling. The ruling also seems to extend an olive branch for those companies still using Chinese solar cells to differentiate their supply chain and regain access to the U.S. marketplace.
Additionally, the Biden administration has paused the tariffs of this ruling until June 6, 2024, giving the U.S. solar manufacturing industry a chance to grow. However, Roth Capital expects that there will be a lawsuit against the Biden tariff delay.
It’s also important to remember that this is only a preliminary ruling, and that there may be refinements and guidance coming from the Commerce Department by the date of the final determination: May 1, 2023.

The original document has two key sentences to consider, noting “these circumvention inquiries cover”:
The first point highlights that wafers and cells coming from China are a key point of consideration. The document also states that these anti-circumvention tariffs are the same as those implemented in the 2012 case, and have been adjusted every two years.
The second point seems to say that a company defined as circumventing could still export solar modules to the U.S., provided that at least four of the six listed components are manufactured outside of China.
Industry analyst Clean Energy Associates (CEA) seems to confirm this logic, and provides some nuance, in a document it published.
CEA notes that a significant volume of solar cells and wafers made in southeast Asia by the largest solar manufacturers in the world – Jinko, JA Solar, LONGi, Trina – have the opportunity to legally avoid the tariffs.
In fact, one of the world’s largest Chinese manufacturers of solar modules – Jinko Solar – was not found to be circumventing at all. It was suggested by others that Jinko was found to be in compliance by Commerce because they manufacture solar cells in Vietnam for their factory in Malaysia.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/07/dont-let-the-solar-lights-go-out-in-california/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",,"DECEMBER 7, 2022",Don’t let the solar lights go out in California,"Leading the way on cutting carbon dioxide from electric utilities and automobile tailpipes, California has for years provided financial incentives that make clean energy options like electric vehicles and rooftop solar affordable for millions of working- and middle-class families. These families represent by far the largest block of the million-plus California households that installed rooftop solar, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
But it could soon be lights out for California’s long, consequential record, which has made the state the nation’s leader in fighting the climate crisis with smart, economically savvy policies. State regulators are proposing to undermine the wildly popular solar program. 
The California Public Utilities Commission issued a proposal last month that would slash by a whopping 75% the credits any new solar customers would get for surplus energy their rooftop panels generate and sell back to the grid. The credits are the core of the solar program, which helps budget-conscious families keep their monthly electric bills low and defray the upfront costs of installing solar.
As captive California ratepayers see their bills soar, there’s never been a more important time to promote the climate and economic benefits of rooftop solar. If finalized, the credit cut would put solar financially out of reach for those who are hardest hit by high bills.
Nevada regulators adopted a similar plan in 2015, and the state’s once-flourishing rooftop solar market evaporated almost overnight, as detailed in the Environment California report, Rooftop Solar at Risk.
Allowing the solar market in California to tank too would be a disaster for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ambitious efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle the worst catastrophes of the climate crisis. We’re already seeing them play out in costly and deadly wildfires often sparked by damaged utility transmission lines and historic drought.
Since the state initiated the residential solar program, annual growth has soared by as much as 62% a year. This is a problem for monopoly utilities, which see their profits threatened as more families and small businesses take advantage of the incentives and install solar, the only source of competition the utilities face.
Pacific Gas & Electric and California’s other two investor-owned power companies are behind the proposal to decimate the solar program, which has helped to install more than 1.5 million homes, small businesses, churches, and schools with solar. The clean energy source makes up about 10% of the state’s electricity generation.
The utilities’ efforts to undermine rooftop solar began a decade ago, when the Edison Electric Institute, the main trade and lobby group for the power sector, delivered a presentation before utility executives warning that increased rooftop solar will lead to “declining retail sales,” and a “loss of customers” and could spell “potential obsolescence” for profit-driven utilities. “Industry must prepare an action plan to address the challenges,” it said.
Restricting rooftop solar and its critical role in helping California fight the climate crisis just to boost utilities’ profits would almost certainly lead to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions. That’s because the power companies would need to expand the use of polluting natural gas to make up for the electricity lost with a plunging solar sector.
California has committed to achieving 60% renewable electricity by 2030, 90% zero carbon energy by 2035 and 100% renewable, zero-carbon by 2045. Its own modeling shows roughly the same amount of rooftop solar must be added each year to meet those goals. Other experts believe far more rooftop solar arrays on homes, schools, businesses, and other structures will be needed to meet those emissions reduction targets.
If Governor Newsom wants to protect his pioneering climate legacy, it’s time for him to flex his political power and demand his hand-picked utility commissioners scrap the solar proposal. Instead, they should start over by identifying ways to make it even easier for struggling California households to reap the benefits of the clean energy source. Let’s keep rooftop solar growing and ensure California’s bright environmental leadership shines on.

In Deloitte’s 2023 Renewable Energy Outlook, the global consulting group argues market headwinds are expected to persist through the better part of 2023, with growth to be unlocked in 2024.
The U.S. added 5.7 GW of utility solar projects and 7.5 GW of wind power in the first eight months of 2022, a decrease of 26% and 8%, respectively, compared to the comparable 2021 term. Nevertheless, solar and wind capacity accounted for 70% of the new capacity added with the share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy increasing from 21% to 23% year-over-year.
2023 drivers for renewable energy growth include:
Bottlenecks muzzle growth
U.S. manufacturers produced 5 GW of solar modules in 2021, falling well short of the 20 GW of solar capacity needed over the same year, Deloitte says.  One of the main pillars of the IRA is to incentivize the domestic manufacturing of solar panels, advanced battery production, offshore wind turbine components and various other products to fuel energy transition independence in the U.S.
Two months after the IRA’s passing, Deloitte calculated $28 billion in new manufacturing investment in the solar, battery and EV manufacturing verticals had been already announced.  Enel and First Solar committed to building solar manufacturing capacity, expand additional plants and developing a supply chain from raw materials through modules.
While this is good news for renewables supply chain, a Deloitte survey of power sector executives found that 56% of those surveyed said it could take two to three years to ease supply chain constraints.
Energy equity
With 44% of U.S. households defined as low-income, the IRA is incentivizing the development of projects such as community solar to provide greater access to the cost savings from co-located solar development.
Clean energy projects eligible for the IRA’s 30% investment tax credit can add 10% to 20% of bonus credit if the project is located in an “environmental justice” area.
In another Deloitte survey, 46% of power sector executives said their company plans to build renewable energy projects in low-income communities in the coming years.
Offshore wind
The offshore wind market has grown to more than 40 GW of sited generating capacity in 12 states, with 1 GW currently under construction and 19 GW in the permitting phase.
With another 20 GW of offshore wind in the siting and planning phases, the next few years could be critical for unlocking growth in renewable energy as part of funding and tax incentives from the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021.
In 2023 the industry is expected to address challenges including financing and construction risk, transmission grid upgrades, and a shortage of vessels and port infrastructure to support the rollout of offshore wind projects.  In the past two years, 10 domestic manufacturing facilities were announced at East Coast ports while the IRA tax credits could spur additional investments in offshore wind.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/07/transmission-needed-to-carry-wind-power-from-the-central-u-s-eastward-doe-finds/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"DECEMBER 7, 2022","Transmission needed to carry wind power from the central U.S. eastward, DOE finds","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has published early results from its ongoing national transmission planning study.
To reach 100% clean electricity by 2035, the geographic distribution of cost-optimal transmission additions is “robust across many sensitivities,” DOE reported in a slide deck for a webinar, with the highest density of transmission additions connecting the “wind belt” in the central U.S. with eastern demand centers, as shown in the nearby image.

Both maps in the image reflect a scenario with high electricity demand that reaches 100% clean electricity by 2035. The map with green lines shows optimal additions of alternating current (AC) transmission without connecting the nation’s three interconnections (Eastern, Western, and ERCOT in Texas). The map with red lines reflects the optimal transmission buildout with both AC and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission, when allowing new transmission across the interconnections.
Solar and wind power would provide 79% of total generation in 2035, including 134 GW of distributed solar, under the core modeling assumptions for a grid that reaches 100% clean electricity by 2035 with high electricity demand. The remaining generation would be provided by a mix of sources, as shown by the bars at the left side of the nearby image. High electric demand by 2035 is modeled as being on the path to reaching net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050.

Characterizing the results to date as “valuable early insights,” Carl Mas, a senior advisor at DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, said on the webinar that “the numerical results will change over time, in part based on future detailed modeling” through next year.
The core modeling assumptions use “moderate” projected future costs of solar, wind and storage capacity, drawn from the “moderate” scenario in the Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) prepared by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In one sensitivity analysis, the study uses costs for solar and storage from ATB’s “advanced technology,” or lower-cost scenario, while another sensitivity analysis uses ATB’s lower-cost scenario for wind capacity costs. A “more distributed PV” scenario models 190 GW of that resource by 2035.
DOE did not disclose its source for cost projections for new technologies shown in the image above, including carbon capture and storage (CCS) based on direct air capture (DAC), and small modular nuclear reactors (SMR).
After the study team identifies “the most compelling scenarios,” the team will select a subset of scenarios to conduct more detailed analysis, said Hamody Hindi, a transmission planning engineer with DOE, on the webinar.
Through that process, Hindi said, “we’re trying to identify those high value [transmission] expansion options that perform well in most, if not all, the future scenarios that we’re analyzing.” The results, he said, would be “a starting point for a conversation; we want to work with regional planners to take those identified options to the next level of development, to ultimately try to get steel in the ground where appropriate, or to upgrade existing corridors using appropriate technology.”
Even under current policy, Hindi said additional transmission capacity equal to 20% to 70% of current capacity would be needed.
DOE is conducting a separate Atlantic offshore wind transmission study, and hopes to perform additional offshore wind transmission studies for other regions, said Maria Robinson, director of DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, on the webinar.
The National Transmission Planning Study is being conducted jointly by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, with support and direction from the Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office.
DOE has posted online the webinar and slide deck, describing the national transmission planning study and its early results.
DOE also has a web page for a national transmission needs study, which suggests that the study will overlap with the national transmission planning study.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/07/biden-admin-seeks-3-billion-for-rooftop-solar-and-storage-in-puerto-rico/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,PUERTO RICO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 7, 2022",Biden admin seeks $3 billion for rooftop solar and storage in Puerto Rico,"The Biden Administration has issued a request to Congress to fund a $3 billion buildout of rooftop solar and energy storage in Puerto Rico to make a more climate-resilient energy grid.
The funds would be provided to the Grid Deployment Office account of the Department of Energy (DOE), providing grants to low-income households in Puerto Rico to purchase and install solar and battery storage systems and energy distribution technology. The administration said these systems can increase resilience for households during blackouts and outages resulting from natural disasters.
Puerto Rico has suffered widespread blackout after blackout as hurricanes continue to intensify and knock out existing infrastructure. In 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria led to long-lasting widespread blackouts and the deaths of over 4,000 people. The damage to the grid took over 11 months to repair and reactivate.
“Equipping the most vulnerable households with rooftop solar could quite literally save lives. These families deserve the same access to energy security as the people who are already buying solar panels and batteries in droves,” said Raúl Grijalva, House Natural Resources Committee Chair.
A growing number of Puerto Ricans have adopted rooftop solar, but the majority continue to rely on the central power grid or backup diesel-fired generators. Electricity blackouts have exacerbated public health crises and researchers estimate there was a 62% increase in mortality in the three months directly following Maria’s landfall.
Following the landfall of Hurricane Fiona in 2021, solar-plus-storage systems played an instrumental role in keeping the lights on while the centralized grid was down. Sunnova Energy International reported that its solar and battery storage systems powered the homes of over 30,000 customers in Puerto Rico during the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona, from September 18 to October 1, 2022, while the grid was down.
During those two weeks, most residents in Puerto Rico were without power, Sunnova reports that its SunSafe solar-plus-storage systems generated a total of nearly 2 GWh of energy total with 3.4 million hours of aggregate back-up power, or an average of 128 hours of power generated per household.  These customers averaged 5.3 days of solar-plus-storage battery backup with many residents remaining dependent on their Sunnova system for more than 10 days.
“Out of our more than 30,000 Sunnova SunSafe systems in Puerto Rico, only 59 required repair in the two weeks following the Hurricane, and Sunnova dispatched crews immediately to repair or replace non-performing systems, whether they were leased or owned,” said Michael Grasso, chief marketing and growth officer of Sunnova. “Looking ahead, we see an opportunity for distributed power to play a larger role in Puerto Rico by networking our solar + storage systems into powerful virtual power plants that would complement the centralized electric system and drive increased grid resiliency.”
The Biden administration also requested $35 million is for technical assistance to other agencies, local entities, and communities throughout Puerto Rico to assist with energy recovery and grid modernization activities; and salaries and travel expenses for dedicated DOE staff for Puerto Rico. These activities include convening stakeholders to prioritize near-term investments and develop mitigation strategies against future storms and working directly with communities to design specific energy solutions.
Analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that Puerto Rico has 40GW of solar potential. NREL modeled pathways to the targets set by Puerto Rico’s Act 17: 20% renewable generation by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050.
NREL reported that Puerto Rico has 20 GW of utility-scale solar potential, mostly along the coasts, and 20 GW of distributed solar potential. Just 10 GW of solar could meet Puerto Rico’s needs, as estimated by Solar + Energy Storage Association (SESA) president PJ Wilson.
SESA’s Chief Policy Officer Javier Rúa said the NREL study of Puerto Rico’s solar potential “represents the commitment that we’ve seen by the Biden administration and the agencies to help Puerto Rico fulfill its self-legislated goal to 100 percent renewables.” Wilson said the study will be “a big step towards every Puerto Rican having solar and storage and completely resilient power during the next hurricane.”

It is also a natural gas state. It produces large amounts of natural gas as a primary fuel used for energy production, with coal and nuclear power following closely behind.  
Currently Arkansas has a small but increasing amount of solar power generating capacity, which accounted for about 10% of the state’s renewable electricity generation in 2021; an 18x increase from 2016.  
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), in mid-2022 the state still ranked 30th in the U.S. for solar generating capacity overall with 587.9 MW of total solar capacity, with 177.1 MW of project installations in 2021. 
Image: SEIA
But according to the Midcontinent System Operator interconnection queue filing, Arkansas represents 1.65 GW of the MISO region’s 5.77 GW of new solar and energy storage project development, a large buildout proposition for a state which in recent years faired in the bottom two dozen states for solar as represented by SEIA.  
According to the Southern Renewable Energy Association, a clean energy advocacy group, more than $28 billion in investment opportunities lie in the Arkansas solar market out of the group’s forecast of 25.3 GW of long-term solar development opportunities.   
Arkansas still does not have a Renewable Energy Portfolio standard as of late 2022, according to the EIA.  In 2010, the PSC created a Sustainable Energy Resources (SER) Action Guide, which required investor-owned utilities to reduce electric sales and natural gas sales compared to a 2010 baseline. 
Net metering 
Despite no statewide RPS, Arkansas’ PSC does allow net metering, enabling households with small, customer-sited solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable installations no larger than 25 kW to receive credits from utilities to sell excess electricity back to the grid.  
Businesses with renewable power systems up to 300 kW in capacity are also eligible to receive the same incentives for net metering as residential customers. 
In May 2022, the Arkansas Court of Appeals ruled in favor of solar power, upholding the rate structure for net metering, which previously had stated that solar customers would receive the full retail rate for excess energy they send to the grid.  The Appeals court ruling ended a tumultuous battle among the PSC, solar companies including Scenic Hill Solar, and rural electric cooperatives including the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. and Petit Jean Electric Cooperative of Clinton.   
Entergy for its part had requested a reduction in the current $0.10 cents/kilowatt-hour net metering rate. But the Arkansas PSC voted on June 1 to retain the current 1-to-1 full retail credit for net excess generation, for both residential and commercial customers. 
In January 2022, the state began two programs to expand EV charging infrastructure. One program provides rebates to government and non-profit groups that install Level 2 charging stations and the second program offers funding assistance for three DC fast charging stations. 
Entergy turning a green page
Entergy Arkansas operates a service territory that encompasses more than 80% of the state’s land area, while a western band of the state is divided among rural electric cooperatives, AEP SWEPCO and Oklahoma Gas & Electric, with 12 communities that also provide their own electricity. 
Before this year, many argued the state appeared to be moving slowly to adopt widespread solar next to its coveted gas and coal-fired power plants.  However, utility Entergy Arkansas revised its 2021 IRP mid-year.   
On June 30, 2022, the out-of-state investor-owned utility filed a request for proposal for 1 GW  of solar and wind generation resources, to enter operations between May 2025 and December 2026. Then Entergy held another climate change meeting and brought its long-term renewables proposal to 4 GW of new capacity by 2030.  
At the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference, an MOU between Entergy Arkansas and the U.S. General Services Administration was announced focused on achieving net zero energy resources in the company’s service territory.  
Entergy Arkansas, the state’s largest utility company owned by New Orleans-based Entergy, filed a 2021 integrated resource plan, which from 2023 to 2042 will see the Arkansas utility company shift away from natural gas combined cycle gas turbines and other baseload generation in favor of more renewable energy resources coming online such as its first three solar projects. 
Prior to revising its 2021 IRP this year with net zero goals, the bulk of the utility’s energy transition was fueled by natural gas combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) facilities, with less than a few hundred MW of anticipated solar capacity. But following the utility’s 2022 shift, Entergy Arkansas’ fuel mix shifted to include more than 4 GW of new solar, energy storage and some wind developments. 
It’s worth noting that Entergy Arkansas has the highest capital spend plan of all Entergy’s utilities for new generation sources in the coming years, with Arkansas as the only state to see $1 billion devoted to new generation investments in 2024 alone, up from $455 million in 2023, reflecting the shift from old baseload generation to new renewables resources.  
Two remaining Arkansas coal-fired generating plants, White Bluff (1.8 GW) and Independence (1.7 GW), may be shut down by 2026 timeframe rather than 2028 as originally planned, said the SREA, well ahead of schedule on 2030 net zero plans.  The curtain call for the coal resources provides a large enough displacement for new solar, storage and wind developments to fill.
Entergy
 
Landmark solar installations
Arkansas’ two largest solar farms each have 100 MW of generating capacity and came online over the last two years. 
The Chicot Solar Farm in Lake Village, Arkansas came online in September 2020. The project has 350,000 solar panels spread over 825 acres and supplies enough power for 18,000 homes.  The project was developed by NextEra Energy Resources and is the second of four solar projects be procured for Entergy Arkansas under a 20-year power purchase agreement. 
Entergy’s third solar project, Searcy Solar farm, is located northeast of Little Rock and came online in January 2022. Searcy marks the first solar plus energy storage deployment in the state with storage capacity of 10 MW (30 MWh) of capacity and was installed by NextEra. 
Entergy’s first solar project to come online was Stuttgart Solar, an 81 MW facility located in Arkansas County about 55 miles east of Little Rock. The project was activated in 2018 and provides $8 million in additional tax revenue to the county.  
Future projects in the state are aiming bigger and bolder. Driver Solar, a 250 MW solar facility being developed by Lightsource bp, is expected to enter commercial scale operations in late 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/07/next-generation-factories-promise-a-brighter-future-for-solar-manufacturing/,"GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 7, 2022",Next-generation factories promise a brighter future for solar manufacturing,"Climate change and energy crises continue to dominate headlines and exert pressure to produce clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels. With policy developments in the United States, such as the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, investments in domestic manufacturing appear to be set to grow at an unprecedented pace as manufacturers work to meet the moment with expanded capacity.
From a production standpoint, the key to enabling this growth efficiently and sustainably lies in digital transformations for scalable and cost-effective manufacturing of solar energy components. Let’s examine the hyperautomation and digital twin initiative we undertook at First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR), for a master class in how the industry can optimize production, drive cost per watt down and shorten energy payback time.
Factory of the future
All manufacturers struggle with modern challenges that include pandemic-related production slowdowns, talent shortages, high sourcing costs and overall supply chain upheaval. For solar technology manufacturers like First Solar, the last two years have prompted a pivot away from the legacy approach of hub-based manufacturing and towards the strategic siting of new manufacturing capacity close to demand.
In such a pivot, competitiveness is enabled by enhanced efficiencies, which, in turn, require digital transformation and automation to modernize the solar manufacturing environment. This was the goal of First Solar, the only U.S.-headquartered company among the world’s ten largest solar manufacturers and a leading global manufacturer of advanced thin film photovoltaic (PV) technology. With a fully vertically integrated manufacturing process that is among the most advanced and efficient in the solar manufacturing industry, First Solar is uniquely suited to further embrace digital transformation to create a “factory of the future.”
A factory of the future is founded on breaking down information silos and streamlining the flow of data – from the shop floor to the top floor – to enhance visibility and intelligent decision support across all manufacturing and operations. Organizations that succeed in this create what’s known as digital thread, a seamless flow of data that runs through the entire organization.
Digital thread, in turn, brings to life digital twins. These virtual replicas of physical operations are finely detailed and exact in mirroring and predicting impacts to any contemplated changes in workflows, machinery, controls and systems. Mature digital twin capabilities can support virtual commissioning and emulation of PLC codes, immersive instruction and training visualizations for equipment operators, advanced design prototyping, and other capabilities that optimize production.
These advantages are amplified in solar production. That’s because panel manufacturing is mid-to-high volume, with processes and workflows that First Solar sought to optimize through faster cycle times, higher cascade yields and industry leading tact times. Production flow throughout the factory is critical to achieve peak throughput, and First Solar saw an opportunity to leverage virtual testing of layout design and control strategies to maximize production throughput.
With the help of Kalypso, First Solar laid out a strategy to leverage digital twin and related smart manufacturing systems for a more connected, data-intensive operation that would provide unprecedented visibility and control around production flow of current and future operations. Added capabilities include advanced analysis of production data to predict and prevent issues; closed-loop auto-resolution of production anomalies; and enhanced visualizations like immersive virtual reality (VR) tools to streamline collaboration and triaging of issues.
Real-world benefits
The digital transformation efforts, including the benefits of digital twins, enabled First Solar’s efforts to scale manufacturing of responsibly produced PV modules that support America’s transition to a decarbonized future. This helps First Solar improve productivity while achieving significantly lower costs, waste, and energy payback times.
To fully understand the application and benefits of the technology, the Kalypso team worked with First Solar to develop and deploy a digital twin pilot to a bottleneck part of an existing factory that was being retooled. A digital twin was used to simulate infeed/outfeed and material handling of the area including identifying optimum routing of the solar panels and placement of a buffer to maximize production output. This model also helped test multiple scenarios and proactively anticipate bottlenecks in the area. All of this was done virtually using a digital twin that replicated production line scenarios.
Based on outcomes of the pilot phase, a digital twin is being developed to optimize operations across First Solar’s newest manufacturing factory in Ohio, which is expected to come online in the first half of 2023.  Virtual modeling helps inform production layout and processes for all 20 manufacturing zones that make up the factory – optimizing everything from workflows and equipment placement to materials transfer, maintenance cycles and more. Throughout, First Solar uses “copy smart” factory scaling techniques to ensure manufacturing of solar modules is done with the same process and equipment in each factory, yielding the same results no matter where a particular module is made.
Innovation at a critical moment
The solar industry is at an inflection point as the sector navigates a confluence of external conditions. The combination of demand driven by the economics of solar, long-term policy, and the urgency of climate change is driving activity across the industry and its value chains. However, it is essential that this growth is sustainable, efficient and capable of not just meeting the moment today, but of addressing tomorrow’s needs with high quality, competitive manufacturing and supply chains.
Fortunately, digital twins and other digital initiatives for intelligent operations are here to help in solving these pivotal challenges of efficiency and scale – strengthening a solar manufacturer’s handling of everything from responsible manufacturing and product performance, all the way to end-of-life management and recycling.
As First Solar has shown through its own pioneering efforts, digital twin capabilities translate into lower costs, reduced waste, and vastly improved productivity – all of which helps the solar industry rise to the occasion.
