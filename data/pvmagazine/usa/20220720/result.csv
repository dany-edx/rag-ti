Aaron Bates, founder of Toledo Solar, an Ohio-based manufacturer of CdTe modules, told pv magazine usa that the technology has grown from a small fraction of solar projects to the dominant source of modules in utility-scale projects.
Bates came from an institutional finance background, and when he first got involved in solar, he was intrigued by this level of growth and began investigating. He said he was trying to find reasons not to enter the space, and the more he looked, the more CdTe became appealing. Eventually, he purchased an existing CdTe facility in Ohio, which today operates as the module supplier Toledo Solar.
Bates said that 90% of US utility-scale projects last year were CdTe, and the utility-scale sector makes up about 55% of all solar capacity added. About 20 years ago, it represented less than 1% of solar installations. So why all the growth, and why did Bates enter the market?
There are quite a few reasons to support CdTe and US-made solar, said Bates, including technological advantages, bankability, recyclability, supply chain stability, improved labor practices, and more.
Performance
First, Bates said CdTe has a wider range of spectral response than polysilicon cells, the main source of US solar panels. Unlike polysilicon, CdTe is photoactive to the entire visible light spectrum. This factor is not measured in efficiency ratings, but it is measured in the final kWh output of the panel, said Bates.

Because CdTe is largely used at the utility-scale, projects are quite large, making investment and liability high. Due to this, stability and bankability, and decreased risk are important, both in the supply and delivery of planned projects, and the performance in the field.
Bates said the degradation level of CdTe is much lower than polysilicon modules, and they perform better in high temperatures, meaning the technology is a safer bet for investors who sign 20 to 30 year power purchase agreements with large utility offtakers. This is important to utilities, too, which are mandated to supply a reliable, stable source of electricity.
Recycling
Bates credits First Solar for being a pioneer in solar module recycling, an industry that is woefully underfunded and underbuilt in the silicon solar cell space.
“First Solar has been doing this for 25+ years. They lead the world of PV in recycling. There’s a higher percentage, no matter if you want to measure it by weight or components or the cost of said components, there’s a higher percentage of recycled everything in a CadTel module. More recycled material than even what’s in automobiles, which are made of highly recycled materials, whether it’s steel, aluminum, plastics, polymers,” said Bates.
First Solar has already set up recycling centers globally for CdTe modules and has sharpened best practices for using the most material possible from retired panels. Bates said PV is notoriously bad at recyclability, with CdTe being an exception.
Normally, in any manufacturing process there is some scrap or excess material thrown away, but this is not the case for Toledo Solar. “We don’t throw anything away. Everything gets recycled. And it goes back into the supply chain, which not only benefits the industry to keep the costs down, but also helps the planet,” said Bates. “It’s ironic when solar panels are not recycled, or made of recycled material, or are just thrown away.”
Supply chains
Supply shortages have been the dominant problem for the buildout of solar in 2022. For many in the industry, the Department of Commerce’s investigation into Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand for alleged harboring of tariff-circumventing Chinese goods came under the crosshairs as a major reason for the shortage. The potential of large tariffs being retroactively applied to goods shipped from the four nations, which supply about 80% of US polysilicon solar panels, caused many developers to cancel or delay projects due to the uncertainty it caused.
Bates questioned whether these were genuine concerns, or if they were instead talking points to continue to support these international supply chains. He pointed to the fact that the Biden Administration did not increase tariff levels and that Commerce was following laws that had already existed for years.
Bates instead pointed to the fact that global supply chains were already brittle, and that even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns were being raised about the stability and sensibility of sourcing from foreign nations the vast majority of the components that will power the energy transition.
Struggles related to this have persisted in other industries that have largely been shipped overseas, like the glass and steel industries. Major glass supply chains haven’t been built in the United States. since the mid 1980s. It became a massive bane to the automotive industry, as steel and other key components became so far afield, that supply chain issues ruptured the United States’ ability to build cars. Toledo Solar ran into the shortcomings of this reality last year, when major glass suppliers had cut what they provided by 15% across the board last year.
The variable and rising cost of shipping is relevant here, too. Shortly before the pandemic, Bates said shipping costs were $3,800 for a container, steeply rose to $17 to $18k before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, peaked in the high $20k range afterward. Shipping not only raises the cost of solar projects, reducing their competitive advantage and slowing deployment, but it also lowers the environmental sustainability by using large amounts of fuel to deliver the modules across the globe.
“Everything we source in our supply chain is within a 300 miles radius of our facility,” said Bates.
Emissions and labor
Many opponents of the Department of Commerce’s investigation argued that it should be halted because the supply needs to continue or else the United States will fail to reach its climate-driven decarbonization targets. However, Bates challenged this idea, highlighting that polysilicon-based solar modules have higher carbon intensity than US-made ones, and they are built with much different practices.
“CSi modules require two things in huge abundance: energy and labor,” said Bates.
The Xinjiang region of China, home to almost 50% of the world’s polysilicon supply chain, is known for the encampment and forced labor of Uyghurs. The Biden Administration passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) to tackle this problem, placing a heavy burden of proof on importers of solar goods to show there is no connection to this region. Transparency is easy for Toledo Solar, as its supply chains and operations are local.
From a climate and emissions perspective, silicon photovoltaics have the largest carbon footprint and longest energy payback period, said Bates. Though China is building massive amounts of solar capacity, the nation also brought online as many as 47 coal plants last year. That’s more coal plants that have been brought online than the rest of the world have retired combined last year. Coal-fired electricity is still part of the panel making process, and when combined with the shipping emissions, the carbon backpack worn by internationally sourced solar panels is heavier than the ones made locally.
Boosting US made solar
The manufacturing capacity to fully power the US energy transition is not here yet, but Bates is hopeful that the nation can get there. One action by the Biden Administration he believes will make an impact is the invoking of the Defense Production Act.
“The full use of the DPA is still being looked at,” said Bates. He pointed to the procurement requirements of our roads, bridges, and signs. Everything is standardized and US made, from the beginning of the supply chain to the end-use. This type of procurement requirement, a “tightening of the belt,” could possibly be used to boost US solar.
Like most in the industry both domestically and internationally, Bates also supports the passing of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which would include up front incentives for materials and components throughout the solar supply chain. Major producers like Maxeon and Qcells have expressed interest in bringing their operations to the US if such legislation passes, which could signal a huge boon for the sustainability and stability of US solar panel supply going forward.

For solar finance company, Solar Mosaic, however, 2022 has been a year of exceptional growth.
Less than two months after announcing that the company surpassed $7 billion in loans funded through the company’s platform, Mosaic has eclipsed the $8 billion mark in loans funded. According to Mosaic, that milestone was achieved in late June, and the company is inching closer to one of its long-standing goals of helping more than 1 million people prosper from clean energy. This figure includes homeowners, contractors and their crews, Mosaic employees as well as other equipment suppliers and partners.
According to Mosaic founder and CEO, Billy Parish, the company has been able to sustain and accelerate its growth through its unique, in-house approach to solar financing.
“I think core is the specialized technology platform that we’ve built, which is the most flexible and advanced in the market, in terms of supporting all the different needs of a whole different range of contractors,” said Parish. “Second is our underwriting approach. Mosaic uses a machine learning based credit model to enable low losses, while delivering the highest approval rates in the market, that’s really valuable, as you know, to contractors who are looking to convert their leads into sales.”
The underwriting approach that Parish referenced evaluates the creditworthiness of potential customers using different criteria than other comparable lenders, allowing the company to finance systems to low- and middle-income customers who may otherwise not be able to afford a solar system, widening the renewable energy means gap and deepening the issue of energy inequity.
“Most lenders use income, debt to income, and FICO as core drivers of their credit decisioning,” Parish told pv magazine. “We have a machine-learning-based model that’s less reliant on those factors, which enables us to offer credit to lower income and lower FICO customers more readily than most traditional lenders… We look a very large number of different data points collected from the credit report and from other sources to make our credit decisions, and we have more solar loan performance data than any other company in the country. We look at all of that performance data, and we run all of these different factors against it to see which are most predictive of loss, in a balanced, scorecard approach.”
Because of the company’s depth of business and experience lending in the solar space, Mosaic is able to use data pulled strictly from solar loans, which can be more accurately predictive of the likelihood of a solar loan being paid back, as opposed to using all types of loans as the basis for a creditworthiness determination.
Beyond extending the economic range of people the company can lend to, Parish shares that Mosaic has also been able to generate growth though its sustainable home improvement business line, offering HVAC and home automation services.
“We’ve seen some really interesting convergence and opportunities to connect to the ecosystem, where roofers want to get into solar or home automation, companies want to start selling solar, and vice versa, you know, electric vehicle customers who are interested in going solar,” said Parish. “So we’re seeing some pretty interesting convergence of our two business lines.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/20/solar-on-wisconsin-city-hall-provides-for-more-than-half-of-the-complexs-energy-needs/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,NET METERING,POLICY,WISCONSIN",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 20, 2022",Solar on Wisconsin city hall provides for more than half of the complex’s energy needs,"A 389 kW solar array installed on the rooftop of Wauwatosa City Hall, Wisconsin’s is providing energy equivalent to 55% of the city complex’s total annual use, reducing carbon emissions by 358 tons.
The city made a commitment in 2010 to cut emissions in half by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and recently made the decision to power city hall with solar. The city hall complex includes government offices plus the local civic center and public library. The complex has a flat roof area of just under an acre, perfect for rooftop solar, but challenges included shading on parts of the roof as well as Wisconsin snowy weather. Arch Solar C&I was selected as the installer after convincing the council that the solar system would provide enough clean energy to help Wauwatosa meet its green goals, while offsetting upfront costs through a fast ROI.
The installation features 1036 Boviet solar modules with SolarEdge P860 Power Optimizers and three SolarEdge three-phase inverters. The SolarEdge solution provides Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), ensuring that if the shading on the roof causes one or more modules underperform, the other modules on the same string will not be affected.
“There are a lot of trees and buildings surrounding the City Hall complex. With a traditional string inverter system, even if just one or two modules are shaded, the performance of the entire sting is reduced. With SolarEdge, even if sections of the array are impaired, the rest of the modules continue to generate power at full capacity, ” said J..D. Smith, head of business development for Arch Solar C&I.
Because Wauwatosa is in snow country, Arch Solar chose to mount its rooftop modules at a 20 degree angle rather than the industry standard 10 degrees, which helps the system accommodate lower sun angles and reduce snow accumulation, contributing to greater energy production.
To build the array, the city received a $40,000 Wisconsin Focus on Energy Grant and came in under the Common Council budget. In the last twelve months, the 1036-module array generated 458,011 kWh of clean energy, putting Wauwatosa on track to cut carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. To share its achievement with the local community as well as other stakeholders, the Council has launched a live dashboard where anyone can see how much electricity is being generated.
The SolarEdge’s Monitoring Platform provides system users with real-time performance data down to the module level. Any drop in energy production, due to shading or faults, is instantly pinpointed and reported to the maintenance team, enabling fast remediation and increasing system uptime.
Finally, SolarEdge keeps projects safe by complying with the latest NEC 2017 and 2020 requirements for Arc Fault Circuit Protection (AFCI) and Photovoltaic Rapid Shutdown System (PVRSS). The entire system comes with a built-in SafeDC feature, which is designed to automatically reduce voltage to a safe level when required, providing protection to the installation crew and maintenance personnel. This also helps enable quick and safe inspection and maintenance while limiting system disruption.

There was a bit of a dance to get the amendment passed, according to the local press.
The vote was on an amendment to Rhode Island House Bill 8220 – Levy and Assessment of Local Taxes. The amendment added language that included the following key text:
Renewable energy resources shall only be taxed as tangible property . . . and the real property on which they are located shall not be reclassified, revalued or reassessed due to the presence of renewable energy resources.
A second refinement affects land that was previously classified as farmland, a tax advantageous state. Farmland that was reclassified to allow it to host renewables “shall revert to the last assessed value immediately prior to the renewable developer’s purchasing, leasing, securing an option to purchase or lease, or otherwise acquiring any interest in the real property.”
Reporting by the local Providence Journal states that the law was supported by the local solar power companies, Green Development and Revity Energy. The Providence Journal notes that both companies have connections to key politicians, at least via donations made to various campaigns.
The law was originally blocked by a 4-3 vote in the Senate Committee on Housing and Municipal Development, due to local community pushback. However, state politicians later pushed the same bill of a different name via the Senate Judiciary Committee – where it passed – and was then approved on the floor by a vote of 28-10.
Revity Energy used an example of land that was purchased at $305,800, and later reassessed at $1,619,300 in 2020 after being developed into a solar project. A second reassessment increased its value to $2,969,300 in 2021. Revity says the solar facility now owes $55,021.13 in property taxes – up almost 1000% – in addition to the $69,375 in tangible taxes.
Local communities pushed back against the law saying that without increasing the tax bill on land under solar facilities, the local jurisdictions would be pushing general land costs onto other taxpayers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/20/can-renewables-curtailment-be-rethought-as-a-good-thing/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 20, 2022",Can renewables curtailment be rethought as a good thing?,"Power curtailment is often viewed as a limiting factor of renewable energy, as intermittent cycles of generation can lead to excess electricity on the grid during peak production. Curtailment is the deliberate reduction in output that otherwise could have been produced, and typically occurs when supply exceeds demand.
The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed 1.5 million MWh of utility-scale solar in 2020, representing 5% of total production, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Solar is by far the most dominant source of energy that undergoes curtailment in the state. EIA said 94% of power curtailments in 2020 involved solar energy.
While curtailment is often viewed as a bad thing, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) said based on its research and modeling of the grid of the future, it may be time to reframe our thinking about power curtailment.
“(Curtailment) can happen not just in cases of oversupply but also when there’s a lack of system flexibility, which could mean congested transmission lines, other power plants being unable to reduce their output safely or economically, or other constraints,” said Kerrin Jeromin, NREL correspondent in a video on the subject.
“Think about it like buying a cable package for your TV—or a subscription to any of the streaming services out there. Buying that package knowing you can’t possibly watch all of the thousands of programs available to you isn’t all that different from building more renewable power plants, knowing we won’t always be able to use all the energy they produce. The point is, you have it for the shows you can’t miss, and the package gets you the best value in the end. We’re going to need a lot of wind and solar in a super-high-renewable future. And the best strategy might be to max out our renewable energy “package,” so we have enough power when we really need it, and get comfortable with curtailing some of it sometimes, to maximize its value at other moments.” National Renewable Energy Laboratory
Power curtailment is nothing new, as the grid has always had more power plants than are used. It is essential to reserve backup power for times of peak demand to keep the lights on. Currently, solar energy is serving that role in Texas, where fossil fuels are struggling to meet demand during summer heat peaks.
Curtailment comes with a particularly negative connotation because it represents lost opportunity. But as the cost of grid-scale renewables continues to decline, so does the cost of that lost opportunity.
“Curtailed electricity can be used to help make the grid more flexible and reliable, making these solar and wind systems more valuable in the end. It’s happening today: Xcel Energy can actively curtail wind generation to support reliability in its US power systems. And First Solar’s large-scale PV plant in Chile uses curtailment as a tool to help the grid respond to changing system needs, letting grid operators turn the system’s output up and down as needed,” said Jeromin.
NREL concluded that creating regulations that discourage curtailment could create barriers for renewable energy buildout, thereby limiting the many benefits it can offer.

However, it is not known as a leader in renewable energy. With just 143 MW installed, it is currently ranked 42nd in the United States for solar installation, receiving 0.46% of its electricity from solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

In the interest of preserving those unspoiled lands, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has developed a Brightfields Energy Siting Initiative (BESI) tool specifically for Wyoming, with the intention of guiding new energy development to previously disturbed areas or “brownfields”. By siting solar and wind on land once used for fossil fuel development, The goal of the initiative is for Wyoming to diversify its energy mix without compromising the state’s iconic wildlife and natural areas.
The BESI tool identifies areas where new energy development is unlikely to encounter significant land use conflicts, permitting delays and cost overruns. It can locate sensitive places to avoid as well as provide information down to an individual project site. For example, it can determine if a potential site would risk conflict with a known mule deer migration route, a location with an abundance of cultural resources nearby or a golden eagle nesting area. It can look at habitat and can flag it as a site that would be better for restoration rather than the site of a new energy facility.
“In addition to spots to avoid, the BESI tool searches for sites that are good places to build new facilities – specifically, land that has already been disturbed by industrial development. More than 500,000 acres of these types of sites are highlighted on the map,” said Justin Loyka, TNC in Wyoming energy programs manager. “That is an important added benefit especially for officials making land use decisions at the state and county level.”
While the growth projection for solar in Wyoming is only 105 MW over the next five years (for a rank of 50th in the country), using the BESI tool to avoid siting renewables in sensitive areas could stimulate additional renewable development. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that more than 43 million acres of brownfields and former mine lands in the US could be suitable for energy siting, and that these lands could supply about three times the expected US energy demand in 2050.
