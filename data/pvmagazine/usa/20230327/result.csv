https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/27/spruce-power-acquires-residential-solar-portfolio-across-10-states/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 27, 2023",Spruce Power acquires residential solar portfolio across 10 states,"Spruce Power, an owner and operator of distributed solar energy assets, announced the acquisition of a residential solar portfolio with  22,500 residential solar contracts from an undisclosed U.S. private equity firm for about $160 million.  Denver-based Spruce Power specializes in subscription-based services designed to make it easy for homeowners and small businesses to own and maintain rooftop solar and battery storage systems.
The portfolio features the customer payment streams from residential solar contracts that originated with the homebuilder, Lennar Corporation, and its solar platform, SunStreet. The rooftop installations are located across 10 states, while the transaction expands Spruce into two new markets, Washington and Oregon.
Christian Fong, chief executive officer of Spruce Power, said the company paid $35 million for the portfolio and assumed $125 million of non-recourse project debt. He noted that with nearly $12 million in cash in the acquired business, Spruce’s net balance sheet cash paid at closing was about $23 million.
“For future acquisitions, that leaves us with over $180 million of Spruce balance sheet cash. We expect this portfolio will make a large, positive and immediate impact on our financial and strategic outlook,” Fong said. “The Spruce Power 4 Portfolio has an average remaining contract life of nearly 15 years, and is expected to generate over $21 million of customer billings in 2023, and about $23 million of average annual billings over the next five years.”
Fong was previously president and director of Spruce Power, and became CEO in January of this year. Its  previous CEO Eric Tech remains active on the company’s board. Fong joined Spruce Power in 2017, growing the company into what it says is the largest privately held residential solar owner/operator in North America. He held prior roles at TerraForm Power, then the world’s largest public independent renewable power producer, or Yieldco.
“This acquisition is the largest in Spruce’s corporate history,” Fong stated. “It grows our ownership of rooftop solar assets and contracts by about 44% overnight to more than 72,000 systems, demonstrating the power of our strategy to grow by acquisition while earning an attractive rate of return on our invested cash.”
On October 20, 2022, Spruce was notified by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that its average closing price of the company’s stock had fallen below $1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days, and therefore was in non-compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards. On February 1, 2023, the NYSE confirmed that the Company’s average price for the trailing 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2023, and that day’s final closing price, was above the NYSE’s minimum requirement of $1.00.
In Spruce’s fiscal year 2022 results, the company reported total revenue of $23.2 million and negative $4.9 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, a common financial reporting metric to track a company’s yearly performance, in its first year as a public company.   In Q4 2022, the company completed four tax equity buyouts, representing $1 million of additional EBITDA to the company’s business.  The company reported a cash balance of $240.1 million at December 31, 2022, while its outstanding debt balance was $533.2 million.
As of December 31, 2022, Spruce Power owned approximately 51,000 rooftop solar assets and contracts  across 16 states with an average remaining contractual life of 12.5 years. Combined portfolio generation for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was 76,000 MWh of power.

Net metering involves crediting customers on their utility bill for sending excess solar generated electricity to the grid and is an important part of a homeowner’s return on investment in solar.
Utility Duke Energy said customers that would have enjoyed $80 to $98 of monthly bill savings will now save only $40 to $68 a month under the new regime. Net metering credit rates will fall from today’s value of $0.05 per kWh to $0.20 per kWh to a lower rate of only $0.03 per kWh.
The rulemaking also calls for a minimum bill for new solar customers ranging from $22 to $28 per month. This places a cap on how much a customer can reduce their utility bill, even if 100% of their electricity demand is met by their solar array’s production.
New solar customers will also have to choose either a time-of-use (TOU) based plan or a critical peak pricing plan, moving away from a fixed price model for non-solar customers. This change was made to address the real-time value of energy on the grid based on the intermittency of solar generation. Instead of a fixed rate of around $0.11 per kWh, customers would be charged $0.056 and $0.077 per kWh during peak solar generation hours, and as much as $0.17 to $0.19 per kWh in times of low solar irradiance and high electricity demand like during early mornings and evenings.
Existing net metering customers are grandfathered into their older, more preferable net metering rates only until 2027, potentially posing a problem for rooftop solar owners that expected a certain return on their investment.
The net metering cuts were part of a compromise, made in May 2022, after long negotiations from installer Sunrun, the Solar Energy Industries Association, and the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association. The compromise included a delay in implementing TOU-based rates for net metering customers and provided a “bridge rate” for new net metering customers.
Accepted as part of negotiations with utility Duke Energy, the bridge rate and delayed TOU were expected to soften the blow of cutting net metering rates and assessing a minimum fixed monthly charge.
The net metering structure was accepted by the negotiators with an understanding that there would be a new energy efficiency and solar incentive in the state, which was also rejected by regulators in the March 23, 2023 rulemaking session. The incentive would have provided customers who pair solar with electric heating an average of $2,500 in value for a 7 kW rooftop array, while paying customers an initial $75 bill credit and a $25 credit each year.
The two rulings were received as strongly negative outcomes for the rooftop solar industry.
“This ruling is just rotten,” said Jim Warren, executive director of NC Warn. Warren said Duke Energy got “everything they asked for, and more” in the negotiations.
NC Warn, which has been a leader in the opposition to this rulemaking change, has committed to continuing to fight the decision. It cites a 2017 law that mandates an independent cost-benefit analysis before any changes are made to net metering policy.
North Carolina currently has nearly 8 GW of solar installed or enough to power nearly one million homes. The state is currently getting more than 8% of its electricity needs from the sun. Read more about North Carolina solar incentives here.

The company acquired a portfolio of 10 projects with 26.2 MW of power capacity. 
Projects in the portfolio range from 250 kW to 5.4 MW. All of the projects are operational, with some linked to net metering agreements and others operating under feed-in-tariffs. 
Offtakers for the projects include, but are not limited to, municipalities and school districts, the YMCA, and Johnson & Wales University. One of the projects is located on the property of the Women’s Development Corporation (WDCHOC), a low-income housing authority that supports women, the elderly, and people with special needs. 
K&L Gates served as buyer’s counsel on the transaction, while the seller was represented by Robinson & Cole LLP and Ballard Spahr LLP. 
“On the structuring side, this operating asset portfolio was unique, as some of the assets were still in the ITC recapture period,” said Alyssa Rinaldi, senior director of business development, CleanCapital. “This is not our first acquisition of this type, but it showcases our ability and appetite to transact on in-recapture assets.”
CleanCapital said its acquisition strategy is focused on asset performance and long-term return on investment, while also equally focusing on providing energy access for underserved or low-income communities, converting landfills, brownfields and former superfund sites to solar facilities, and funding emerging markets like Guam and Alaska.
Brownfield and landfill redevelopment and underserved energy community solar projects have come under focus following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which adds a 10% installed system cost tax credit for qualified projects in such locations. LandGate, a leading provider for data solutions and an online marketplace for U.S. commercial land and resources, recently published a guide for profiting from these energy communities using their PowerData tool. Analysis of LandGate data suggests that nearly 40% of the U.S. could qualify for these energy community tax credits, signifying a large opportunity for values-focused investors like CleanCapital.
“With every investment and acquisition, we apply a great deal of rigor, honed from years of assessing clean energy assets’ longevity and ROI, as well as maximizing high-impact federal tax incentives. The Rhode Island portfolio demonstrates our ability to structure an acquisition to meet the seller’s needs; in this case, structuring around the developer taking their tax equity internally,” said Julia Bell, chief commercial officer, CleanCapital. 
CleanCapital has typically focused on operational asset acquisition, but expressed intent to also expand into new construction, pre-notice-to-proceed investing, and corporate capital injection. The company expects to continue to seek new business in Rhode Island, a state that targets a 100% renewable energy standard by 2033. The state’s 2021 Act on Climate sets mandatory, enforceable emissions reduction goals and a 2050 target for net-zero emissions. 
To date, CleanCapital has invested nearly $1 billion in projects and companies, including the acquisition of BQ Energy, a landfill and brownfield site rehabilitation specialist. The company has acquired and managed more than 200 operating and new construction projects in 27 states, totaling more than 400 MW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/27/over-500-mwh-standalone-battery-storage-facility-enters-operation-in-texas/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 27, 2023",Over 500 MWh standalone battery storage facility enters operation in Texas,"Eolian LP, a portfolio company of Global Infrastructure Partners, has completed construction on what will become the largest merchant energy storage facility in the world, the companies stated. The Madero and Ignacio energy storage plants have combined power capacity of 200 MW. The grid storage projects will participate in the retail energy power market in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid.
Each phase of the combined storage project is greater than 250 MWh, and the combined facilities have two-hour discharge, putting the system at well over 500 MWh, a Wärtsilä Energy spokesperson told pv magazine USA, but declined to provide a specific value for the total discharge of the combined system.
Eolian first contracted with battery systems supplier Wärtsilä Energy in February 2021 to procure batteries for the large merchant power system, with construction of the project taking approximately 26 months to complete, according to the supplier.
The Madero and Ignacio facilities’ multi-hour continuous dispatch capability provides the longest duration of any energy storage assets operating in ERCOT, and as a combined site the project is the world’s largest (by MWh) fully-merchant and market-facing energy storage facility built to-date, the supplier said.
The Texas project is the first U.S. storage project to make use of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for standalone utility-scale energy storage systems, which was introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
The grid storage facility reacts instantaneously to sustain electricity output and keep the lights on when power generation fails or cannot respond quickly enough to rapidly-changing conditions.
“Texas needs more flexible capacity solutions like energy storage for grid support and energy resource optimization,” said Risto Paldanius, vice president Americas for Wärtsilä Energy. “This will help the state as it faces the natural replacement cycle of older inflexible generators and adapts to more frequent extreme weather events.”
“In the midst of an uncertain market redesign process, Eolian invested hundreds of millions of dollars to construct these projects using cutting-edge technology,” said Aaron Zubaty, chief executive officer, Eolian LP. “We did this because of an unwavering belief that the highly flexible and instantly-dispatchable multi-hour resources at this site will do the hard daily work of fast-ramping and quick starts, allowing aging, inflexible and increasingly fragile generators to remain available to the system in backup roles.”
The Maderos and Ignacio projects use Wärtsilä’s smart energy management system, the GEMS Digital Energy Platform, to monitor and control the flow of energy, while providing grid support during periods of grid instability. The facilities will also deliver ancillary services required for grid stability, such as frequency response and regulation in the ERCOT grid.
According to Wood Mackenzie’s Q1 2023 energy storage market review, Texas and California represented 94% of the 1.07 GW (3.03 GWh) of energy storage projects brought online in Q4 2022, while the two states continue to show the dominance of solar plus storage across the two markets.  The Q4 2022 installation rate was a 41% decline year over year from Q4 2021, as the U.S. energy storage market continues to be hamstrung by project delays related to supply chain disruption.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts 79 GW or 253.2 GWh of energy storage projects to be added through 2027, a revised estimate from what was reported in pv magazine USA’s 2023 energy storage outlook from early this year, in which the research firm forecast 65 GW of added capacity storage.

In the first round, 46.4 MW of commercial and industrial energy storage was approved, with a total energy capacity of 139.4 MWh. The projects average 3 hours of capacity per hour of peak power output.
The residential program recently surpassed the 1 MW sign-up milestone and has ample space in its first round, which targets 10 MW of deployed capacity.
The program is managed by Energy Storage Solutions and administered by the Connecticut Green Bank. The state aims to deploy 1 GW of energy storage by 2030, with interim targets of 300 MW awarded by 2024 and 650 MW by 2027.

Residential customers can receive an upfront incentive of approximately $200 per kWh of battery capacity, with the maximum incentive capped at $7,500. Multiple batteries can be combined to achieve up to 37.5 kWh. Several other factors affect the final value, which can be found here.
To qualify, batteries must be accessible by local power companies for use during peak demand periods. Residential battery owners will be compensated based on when and if their systems are used during high-demand periods. The summer season runs from June to September, and the winter season from December to March. The batteries are expected to be used between noon and 9:00 PM.

Batteries from Enphase, Generac, and SunPower have been approved for the residential market. These units can be managed by inverters from Enphase, Sol-Ark, GoodWe and Shenzhen Lux Power.
The legislation also stipulates that low-income, underserved, and “grid edge” located customers qualify for additional incentives. The state has released a detailed map that shows where the edges of the grid are located.
Research by Dr. Christopher T. M. Clack of Vibrant Energy suggests that putting additional solar and storage at the edges of the grid would generate $473 billion in benefits nationally, with $109 billion in California alone.

The first tranche includes 27 projects submitted by six developers, with projects located in 20 towns across the Constitution State.
Of the 1 GW of capacity to be deployed, the law states that at least 580 MW must be located at the point of demand.
The energy storage program is part of Connecticut’s broader goal of achieving 100% clean energy production by 2040. As of 2030, 48% of the electricity sold within the state must come from renewable energy resources.
The commercial portion of the program aims to deploy 100 MW of capacity. Hardware from six manufacturers are approved: Cadenza Innovation, Caterpillar,  Tesla, ELM Fieldsight, Milton CAT and Socomec.

Researchers from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and scientists from the State University of Ponta Grossa in Brazil have developed four models to estimate the temperature of floating PV modules under various climate conditions, configurations, and locations.
They created a three-layer thermal model, a simplified thermal model, an empirical model, and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model. They applied the models to a single 330 W JA Solar module in a floating solar system on Passauna Lake in Brazil, between May 2020 and September 2022. The system has an installed capacity of 130 kW and occupies an area of 1,200 square meters.
The more complex thermal model studied the dynamic behavior of solar cell temperature in three layers of the module: front surface, cell surface, and back surface. The simplified thermal module considered the temperature of the module as a whole. The empirical model calculated the temperature of the back of the module using site data via least-squares regression analysis. The CFD modeling also determined the temperature of the back of the module using the finite element method (FEM).
The results show “a good correlation between the proposed four models and the actual data collected from the site with an [root mean square deviation (RMSD)] in the range of 0.5 C to 4.8 C,” the scientists said. The complex thermal model showed the best fit, with a RMSD of 2.04 C, followed by the empirical model at 2.27 C, the simplified thermal model at 2.89 C, and finally the CFD model at 3.26 C. However, the simplified thermal model showed the best results in terms of following the linear fit line of the module’s actual temperature.
The scientists also compared the efficiency of the floating solar module with ground-mounted systems, as modeled by Sandia National Laboratories. The results show that a maximum of 3% efficiency gain is possible, compared to the ground-mounted Sandia model.
“The effect of the water cooling plays an integral part in the efficiency increase of the [floating PV] module; as the cell temperature goes down due to water proximity, the efficiency increases,” the academics explained.
They shared their findings in “Floating photovoltaic module temperature estimation: Modeling and comparison,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/27/get-what-you-pay-for-with-high-efficiency-pv-modules/,"GUEST POST,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"MARCH 27, 2023",Get what you pay for with high-efficiency PV modules,"From pv magazine March 2023
Developments in PV module technology have accelerated since 2018. The chart above – based on CEA quality assurance data – shows the most common modules for utility-scale projects in 2017, varied by technology, had a glass-backsheet structure and featured 72 six-inch cells – a module type launched in 2008.
Since 2018, we have witnessed the transition from multicrystalline aluminum back surface field cells to mono PERC (passivated-emitter, rear contact) devices; the adoption of half-cut cells; the dominance of bifacial, glass-glass products; the introduction of multi busbar devices; a shift to larger wafers – 166 mm, then 182 mm, then 210 mm; the emergence of gallium doped p-type wafers; and, most recently, the rise of n-type cells – predominantly n-TOPCon (n-type, tunnel-oxide, passivated contact) products.
Wafer sizes grew to reduce costs. Market share today is split between 210 mm and 182 mm wafers as the advantages of each depends on project specifics. As production lines can be altered to produce either size, market share is fluid.
While “exotic” formats such as 218 mm wafers are unlikely to prosper, 182 mm variants have emerged, such as 182 mm wide by 185 mm products designed to minimize white space between cells in the long direction of the module. Trina Solar recently launched a 182 mm wide by 210 mm tall wafer. Ultimately, such variants are dependent on M10 or G12 solar ingot platforms and supply chains.
N-type moves
N-type (negatively-doped) solutions made an impressive entry in 2022 with several gigawatts of TOPCon generation capacity shipped already. TOPCon and heterojunction (HJT) cells are the main high-efficiency contenders to replace mainstream, p-type PERC cells. TOPCon and HJT cell architecture can be applied on p-type or n-type wafers but years of research have convinced manufacturers only n-type TOPCon and HJT variants can achieve an optimum efficiency-cost relationship.
TOPCon leads the race for now as legacy PERC cell production lines can be upgraded to produce it, whereas HJT requires retooling. TOPCon is also cheaper, thanks mainly to lower capital and operating expenditures.
Rival high-efficiency technology, interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar, has been touted as the “end-of-the-road” single-junction silicon PV technology because going beyond 26% conversion efficiency requires tandem cells. IBC cells have their contacts on the rear side, theoretically offering the highest efficiency for single-junction devices. However, front-contact TOPCon and HJT cells can become back-contact devices and several manufacturers appear to have planned such development. Longi, however, has chosen a p-type IBC architecture that probably uses PERC and TOPCon passivation.
The pros and cons of competing cell technologies are summarized in the following table, in which IBC refers to any passivation method, although properties such as bifaciality and tooling capital expenditure (capex) are linked to back-contact cells. An intense effort is under way to reduce the silver content of HJT devices.
Levelized energy cost
The pace of n-type expansion will rapidly accelerate once technology and cost hurdles are surpassed. Module buyers will accept a price premium on n-type if high efficiency and improved energy yield reduce capex and the LCOE.
To measure such savings, CEA studied a 100 MW system on single-axis horizontal trackers in Spain. PERC and TOPCon cells were compared. Balance-of-system component costs were assumed from several sources, module cost and price data points were taken from CEA’s “PV Price Forecasting Report” and price tracking. PVsyst was used to measure energy yield.
For the analysis, CEA defined a “maximum price premium” metric to indicate the amount a high efficiency module could command over a PERC panel without surrendering LCOE advantage.
CEA equalized the LCOE for PERC and TOPCon systems, deriving the TOPCon module price by adding the maximum premium to the PERC module baseline. Calculations showed TOPCon manufacturers can charge a premium of up to $0.0327/W over PERC without LCOE suffering. While buyers would not pay the maximum premium for zero LCOE advantage, they would pay extra for some LCOE gain. The following chart shows the sensitivity of the LCOE advantage to the price premium, with premiums below 50% of the maximum figure resulting in LCOE advantages of 2.5% or higher. In this scenario, a premium of less than $0.016/W would be reasonable.

The price premium for HJT modules – similarly efficient to TOPCon but with higher energy yield – could be roughly 30% higher than for TOPCon: around $0.005/W. HJT manufacturers must work hard to reduce their cost delta with TOPCon and aim for an efficiency lead.

Modules are lowering the LCOE but pushing past tipping points accelerates the rate of change, making it difficult to estimate development timelines. As a web of factors influence LCOE, manufacturer claims need verification.
