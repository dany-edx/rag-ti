In the past, the Solar Decathlon was an international collegiate competition that, in its 20 years, challenged more than 25,000 students to create efficient, affordable buildings powered by renewable energy, while promoting student innovation, cross-disciplinary education, and real-world training for a variety of careers.
In the future, the Solar Decathlon will expand to train professionals as well as to try to inspire high school students to seek careers in our zero energy future. Solar Decathlon Professionals (SD Pro) and Solar Decathlon Pathways (SD Pathways) are the two new programs that offer opportunities to learn from some of the competition’s most successful alumni and to develop proficiencies in the latest sustainable building software platforms.
“Solar Decathlon has always been about the students, and as we enter the competition’s third decade, now is the time to expand our offerings to include more scholars – from high schoolers preparing to choose careers to practicing professionals who are ready to learn new skills,” said Holly Jamesen Carr, director of the Solar Decathlon in the Building Technologies Office.
SD Pro for professionals
Developed by the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon and the American Institute of Architects (AIA), Solar Decathlon Professionals (SD Pro) with the intent to train industry professionals interested in integrating zero energy building techniques into their work.
“The Solar Decathlon is really a springboard to careers in clean energy,” said Secretary Granholm at the Solar Decathlon 2022 Competition Event, “but we need to grow the ranks of big thinkers with bold ideas for new buildings that are energy efficient, affordable, and designed with our communities in mind. That’s why we’re partnering with the American Institute of Architects to launch the new Solar Decathlon Professionals Program, which is aimed at imparting practical experience with zero energy building design to professional architects and engineers.”
SD Pro is aimed at early- to mid-career design professionals, and is designed to develop building science expertise, gain practical experience in designing zero energy projects, and earn continuing education credits (CEUs).  Participants will apply building science fundamentals to real-life projects, where they will be challenged to revise an existing building design to reach a zero-energy target.
The first 10-week course will be offered by the AIA beginning in June 2022. Register for an upcoming SD Pro cohort by emailing aiau@aia.org.
SD Pathways
While the Solar Decathlon has traditionally been aimed at college and graduate-level students, this fall, Solar Decathlon Pathways (SD Pathways) is aimed at high school students. The goal of SD Pathways is to inspire them to pursue clean energy careers. Solar Decathlon alumni will work with students on activities related to the built environment and renewable energy. By describing their own educational paths, and highlighting career opportunities in the clean energy and high-performance buildings sector, the SD alumni will be mentoring tomorrow’s clean energy workforce.
While speaking about SD Pathways, US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said she was “thrilled to learn about the new Solar Decathlon high school program, Solar Decathlon Pathways. There is no one better suited to inspire the next generation of Solar Decathletes than our alumni network, which is now 40,000 strong and spread all over the world.”
Alumni participating in SD Pathways will receive a small stipend for each classroom they visit. If you are a Solar Decathlon alum or an educator interested in learning more about SD Pathways, complete the interest form

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/27/solar-farm-to-power-philly-government-buildings-gains-momentum-after-covid-supply-chain-delays/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,PENNSYLVANIA",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 27, 2022","Solar farm to power Philly government buildings gains momentum after Covid, supply chain delays","Officials with the City of Philadelphia announced that they have signed an updated power purchase agreement (PPA) with Virginia-based Energix Renewables for the annual electricity generated by the 80 MW Adams County solar farm.
The aptly-named installation is set to be constructed on farmland in Straban Township, Adams County, not far from Gettysburg, though the project’s new construction timetable is still up in the air. The project was originally set to break ground in the first half of 2020 and be operational in 2021, however the plant’s receival of conditional approval, granted at the end of 2019, coincided with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the global supply chain hardships created in part by the pandemic served to further delay development and construction.
Whenever the project is completed, currently anticipated for some time in 2023, it is anticipated to power 22% of the demand coming from Philadelphia government buildings, as a significant step towards the city’s goal of sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. And along the way it will eliminate more than 4 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions over its lifetime. The city’s reaffirmation of its PPA means that the city will purchase the electricity generated by the project for 20-years after its commissioning.
The city of Philadelphia will also take market ownership of the electricity generated by the project, which will be delivered to Peco territory, since there is no way to send electricity directly from Adams County to Philadelphia.
As far as the hardware intended for use, Energix stated that the project will be constructed with First Solar modules mounted on single-axis trackers.
When it was first announced and on its original schedule, the Adams Solar Farm was on track to be one of the largest projects in the state. Since that time more large, utility scale installations have been announced and begun development, including the 127 MW CPV Maple Hill solar installation. Maple Hill began construction in 2021 and will start providing power to Hydro’s aluminum extrusion facility in Cressona, Pennsylvania this summer. The solar field will consist of 237,000 Talesun bifacial panels on a single-axis tracking system to maximize energy production. The tracker provider has yet to be disclosed.
Utility scale solar development has accelerated in Pennsylvania since the start of 2020. The state is currently home to just under 900 MW of installed solar capacity, the 23rd-most in the nation, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. Over the next five years, the state is expected to add another 1.9 GW, good for 18th in the nation over that time.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/27/recurrent-energy-completes-mississippis-largest-solar-installation-under-a-build-transfer-agreement/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MISSISSIPPI",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 27, 2022",Recurrent Energy completes Mississippi’s largest solar installation under a Build Transfer Agreement,"Canadian Solar Inc. announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Recurrent Energy, LLC, successfully completed the construction of the 100 MW Sunflower Solar Station. The solar power plant, located in Sunflower  County in the Mississippi Delta, will provide enough clean energy to power 16,000 homes in Entergy Mississippi’s territory.
The Sunflower project is one of the first utility scale solar projects to be constructed under a Build Transfer Agreement (BTA) in the United States and it is the first BTA signed by Recurrent Energy. The BTA was signed with Entergy Mississippi in 2018 designating that the utility would take ownership of the project once it began commercial operation.

“It’s a historic day for Entergy Mississippi, our customers and our state,” said Haley Fisackerly, Entergy Mississippi president and CEO. “Powering communities is the heart of our business, and this power station does that in several ways—by providing clean, green power to customers and a hedge against rising natural gas prices and giving industries with renewable energy goals an incentive to locate or expand operations in our state.”
The Sunflower project raises the bar for solar in the state of Mississippi. As of the 4th quarter of 2021, Mississippi was ranked 36th in the country for installed solar at just under 320 MW. At the time solar was contributing only .67% of the state’s electricity.

In the fall of 2021, Entergy announced its intent to expand renewable energy in its territory when it launched EDGE, for “Economic Development with Green Energy,” a program that aims to replace aging natural gas facilities with 1,000 MW of renewable energy, including solar, over the next five years. This level of added capacity would increase the company’s total power generation portfolio from less than 1% to 17% in three years, and nearly 33% by 2027. Entergy expects to have 11,000 MW of renewable energy generation by the end of 2030.
“We are proud to have completed the largest solar project in Mississippi on behalf of Entergy in a way that has supported Mississippi businesses and paved the way for more renewable energy in the state,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and chief executive officer of Canadian Solar. “Sunflower is our first build-own-transfer project and our first project in Mississippi. We look forward to supporting the growth of solar throughout the southeast United States and repeating this model which provides additional value for our customers.”
The single-axis tracker-based Sunflower project uses 272,000 PV modules and was built on a 1,000-acre site. Attala Steel Industries, based in Kosciusko, Mississippi supplied 2,475 tons of steel for foundations. Additionally, A-1 Kendrick Fence Company, based in Jackson, Mississippi installed the perimeter fence. Signal Energy LLC served as the EPC provider.
In other recent solar news in the state, the Mississippi Public Service Commission released updated Net Metering and Interconnection Rules with policies that look to increase solar adoption across the board, while also improving access to solar for low- and middle-income residents. And in February of this year, Mississippi Power announced a request for proposal (RFP) for a total of 200 MW of solar projects, which are required to have an export capability of the point of interconnection of at least 20 MWac and must include 25-year energy-only power purchase agreements. The final bid list is planned to be accepted in August.

North Carolina State University (NCSU) has developed a continuous-flow reactor applying reusable photocatalyst and sunlight to extract hydrogen gas from its liquid organic carrier (LOHC) using less rhodium (Rh). The researchers achieved a 99% yield in three hours, reportedly eight times faster than conventional batch reactors. The room-temperature reactor resembles a thin, clear tube packed with micron-scale grains of titanium oxide (TiO2). The hydrogen-carrying liquid is pumped into one end of the tube. Only the outer grains of titanium oxide, the ones exposed to the sun at the other end of the tube, are coated with rhodium. These photoreactive catalysts react with the liquid carrier to release hydrogen molecules as a gas. “In a conventional batch reactor, 99% of the photocatalyst is titanium oxide, and 1% is rhodium. In our continuous flow reactor, we only need to use 0.025% rhodium, which makes a big difference in the final cost. A single gram of rhodium costs more than $500,” said Milad Abolhasani, corresponding author of the paper recently published in ChemSusChem. According to the researchers, the system should be easy to scale up or scale out to allow for catalyst reuse on a commercial scale. “You can simply make the tube longer or merge multiple tubes running in parallel.” The flow system can run continuously for up to 72 hours before losing efficiency. The catalyst can be “regenerated” without removing it from the reactor in about six hours. The system can then be restarted and run at full efficiency.
Airbus launched its Zero Emission Development Centre (ZEDC) in Bristol, the United Kingdom, to develop, test, and manufacture cryogenic fuel systems. The center will work on the full product capabilities from components up to the whole system and cryogenic testing. The new ZEDC joins other centers focused on cryogenic liquid hydrogen tanks in Spain, Germany, and France. “All Airbus ZEDCs are expected to be fully operational and ready for ground testing with the first fully functional cryogenic hydrogen tank during 2023, and with flight testing starting in 2026,” the European aerospace corporation wrote. 
Toshiba Energy Systems and Solutions reached an agreement with Ireland-based Fusion Fuel to study collaboration opportunities, aimed at expanding sales of electrolyzers in Europe and Australia. Fusion Fuel will evaluate the use of Toshiba ESS membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) in its proprietary Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) eletrolyzers; and Toshiba ESS will explore using its local sales channels to expand sales of Fusion Fuel’s PEM electrolyzers in Australia. “Furthermore, the two companies will also explore potential collaboration for future sales of Toshiba ESS solid oxide electrolysis cells, which Toshiba ESS targets bringing to market in 2025,” Toshiba ESS wrote. 
Chile development agency Corfo signed agreements with regasification plant GNL Quintero, iron producer CAP, and industrial gas supplier Air Liquide to finance the development of the first green hydrogen production plants on an industrial scale in Chile. The GNL Quintero’s 10 MW project aims to develop, construct, and operate a green hydrogen plant in the Valparaíso Region. CAP’s 12 MW project focuses on the Biobío Region, while the Antofagasta Region will host Air Liquide’s 80 MW project. The three companies were awarded US$5.7 million (€5.3 million), US$3.6 million, and US$11.7 million, respectively. “These three initiatives are part of the six selected by Corfo last December, which, once installed, will have a total electrolysis capacity of 388 MW, equivalent in size to what is currently in operation worldwide. They are expected to generate investments of US$1,000 million and produce more than 45,000 tons of hydrogen per year,” Corfo wrote. 
The German Parliament passed the bill tabled by the Government to bypass specific procedural steps, like the need for an environmental impact assessment, to install two floating terminals in Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel by the coming winter.  The LNG facilities should be “hydrogen-ready.”
US-based Air Products, Oman’s energy group OQ, and Riyadh-based developer ACWA Power signed a joint development agreement toward a multibillion-dollar investment in a world-scale green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility powered by renewable energy in Oman. 
Air Liquide invested $250 million to open its largest liquid hydrogen production and logistics infrastructure facility in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The facility will produce 30 tons of liquid hydrogen per day, mainly for the mobility sector in California, wrote the Paris-based industrial gas business. 
French green hydrogen producer Lhyfe and the Swedish local energy company Trelleborgs Energi teamed up for a pre-study for a local renewable hydrogen production system in southernmost Sweden. The results are due to be presented in the summer of 2022. Earlier this week, Lhyfe entered into an industrial agreement with Spain’s EDP Renewables to identify, develop, build, and manage renewable hydrogen projects.
Algeria’s Sonatrach and Italy’s Eni signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to accelerate the development of gas fields in Algeria and decarbonization via green hydrogen.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/27/the-making-of-a-clean-energy-prosumer-part-two/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA",,"MAY 27, 2022",The making of a clean energy prosumer: Part two,"This article series describes my journey from a standard consumer to a prosumer and from owning a gasoline-powered vehicle to owning an electric vehicle (EV). I was led to making these two decisions to lower my ever-rising electric and gasoline bills, to enhance the resilience of my house to power outages, and to promote clean air.
The report includes economic analysis behind the decisions, explains what it took to implement them, and provides the results during the time that has elapsed since I became a prosumer and EV driver.
Buying the EV
To further enrich our prosumer experience, I decided to trade in the Porsche Boxster I had owned for 14 years for a Tesla Model 3 (long range) sedan. The Model 3 has become ubiquitous where I live. One day I recalled seeing five Model 3’s in five minutes while driving to the Whole Foods grocery store. About a dozen friends drove the Model 3 so I solicited their experience. All gave me really positive feedback. I also checked the reviews on Consumers Report and social media and convinced it was a no-lose proposition, took the plunge.
It’s a car like no other: essentially a computer on wheels with “One screen that rules them all.”
I traded in my two-seater convertible that had faithfully served me since 2005. It had become a tad expensive to maintain, and as the years went by, whenever I drove it with the top down (which was the best part of the car), my nasal allergies went out of control.
But giving it away broke my heart. That car was loaded with so many memories, including the drive on the floor of the Yosemite Valley which we had done the month after we bought it.
Picking an Electric Rate
Then I had to pick an electric rate for my house. Being an economist who had spent a good chunk of my career on rate design, I had thought this would have been the easy part. It turned out to the hardest nut to crack and sullied the prosumer experience.
I was currently on a time-of-use rate whose off-peak price was 26 cents per kWh and on-peak price was 37 cents per kWh. A few years ago, I had picked that rate my going to the local utility’s website and using the handy bill calculator to calculate what my bill would be across a few rate design options. But all of those computations were contingent on the load shape of my house during the past 12 months. With all the prosumer technologies, the load shape was going to change.
My friends who drove electric cars were on a whole-house EV rate where the off-peak price dropped to 13 cents per kWh. But the on-peak rate was going to rise to 43 cents per kWh. We keep the thermostat at 72 degrees during the summer. Would the bills rise or fall if I switched to that rate? My new load shape did not exist yet so the utility website was unable to provide me with any guidance. Of course, solar would reduce my afternoon load but by how much and at what time? I reached out to the solar installer but they could not provide me that information either.
I knew once I got the panels installed, I would have to be on some TOU rate with a minimum $10 monthly charge. It would take several months to install the solar panels. In the meantime, should I switch to a TOU rate that would be ideal for charging my EV? Could I pick such a rate just for the EV. The good news was that the local utility also offered an EV-only rate. Should I look into that? The first thing I did was sent an email to the Tesla salesman. He never responded.
So, I called the local utility. I knew from the website there would be a charge of $100 for the separate EV meter. It was possible that with my acquisition of an EV and the installation of a 220-volt charger, I would have to upgrade the main electrical panel for the house. But I may have to do that anyway since in a few months solar panels would be installed. No one seemed to know the answer to that question.
So, I thought I would go ahead with the EV-only meter. I called the utility. I was told that there would be a $5,000 charge for putting the underground line from the pole to my house in a conduit. The Green Book required it. The only Green Book I knew was the one written by the former Libyan dictator. Colonel Gaddafi had written it as a riposte to Chairman Mao’s Red Book.
So, the separate EV TOU rate was no longer on the table for my house. With the standard 110-volt outlet, the speed of charging works out to 4 miles per hour. With a range of 325 miles, it would take 81.25 hours to get the car fully charged, which was ridiculous. With a 240-volt outlet, the speed of charging is 29-30 miles per hour. The car would be charged in 10-11 hours. I began to search for a contractor who would install a 240-volt outlet.
At a supercharger, the speed of charging varies by location and by how many cars are plugged in at the same time. In one instance, it was 385 miles per hour. The car would be fully charged in 0.84 hours or just under 51 minutes. But Tesla does not recommend using the Superchargers on a regular basis, since fast charging shortens the life of the battery. It recommends using the Superchargers just for long trips.
So, I reached out my friends and neighbors to see who had installed their 240-volt outlet. I got the names of several vendors, called them, they provided me their bids and I picked one.
But the issue was whether to wait until the solar panels and battery had been installed and the electric panel changed, or to do the panel change out and install the 240-volt outlet first. I talked to the two vendors and they talked to each other. I decided to wait. In the end, I chose the EV2-A rate. It is a three-period TOU rate. The picture on the left shows the rates as of March 2022. The picture on the right shows the rates as they were in 2019 when I bought the car.
I always charge during the off-peak period when I charge at home. Off-peak prices have gone up by 41% in three years.
Part three will conclude with Ahmad Faruqui’s assessment of the economics of being a prosumer.
