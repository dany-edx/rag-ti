Inside the massive energy, climate, and tax bill is $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is focused on supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience. The spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes on ultra-wealthy Americans and corporations. 
The IRA mandates a reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030. The bill is “long overdue and a necessary step to ensure the United States takes decisive action on the climate crisis that helps our economy and provides leadership for the world by example,” said former Vice President Al Gore. 
One of the most significant provisions in the IRA was something the industry had been calling for all year: a long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit. The bill mandates a 10-year extension of the tax credit at 30% of the cost of the installed equipment, which will then step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. The 30% credit will be retroactively applied to anyone who installed their system since the beginning of 2022. 
Informational site SolarReviews, home of the residential Solar Calculator, surveyed over 3,000 installer partners about the impact of their business following passage of the IRA, and 95% of respondents said they anticipate their business to grow now that the historic package is law. 
Residential solar installation companies alone are likely to add an additional 340,400 workers over the next five years, said SolarReviews. This is a 148% estimated increase among installation companies alone in just five years. 
The IRA may also be accelerating at-home electric vehicle (EV) charging goals. About 86% of respondents said they already offer EV charging solutions, and after the passage of the IRA, 46% of respondents who do not currently offer EV charging now plan to in the future. 
 
Over 95% respondents said the long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit was the most beneficial part of the bill to their business. This was followed by the energy storage tax credit and EV tax credits as the biggest boon to installers. 
When asked to select the biggest challenges facing their business today, 58% said acquiring new customers was a key challenge. This was followed by hiring installation labor (40%), acquiring stock (28%), cashflow issues (21%), and hiring a salesforce (11%).
On the passage of the IRA:
“What an historic moment for our country! Sunrun applauds everyone in Congress and the Biden Administration who helped accomplish this major step forward for humanity. The Inflation Reduction Act will combat inflation, lower energy prices and help our country meet its climate goals. It will boost U.S. manufacturing, create millions of good-paying jobs, expand access and equity for those who need it most, and improve grid stability and resilience. The need for families to take control of their energy and for broader U.S. energy independence has never been clearer. All of us at Sunrun are focused on scaling as fast as humanly possible to provide customers with a more affordable, clean and resilient way to power their homes and lives.” Mary Powell, CEO, Sunrun

These sites have the potential for a combined savings of nearly 60 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, or the equivalent to the total emissions produced by more than 16 coal-fired power plants over the course of a year.
“This month, the Aurora community of solar installers officially surpassed 10 million projects designed in the platform,” said Chris Hopper, co-founder and CEO, Aurora Solar. “We are so thankful to our customers for pushing the solar industry forward and making the switch to the future. With every solar installation, we’re moving toward a cleaner world and a brighter future.”
Aurora reports that more than 7,000 solar installers around the world use its platform, which offers benefits such as increased revenue and lower soft costs such as permitting, taxes, customer acquisition and more.
“We couldn’t have achieved this milestone without the hard-working and growing group of installers who are in the field every day turning the promise of solar into reality. These individuals directly empower their communities with the freedom and sustainability of solar energy and should be applauded,” said Sam Adeyemo, co-founder and CRO, Aurora Solar.
“Solar Holler is a benefit corporation, which means we are not focusing on profits; we focus on savings for the homeowner,” said Justin Kline, lead residential solar designer at Solar Holler and Aurora customer. “At the same time, the industry is growing faster than ever; we have to be quick on our feet in order to grow and scale as rapidly as the industry is changing. We’ve barely reached the cusp of what the possibilities are here, but we’re well on our way and we’re moving quickly, thanks to Aurora.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/06/resonant-energy-aims-to-help-people-share-their-solar-abundance/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,MASSACHUSETTS",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2022",Resonant Energy aims to help people share their solar abundance,"Boston-based Resonant Energy has announced the Solar Equity Platform whereby solar users can install more solar than they need, and share the excess with low-income families. Not only does this help families use clean energy who otherwise may not be able to afford it, but in Massachusetts, the donation makes systems eligible for larger state incentives, significantly improving project economics.
So far the company has a handful of residential customers, a children’s museum and a group of multifamily affordable housing projects on the platform that are already donating what amounts to about $23,000 a year in no-cost credits to low-income customers. The host customers are benefiting from a lower per-panel installation cost and the generous Massachusetts state tax incentives.
“Through our partnerships with local advocacy groups and solar providers, we hope the Solar Equity Platform will be a tool used to build intergenerational sustainability and foster education in communities that have historically been underserved by the clean energy industry,” said Kelsie Daniels-Jackson, Environmental Justice Program Manager at Resonant Energy.
An affordable housing provider, Homeowners Rehab (HRI), will be the among the first projects on the platform, and will be able to install an additional 49 kW of solar across its 24-site portfolio, for a total of 326 kW.  The installation is 15% larger than what was originally planned, and by using the platform, the excess electricity will go to help offset electric bills of some of its low-income tenants.
“We are excited that we were able to oversize our solar projects through the Solar Equity Platform,” said Will Monson from Homeowners Rehab, Inc.” Resonant estimates that we’ll be able to send 55,000 kWh (worth ~$13,000) to low-income tenant bills per year, which would be a significant financial burden lifted off of many of our residents.”
The Solar Equity Platform is one of 10 teams competing for more than $500,000  in prizes in the Department of Energy’s American-Made Competition, and the company just announced that it has been selected as a finalist for the fifth round. Winners will be announced on September 22, 2022 at the RE+ clean energy convention in Anaheim, Calif.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/06/california-law-would-target-90-renewable-and-zero-carbon-electricity-by-2035/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2022",California law would target 90% renewable and zero-carbon electricity by 2035,"California could reach 90% renewable and zero-carbon electricity by 2035 under legislation that awaits Governor Newsom’s signature.
The legislation sets a more aggressive ramp for the state’s clean energy progress, moving in five years from an existing target of 60% renewables by 2030 to the new 90% renewable and zero-carbon target by 2035.
California currently has 33% renewable generation, 25% from solar and 8% from wind.
State regulators would be required under the legislation to “prevent unreasonable impacts to customer rates and bills,” while maintaining and protecting the safe, reliable operation and balancing of the electric system.
The targets are to be achieved through work by the California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy Commission, and the state’s Air Resources Board, using programs authorized under existing statutes, the legislation says. Achieving the new targets “shall not increase carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid and shall not allow resource shuffling.”
“Zero carbon” generation is not defined in the legislation, which is known as the Clean Energy, Jobs, and Affordability Act, or SB-1020.
California also has an existing target, set in 2018, of 50% renewable generation by 2026. The new legislation sets longer-dated targets for renewable and zero-carbon electricity sales of 95% by 2040 and 100% by 2045, with the latter goal unchanged from the target set in 2018. The legislation’s targets apply to retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers.
State agencies face an earlier target, as the legislation would direct them to procure 100% of their electricity from renewable and zero-carbon sources by 2035. Local governments would be permitted to move more quickly to achieve the state’s electricity sector decarbonization goals.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/06/energy-intensive-cryptocurrency-mining-slows-the-march-to-100-renewables/,"SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2022",Energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining slows the march to 100% renewables,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other cryptocurrencies have come under spotlight for their disruption of financial markets. But one unintended consequence has been the disruption of the global energy market.
Bitcoin was estimated to burn about 76 billion kWh last year, about triple that of Ethereum. There are thousands of types of coins, and new ones springing up by the day.
The process of generating a unique coin is called mining, which may be an apt name for the practice, as it is a highly physical activity, and not the ethereal, cloud-like process that it may appear to be on surface. High-powered servers, or mining rigs, are required to show “proof of work,” performing increasingly complex math equations in the process of minting a unique coin. This requires a lot of energy, and in turn, expels a lot of carbon.
Fortune magazine said Bitcoin deploys an incredible 707 kWh and emits half a ton of carbon per transaction. This is hundreds of thousands of times the energy required by a credit card transaction. While cryptocurrency is hailed for increasing financial security through decentralization, is the juice worth the squeeze?

In response to this criticism, organizations like the Crypto Climate Accord and the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) have been formed to, “promote transparency, share best practices, and educate the public on the benefits of bitcoin and bitcoin mining.”
BMC said, “bitcoin mining uses a negligible amount of energy, is rapidly becoming more efficient, and is powered by a higher mix of sustainable energy than any major country or industry.” It is estimated that around 50% of bitcoin mining is renewably powered, but lack of quality data and transparency challenge this figure.
Cambridge University’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index shows that in less than ten years, Bitcoin’s energy demand has increased from near-nothing about 200 TWh a year, more than the Netherlands and Austria, and nearly as much as Spain, which uses about 250 TWh each year. Its consumption is multiples higher than the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest power plant in terms of capacity.
Renewable energy represents roughly 28% of the world’s energy mix, indicating that there is much work to do to achieve carbon neutrality. By sharply increasing the demand for electricity, crypto mining can crowd out renewable energy development that could power other important functioning aspects of the economy like agriculture and transportation.
Climate may challenge crypto value
The carbon impact of cryptocurrency may impact its valuation going forward, said the European Central Bank. Last year, China placed a ban on all crypto transactions amid financial stability, consumer protection, financial crime, and environmental concerns. The European Parliament plans to submit a legislative report by 2025 on the climate impact of cryptocurrency, and New York State passed a bill that placed a two-year ban on certain carbon-based crypto mining operations.
Investment in cryptocurrencies may pose risks to corporations that have set environmental, social, and governance goals. Worldwide, a large group of banks representing 40% of global banking assets have voluntarily committed to achieving net zero emissions in their lending and investment portfolios by 2050. Transparency is difficult to achieve with cryptocurrency mining, meaning these banks and corporations may be unwilling to take on the risk of investment if it means compromising carbon emissions goals.
Solar mining kit
Distributed, decentralized power may be the best match to mitigate the environmental damage of cryptocurrency if it is to continue on this path. Solar and energy storage built in a distributed fashion can lessen the need for transmission infrastructure, reducing the overall raw material input supporting currency mining. It would also ensure a given mining operation is 100% renewably powered, rather than the roughly estimated 50% that powers it today.
One company working in this space is MECO Limited, which recently released a solar panel kit along with a portable power station, to be coupled with its mining equipment. The new products are called the Mecobit Solar Unit M4000 and Solar Panel Kit.
Included in the portable Solar Unit M4000 is a lithium-ion battery bank and eight solar panels with a combined rated power of 3 kW. The Solar Panel Kit is a 2 kW model that integrates panels on top of a rack, with battery storage and the crypto miners mounted below.
The two kits are compatible with most home and Industrial appliances, equipment, tools, electronic devices such as cryptocurrency miners, providing backup and durable power for home and office use. While cryptocurrency mining could represent one destiny for the power generated by the system, it could also be used for essentials like refrigeration, heating and cooling, medical devices, lighting, and more.
