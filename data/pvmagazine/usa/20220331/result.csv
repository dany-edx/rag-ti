The first day of the event started with SEIA President & CEO Abby Hopper on stage with the President & CEO of NYSERDA, Doreen M. Harris. They talked about the growth of New York’s community solar and large-scale programs, as well as the various pragmatic designs that attempt to consider and adapt to market conditions.
Harris also referenced project siting upstate — and noted that using prime farmland for solar power is not a viable long term path forward.

Harris says that she sees potential for New York State to deploy as much as 60GW of renewables (along with 10GW of community solar by 2030) as the state moves toward a 100% emission free power grid.
That’s a big number.
Next on stage was a group led by SEIA’s Erin Duncan, who expressed optimism over the signing of the Build Back Better (BBB) legislation — specifically, on the subject of solar construction (along with direct pay) and manufacturing tax credits.
Duncan’s opinion was shared by everyone on stage. James Dennis reminded the audience that West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin had recently suggested that the BBB legislation must be finalized by July 4th so that there is time for it to be signed before the August recess — in time for Congress to go home and shake hands.
There was some technical discussion of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provisions in the BBB bill. The additional tax credit opportunities on properties greater than 1MWac — specifically, 10% for domestic content, as well as for building in financially challenged regions — could bring the ITC to 50%.
That’s a lot of Direct Pay.
Next on stage were representatives from two companies with a combined market capitalizations over $2.5 trillion — $2.3 trillion from Microsoft and $250 billion from Intel. The representatives from both companies vocalized their desire to buy within the high Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards.
Both representatives encouraged contractors to go through their respective websites to connect with them. Intel’s representative — Jamie Belliveau — suggested finding him via his LinkedIn profile.
SEIA took the stage next, and presented some great data.

Despite charts showing heartburn from pricing increases, there was still growth in utility scale deployment and in the pipeline. Unfortunately, it was clear that commercial and industrial onsite installation had stalled during the past year.
Some of the more interesting data points were concerned with the amount of time it takes to deploy the various phases of solar panel manufacturing — from polysilicon, to ingots and wafers, cells, and modules. (Photo above)
This is an important topic because of the manufacturing credits included in the BBB, as well as the high level of optimism coming from SEIA on the topic.

The final talk of the day was the most technical, on the subject of tax and finance law.
 
Among the most important issues was the subject of changing market conditions, which have forced many tax partners to be increasingly flexible. This “forced flexibility” arose from product availability issues and inflationary pressures, as well as the looming potential of the direct pay option. However, it was clear that while some tax partners have been able to adapt to these conditions, others were significantly challenged, as many tax equity investors have a finite amount of capital.

The Borrego FirstLight relationship contemplates multiple storage project types and configurations across FirstLight’s real estate portfolio. Project types include but are not limited to utility scale standalone storage, DG standalone storage, and PV+ESS.
“I am thrilled to partner with Borrego to accelerate New England’s path to a fully decarbonized electric grid by advancing innovative new solar and energy storage offerings to customers in Massachusetts and Connecticut,” said Alicia Barton, President and CEO of FirstLight.
The installation will be similar to FirstLight’s first solar facility, Northfield Mountain in Massachusetts. This 2MW installation was one of the largest in New England when constructed in 2011, consisting of more than 18,000 solar panels covering approximately 11 acres of land. The solar facility is adjacent to FirstLight’s pumped storage hydro power generation operation on the Connecticut River.
The partnership advances FirstLight’s mission of creating a clean, affordable, reliable and equitable electric grid. The new developments will provide local jobs and increase FirstLight’s economic development impact in the local communities.
“Borrego’s partnership with FirstLight will help create innovative hybrid renewables solutions in New England – combining solar and energy storage resources with existing generation,” said Jared Connell, VP of Project Development in New England, of Borrego.
This announcement with Borrego follows a recent partnership that FirstLight announced in Connecticut to advance new hybrid renewable energy projects across the state and the company’s participation in a successful investment consortium that secured a lease in the recent NY Bight Offshore Wind auction.
The first Borrego/FirstLight installations are expected to be operational in 2025.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/31/new-solar-trailer-bus-from-sono-motors/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WESTERN EUROPE,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 31, 2022",New solar trailer bus from Sono Motors,"Sono Motors, an electric vehicle maker with a focus on integrating solar PV with transportation, announced it has deployed its solar technology on the municipal bus fleet in Munich, Germany. The buses will be attached with a trailer that is topped with 20 semi-flexible solar panels.
The modules cover an area of 12 square meters and supply the 24V battery with over 2,000W. In this pilot, the solar energy generated will be used to operate the HVAC system and to support the trailer steering system. This saves the bus from burning diesel and stabilizes the battery’s energy supply, which lowers maintenance costs and extends battery lifecycle.
The PV system was custom-built for the needs of buses, and features the company’s proprietary maximum power point tracker (MPPT) unit and an algorithm-enabled charge controller designed to optimize energy production. Production can be tracked online through integrated software.
After technical approval by supervisory authorities, the bus trailer will go into regular service, providing cleaner transportation for Munich residents. “We need a change of course in the transport sector. Transport still misses the climate protection targets by a very wide margin, and this also has a direct impact on air quality in Munich. The solar buses can be a cornerstone in this urgently needed change towards climate-friendly mobility,” said Katrin Habenschaden, Munich vice mayor.
The company said a medium-sized fleet of 300 buses could save about 2,000 metric tons of C02 emissions each year. When considering the 1.5 ton C02 emissions “backpack,” or the amount of emissions related to producing the bus trailer, the carbon impact of production would be offset in less than one year of operation.
“The photovoltaic system on our bus trailer now allows us to test under real conditions how well the power generation works and whether there are perhaps routes in our network that are better suited than others for this type of power generation. The question of what energy savings can be achieved by using solar energy are, of course, particularly exciting against the background of current fuel and energy prices.” Veit Bodenschatz, Managing Director and Head of Bus Division of the MVG
Sono Motors said its solar technology has been designed so that it can be integrated with a large range of vehicles. E-buses can be integrated with PV on their roofs and sides, extending range, reducing standstill times for charging processes, and protecting the battery for a longer life through steady power cycling.
The company said it has signed more than ten letters of intent and contracts with companies like MAN, ARI Motors, and easymile. The company’s complete solution includes customized solar modules, power electronics, telematics and data, mechanical and electrical integration, and after-sales service. The technology is suitable for integration into existing vehicles and ready to be integrated with the production of new vehicles, said Sono Motors.
“Especially in times of rising energy prices and increasing urban area emission regulations, our solar technology offers great added value for public transport operators. City buses and coaches, whether electric or diesel-powered, offer a lot of space and are out on the road every day. The first solar bus trailer for MVG will hit the streets of Munich in the future and allow MVG passengers to experience solar mobility in daily use.” Laurin Hahn, co-founder and CEO of Sono Motors.
The Sion passenger EV
Sono Motors is also developing its own passenger vehicle, the Sion. The Sion sports a liquid cooled battery with a 54kWh battery and a 190 mile range and has 248 solar cells seamlessly integrated in the roof. The PV on the roof can add between 70-150 miles per week to that range.
The car can be charged 80% in 35 minutes via a fast charger, and is capable of public charging, at-home charging, and can exchange power vehicle-to-vehicle. Preorders are available in the German market.
Sono said the former SAAB plant that will be used to produce the Sion will be powered by 100% renewable energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/31/solar-landscape-completes-final-project-under-new-jerseys-community-solar-pilot-program/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW JERSEY",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 31, 2022",Solar Landscape completes final project under New Jersey’s community solar pilot program,"Solar Landscape announced that it has energized its eighth community solar project awarded under New Jersey’s Community Solar Pilot Program Year One, marking the completion of the entire 20MW portfolio that the company was awarded in 2019.
The final installation is located at World Harvest Church in Pennsauken, New Jersey, just east of Philadelphia. Just like the rest of the company’s 20MW Year One portfolio, the electricity generated by the World Harvest Church project will provide energy primarily to low- to moderate-income households, a provision required by state law.
“This is a milestone for New Jersey’s progress in community solar,” said Solar Landscape CEO Shaun Keegan. “Together with our partners across the state, we are bringing affordable solar energy to thousands of people who thought they could never get it, either because they don’t own their home, they live in a place where solar panels aren’t an option or because they lack the financial resources to install them.”
Looking ahead, Solar Landscape’s 46 projects for Year Two of the program are now under construction and are expected to generate more than 50MW of power once operational.
Solar Landscape’s 50MW portfolio represents roughly one-third of all capacity awarded under year two of the community solar program. The program has also been subject to some changes in this second year, as regulators look to reduce time and costs for developers looking to enroll customers in the program.
The changes mainly focus on easing enrollment — simplifying the rules used to verify which customers qualify as low- and moderate-income residents. If the new rules are approved, developers will no longer have to obtain potential subscribers’ two previous years of federal tax returns.
In October 2021, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities announced that it would be making the program permanent, driven by the pilot’s success so far.
Scott Elias, senior manager of state affairs, mid-Atlantic for the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said that the trade group is working with the state to develop a program that adds at least 150MW of solar energy capacity each year.

The Blue Sky project is one of the largest solar projects approved to date in the PJM regional transmission organization, which coordinates wholesale electricity in all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia. Set to clock in at 369MW, the project is being developed on 2,700 acres of land near Morris, Illinois in Grundy County. The Blue Sky facility is scheduled to begin commercial operations in 2024, and Comcast’s PPA will begin in 2025.
During construction, the project will create up to 400 construction jobs and 20 new local long-term jobs. Once in operation, Blue Sky is anticipated to generate $36.3 million in tax revenue over the life of the project, including $25.4 million slated to go directly to local schools.
As far as Comcast is concerned, the 250MW the company has contracted annually will  power approximately 12% of its U.S. operations and the vast majority of its Mid-Atlantic operations with clean, renewable energy.
“Sourcing clean, renewable energy is the top priority for meeting our goal to be carbon neutral by 2035,” said Peter Kiriacoulacos, executive vice president and chief procurement officer at Comcast. “This marks the first of many major green investments that are already underway or on the immediate horizon which demonstrate our commitment to sustainable, responsible business.”
Scout Clean Energy acquired the Blue Sky Solar project from developer Renewable Energy Systems back in December 2021. Scout is a portfolio company of Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners,  a specialist investment manager focused exclusively on renewables, storage and grid support infrastructure and operational asset management in the US, UK, and Australia.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/31/toronto-area-businesses-to-engage-in-77mw-distributed-energy-aggregation/,"BUSINESS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 31, 2022",Toronto area businesses to engage in 77MW distributed energy aggregation,"Enel X won a $3.3 CAD investment from the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) and Ontario Energy Board (OEB) to participate in real-time energy markets by providing demand response services through a series of 14 distributed energy storage and generation sites. Together, the projects, which are sited at 11 different businesses, combine for 77MW in capacity.
The project is expected to support grid resilience and reduce carbon emissions. The funds come as part of IESO’s Grid Innovation Fund and OEB’s Innovation Sandbox. The project aims to create opportunities for businesses to reduce energy use and leverage on-site batteries to meet real-time energy needs.
Alone, these commercially sited batteries and generation sites would not have a large enough capacity to participate in the IESO administered markets under current market rules. But when aggregated, the distributed energy resources (DER) can join the market. Enel X said the pilot project will run for two years, and the company will demonstrate the ability of DERs to provide energy load reduction, and serve as a firm, reliable resource to the grid.
IESO said growth in the industrial sector is expected to cause demand for electricity in Ontario to grow at a rate that outpaces the past, climbing 1.7% each year. “With this investment through the IESO Grid Innovation Fund, Enel X will help these businesses better participate in the electricity sector, securing a new revenue stream while contributing to a reliable, sustainable, and affordable electricity system in Ontario,” said IESO president and CEO Lesley Gallinger.
Enel X has been a participant in demand response programs since they began in Ontario. The company has 150MW of managed commercial and industrial capacity, and has more than 60MW of contracted and operational battery energy storage capacity. The company recently secured partnerships with Toronto-based fleet management company Element, and Killam, one of Canada’s largest residential landlords.
“Large energy users in Ontario continue to make significant commitments to reducing emissions, recognizing emissions reductions not only as an opportunity to make operations more sustainable but an opportunity to manage their energy costs. It’s critical that we continue to unlock these businesses’ energy resources to reduce demand on the grid, lower energy costs, improve sustainability, and deliver economic value.” Surya Panditi, head of Enel X North America.
In North America, Enel X has about 4,500 business customers, representing $10.5 billion in energy spending under management. It has about 4.7GW of demand response capacity, over 100 battery storage projects under operation, more than 100,000 electric vehicle charging stations, and 3GW long-term renewable energy contracts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/31/evolving-requirements-in-the-solar-storage-industry/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 31, 2022",Evolving requirements in the solar + storage industry,"According to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, utility-interactive PV systems were a small percentage of PV systems installed in the United States before 2000. The primary standard for the power conversion hardware for solar PV in the United States, UL 1741, was originally published in May of 1999 by Underwriters Laboratories (UL). UL 1741 focused on inverters and charge controllers for photovoltaic power systems, with a primary focus on safety. By January of 2001, the report expanded its scope to include other power conversion sources for independent power production systems and photovoltaic was dropped from the title. Since then, UL 1741 has expanded to cover various types of equipment used in DER applications. A facility certified to perform the testing required to achieve listing under standards like UL1741 is referred to as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL).
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published the IEEE 1547 standard in 2003 to address the interaction aspect of DERs. IEEE1547 was accepted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a national standard shortly thereafter. The test procedures required to successfully demonstrate compliance to the IEEE 1547 standard were documented in IEEE 1547.1, first published in 2005. UL 1741 was updated in 2010 to specifically reference IEEE 1547 and 1547.1. IEEE standards are voluntary standards that need to be specifically referenced in testing requirements to ensure they are always incorporated. The rapid growth of the PV industry prompted updates to UL 1741, IEEE 1547 and 1547.1. These changes rolled out at different times and were only required in certain markets. The lack of harmonization of these standards has been a growing cause of confusion within the PV industry.
The PV industry in the United States grew rapidly in 2010. The Department of Energy reported 918MW of capacity installed in 2010, bringing the total installed to roughly 2,500MW. California was responsible for the majority of this capacity, and concerns grew at the major utilities in the state. The utility infrastructure was built so that very large power plants could send power in one direction: to customers. Many of those customers produced power that could be sent back to the utility. Concerns about the impacts of massive growth in customer sited DERs on power quality and grid stability were growing across the United States, especially in Hawaii and California.
In 2011, proceedings in California began examining how to update the California Rule 21 requirements for utility interconnected power producing facilities, in the territories of investor-owned utilities (including PG&E, SCE and SDG&E). The Smart Inverter Working Group (SIWG) was formed and drafted recommendations on beneficial “grid support” functions that, if required by CA Rule 21, could mitigate the impacts on the grid of large amounts of connected DERs. Shortly after, Hawaii started similar work within the industry which resulted in updates to the utility rules that evolved over time.
The IEEE 1547 standard was amended in 2014 to allow for the possibility of utility interactive inverters to provide grid voltage support through active or reactive power output adjustment and frequency support by active power adjustments. Ride-through of brief voltage and frequency excursions away from nominal values for the grid were added. This marked a dramatic change in behavior for DERs. Inverters previously had to detect if grid voltage or frequency deviated marginally from nominal values, and if so, disconnect from the grid in specified times. No intentional action to modify grid voltage or frequency had been allowed. Lessons learned in Europe dramatically illustrated the weakness of that policy as the capacity of DERs connected to a grid increased.
The SIWG in California adopted points of IEEE 1547a in their recommendations, but also included additional required “grid support” functions. In 2014, those recommendations were adopted into California Rule 21, with an enforcement deadline of 2017. Pressure from the impending requirements in the largest PV market in the nation instigated an update to UL 1741 to add Supplement SA that incorporated testing procedures for the soon-to-be required “grid support” functions. Inverters that passed the UL 1741 Supplement SA testing were labelled “grid support utility-interactive inverters,” to explicitly call out the grid-support capability – even if it was not enabled.
This situation meant UL 1741 referenced IEEE 1547, but included additional interaction details, to cover requirements of specific regions of the nation. This misalignment was addressed in revision of the IEEE 1547 standard which was published in 2018. It was predicted that different regions would have different requirements for grid support from DERs based on the density of installations. However, the capability to provide this grid support was determined to be beneficial in any density scenario.
The IEEE 1547-2018 revision requires inverters to demonstrate the ability to ride through brief utility voltage or frequency deviations and to adjust active power in response to frequency deviations. It additionally requires inverters to adjust reactive or active power in response to voltage deviations and provide for communication via a standardized protocol.
These changes were incorporated into the testing standards document IEEE 1547.1, published in May of 2020. To harmonize with these updates, a third edition of UL 1741 including Supplement SB was published in September 2021 with reference to IEEE 1547-2018 and IEEE 1547.1-2020. As industry and test labs started to implement these new test procedures, issues with certain test procedures in IEEE 1547.1-2020 were identified that required clarification. By September 28, 2021, UL published UL 1741 Third Edition with substantial updates to Supplement SB that clarified these testing issues. Compliance to IEEE 1547-2018 is now verified by certification to UL 1741 Third Edition using Supplement SB and IEEE 1547.1-2020.
This new certification will be required soon, but potentially not until mid-2022 at the earliest. California has postponed the deadline until March 28, 2023. Many jurisdictions have not finalized a new date and there will likely be more adjustments. Why has there been such a delay in requiring these beneficial features? Inverters are certified to UL 1741 not IEEE 1547.1 because there are safety tests included in UL 1741 that are not addressed in IEEE 1547.1. Only after the updates to UL 1741 were published was it even possible for equipment to be tested, and that resulted in the identification of uncertainty in the procedures that resulted in further updates to UL1741 late in 2021. The NRTLs need to set up equipment and validate the new test procedures after each change. It is impossible for hundreds of devices from dozens of manufacturers to proceed through this detailed (i.e., time-consuming) testing process in a short time span.
The path to certification under the new UL1741 Third Edition with Supplement SB appears to be finalized, but that is not the end of the road for equipment manufacturers and utilities. To understand the remaining portion of the journey, remember the new testing required manufacturers to demonstrate their equipment had certain capabilities. Individual utilities will specify through their interconnection rules which of these functions must be activated within their territories and what parameters are to be used to configure each function.
There are two category-based requirements that will be specified. First, there are three possible categories (I, II, and III) for voltage and frequency ride-through capability, and each utility can direct individual parameters to be changed from default values for the categories. Second, there are two possible categories (A or B) for reactive power capability and response to voltage variations within the normal operating range. To help clearly convey what functions are active and what parameter settings have been chosen for each, a “utility required profile” (URP) format specification has been developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The goal of this specification is to eventually allow for the automated exchange and verification of parameters between installers and utility inspectors.
The updated certification process is certainly more involved but provides a uniform testing framework while still allowing utilities to specify equipment settings tailored to their constraints and level of DER penetration. This massive effort should reduce industry confusion on equipment certification, and shift the focus to utility requirements, hopefully within a standard framework like the URP. SMA America is proud to leverage its 40+ years of industry experience and participate with other experts in the drafting and updating of DER standards and procedures, so that renewables can increasingly be part of the solution to our future energy needs.
The next article in this series will look at other required standards for PV inverters, like DC arc-fault detection and rapid shutdown. Future articles will consider the landscape for grid interactive solar + storage systems.

Prof. Overland, the war in Ukraine appears to have already disrupted the European and global energy landscape. Have we already crossed a point of no return? Do you believe the ‘back to normal’ option can now be completely excluded?  
Yes, I am certain that we will not return to the status quo that existed before Feb. 24, 2022. Although there are many uncertainties and possible outcomes, I don’t see how a return to the past could happen.
Relations between Russia and Europe have always been complex when it comes to energy supplies. Europe may encounter big problems by completely cutting gas supplies from Russia, but Moscow will always need a buyer, and Europe may still be its best client in the decades to come. Do you really think Russian gas can be sold in other markets, such as Asia or elsewhere? 
In principle, a good bit of Russian gas previously sold to Europe could go to Asia. However, it would require new infrastructure such as pipelines or liquefaction terminals for liquid natural gas (LNG) and take some years to prepare. And LNG may be difficult now because it requires foreign technology and know-how and sanctions will cause a lot of problems. Access to capital will be a problem both for LNG and pipelines, though in principle the Chinese could provide it for pipelines. However, even if it worked out with new pipelines, they would eat up a bit of the profit and the lack of competition between buyers would reduce profits even more.

What could be expected if Europe loses access to Russian gas? And what’s the likely scenario if gas supplies go back to normal?
If the Russian gas supply is lost, it may be a very tough situation for Europe. However, it may also help overcome the Putin regime in Russia, solving some of Europe’s long-term problems. High energy prices are usually a problem for politicians, but may be less so when the population knows they are due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. How it will play out, I don’t think anyone knows.
Which countries can most easily find alternative solutions if Russian energy supplies are interrupted?
I believe Spain and possibly the UK are relatively well-positioned to handle this. Perhaps also the Netherlands, if they are willing to start producing from the Groningen gas field again for a short period to alleviate the situation. Perhaps the most exposed country is Germany. Although I am a big fan of Germany, it has to be admitted that it has brushed aside all warnings and made itself highly dependent on Russian energy, in the process in fact helping facilitate the Russian invasion of Ukraine and imperilling Europe’s energy supply. Thus Germany also has the greatest moral obligation to make sacrifices to help resolve the situation. So far we have not seen this.
I think it may be too soon to outline possible scenarios, but do you believe the current situation will really be a big driver for more renewables expansion in the short term in Europe and globally, as expected by many analysts? Do you see more challenges or opportunities at this stage? 
Yes, I cannot see how these developments can avoid leading to massive investment in renewable energy, probably also nuclear power. I think the only question is how fast it can be done, and here lack of labor and equipment and dependence on Chinese equipment will be important factors. Anyone who has acquired skills related to the installation of solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps or electric vehicles is guaranteed good work for a long time.
Higher energy and gas prices may be a good driver for renewable energy, especially for unsubsidized projects under bilateral purchase agreements. However, the current price volatility is discouraging this market trend. Do you believe this unstable scenario could last for a long time? What kind of impact could this have on clean energy development? 
As I can’t see how the conflict between Russia and the West over Ukraine can be solved, I expect fossil fuel prices to remain high for long. However the current war develops, it will be very difficult for Russia to give up Crimea, and it will be impossible for the West to accept the continued occupation of Crimea. And as this intractable nature of the conflict becomes clear to markets, they should gain confidence and their willingness to take long-term financial risk should grow.
We have seen many governments in Europe taking measures to support new deployments of solar, wind and heat pumps. Authorizations are now being given more easily in several countries and fiscal incentives are being awarded. Do you think that politics could now turn to renewables on a scale we have never seen before? Would this be a real mindset change? 
Yes, I think that is the direction we are going in. I expect to see a lot more regulatory easing than we have seen so far and it should also become easier to overcome ‘NIMBY’ (not in my backyard) instincts, which are a major obstacle for renewable energy developments, especially wind power. This is because I think the invasion of Ukraine qualitatively changes the nature of many arguments and discussions about energy, pricing and what people must accept. In addition, Russia has also very actively been supporting right-wing populists all over the West who are anti-climate and anti-renewables, both major politicians and parties. The reduction of this support, both because of crackdowns from Western governments and because of less Russian money and access, should also help reduce resistance to new renewable energy installations.
Which countries will be the biggest winners and losers of this crisis?
In the short term, Russia and Ukraine are the biggest losers. Ukraine has been subjected to a gruesome attack, Russia is shooting itself in the foot with all the weapons it has. Tens of thousands of young Russian men are killed, wounded or traumatized; weapons worth billions and billions of dollars are destroyed; the economy is devastated; the most educated and dynamic young people are leaving; Russia has become and will remain a pariah among all developed countries; it will take decades or centuries for the Ukrainians to forgive the Russians. Unlike the weak sanctions after the occupation of Crimea, the current sanctions will have a more substantial effect. In the longer term, Russia will inevitably continue to be a big loser as long as Putin is in power, while Ukraine may emerge victorious and greatly strengthened. Concerning winners, other oil and gas exporters like Canada, Norway, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia are big winners.
The USA is also a big winner, both as a major oil and gas producers and because Russia’s aggression hugely strengthens the USA’s position in Europe, as well as that of NATO. Countries that are at the forefront of renewable energy equipment manufacturing may also see great long-term benefits, for example Denmark. The current developments will also reinforce the trend towards a geopolitical rebalancing based on the decline of fossil fuels and rise of renewables. The invasion also strengthens the Democrats within the USA, which is again good for the USA as long as Trump is the alternative. Russophobes of all hues are also big winners and can send a big thanks to Vladimir Putin.
Prof. Indra Overland is an expert on Russian and global energy issues and has published academic works on the Russian natural gas sector and Russian oil companies. In previous interviews with pv magazine, Overland has discussed geopolitical issues related to the GeGaLo Index, the geopolitics of hydrogen, the myths around the geopolitics of renewable energy, and the combination of solar and hydropower. He has also talked about countries such as China, the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as technologies such as storage, super-grids and the energy transition in general.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/31/doe-names-22-communities-to-receive-energy-assistance-through-the-communities-leap-program/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 31, 2022",DOE names 22 communities to receive energy assistance through the Communities LEAP program,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) Local Energy Action Program, also called Communities LEAP, is an initiative designed to help energy-overburdened communities take direct control of their clean energy futures. The DOE just announced the first 22 communities that will receive support to create community-wide action plans that reduce local air pollution, increase energy resilience, lower utility costs and energy burdens, and provide long-term jobs and economic opportunities.
Nationally, more than 65% of low-income households face a high energy burden and more than 30% of all households have experienced some form of energy insecurity. The Communities LEAP opportunity is specifically open to low-income, communities that are also experiencing either direct environmental justice impacts, or direct economic impacts of shifting away from fossil fuels.  The Communities LEAP Pilot aims to provide supportive services valued at up to $16M for community-driven clean energy transitions.
The 22 communities will receive support to assist them in their transition to a clean energy economy, and to build a healthier, more equitable, and sustainable future.
“The President committed to making a historic investment in our clean energy future and environmental justice,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “With today’s Communities LEAP announcement, we will use the power of the Federal government, DOE’s National Labs and other experts to help our communities develop clear, actionable plans to reimagine their energy future and protect the health and safety of all residents.”
The intention of the Communities LEAP is to help open the door for communities to access significant, additional DOE and other federal government programs, including those included in the $1.3 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Communities LEAP also implements the Biden-Harris Administration’s Justice40 commitment, which aims to ensure that federal agencies deliver at least 40% of benefits from certain investments to disadvantaged communities and advances the work of the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities, which focuses on delivering federal investment to hard-hit energy communities.
The benefits of transitioning to a clean energy economy include lowering local air pollution and reducing energy burdens, but it also has the potental to bring in billions of dollars to communities across the country while generating good-paying jobs. In 2019, renewable energy investments in the US reached $55 billion and clean energy jobs paid 25% more than the national median wage. Workers in clean energy earned a median hourly wage of $23.89 compared to the national median wage of $19.14.
The 22 selected communities will work with DOE and its network of technical assistance providers, government and non-governmental partners, community-based organizations, utilities as well as environmental justice, economic development, and equitable investment organizations to develop roadmaps for clean energy economic development pathways. The inaugural Communities LEAP localities will pursue strategies for planning and investment in energy efficient buildings and beneficial electrification, clean energy development, clean transportation, critical minerals recovery, resilient microgrids and energy storage, manufacturing and industry opportunities.
The selected communities are: 
Commenting on what this means to Seattle’s Beacon Hill community, US Congressman Adam Smith noted that families in this community rely primarily on oil to heat their homes, which increases the already poor air quality in the area. “The technical assistance provided through this DOE program will help these community organizations led by El Centro de la Raza convert homes from oil furnaces to electric heat pumps, expand weatherization services, and ensure that every community member, regardless of language or culture barriers, is reached,” said Smith.
“The federal investment announced today will help drive new economic opportunities and support new and good-paying jobs in coal communities in West Virginia,” said U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “As always, I will continue to advocate for policies and funding that will revitalize communities across the Mountain State and ensure they have the tools they need to build a brighter future.”
