U.S.-based solar manufacturer Sunpower has unveiled two new storage systems for residential rooftop PV systems.
The two devices, called SV-BASE13-C and SV-BASE19.5-C, respectively are part of the company’s Sunvault series. “With this launch, SunVault is now available in five configurations: 13 kWh, 19.5 kWh, 26 kWh, 39 kWh and 52 kWh. Some of these options include multiple inverters,” it said in a statement released.
The SV-BASE13-C storage system has a storage capacity of 13 kWh and maximum usable energy of 12 kWh. It measures 164 cm × 71 cm × 36 cm and has a weight of 217 kg.
The SV-BASE19.5-C battery features a storage capacity of 19.5 kWh and maximum usable energy of 18 kWh. It has the same size as the SV-BASE13-C system and weighs 267 kg.
Both lithium-ion systems use LiFePO4 as the cathode material and have a round-trip efficiency of over 86%. Their nominal internal voltage is 51.2 V and the maximum (AC) continuous backup output current is 28.3 A.
Both batteries can operate with an ambient temperature range of -20 C to 45 C and feature an IP54 protection level. The new products come with a 10-year warranty and, according to the manufacturer, can operate for unlimited cycles.
“With these new storage sizes and higher power output through multiple inverters, SunVault’s modular configuration allows customers to get the storage size they need today with the reassurance that they can grow their system as their home energy requirements change,” Sunpower said. “The new SunVault sizes will be available beginning early 2023.”

Fire broke out in a battery energy storage facility housing a 182.5 MW Tesla Megapack system, where at least one of the battery units caught on fire. The facility is operated by utility PG&E and is located in Monterey County, California, in the United States.
“There have been no injuries to onsite personnel, and there are no electrical outages for customers at this time due to the incident,” Jeff Smith, operations and communications manager at PG&E, told pv magazine.
The fire started at 1:30 a.m. Pacific Time (PT) on the morning of September 21, and was fully controlled by firefighters at the North Country Fire Department by 7:00 p.m. PT. It caused California’s Highway 1 to shut down. The County Sherriff’s Office lifted its twelve-hour long shelter-in-place advisory at 7 p.m. PT and reopened the roads. Residents had been asked to shut all windows and turn off ventilation systems due to the hazardous material emitted by lithium-ion battery fires. The County Office advised via Twitter that smoke may still occur in the area for several days despite the fire being fully controlled.
According to local media reports, firefighters let the initial megapack burn out and worked to prevent flames from spreading to adjoining batteries and structures in the large-scale system, as per protocols recommended by PG&E and Tesla to the fire department. The cause of the fire is still unknown, and a joint investigation will be carried out by PG&E and Tesla.
“Safety systems at the facility worked as designed and automatically disconnected the battery from the electrical grid,” Smith said. Property damage to the battery is expected to exceed $50,000, according to preliminary information shared by PG&E.
The Californian facility is one of the biggest utility-owned, lithium-ion battery energy storage systems in the world. A Tesla Megapack also caught fire last year in the Victorian Big Battery in Moorabool, Australia, seen in photo above.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/22/battery-manufacturing-ramps-up-in-the-u-s-a/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2022",Battery manufacturing ramps up in the U.S.,"In August President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate and energy package in the history of the United States. Included in the IRA is over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, which includes $30 billion in production tax credits to accelerate domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing. A month later and battery manufacturers are clamoring to set up shop in the United States to take advantage of the financial incentives and to be a part of the clean energy transition.
Panasonic
Panasonic, which makes batteries for electric vehicles, was already manufacturing in the US at a Nevada gigafactory operated in conjunction with Tesla. Now it plans to expand a new facility in Kansas and open yet another facility in Oklahoma. When complete, the Kansas plant would be the largest economic development in the state’s history and would be larger than the Nevada gigafactory.
Panasonic’s factories are expected to produce the company’s lithium-ion 4680 cells for the batteries that go in EVs such as Teslas. Demand for EVs is expected to pick up, also as the result of the IRA, as it includes a $4,000 consumer tax credit for low- to-middle income individuals to buy used clean vehicles, and up to $7500 for new clean vehicles, which includes electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. EV sales will also be boosted by the passage of state bans on gas-powered vehicles—with California leading the way with a ban on sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Other states, including Washington, New York and Massachusetts may follow suit.
GM and LG
GM and LG recently announced a joint venture to build EV battery manufacturing plants in Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan. Announced prior to the signing of the IRA, the joint venture, called Ultium Cells LLC, announced that it received a $2.5 billion loan from the U.S. Energy Department to help finance construction of the new plants. The loan comes from the government’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program, which has $17.7 billion in loan authority to support the manufacture of eligible light-duty vehicles and qualifying components, authorized by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.
GM and LG are investing more than $7 billion via the venture to build three battery plants, according to a Reuters article. The Warren, Ohio plant is currently employing 700 workers and is planned to begin production next month. The Tennessee plant will start production in late 2023 and the Michigan plant in 2024, according to the Reuters report.
Toyota
Just as Toyota announced its target of 40% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electrified vehicles by 2025, which increases to 70% by 2030, it announced an additional investment of $2.5 billion in its newest North American facility, Toyota Battery Manufacturing in North Carolina. The expanded manufacturing facility will not only provide the batteries for its EVs, but will add 350 jobs, bringing the total employment to approximately 2,100. Production is expected to begin in 2025. With the new investment in its North Carolina battery manufacturing facility, the total commitment to advancing its battery production is now $5.6 billion.
Zinc8
Canadian battery developer, Zinc8, is not a well-known brand in the United States, but the company plans to bring battery manufacturing to New York state, incentivized by manufacturing production credits within the Inflation Reduction Act. The inaugural facility is planned for Ulster County, which it will produce batteries based on its proprietary flow battery technology for long-duration energy storage. Zinc8 claims that it is able to deliver power in the range from 20 kW to 50 MW that can store and discharge energy durations from 4 to 100 hours. Scalability and higher capacity is achieved with an increase in the size of storage tanks that hold zinc particles. Intended use is for microgrids and utilities, as well as for commercial and industrial projects.
The company chose Ulster County in Upstate New York after Senator Chuck Schumer personally called the CEO of Zinc8, Ron MacDonald, to urge the company to expand their operations in New York state and particularly to Ulster County.
“Zinc8 is the jolt of electricity the Hudson Valley needs, and is proof positive that when you invest in fighting climate change you are investing in creating good-paying jobs, new economic growth, and a brighter future for our communities. As the EPA officially begins cleanup of this once-contaminated asbestos dumping ground, I can think of no better way to usher in a renaissance for Ulster County than by making this the foundation for supercharging the fight against climate change with an investment in clean tech manufacturing,” said Senator Schumer.
SuperBase
The SuperBase battery is manufactured by U.S. startup, Zendure. It’s a plug-and-play residential storage system with semi-solid-state batteries designed for household backup power, mobile living, and portable EV charging applications.
The SuperBase V 6400 (SBV) measures 29 inches by 14 inches by 17.4 inches, including its real wheels, and weighs 130 pounds. The semi-solid state Satellite battery B6400 measures 27 inches by 11.22 inches by 11 inches and weighs 101 pounds. One SBV unit has a storage capacity of 6.438 kWh and can be scaled with up to four battery modules, reaching a capacity of 32 kWh. Two SBV units can be chained together to reach up to 64 kWh capacity. The energy storage system can operate at temperatures ranging from -20 C to 45 C and has a 3,000-cycle life.
The battery pack, according to the manufacturer, contains 42% more energy than lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries. The company is launching versions of the system for the U.S. and European markets, with different inputs and outputs. The U.S. version has a maximum 1,800 W output at 120V, and of 3,800 W at 240V.
Ion Storage Systems
Another U.S.-based startup, Ion Storage Systems, raised $30 million venture capital funding, which will go toward scaling up its solid-state battery cell production facility in Maryland, with aims to produce 10 MWh per year by the end of 2023. The funding came from Toyota Ventures, Tenaska, and Bangchak Corp.
The key differences to other solid-state and next-generation batteries is its bi-layer cell design, which the company says reduces typical lithium-ion battery defects, and works with existing and next-generation cathode chemistries, avoiding the use of critical raw materials like cobalt, nickel, and gold.
Neil Ovadia, Ion’s vice-president of operations, told pv magazine that the company can target multiple markets, ranging from defense to consumer products to electric vehicles and stationary grid storage. Ovadia noted that Ion is working on a variation to the core product meant for stationary storage applications.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/22/three-major-drivers-in-solar-growth/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2022",Three major drivers in solar growth,"This August saw ratings giant Moody’s predict that the issue of green, social, sustainability, and sustainability linked (GSSS) bonds will reach $1 trillion in 2022. Bloomberg Intelligence has predicted that global ESG assets are on track to exceed $53 trillion by 2025, representing more than a third of all assets under management. When a third of the world’s investments are ESG, or Environmental, Social, and Governance, that’s no longer a trend but a transformation.
For companies that create a product that is already aligned with that direction of travel, such as solar creating a product for low carbon power generation, that seems a perfect match. What we’re beginning to see, however, is a shift towards where operational sustainability is becoming a must have, no matter the product. As Mia d’Adhemar, Head of GRI Sector Standards puts it, “the foundation of sustainability reporting is for an organization to be transparent about its impacts on the economy, environment, and people. These impacts can be negative or positive, short term or long term, intended or unintended, and reversible or irreversible.”
Adverse impacts
Under the EU’s proposed sustainability reporting guidelines, for example, the impact of the business on the wider economy, environment, and society must be explored and reports must be made on “potential adverse impacts” of the business. While the final shape of the guidelines has yet to be agreed, this will require sustainability reporting for any company wishing to access funding under the EU Taxonomy framework for sustainable activities. That is going to channel significant funding and means that operational sustainability will become as important as products.
Kent Halliburton, president and COO of bitcoin-mining platform Sazmining, points out the role of solar in helping other companies achieve their ESG criteria and net zero goals: “We can see this if we look at the growth in solar bond purchases from investment firms. From January to March 2022, we’ve already seen sales of about $2 billion worth of solar bonds, doubling the amount sold during the same period in 2020 and 2019.”
Solar appeal
Solar is massively appealing as a net zero product, one which generates low carbon power. According to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) recent report on supply chains, domestically produced solar modules, including polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells, and module assembly, need to operate for just three to five months before they’ve generated enough clean power to cover their manufacturing-related emissions. They are now also lower in price than most alternatives.
Some have expressed concern that solar prices will continue to rise, with 2021 seeing the reversal of a decade long downward trend. Much of that was due to increasing cost of polysilicon but Peter White, chief executive of Rethink Technology Research, says “the supply chain is getting tighter due to the shortage of polysilicon, glass, and certain metals for solar, but this is mostly artificial, with the US and India using tariffs to keep Chinese-made solar out of their markets. And it will go away by the end of 2024, as more polysilicon factories come online.”
Offering a low carbon power generation solution at a low cost may make solar an obvious match for ESG funds. Increasingly, however, the sector is being asked how to address concerns about toxic pollution in production, resource management, slavery in the supply chain, and more.
Supply chain challenges
Adham Makki, decarbonization research manager at EcoAct, an Atos company, warns that solar cell manufacturing is a resource-intensive process, requiring a substantial amount of water and industrial materials. “The manufacturing process also involves toxic waste, unsustainable mining practices and habitat loss, all of which need careful consideration if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” he says.
The issue of labor practices is increasingly high profile as well. In 2021, the Helen Kennedy Centre released a report, exploring accusations of forced labor in the Xinjiang region, which is responsible for as much as 50% of global polysilicon supply.
The United States has already imposed restrictions on imports from the Xinjiang region and the US-based Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) launched a pledge for companies to commit to removing such practices from the supply chain, which companies including Tesla and JinkoSolar US have all signed.
“The sector takes reports of forced labor in its supply chain extremely seriously. SolarPower Europe is currently hard at work, in close contact with our members, to increase supply chain transparency. In partnership with Solar Energy UK, SolarPower Europe is developing a Supply Chain Monitoring Programme to ensure that solar modules entering Europe comply with international sustainability and labor standards,” says Dries Acke, policy director at SolarPower Europe. Undoubtedly, such concerns will be an issue for ESG investment.
New opportunities
There are huge opportunities for the solar sector. The demand and scale required in the sector is immense, with expectations that it will provide over 16% of global electricity by 2050. That means demand for chemical elements such as gallium and indium, and metals like silver and copper. Reliance on products, such as aluminum, that are carbon intensive in manufacture, further mean other sectors must decarbonize to lower emissions for solar. All of this will drive demand for new materials and new technologies, as well as innovative ways of using solar.
In terms of increasing land use challenges, new approaches are already in play which are driving market growth and can be used to argue ESG benefit. The EU has projected that 25% of the region’s electricity needs could be met through rooftop solar alone. Floating PV (FPV) symbiotically combines power generation with the shade for bodies of water, limiting evaporation. Meanwhile, bifacial modules are helping drive agri-PV, adding biodiversity and nature protection benefits through shade, cutting water use, as well as protecting crops and livestock from inclement weather.
Recycling is also going to play an important role in meeting demand. “Both economic and environmental benefits can be attained from recycling by increasing the security of the supply of raw materials, and by preventing materials within solar panels that hold economic value, like copper and silver, from ending up in landfills. Reusing old materials will eventually lower the demand for new materials as well,” says Acke.
Worldwide, the recycling of materials is low. This is compounded by a lack of financial incentives to activate recycling measures. Yet a supportive regulatory framework could transform this, allowing the solar sector to make the most efficient and effective use of depleting resources.
Certainly in the US and Canada there is increasing focus on recycling. Jason Smith, sustainable supply and value Chain expert at PA Consulting, says “they’re looking at individual component parts and processes, probably 10% of the market moving forward that can be reused. The challenge is that the PV supply chain is quite complex, involving silicon, copper, glass, and other materials. Recovery is labor intensive.”
A huge opportunity
Alan Duncan, founder of Solar Panels Network USA, says that the rise of ESG has made us even more aware of the need to pay attention to our supply chain and operational impacts.
“We’re working closely with our suppliers to make sure they meet our high standards for sustainability, and we’re constantly looking for ways to reduce our own environmental impact,” Duncan says. Action on some of the solar sector’s challenge is already taking place, opening new opportunities for the sector, and its supply chain, to grow.
There are inevitably going to be trade-offs for ESG and sustainability investors in terms of balancing supply chain concerns with the emissions reduction solar offers. To make such trade-offs there needs to be far greater understanding of, and transparency around, what is going on across the sector. That means traceability is going to be critical moving forward. This is an increasing demand across many sectors as buyers want to know what they’re getting.
While there are ratings for the solar sector, there are also many challenges in the ESG landscape due to the number of differing frameworks that are applicable and a lack of standardized reporting requirements.
As the EU sustainability framework comes into play, that single legislative framework will help cut through some of the noise. Smith believes we are facing a massive change in supply and manufacturing, and the solar sector needs to start implementing ESG factors into the supply chain if it wants to be able to access the billions in available capital to fund that shift.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/22/real-barriers-to-virtual-power-plants/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2022",Real barriers to virtual power plants,"In recent decades, the United States has made unprecedented technical advancements in a broad array of clean energy solutions with the potential to decarbonize the grid while making it more equitable and resilient. We now find ourselves in a new stage of the clean energy revolution and on the cusp of a dramatic transformation of the electricity sector.
The speed at which this transformation occurs will be determined not by the pace of technical innovation, but by the availability of debt financing for unfamiliar technologies and the ability of innovative grid-scale solutions to tap into viable business models. This is particularly true for virtual power plants (VPPs).
As we view it at the US Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), a VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) like PV, energy storage, EV chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances). VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants.
Market entry
In September 2020, FERC Order 2222 opened the door for VPPs in the United States. Nearly two years later, VPPs are just beginning to compete in organized capacity, energy, and ancillary services markets at a meaningful scale at the regional level. To truly unlock VPP’s potential, wide reaching deployment at the national scale is needed.
At the state and retail level, utilities have an important role to play in scaling up DER integration and automated demand response. Equally important will be the ability of VPP aggregators to secure revenue contracts that can underpin a successful business endeavor.
To unleash the capital that makes ratepayer and wholesale power cost reductions possible, incumbent financiers need to see lower customer acquisition costs and consistent revenues for the critical services provided. These and other challenges are far from intractable, and well-worth the cascade of benefits we expect to unlock if we come together to solve them.
Consumer advocates, local government, established utilities, and other partners that have earned the public’s trust across income strata can be important allies for aggregators looking to lower customer acquisition costs. Separately, open-source standards and packages like OpenADR, EcoPort, or other measures that enable intersystem transferability will be important tools to empower consumers by enabling them to switch aggregators.
As director of LPO, I lead the provision of public debt capital for technology projects in the US that are large-scale, innovative, and clean when private lenders cannot or will not lean-in. Bridging this gap while protecting the taxpayer interest is a challenge only surmountable with vast expertise across financial, technical, utility, and clean energy fields that comes together at a place like the Department of Energy. From this vantage point, my goal is to educate the audience on the essential nature of VPPs – there is simply no other cost-effective way to integrate electric vehicles and heat pumps at scale.
In pursuit of this educational role, I have surveyed the technical components of VPPs – from hard assets like PV, energy storage, and grid-interactive efficient buildings and appliances, to the core role of the software and control applications. I have looked at the importance of interoperability between VPPs and existing grid control systems, but also among software and the diversely sourced hardware of a VPP itself. One conclusion I have reached is that the technology has been available for decades but integrating and compensating these technologies remains elusive within utility planning.
To explore these challenges further, I will be looking at VPPs on the pv magazine USA site with a fresh lens – a new, follow-on video series. I’ll sit down with guests from around the US with real-world VPP experience as customers, operators, and regulators. We’ll talk about the benefits of VPPs in terms of resilience, equity, and decarbonization. As well as the growing pains they’ve witnessed as pioneers. We’ll look at what’s working, what needs improvement, and how we can help one another to realize the benefits of the technology’s progress.
