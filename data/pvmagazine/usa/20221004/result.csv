The software is akin to having an expert at the project site, the company says, because it helps streamline on-site operations and supports workforce development. With installed solar capacity in the U.S. projected to grow nearly threefold by 2027 under the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act, SolarGrade is designed help address workforce challenges with its pre-built and customizable workflows that standardize on-site processes and procedures so that field teams can quickly identify problems. The pre-written issue descriptions improve documentation in the field and automate reporting.  Geo-referenced issue-tracking helps reduce future service calls, thus saving time spent on the site.
“SolarGrade was selected as a winner for the fifth round of the American-Made Solar Prize because it meets an increasingly urgent need for solar-specific O&M and fieldwork tools,” commented Debbie Brodt-Giles, lead prize administrator at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
The Solar Prize is designed to energize U.S. solar innovation through a series of contests that reduces the time involved in the entrepreneurial process from years to months.
“We built SolarGrade to empower solar professionals like ourselves, who have high standards for quality, safety and performance but are under immense pressure to reduce costs and save time in a fiercely competitive market,” commented David Penalva, co-founder of HelioVolta.
HelioVolta will use the prize money to expand its team and accelerate software development efforts. The company hopes to quadruple the existing SolarGrade user base by 2024 by expanding its value proposition and implementing new features that support fieldwork across the full solar project lifecycle.
“In just a few months, we have already experienced benefits from implementing SolarGrade in our project development, construction and operational asset activities,” commented Armando Solis, senior director of engineering in the Americas for Lightsource bp. “We plan to continue utilizing the platform as it evolves and improves over time.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/04/multi-day-iron-air-battery-startup-nets-450-million-investment/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 4, 2022",Multi-day iron-air battery startup nets $450 million investment,"Solar and wind power have intermittency in their productive hours, as multi-day weather events can impact output. Therefore, multi-day storage that is cost effective is an important feature in grid reliability.
Boston startup Form Energy developed technology to address this need, creating multi-day iron-air batteries. The company said its batteries can store renewables-sourced electricity for 100 hours at system costs competitive with conventional power plants. At full-scale production, Form Energy said the modules would deliver electricity at tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air and create rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
The technology has garnered significant interest from investors. Most recently, it raised $450 million in a Series E funding round led by TPG Rise Climate. Also joining the Series E round are GIC and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), along with existing investors ArcelorMittal, Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), Capricorn Investment Group, Coatue, Energy Impact Partners (EIP), MIT’s The Engine, NGP ETP, Temasek, Prelude Ventures, and VamosVentures.
“The development of reliable, long duration energy storage technology is critical for the global transition to renewable energy,” said Leon Pedersen, Managing Director and Head of Growth Equity at CPP Investments. “By introducing new storage solutions to the market, Form Energy can contribute to the energy transition process while also providing attractive risk-adjusted returns for the CPP Fund.”
The technology is less energy-dense than its lithium-ion counterparts, making it a better fit for large grid-scale applications. This may come as an advantage for the company, as EV batteries are in competition for lithium, a metal with geo-political mining concerns and battery fire risks.
Form Energy said an individual battery module is about the size of a side-by-side washer/dryer set and contains a stack of approximately 50 one meter-tall cells. The cells include iron and air electrodes, the parts of the battery that enable the electrochemical reactions to store and discharge electricity. Each of these cells are filled with water-based, non-flammable electrolyte, like the electrolyte used in AA batteries.
These battery modules are grouped together in environmentally protected enclosures. Hundreds of these enclosures are grouped together in modular megawatt-scale power blocks. Depending on the system size, tens to hundreds of these power blocks can be connected to the electricity grid. For scale, in its least dense configuration, a one megawatt system comprises half an acre of land. Higher density configurations would achieve >3 mw/acre.
The company’s first project is a 1 MW / 150 MWh pilot installation with Minnesota-based utility Great River Energy, located near the American Iron Range. Form Energy said it expects to have the facility deployed at a Great River Energy power plant by 2023.
Upon the funding announcement, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said, “Form was founded with a unified mission to develop a multi-day energy storage battery that would unlock the power of extremely low-cost renewable energy to transform the electric grid. Over the last five years, through rigorous R&D and product engineering, our 100-hour iron-air battery product is ready to scale. The Series E funding will accelerate our ability to responsibly build a globally competitive U.S. battery manufacturing supply chain and advance American innovation.”
Form Energy said it is currently engaged in a site selection process for its first full scale battery manufacturing facility. Starting with identifying over 100 initial sites across 16 states, Form said it has narrowed the site selection to three states, and expects to make an announcement in this regard before the end of the year.
The funding round builds on last year’s $200 million in Series D funding. This round was led by $25 million from ArcelorMittal’s XCarb innovation fund. ArcelorMittal will non-exclusively supply the iron materials for the battery system production, and Form Energy said it intends to source its iron domestically, manufacturing the batteries near where the iron was sourced.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/04/50-states-of-solar-incentives-south-carolina/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH CAROLINA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 4, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: South Carolina,"South Carolina’s solar industry was essentially born six years ago in 2016, when a boom in both residential and utility-scale solar occurred in the state. Before this, there was an infinitesimal cumulative capacity of solar. In 2020, the state experienced peak deployment, with nearly 600 MW of capacity installed, the vast majority of which was utility-scale.
South Carolina ranks among the top three sunniest states east of the Mississippi River along with Florida and Georgia. However, it lags cloudier states like New York and Massachusetts in terms of solar deployment. Thus far, just over 2 GW of solar has been installed in the state.
In total, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that $2.6 billion has been invested in solar in South Carolina to date. There are 73 solar companies, including 18 manufacturers in the state. SEIA projects an additional 1.4 GW will be installed over the next five years, which would mark a deceleration in deployment compared to the previous five. This projection may not include the increased buildout that is expected following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a record $370 billion in climate and energy spending.
Incentives
Perhaps the most significant incentive in the state is the personal tax credit, which covers 25% of system equipment costs. The incentive credits a maximum of $3,500, or 50% of taxpayer’s tax liability for that taxable year, whichever is less. If the amount of the credit exceeds $3,500 for each facility, the taxpayer may carry forward the excess for up to ten years.
The South Carolina state government maintains a database of active incentives and net metering structures for the various utilities across the state. Incentives and rates vary widely, so those interested in residential and commercial solar can find more information about opportunities with their utility provider here. For example, Santee Cooper customers are eligible for a rebate of $1.05/W of solar energy that they install on their roofs, up to $6,300.
The state also offers net metering, which involves crediting a customer on their bill for excess solar production they send to the grid. Net metering rates vary widely by utility and customer rate type, so it is important to understand how much value the solar system will receive for its production. Here is an example of utility SCE&G’s rate structure:
Using the Solar Calculator from SolarReviews is another method for getting a customized estimate of your solar savings potential based on zip code, utility provider, and average utility bill.
Residents and business owners in South Carolina will also be eligible for any qualifying federal incentives, including the Investment Tax Credit (ITC). The ITC was recently extended at 30% of the eligible equipment costs of a solar array for the next ten years. Unlike the state tax credit, you may be eligible for a direct payment of the incentive, rather than rolling over year-to-year based on your tax appetite.
A solar victory
A landmark case for the solar industry was spearheaded by SEIA in 2019, when the state passed the Energy Freedom Act. The act led to numerous solar victories and opened the gate for the record year of deployment in 2020. Provisions included:
“After a unanimous vote in the South Carolina House, we are glad to see that the Senate also approved this critical legislation, which will lower electricity bills and create jobs across The Palmetto State. That the bill passed with strong bipartisan support is a testament to the hard work of our many partners and allies in the state, and clean energy champions in the Legislature,” said SEIA president Abigail Ross Hopper.
Landmark project
Earlier this year, Pine Gate Renewables announced the financing of Beulah Solar, its 20th project in the state, which will bring 101 MW of capacity to Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina. Located in Saluda and Lexington Counties, Beulah Solar is expected to provide enough electricity to power approximately 23,000 homes in the area each year, through a 10-year power purchase agreement with Dominion Energy South Carolina.
Pine Gate said the project will provide $166,000 in tax revenue each year for the counties over the lifespan of the project’s anticipated 40 years of operation ($6.6 million total).
Pine Gate currently has 19 operational projects in South Carolina, with 16 more under construction or in development. Blue Ridge Power is facilitating the engineering, procurement and construction of Beulah Solar, which is expected to become operational in the spring. John Hancock provided the preferred equity, Churchill Stateside Group provided the tax equity and Live Oak Bank provided the permanent loan for Beulah Solar.
