Breaking from previous studies, the researchers have classified the volume of space housing the batteries as an opportunity cost, rather than a fixed technical constraint. After modeling a wide variety of containership sizes, as well as 13 major world trade routes, the research suggests that more than 40% of the world’s fleet of containerships could be electrified “cost-effectively and with current technology,” by the end of this decade.
TCP (total cost of propulsion) by ship type, route length, current (a) and future (b) battery pricing:

In graph ‘a’, (above left), the authors show the current viability of containership electrification, based on ship size and length of voyage. The gray and white areas of the graphs represent the shipping routes where the electrification of containerships would immediately lower shipping costs.
Using only technology available for purchase today, nearly all ships with routes shorter than 2,000 kilometers are economically advantageous, and ships with routes as long as 3,000km are economically viable.
Graph ‘b’, (above right), projects that price reductions to “near future“ battery technology are expected to roughly double the economic viability and range of electrified containerships.
Crucially, this research demonstrates that electrified containerships have an economic advantage over the internal combustion engine (ICE), even when the costs of environmental and health damages are excluded.
The differences in TCP are contrasted in graph ‘a’ (ICE) vs graph ‘b’ (electrified):

The authors present estimates of air pollution damages and the social cost of carbon for both ICE, (above left), versus electrified containerships, (above right). The gray bars in the chart above show that ICE containerships cause damages equal to or greater than three times the ship’s costs.
An electrified containership will also cause some environmental damage, however, the estimates of electrified ship’s air pollution, and the social cost of carbon, are only 1/12th that of an ICE ship.
In a future in which the costs of large ICE containerships will continue rising, as electrified containerships become increasingly cost effective, the authors posit that ICE ships (below, left) will be grossly more expensive than electrified containerships (below, right).

The authors show that at current battery prices, the electrification of trade routes less than 1,500 km is economical, and has minimal impact to ship carrying capacity. And when the authors include environmental costs, the economical range skyrockets to 5,000 km.
A 5,000 km containership would require approximately 6.5 GWh of LFP batteries.
The average cost of lithium-ion batteries has plummeted 89% since 2010, and is expected to reach $50 per kWh in the near future. Assuming a battery cost of $100 per kWh, the TCP for a battery-electric containership is already lower than that of an ICE equivalent, for routes less than 1,000km. And when battery prices reach $50 per kWh, which is predicted for the near future, electrified ships will be cost-effective on routes as long as 5,000km.
The key technical constraint for battery-electric container shipping is the volume of the battery system and electric motor relative to the volume occupied by a vessel’s existing engines, fuel storage and mechanical space. The extra weight of the BES system is, however, non-trivial in determining a vessel’s power requirements.
Battery chemistry is another key factor in configuring electric cargo ships. Vessels that take short, frequent trips have lower power requirements, but would need to recharge quickly. These vessels should benefit from the high charge rates and long life cycles of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Long range ships already spend more time docked in each port – typically well over 24h – and could take advantage of the relatively low cycle life and high energy density of nickel manganese cobalt oxide batteries.
The Yara Birkeland is an 80m long, 7MWh electrified autonomous containership that can hold 120 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), which makes 12 nautical mile trips.

For ‘Neo-Panamax’ containerships, (sized to fit through the Panama canal), routes less than 3,000km actually require LESS space for batteries and motors than the volume currently occupied by combustion engines and fuel tanks.
If this class of ship were to travel 20,000km on a single charge, the batteries and motor would require 32% of the ship’s carrying capacity, or 2,500 TEU.
We find that as carrying capacity increases, the percentage of total carrying capacity volume occupied by batteries decreases because larger ships typically have lower energy requirements per unit of carrying capacity.
The charging infrastructure for a containership traveling less than 10,000km can be accomplished using less than 300 MW. Containerships holding 1,000-3,000 TEUs typically spend an average of 31 hours waiting in line and berthing. The largest ships, holding 10,000-20,000 TEUs, spend an average of 97 hours waiting and berthing. 
The infrastructure required to support such massive charging capacities is surprisingly affordable, largely due to the efficient logistics of ports, since berths are typically occupied more than 50% of the time. At 50% utilization, the researchers modeled that the levelized cost of a 300MW charging station comes to mere $0.03 per kWh.
None of this technical viability would exist if it were not for recent and ongoing improvements to batteries, inverters and electric motors. For instance, in their models, the researchers assumed ICE “tank-to-wake efficiency” of 50%, and electric motor and inverter efficiencies of 95% each. Electrified containerships are 80% more efficient than their ICE counterparts, and use 30% less energy overall.
For inquiring minds: one gallon of heavy fuel oil (HFO) contains approximately 150,000btu, equivalent to roughly 44kWh. But since even the most efficient internal combustion ship engines are no more than 50% efficient, a gallon of HFO produces no more than 22kWh of actual propulsion. Most modern electric motors are now over 90% efficient, and the most advanced prototypes are approaching 99% efficiency.

Mississippi Silicon is a silicon metal facility that was launched in 2015, which the company says is the first in North America in forty years. The facility produces silicon metal, a semi-conductive metalloid element that serves as a crucial component in thousands of products, from electronics to steel to solar to automotive.
“Mississippi Silicon was founded nearly ten years ago to be a domestic source of high-quality silicon metal to the US solar, electronics and chemical industries,” said Eddie Boardwine, CEO of Mississippi Silicon. “We are pleased by the growing recognition of the importance of a strong end-to-end US supply chain for these materials. Passage of the SEMA Act makes bringing that supply chain to reality. We look forward to working with REC Silicon to strengthen our existing relationship and build out that vital supply chain.”
Recent investment by the Hanwha Group into REC Silicon, in conjunction with Hanwha’s subsidiary Qcells, positions REC to expand its relationship with Mississippi Silicon, which supports the development of an end-to-end U.S. solar supply chain from raw silicon, to polysilicon, and finally fully assembled modules.
In June, REC Silicon and Ferroglobe signed an MOU with the plan to develop an end-to-end US solar supply chain from raw silicon, to polysilicon, and finally fully assembled modules. Ferroglobe is a producer of silicon metal and its alloys and it supplies critical materials for many industrial and consumer products, from silicones to solar power cells, from steel to aluminum to foundry components.
The recent Hanwha investment will enable a re-start of the currently idle Moses Lake plant in 2023 and make available high volumes of cost competitive, high quality, and low carbon solar grade polysilicon. REC Silicon has an annual production capacity of more than 20,000 MT of polysilicon from its two U.S.-based manufacturing plants in Moses Lake, Washington and Butte, Montana.
“As previously announced, REC is working hard to drive large-scale investments to develop a robust solar supply chain in the US. In line with REC’s endeavors, we applaud the efforts and determination that were needed to realize the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act,” said James A. May II, CEO of REC Silicon. We are hopeful that with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act which includes SEMA, the entire solar supply chain in the US will be fully established and placed in a position to flourish.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/22/renewables-expected-to-generate-22-of-us-electricity-this-year/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 22, 2022",Renewables expected to generate 22% of US electricity this year,"Renewable energy will climb another rung of the ladder in the energy transition in 2022, reaching 22% of all generation this year, said the Energy Information Administration (EIA). EIA categorizes renewable energy as solar, wind, and hydropower, as well as other renewables like biomass and geothermal.
The category reached 20% in both 2020 and 2021. EIA said it expects renewable energy to account for 24% of all generation next year. The organization regularly posts forecasts for five renewable energy sources: conventional hydropower, wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal based on its monthly historical data releases.
EIA tracks 11 distinct regions in its renewable energy generation report. In 2021, the top two regions for renewable energy were California, where renewables accounted for 44% of electricity generation and the Northwest, where renewables accounted for roughly 50% of the region’s electricity generation. EIA said droughts hampered the hydroelectric contribution to these numbers, but they still increased their renewable share in the generation mix through buildout of solar and wind.
The most significant growth in renewables generation share this past decade was in the Southwest Power Pool, where renewable energy has grown from 13% of the mix in 2013 to 44% in 2022. This was largely due to wind generation additions, said EIA. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas also increased its renewables share from 10% to 32% over the same time period.
Three East Coast regions had the lowest share of renewable energy generation in their mix, namely PJM Interconnection in the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast, and the Florida Reliability Coordinating council. EIA expects these regions to remain below the national average for renewables through next year. Natural gas and nuclear are the most significant power generators in the Southeast and Florida regions, and in PJM, the most prevalent power providers are natural gas and coal.
A distinction should be made between “renewable” and “sustainable” energy. Johns Hopkins University describes renewable energy as something that comes from sources that naturally renew themselves to meet our energy needs. This can include such technologies as biomass, hydropower, etc. “Sustainable” energy is defined as energy that can support both the current generation as well as future generations. John Hopkins considers solar and wind as the primary sources of sustainable energy.
Following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, sustainable energy sources are set to be significantly boosted by long-term industrial policy. In a collaboration with research institutions called the REPEAT project, Princeton University said solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said the analysts. This will lead to the presence of renewable energy in the total U.S. generation mix being much more robust a decade from now.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/22/oahus-first-utility-scale-solar-plus-storage-power-plant-complete/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,HAWAII",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 22, 2022",O‘ahu’s first utility-scale solar-plus-storage power plant complete,"Clearway Energy Group completed construction and reached commercial operations at its Mililani Solar I plant. This is Clearway’s fourth solar plant on O’ahu and the island’s first utility-scale solar and battery storage power plant. The solar power plant advances the state’s goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045. Hawaii is currently ranked 16th for solar installations by capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, with 17.68% of its electricity needs being generated by solar.
“Hawai’i has long led the nation in the transition to reliable carbon-free power. Today’s celebration of O‘ahu’s first major solar and energy storage plant is evidence that that ambition is well within reach,” said Craig Cornelius, CEO of Clearway. “We’re proud to help Hawai’i achieve its clean energy goals and we are grateful to Hawaiian Electric, whose partnership has been critical in reaching this important milestone.”
The 39 MW Mililani Solar power plant is paired with a 156 MWh battery storage system and includes over 123,000 photovoltaic panels, each measuring 6.5-feet tall and slightly more than three feet wide. The tracker-based solar power plant, located on 131 acres in Mililani Agricultural Park, will enhance grid reliability and provide grid services at a critical time with the decommissioning of the state’s last coal plant in September.
 
“Renewable energy is critical to Hawai‘i to be more affordable and resilient,” said Governor David Ige. “We are a step closer to that goal today because of the Clearway team, which understood the urgency and stepped up to deliver their project ahead of schedule.”
 
“Projects like this one help our customers by providing electricity to the grid at one-third the cost of oil and help Hawaiʻi by moving us on the path to a decarbonized energy system,” said Shelee Kimura, president and CEO of Hawaiian Electric. “Working with experienced energy developers like Clearway, we will be bringing eight additional projects online over the next two years on Oʻahu, providing even greater benefits to our communities.”
Clearway has developed and operated renewable power plants in Hawai‘i for the past four years. In 2019, the company completed the construction and commissioning of three utility-scale solar facilities: a 45.9 MW site in Waipi‘o, a 14.7 MW in Mililani, and a 49 MW site in Kawailoa on O‘ahu’s North Shore. Construction of Clearway’s second solar and battery storage plant in Waiawa, being built on Kamehameha Schools land, is expected to be complete later this year. The company broke ground on Mililani Solar power plant in April 2021 and installation was completed ahead of schedule.
Mililani Solar and Clearway’s second solar and storage plant under construction in Waiawa are together expected to contribute $9 million in taxes to the City and County of Honolulu. More than 240 local union jobs were created during construction of both plants and a permanent workforce will support ongoing operations and maintenance. Altogether, Clearway’s five solar power plants totaling 185 MW will serve Hawaiian Electric’s grid and generate enough clean electricity to power more than 45,500 O‘ahu homes each year.
“Wärtsilä is proud to be leading the clean energy economy in Hawaii and addressing climate change in partnership with Clearway Energy Group and Hawaiian Electric. Power system optimization technology and flexibility solutions such as energy storage play a key role in balancing the state’s renewable energy power systems and ensuring power reliability for island residents,” said Håkan Agnevall, president and CEO, Wärtsilä.
Project construction was led by Moss and the batteries were supplied by Wärtsilä.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/22/sheep-to-manage-vegetation-at-solar-project-in-colorado/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,COLORADO",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 22, 2022",Sheep to manage vegetation at solar project in Colorado,"Solar developer Guzman Energy achieved regulatory approval from the Delta County Board of Commissioners for a limited use permit to install and operate an 80 MW project on land in Southern Delta County, Colorado. The commissioners unanimously approved the Garnet Mesa Solar project.
Once complete, the project will produce more than 194,000 MWh of electricity annually, equivalent to the energy demand of about 18,000 Colorado homes. Electric utility Delta-Montrose Electric Association (DMEA) will directly purchase a portion of the energy produced by the facility, and Guzman Energy will offtake the rest of the supply to serve other wholesale customers.
The project is expected to create 300-400 construction jobs, generate an estimated property tax value of $13 million over 15 years, and help DMEA achieve about 20% local power generation.
The project now heads to the next phases of engineering and procurement planning, followed by construction resource and timing details announcements.
“With the Commissioners’ approval, we are one step closer to securing a significant amount of local affordable energy. Together with Guzman Energy, we are driving rate stability for our members,” said Kent Blackwell, Interim CEO and Chief Technology Officer, DMEA. “We are confident Garnet Mesa Solar will be a premier example of agriculture and energy co-existing together.”
The site that will house the array is currently irrigated and utilized for grazing, and will continue to be used in that manner, said Guzman Energy. About 1,000 sheep will remain on the site to manage vegetation and graze on native plants.
The Garnet Mesa Solar project is a collaboration between Guzman Energy, DMEA, and Citra Power. Citra’s team brings experience in renewable energy development, technical engineering, EPC management and oversight, portfolio acquisition, and wholesale power procurement. It has worked on thousands of megawatts of now-operational solar, energy storage, and wind projects.
“We are thrilled with the Delta County Board of Commissioners unanimous decision to approve the limited use permit to install and operate the Garnet Mesa Solar project. “We are grateful for the time and attention the community and County officials gave to the process,” said Robin Lunt, Chief Strategy Officer, Guzman Energy.
Colorado has installed 2.2 GW of solar to date as of Q1 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA). About 5% of the state’s electricity comes from solar, and about $4.9 billion has been invested in the technology in the state thus far. Colorado is home to 330 solar companies and about 7,400 employees.
SEIA projects 3.5 GW of solar will be installed over the next five years in Colorado. It is a very sunny state with over 300 days of sunshine a year and a rapidly growing population, making it a prime candidate for increased solar demand.
