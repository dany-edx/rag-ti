Through the first three quarters of 2023, 13.5 GWh of storage was installed, more than the 12 GWh installed in all of 2022.
One of the major U.S. companies operating in this space and riding this growth trajectory is Powin, provider of lithium-ferro-phosphate grid-scale battery services. The company’s sales have exploded from $200 million in 2021 to $2.2 billion in 2022.
pv magazine USA was joined by company president Anthony Carroll to learn what the company has been up to in this high-growth environment.
Powin has deployed over 3,200 MWh of battery systems worldwide, with another 11,900 MWh under construction as of Q4 2023. It typically installs batteries of two- to four hours of duration that provide grid arbitrage services, peak demand shaving, and storage-as-transmission services.
The company has had a busy past two years, including acquiring power electronics company EKS and then selling majority stake to Hitachi Energy, securing a massive project with Akaysha Energy, which is owned by major investment group Blackrock.
In 2023, Carroll said the company moved its focus toward building and delivering on the booked orders it received in 2022. It is ramping up manufacturing and has active sites in China and Mexico and is ramping up operations at a Vietnam plant. The company also set up contract manufacturing operations in the United States in Utah.
Carroll said Powin’s investment in research and development, including expanded efforts at its Portland, Oregon lab, have given it a leg up in its U.S. operations.
“Once of the exciting things that has happened in 2023 is the confirmation on the data analytics and how we are using software to predict battery performance better,” said Carroll. “We doubled down on the investment in the lab, we doubled down on tracking performance at the cell level.”
Carroll said there are three aspects that make their battery service different. First, the company made the investment in advanced sensors to track battery cell temperature, voltage, performance. This helps ensure optimal operations and helps Powin set a performance guarantee for its products. Second, the extra visibility into the cell level offers millions of datapoints that are used to drive Powin’s battery operation software and allows the company to develop predictive analytics for grid operations.
Third, its acquisition of power electronics company EKS gave the company a direct roadmap on how to integrate storage with the grid.
“The EKS acquisition will give us direct access to an industry-leading team, their power conversion technology, advanced controls, and decade’s worth of experience; enabling Powin to offer a fully wrapped solution to further enhance the customer experience,” said Powin strategic advisor and board member Geoff Brown.
Powin has since sold majority stake of EKS to Hitachi Energy, but remains partnered with the company, giving it a leg up in grid integration.
When asked about the Inflation Reduction Act’s impact on Powin’s business, Carroll noted the legislation has driven demand for U.S.-based products and support teams. Today, he is seeing customers willing to ink deals with Powin that are two or three percentage points more expensive than foreign competitors. Powin has a dedicated staff of over 80 U.S.-based people in its project success team and other 60 U.S. employees in its services department, and customers have been willing to pay to have local expertise.
As it relates to supply, grid scale batteries have had to compete with the EV industry for lithium carbonate, the essential material in conventional storage. Grid-scale storage only represents about 3% to 5% of overall demand, placing it at the mercy of EV battery demand when it comes to supply.
However, Carroll said conditions have improved. Shipping and logistics costs have come down from their extreme Covid-era highs. The global supply of lithium carbonate is ramping up considerably, and recent unexpected dips in EV demand have offered buying opportunities. Now, grid-scale storage is increasingly being viewed as an essential service, and Carroll said it has grown enough to carve out its own steady supply.
Lithium-ion batteries continue to be the most bankable solution for grid-scale storage, but Carroll recognized that alternatives could still emerge over time. Sodium, vanadium, and other long-duration energy storage chemistries may emerge. Carroll said Powin is flexible and able to change with emergent technologies. By leveraging its partnerships, focusing on software and analytics, and investing in teams of U.S.-based experts, the company is poised to adapt to an ever-evolving industry.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/26/building-not-your-average-dream-home-the-roof/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,MINNESOTA",,"JANUARY 26, 2024",Building not your average dream home: The roof,"Most of the time when residential PV systems are designed, they are optimized within the limitations of the already-built roof. It is not often that roofs are designed to optimize PV production. But that is the exact opportunity that I get while building not your average dream home.
With years of experience in solar, I assumed that this would be one of the easiest parts of the process – especially for a one-story home with such a high roof surface area to square footage ratio. I thought that all I would need is the right azimuth and tilt. Well, I quickly learned that it’s a bit more complicated.
Luckily, the azimuth was straightforward since the lot is completely open without any obstructions. However, since most houses are designed to align with the road, completely ignoring this rule of thumb feels contrarian. At the same time, using solar orientation and the sun’s ecliptic feels both organic and instinctive to this process. It made me take a step back and wonder how society has distanced itself so much from the natural world that we use something as arbitrary and temporary as a road to orient something as important as our homes. But there was no time for philosophizing when there were important calculations and opportunity costs regarding the roof angle and energy production to consider.
When I was originally dreaming up the house design, I had envisioned a single-pitch roof, with an angle optimized for solar. Since Minnesota has a latitude of about 45°, that is typically the recommended angle for solar panels since that puts them horizontal to the sun during the equinox. But a roof with such a high angle introduces several setbacks. Such a steep roof adds extra volume, increasing build and system installation costs, and therefore the system payback period. Plus, it would create a very inaesthetic and unbalanced building design, with the north exterior wall being double the height of the south wall. In terms of power density, the higher angle creates more surface area, supporting a small C&I system at a 30 kW – much larger than I need.

That’s when we evaluated the clerestory roof, with two differently-angled sloping sides and a vertical, dividing wall. This roof type adds in some additional lighting and ventilation options, while also overcoming many of the challenges of the shed design. Unfortunately, it also creates some weight-bearing structural complications at such a high angle that make the build cost inefficient.

After that, we tried a saltbox roof, which is a pitched roof with unequal sides, one short and high and the other long and low. The thought around this design is that it creates a large surface for a power dense roof.
According to SolarEdge’s Designer tool, if the long, south-facing side were at 34°, I could fit a whopping 55 solar panels for a 22 kWp system to achieve 33 MWh of annual energy production. But this angle is significantly lower than the standard recommendation of 45°, meaning that the energy density would be compromised.
According to Chris Bunch, VP of design and engineering at Powur, the 45° recommendations is “only part of the equation. I think the more important thing is when is electricity going to be used. Is it mostly in the summer? Is mostly in the winter? What sort of energy is driving the heating in the winter and the cooling in the summer? And the anticipated electrical demand throughout the year is important.”

Unfortunately, without an electric bill to show energy usage patterns, this type of information is hard to know in a new build. And it can be even more difficult to estimate for a passive house that is specifically being designed to reduce energy demand. However, in general, houses in Minnesota have a higher energy load in the winter due to the extremely cold weather. And as I’m planning for the house to be all electric, with no gas connection, this will likely hold true. As we were contemplating options, other suggestions arose such as a flat roof or even a ground mount PV system.
But then lightning struck when I suggested turning the saltbox roof 180°, so that the short and high side of the roof would face the south. While that leads to less surface area at a higher angle of 40°, making it less power dense, it becomes more energy dense and better optimized for the higher energy demand in the winter.
With this new roof design, I can fit on a 12 kWp PV system with an annual yield of 18.6 MWh. While this would be 55% the size of the 22 kWp systems mentioned above, its yield would be 56% of the 34° roof and 59% of the 18° roof. And an added benefit of a steeper roof angle according to Bunch is that it can help with snow shedding.

With Minnesota being a standard net-metering incentive structure, this process was more straightforward than it would have been if I were building in a state with a more complex rate structure, such as time of use. As Carina Brockl, CRO of Aurora Solar noted, “Generally south-facing PV systems with less shade are going to do well, but certain net metering programs like the Net Billing Tariff in California actually favor a southwest orientation.”
The other benefit to designing the roof for optimal solar production per Bunch is the ability to plan for all the ventilation and plumbing to be on the north-facing side to both maximize system size and prevent any energy losses from shading.
Now that I have a roof to put over my head, I still need to decide on the components and appliances for energy production, consumption and potentially storage. I’ll be diving into the product choices and the different types of appliances, plus energy efficiency considerations further into the process.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/26/south-dakota-solar-up-3600-in-2023-doubling-again-in-2024/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SOUTH DAKOTA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 26, 2024","South Dakota solar up 3600% in 2023, doubling again in 2024","In 2023, solar electricity generation in South Dakota was set to increase by approximately 3,600% compared to 2022, as highlighted in pv magazine USA’s 50 States of Solar output report. This growth stems from the addition of a single utility-scale solar power plant – the Fall River Solar facility, located in Fall River, South Dakota.
The 80 MWac Fall River facility came online in September 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA). Before this addition, the sum total of South Dakota’s solar power capacity consisted of a solitary 1 MWac solar power plant, and roughly 5 MW of distributed small-scale solar.

In October, approximately 14 GWh of South Dakota’s electricity originated from solar sources, with an overwhelming 96.5% coming from the Fall River solar facility. The plant generated nearly 1.3% of the state’s electricity in September and around 1% in October. Throughout the year, the facility is estimated to produce 189 GWh of electricity under a 20-year power purchase agreement with Black Hills Energy.
The vast majority of South Dakota’s electricity currently originates from wind power, contributing 40% of the state’s electricity in June and peaking around 70% during autumn and winter months, averaging 57.5% annually in 2022. Overall, the state’s electricity generation is remarkably clean, with its CO2-free generation varying between 93% and 60% on a monthly basis. Wind and hydroelectric sources make up 84% of the state’s generation, while coal and gas contribute about 15.7%.

For at least one more year, solar power is expected to expand significantly. According to the EIA, the Wild Springs Solar facility is expected to come online in April 2024, and at 128 MWac, it will more than double the state’s solar capacity over the previous year. Local reporting from Black Hills Fox indicates that the facility has already broken ground. Owned by National Grid Renewables, this new plant will increase the state’s total utility scale capacity from 81 MW to 209 MW.
This growth is statistically significant. Historically, South Dakota derives less than 16% of its electricity from coal and gas. The introduction of solar facilities contributing more than 2% to the state’s electricity mix has the potential to substantially reduce the state’s remaining fossil fuel reliance and cut related emissions. However, the specifics of integrating this new solar capacity into the broader generation mix remain complex and are beyond the scope of this publication’s current analysis.

The prospects for distributed solar in South Dakota, however, appear limited. This is largely due to electricity prices being at or below the national average and political choices, notably reflected in the state’s decision to not participate in the Solar for All initiative under the Inflation Reduction Act. South Dakota was joined by Florida, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and Nevada in opting out of the funding from this federal initiative.
In terms of fiscal impact, utility-scale solar power in South Dakota is subject to a $3/kilowatt annual nameplate capacity tax and a $0.0009/kWh generation tax. National Grid Renewables anticipates that their solar project will generate approximately $330,000 in tax revenue annually, accounting for 1/12th of the county’s tax receipts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/26/nebraska-introduces-legislation-to-prevent-hoa-from-barring-solar-installation/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEBRASKA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 26, 2024",Nebraska introduces legislation to prevent HOA from barring solar installation,"The Nebraska Judiciary Committee heard testimony for a proposal that would prohibit homeowners associations (HOA) from restricting the installation of solar panels on homeowner property. 
The bill, LB1119, was introduced by Lincoln Senator George Dungan. If passed, HOA would not be permitted to restrict installations in any covenant, bylaw, deed contract, or other agreement. Any regulations prohibiting solar installations would be deemed void and homeowners would have a civil cause of action if a violation occurred. 
Merlyn Bartels of Lincoln, Nebraska testified in opposition to the bill. He expressed concerns that solar panels on a home ecould increase insurance costs for people who obtain insurance through their HOA. 
The Sierra Club testified in support of the bill. It said solar energy has become more popular, affordable and durable in recent years, and tax credits have made installation lucrative for homeowners. Sierra Club said there is no evidence that homes with solar panels lower the value of neighboring properties.   
“Solar panels on a roof are not an eyesore but an adaptation to a new technology, which is helping our planet reduce the use of fossil fuels and should be encouraged rather than opposed by local and state governments,” said Al Davis, Sierra Club, Nebraska chapter, in a testimony for the bill. 
The bill’s author, George Dungan, said homeowners should, within reason, be able to do what they wish with their property.

The site addresses questions surrounding the costs of electric vehicles, especially compared to those running on gas. It also breaks down the potential fuel savings for customers.
The Electric Vehicle Affordability Resource Page explores the affordability of EVs. The organization states that EVs are expected to reach price parity with gas-powered cars in the next two years. It also lists several EV models that cost the same or less than traditional cars; they include the Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Kona Electric and Mazda MX-30. 
According to ZETA, EV owners can save between $6,000 and $12,000 on gas and maintenance. The site also includes details on how potential owners can save on electric bills, as several electricity providers offer lower electricity rates to users who have installed at-home Level 2 charging stations, among other incentives. 
The resource page explores how EV owners can benefit from Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, particularly those geared at reducing the price of new and second-hand EVs and at-home charging equipment. It also delves into the incentives various states and local governments offer to help accelerate the U.S. transition to a carbon-neutral economy. 
Regarding batteries, ZETA explores common misconceptions, particularly the assumption that EV batteries need replacement, like those used in gas-powered cars. The coalition states that an analysis by Recurrent, a group of software engineers and battery scientists working to advance EV adoption, found only 1.5% of EVs analyzed needed a replacement battery. This pool excluded manufacturer recalls related to a battery replacement. 
ZETA has also added a MythBusters resource webpage to its platform, which builds on addressing battery misconceptions by debunking common myths associated with EVs altogether. Examples include the idea that EVs don’t provide enough driving range for U.S. families. The platform asserts that many models have a driving range lasting over 200 miles per charge, with about 18 EV models having a driving range over 300 miles.
Regarding EVs being a fire hazard, ZETA draws from figures by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that state injury claims for EV drivers and passengers were over 40% lower than those from identical gas-powered vehicles between 2011 and 2019. The platform also states that all EVs meet the same Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards applicable to gas-powered cars. 
The launch of ZETA’s Electric Vehicle Affordability Resource Page is part of the organization’s effort to stop the spread of misinformation about EVs. Otherwise known as the ZETA Education Fund, the non-profit is an affiliate of ZETA that draws from white papers and policy briefs on the EV market and supply chain to educate the public on the environmental and social benefits and opportunities of country-wide EV adoption. Other resource pages ZETA has launched include Optimizing EVs in Cold Weather, the Electric Vehicle Safety Resource Page and the Electric Vehicle Charging Resource Page. 
ZETA was founded in 2020. It functions as a coalition that advocates for the full adoption of electric vehicles by leveraging experts and research to provide the public with more insight into the industry. The organization also advises policymakers on developing laws that protect federal resources allocated to scale vehicle electrification. ZETA’s members include Li-Cycle, Tesla, Uber, and Excel Energy. The coalition tackles topics like consumer incentives, domestic manufacturing, emissions and performance standards, infrastructure investments, and federal support for local leaders.

Nexwafe, a German epitaxial wafer manufacturer that is currently building a 250 MW factory in Bitterfeld, Germany, has announced that it has established a U.S. subsidiary.
The company said in a statement that it is evaluating the development of multi-gigawatt-scale solar wafer manufacturing in the U.S. market, with an initial target production volume of 6 GW.
The company said it is evaluating manufacturing locations, considering regional incentives, and actively working on strategic partnerships and wafer offtake agreements in the United States.
To lead the U.S. operation, the company has named Jonathan Pickering as VP of business development, North America. He was previously an executive at JA Solar Americas and Applied Materials.
“Multiple top-tier solar companies have committed to advanced PV cell and module manufacturing at a multi-gigawatt scale across the U.S. But now we see a significant bottleneck in the supply chain for a domestic source of silicon wafers,” said Pickering, adding that the company will be able to offer U.S.-made, thin silicon wafers.
Nexwafe is commercializing kerfless wafers. Its monocrystalline silicon wafers are grown directly in a gas-to-wafer manufacturing process that it claims is not only more efficient but also enables the production of ultra-thin wafers. Its wafers are compatible with conventional cell processing, and reportedly minimize wastage, offering a 60% reduction in the carbon footprint compared to conventional processes.
Nexwafe, which is based in Freiburg, Germany, announced a €30 million financing round in May 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/26/april-total-eclipse-to-impact-solar-generation-from-mexico-to-new-england/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA,NEW YORK,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 26, 2024",April total eclipse to impact solar generation from Mexico to New England,"As solar capacity increases, the grid impact of subsequent major solar events also increases. On April 8, a total eclipse will pass from Mexico, across Texas and up the East Coast, with most of the continental U.S. experiencing a significant drop in solar generation. The eclipse will occur from Noon to the early afternoon, when solar generation is at its highest. It is too early to predict weather conditions for the day, in particular high-resolution cloud modeling, so this analysis is based on clearsky data via the Solcast API.

Areas in the totality, where the moon completely blocks the sun, will see a 100% loss in solar generation for the duration of the totality. However, the overall effects of the eclipse will cost up to 16% of daily total clear sky irradiance in areas most affected.

While it is too early to predict the precise cloud impacts on the day, Grid Operators will already be preparing for the maximum potential impact, a temporary total loss of solar generation and a fast ramp of solar decreasing then increasing. For areas directly in the path of the eclipse, the maximum duration will be over 90 minutes of impacted generation, and a total loss of up to 6 minutes. In every grid analyzed, the rate at which solar generation drops off and then picks back up again, is faster than grids normally see in the morning and evening.

Due to the large proportion of utility scale assets in ERCOT, Texas will be heavily impacted by the effects of the eclipse. Individual assets will lose up to 16% of their daily irradiance, but the wide area covered by ERCOT means that the overall loss to the grid will be up to 11.7% of daily utility scale solar generation. At current capacity, that would be 16.9 GWh, though the rapid increase in capacity in ERCOT, and known projects coming online before April makes it likely this number could be higher. Solcast’s grid aggregation model shows that the ramp will be slightly steeper than normally seen in the morning or evening, peaking at a rate of 250 MW/minute. The fast change in generation is what can cause instability in the grid, so asset managers, energy traders and grid operators will be working to maintain stability whilst making the most of volatile energy prices.


As the eclipse moves up the East Coast, it will impact both NYISO and ISO-NE. These regions have less utility scale solar than Texas, so the impact will mostly be seen in ‘behind-the-meter’ residential rooftop solar generation. For each grid, the impacts are fairly similar. NYISO will lose up to 10.91% of their daily rooftop generation, and up to 3.1 GWh of power. Being further south, and hit by the eclipse slightly earlier explains the difference with ISO-NE. New England will lose up to 9.85% of its daily behind-the-meter generation, though differences in installed capacity make this a higher 3.7 GWh. Notably the ramp rate is much higher than the morning or afternoon ramps, as irradiance will drop from almost the daily maximum to zero in approximately 40 minutes. This will require active management from the grid operators to maintain stability.

CAISO in California will also see impacts from this eclipse, though being so far from the path of totality, the effects will be less than seen in the partial annular eclipse in September 2023. Despite seeing a lower proportional effect from grids in the North-East, only 5.72% of daily generation, increased levels of rooftop solar in California mean that the energy losses will be greater than either NYISO or ISO-NE, up to 4.0 GWh.
While the impact of this eclipse is significant, it is predictable, and grid operators are already preparing and planning for the impacts. Large storm events, snow dump events and large heavy cloud fronts are less spectacular but can have even bigger impacts on whole-day solar generation. These events are also harder to plan for and predict, which makes it more important for asset owners and grid operators to plan and manage the impact of weather on solar generation as solar increases in the generation mix.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This information is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets throughout the world.
This article was amended to correct the figure in this statement: “the wide area covered by ERCOT means that the overall loss to the grid will be up to 11.7% of daily utility scale solar generation”.
