SolarEdge unveiled a bidirectional DC-coupled electric vehicle (EV) charger at Intersolar Europe last week in Munich, Germany.
The Israel-based inverter manufacturer’s DC-coupled architecture allows for simultaneous EV charging directly from solar, home battery storage, and the grid. The charger is connected to single- or three-phase inverters through a DC bus circuit which can be oversized by up to 200%, enabling charging the EV with excess PV. The charger has a charge/discharge rate of 12/24 kW and a peak efficiency of DC to DC of 99%.
The new charger will enable solar-powered vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. It will become commercially available in the second half of 2024.
V2G applications allow automatic charging and discharging of the EV battery based on dynamic utility prices. This enables homeowners to receive payments from their electricity supplier by discharging stored EV battery power back to the grid during demand response events.
Additionally, users can use the EV battery to back up their homes during outages, demonstrating a V2H application. The battery has a capacity of up to 50 kWh.
“The charger will be compatible with both 400V and 800V EV powertrains via a standard CSS connector,” Solar Edge said in a statement.
The device measures 24.4 by 13.4 by 7.87 inches, weighs 48.8 pounds, and features a 23-foot cable. It can operate in temperatures ranging from -22 F to 122 F and features an IP-65 rated enclosure for indoor and outdoor use.

It is scheduled for release in the second half of 2024.
Solar-plus-storage microgrids minimize power shutoffs during wildfires  A study conducted by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory shows that microgrids with solar-plus-storage systems can keep the average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and annual public safety power shutoffs below 30 cents per kWh and 2 to 3% of annual energy demand, respectively.
Virtual power plants roll out across the U.S.  Virtual power plants (VPPs) coordinate distributed resources and demand for a more resilient, cost-effective energy transition. And they are gaining traction in the United States.
With 18 GW solar, Southeast U.S. nears U.S. average solar generation  Florida and utility Florida Power & Light lead the way for solar, while other states and utilities bypass low-cost solar and storage, favoring gas peaker units and small modular reactors and risking higher customer bills, said experts from the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.
Solar permitting reform at a turning point  Sluggish permitting continues to dog the solar market, despite the $369 billion boost from the Inflation Reduction Act. However, calls for reform could be gaining traction.
Rapid growth in U.S. solar market requires new approaches to project delivery  The workforce and supply chain challenges faced by growing solar industry can be overcome through new partnerships and contracting approaches between EPCs and developers, according to a McKinsey report.
