The practice has been shown to cause mutual co-benefits for both the crops and animals and the output of the solar array.
The latest of such projects comes from Lightstar Renewables, which is developing the Old Meyers solar project in Poughkeepsie, New York. The project commenced construction this fall and is expected to reach commercial operations by Summer 2024.
The project, located in Wappingers Falls area, includes a 2 MW community solar array that facilitates the land’s proprietors, the Thompson’s family, to continue agricultural activities. The project will offer the Thompson family a stable source of land lease income for 25 years. Lightstar has been engaged with the farm owners since early 2022 to help rezone the property at no cost to the farmers.
Lightstar’s community solar project will generate clean, local energy that home and business accounts can subscribe to a pay for portion of the electricity generated. This generation is then used as a credit to offset utility bills.
“What many don’t realize is that solar and agriculture are perfect partners — their synergies are crucial to the security and resiliency of our community for green power as well as localized food sources,” said Paul Wheeler, chief executive officer and founder of Lightstar.
The AgriPV project will mount the panels with enough height to adequately allow for farming activities beneath. Once completed, the array will provide protection to crops from extreme weather events like storms, early and late frosts, and heat waves.
Underneath the array, a variety of strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, lavender and other produce will be grown. Lightstar said it will work with local institutions to study the growing process and document the financial and agricultural case studies for wide dissemination.
“This project is a fantastic opportunity for our family farm to increase our capacity to produce a variety of healthy locally grown crops and at the same time demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the dual-use solar concept,” said Sean Thompson, landowner and farmer.
“An added bonus is that this project will increase the vitality of our farm! The crops we produce under the array will be sold directly to consumers as well as through local channels and will fill a food niche that is otherwise only satisfied by producers outside of our region,” said Thompson.

The United States deployed 1,680 MW / 5,597 MWh of energy storage nationwide, leading to an average duration of 3.3 hours.
Despite the record quarter, Q2 installations were meaningfully lower than expected based on project pipelines. Wood Mackenzie said that well over 2 GW of projects have been pushed to later years.
Much like the residential solar sector, the residential energy storage sector has been hammered this year by steep interest rates and meaningfully negative policy changes like the onset of California Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0. In Q2, residential storage declined to 138 MW / 381 MWh. The biggest decline was in California, which has peeled back 17% quarter-over-quarter and 37% year-over-year, despite promises from regulators and utilities that NEM 3.0 would be a net-positive for a solar plus batteries market.
Despite these challenges, Wood Mackenzie sees growth ahead for the residential storage segment. The report said the sector is forecast to install 3.5 times more solar in 2027 than it did in 2023. It expects 8.0 GW for the sector over a five-year horizon.
Looking ahead, Wood Mackenzie sees grid-scale storage comprising most of the capacity added through 2027, though residential storage is expected to rebound and maintain strength despite recent challenges. Between 2023 and 2027 the report projects 66 GW of energy storage added, 83% of which will be grid-scale capacity.
The firm’s five year outlook for all sectors was lowered on average about 12%, with most of the decreases occurring in 2023 and 2024. Regulatory challenges hampered residential storage in the near-term, while supply challenges trimmed near-term forecasts across all sectors. Grid scale storage remains held back by grid operator interconnection queue delays. Inefficient grid operator interconnection processes remain one of the most significant challenges to the United States’ move towards carbon emissions-free electricity generation and storage.
As for pricing, Wood Mackenzie said lithium-ion battery storage systems may have reached a peak in late 2022. Batteries have come down in price more rapidly than commodity prices since then, though price decreases may start to slow in Q3 and Q4 of 2023, said the report.
Labor and balance of plant costs are still increasing due to various factors, and transformer and inverter costs continue to trend upward due to high demand, said the report. Price pressures are affecting original equipment manufacturers and to a lesser extent integrators, and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firms have the most power to pass on costs and be selective with their client choices.
One of the report’s lead authors, Vanessa Witte, senior analyst, energy storage with Wood Mackenzie will be a featured panelist on the grid-scale energy storage session at the upcoming pv magazine Roundtables US 2023 free online event.

A research group led by the University of Liège in Belgium has looked at the potential of vertical agrivoltaics to improve water usage and reduce PV curtailment in regions with severe drought. The scientists focused their analysis on Chile’s Maule region, which has a strong agricultural profile and is affected by chronic periods of drought.
“I think vertical PV would be feasible and interesting in many other regions of Chile considering the troubles they have with scarcity of water and the type of crop they have,” the research’s corresponding author, Roxane Bruhweyler, told pv magazine. “We decided to focus on the central region because of the additional problem of the water conflict between farmers and hydropower centrals and the importance of irrigated agricultural lands in that region. This particularly makes sense when you are evaluating the geometry of an agrivoltaic system that you suspect to be able to reduce the evapotranspiration of the crop.”
They quantified the anticipated reduction in water usage when converting irrigated agricultural land to vertical agrivoltaics and assessed the expected power generation of a 100 kW north-tilted PV array in Chanco, located in the Maule region’s Cauquenes province. The PV system reduces the cultivated area of the agricultural surface by 15%, and a 14 m gap between the rows of bifacial solar modules enables the use of agricultural machinery.
“Shading of the crop on the solar panels is negligible for most cereals and forage crops and there is no effect at all for a crop height below 105 cm,” the scientists explained.
They conducted a series of simulations on the system considering the global horizontal irradiance, ambient temperature, and wind speed as input data. They also used hourly weather data for 2021 and the PVLIB-Python modeling tool produced by Sandia National Laboratory, which calculates solar irradiance on the plane of a PV panel (POAI), measured as kWh/m2/day, to analyze the array’s power production.
Through these measurements, the academics were able to verify that the vertical PV system could reduce water demand for the irrigated main crops. They also found that the PV installation produces 10% less energy than conventional PV systems.
“However, the agrivoltaic facility offers a two-peak generation profile that allows the spreading of the production of photovoltaic energy over the day, reducing the risk of curtailments,” they stated. The microclimate heterogeneity analysis of this vertical agrivoltaics suggests that plants will need slightly different amounts of water depending on their position between the rows of panels.”
The researchers presented their modeling in “Vertical agrivoltaics and its potential for electricity production and agricultural water demand: A case study in the area of Chanco, Chile,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments.
“Future work will aim to further validate the computational models tested in this study through field monitoring of vertical AV sites in collaboration with other partners, with a specific focus on the effects of these installations on microclimate and water balance, energy yield prediction uncertainties, and crop growth,” they said, in reference to their future plans.
The research group includes scientists from Hochschule Anhalt University of Applied Sciences in Germany, French technology company Naldeo Technologies Industries, and Universidad de Santo Tomás in Chile.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/26/fluke-gains-solmetrics-high-wattage-solar-panel-i-v-curve-tracer-tool/,"PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2023",Fluke gains Solmetric’s high-wattage solar panel I-V curve tracer tool,"Fluke recently acquired Solmetric, a company that combines cutting-edge equipment with industry expertise. pv magazine USA met with Fluke’s Will White at RE+ to explore the company’s new high wattage, current-specific solar module I-V curve tracing hardware.
At the booth, Fluke proudly displayed the PVA-1500HE, formerly Solmetric’s flagship product. The presentation emphasized the 3 primary components of the unit: the I-V unit, the SolSensor, and a user interface that operates on a tablet or laptop. The I-V unit and SolSensor function in tandem, assessing the I-V curve, irradiance, and temperature.

The team at Fluke highlighted a key challenge in testing high-wattage, high-efficiency, and thus high-current solar modules: managing and bleeding off the rush of current that occurs at the onset of a measure, which is driven by the high capacitance of modern solar cells. The acquired Solmetric team, with their refined solution, has solved this challenge. The unit can provide an I-V curve read in milliseconds, a significant improvement over the seconds required for prior test techniques.
The unit is 45 kW, which is double Fluke’s existing 1000V I-V curve testing unit.

 
In addition to the PVA-1500HE, Fluke also now possesses the renowned SunEye, a valuable tool for measuring shade to accurately estimate electricity generation by the modules beyond idealized projections.
In the booth, hardware was only part of the story. Fluke, a recognized name in the testing industry, expressed their enthusiasm about collaboration with the adept team behind this equipment. Solmeric’s specialized knowledge in high-powered equipment testing, particularly for the I-V curve tracer, not only reinforces Fluke’s existing team but also opens doors to explore applications in the EV charging and energy storage sectors.
In a conversation with Patrick Edwards, a Massachusetts Master Electrician and owner of Edwards Electric, pv magazine USA Edwards, who offers IV- curve tracing services in the New England market, said that he is planning to buy the Solmetric unit for use on a recently contracted portfolio of community solar projects:
“We’ve recently signed a deal to do IV-curve tracing as part of the commissioning process for a series of community solar plants in Maine. All of these sites have high wattage modules, and we need a new testing kit to work with them. I was planning on buying the Solmetric unit, so I guess I’m buying a Fluke now.”
When asked why he was going with the Solmetric unit specifically, he said, “I have faith in a product that supplied reliability and accurate testing for as many years as I have been installing and testing.”
Although not yet featured on Fluke’s official webpage, the I-V curve tracing unit remains available on the Solmetric site, ensuring uninterrupted access to this critical tool for industry professionals.
In broader context, this acquisition is part of Fluke’s consistent endeavor to integrate testing firms into their expansive portfolio. Fluke Reliability, a Fortive subsidiary, recently acquired machine diagnostic company Azima DLI, continuing a trend of adding specialized companies like Raytek, Comark, TTL Technologies, eMaint, Pruftechnik, and Irisys to the Fluke family, enhancing their offerings and reinforcing their industry standing.
Founded in 1948, Fluke’s growth and evolution included acquisition by the Danaher Corporation in 1998 and a subsequent spin-off into Fortive in 2016, marking key milestones in its journey to its current industry leadership position.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/26/solar-industry-should-focus-on-virtual-power-plants-says-does-jigar-shah/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2023","Solar industry should focus on virtual power plants, says DOE’s Jigar Shah","The days of the solar industry operating as a “net metering type of industry” are “starting to be numbered,” said Jigar Shah, director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, at the RE+ 2023 conference in Las Vegas.
Now, “most solar systems come with batteries, and most are integrating smart panels,” he said. “They’re integrating demand response and load control capabilities into the inverter controls.”
Because a solar-plus-storage system with those features can earn its owner compensation through participation in a virtual power plant (VPP)—an aggregation of similar systems often managed by a third-party aggregator—Shah encouraged the solar industry to see its future in VPPs. The deployment of VPPs to date is shown in the featured image above.
Besides distributed storage, other distributed energy resources that can be aggregated into a VPP include electric vehicle chargers, smart thermostats, and smart electric water heaters.
Shah said that electric utilities are “looking to bury the hatchet and really deploy a lot of these technologies at scale” through VPPs. “Frankly, it is the only way for them to integrate all of the huge load that is coming their way,” for example due to increasing use of electric vehicles and heat pumps.
Shah separately noted that the utilities Duke Energy, serving the Carolinas, and Luma Energy in Puerto Rico have announced large VPP projects, the latter with the residential solar firm Sunnova.
Addressing the solar industry professionals in his audience at RE+, located 100 yards from a vast exhibit hall, Shah said “you’re the ones who should be integrating all of the technologies that are shown on the floor out there, into a coherent package.”
DOE investment
For its part, the Department of Energy (DOE) anticipates lending support on the order of $100 billion to advance VPPs, Shah said. Sunnova’s inclusion of low- and moderate-income Puerto Ricans in its VPP project is being supported by $3 billion in loan support, while other applicants are already preparing $30 billion in loan requests.
DOE’s goal is for the U.S. to deploy VPPs encompassing 80-160 GW of distributed energy resources by 2030, tripling the current scale of VPPs, to “support rapid electrification while redirecting grid spending from peaker plants to VPP participants and reducing overall grid costs,” according to a DOE report released during the RE+ conference.
The savings from that scale of VPPs would be on the order of $10 billion per year due to avoided resource costs, after payments to VPP participants, said Jennifer Downing, senior advisor at DOE’s Loan Programs Office and the report’s lead author, at the conference. That figure is based on an estimate prepared by analysts at The Brattle Group that VPPs and time-of-use pricing combined could achieve annual savings of $13 billion by 2030. The analysis avoided double-counting of savings from time-of-use pricing and savings from electric vehicle time-of-use management.
Dynamic pricing
An alternative to VPPs for achieving flexible demand for electricity, opt-in dynamic pricing, would yield annual system savings of $33 to 50 billion nationwide across several scenarios, found a modeling study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. California is now pursuing demand flexibility through dynamic pricing.
DOE’s report says that time-of-use pricing “lacks a unifying architecture that allows the distributed energy resource aggregation to interact with a grid operator as one utility-scale resource.” The same is true of dynamic pricing.
Policies
Shah encouraged the solar industry to lobby for state policies that foster the deployment of virtual power plants. Downing described “favorable market mechanisms” in California and New York that have led to a number of VPPs in each state.
DOE’s report is titled “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Virtual Power Plants.” DOE has also published a “liftoff” report for long-duration energy storage, and similar reports for other technologies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/26/not-all-lithium-ion-batteries-are-dangerous/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2023",Not all ‘lithium-ion’ batteries are dangerous,"Lithium-ion battery deployment is proliferating exponentially in the U.S. Every cellphone, power tool and electric vehicle come with a lithium battery today, not to mention the 100 GWh or so of lithium batteries operating at the utility scale.
This makes a lot of consumers nervous. As this trend unfolds, stories litter the media landscape about lithium-ion batteries catching fire, and even exploding. It’s a valid concern, and the time for consumers to understand a basic truth about lithium-ion batteries is long past due.
The crucial point that’s either unknown or omitted in every one of the hundred horror stories you can find online about EV, utility and home battery fires, is that “lithium-ion” is a catch-all term. It doesn’t describe a particular type of battery. There are more than a dozen lithium-ion battery chemistries. Six of them have made it outside the laboratory. Three of them can be found on the market. Two of those are incredibly common, and the differences between them are so substantial that comparing them will serve as an excellent primer for the subject.
NMC
The first chemistry is lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide or NMC. Up until about 2020, these were the undisputed leader of the market share of lithium batteries. In 2022, they still comprised some 60% of the market share. However, after so many (largely unreported) battery fires in early models of  electric vehicles (EVs), and the subsequent shift by Tesla and a few other major EV manufacturers to the exclusive use of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry last year, this is expected to halve in short order.
NMC has an energy density roughly 10% (depending on manufacturer) better than LFP. In addition, they are significantly lighter than LFP in weight per kWh. This is largely responsible for its early adoption by industry. However, NMCs lackluster safety record, lifespan, and its increasing material cost has recently made LFP the preferred choice of nearly every industry sector in the last year.
The dangers of lithium-ion about which the public has been so repetitiously warned, are almost exclusively the dangers of NMC. A very low thermal runaway temperature reached in many real-world scenarios is primary. With temperatures breaking records every year in most parts of the country, ambient temperatures of 110°, or even 120°F are almost commonplace now in regions that had never seen them before the 2000s.
With most of the country’s grid suffering from insufficient and decaying infrastructure, coupled with increased demand for air conditioning in hot weather, a ‘perfect storm’ is created much more commonly now wherein NMC batteries attached to utility grids (whether in a garage or a utility storage facility) are called upon to export their maximum power capacities during the hottest ambient temperatures. Thus, their (alarmingly low) thermal runaway temperatures are reached, and you get cell explosion and battery fires.
Calls for evacuations in response to the larger of these incidents, aside from risks of explosion in the immediate vicinity, are issued by fire personnel because the gas emissions during an NMC cell rupture event are extremely toxic, containing several fluorine gasses as well as cobalt and manganese cenospheres well above toxic limits.
LFP
LFP or lithium iron phosphate, also known as LiFePO4, is a completely different chemistry. With a much higher thermal runaway temperature, (some 20° C higher depending on manufacture), the potential for cell rupture due to thermal runaway is well outside of normal operating conditions, even on the hottest of days.
Further, (and it seems obvious but still bears mention) iron doesn’t burn like manganese. Actual fires due to battery failure, on those rare occasions that they do occur, are limited to wires, and sometimes battery management system (BMS) printed circuit boards. Assuming that the battery casing conforms to NEMA or IP standards, cell fires cannot escape the case unless it’s been punctured.
Also, the findings of several experiments where cell explosion is forced, have confirmed using gas chromatography that the release of gasses during a cell rupture event are by far the least toxic (containing no transition metal aerosols in contrast with NMC) of the common three lithium chemistries.
If the decarbonization of U.S. energy infrastructure within our generation is a real goal, and not just election-cycle pillow talk, then the continued deployment of LiFePO4 batteries in tandem with the ongoing rapid deployment of solar and hydro renewable resources are absolutely paramount.
Let’s not do the public further injustice by promulgating terms like ‘lithium-ion batteries’ that for lack of distinction are turning us all away from the LFP solution that may yet afford a small chance of success, for fear of the early NMC deployment that even the profit-first-and-only markets have admitted was probably a bad idea.
