That compared to a net loss of $77.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.
The company said the smaller loss was largely the result of lower net interest expense. It said this was driven by decreases in realized losses on interest rate swaps of $31.3 million related to the termination of certain debt facilities in 2020, unrealized losses on interest rate swaps of $26.3 million, and debt discount amortization of $2.9 million.
Sunnova said its first quarter revenue rose to $41.3 million, an $11.4 million increase from a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of customers served.
These decreases were offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $2.5 million due to an increase in the principal debt balance after entering into new financing arrangements.
In February, Sunnova said it would acquire Lennar’s residential solar platform, known as “SunStreet.” As part of the deal, Sunnova became the residential solar and storage service provider for Lennar’s new home communities that offer solar.
The deal offered Sunnova access to a multi-year supply of homesites, reduced customer acquisition cost by making solar a standard feature on new homes, and an opportunity to upsell solar and battery storage services to the roughly 250,000 homes built by Lennar in the last decade.
The company said its first quarter total net operating expense rose to $64.6 million, an increase of $20.4 million from the same period a year earlier. The increase stemmed from an increase in the number of customers served, greater depreciation expense, and higher general and administration (G&A) expense.
Its G&A expense was higher due to $4.0 million in SunStreet acquisition costs. The company also cited higher payroll and employee-related expense due to an increase in non-cash equity compensation and the hiring of personnel in commercial operations to support growth.

The recommended action was petitioned for by both local solar advocates and consumer choice advocacy groups.
In accepting the proposal, regulators rejected Dominion’s apprach which would have stuck residential solar customers with a fixed monthly rate and a monthly payment based on the size of their rooftop system. Because of those two components, the average South Carolina solar homeowner would have seen their cost savings shrink by 60%.
Multiple advocacy groups claimed that Dominion’s proposal would have slowed the state’s rooftop solar market to a crawl.
Instead, regulators approved a proposal that includes a less crippling minimum monthly bill of about $13.50 for solar customers (Dominion’s would have averaged around $50). The approved proposal also requires Dominion to take new rooftop customer service under a time-of-use rate schedule and allow customers to carry over monthly excess generation at the full retail rate based on the time-of-use period.
Customers also were granted all rights and title to own and transfer renewable energy credits attributable to their generation.
Residential solar hasn’t taken off as much in South Carolina as much as in other states. While this new system won’t necessarily increase adoption rates, it may prevent stagnation within the rooftop solar industry, as was predicted as one outcome of Dominion’s proposal.

Its projects are in southern Kern County and a less specific site in “central California.” The two projects represent a combined investment of more than $1.5 billion. Hydrostor said that development work, including transmission interconnection, engineering and permitting activities, are underway. Even though these initial phases have begun, Hydrostor has not yet shared when the projects will start construction, be completed, or what their names will be.
All projects will use the company’s Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology, which provides eight to 12 hours of energy storage.
State regulators in California have identified a need of up to 1,600 MW of long duration energy storage by 2026. Hydrostor also is developing the Rosamond A-CAES Project in California, northeast of Los Angeles. That project will provide 500 MW of on-demand peaking capacity for 12 hours of duration once it becomes operational in 2024.

The software-as-a-service will be rolled out to 1,500 agencies and made available to Accela’s current state and local customers. The tool is designed to speed solar permitting timelines from an average of two weeks to instantaneous. Accela said it works with over 80% of the largest cities in the United States and has been partnering with agencies to modernize solar permitting.
The NREL-designed tool catches any code issues, typos, and other errors, and returns corrections to the applicant, allowing simple projects to move forward quickly while creating more bandwidth for staff to focus on more complex or unique applications. Accela said its customers can integrate SolarAPP+ into software to speed up review and approval processes and track permits within a single system.
Rochester, New York-based Hyzon Motors and Modern Industrial Investment Holding Group, a Saudi industrial conglomerate, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with NEOM Company to develop a plant in Saudi Arabia to assemble hydrogen-fueled vehicles.
Under the agreement, Hyzon and its partners will work over the next 18 months to finalize plans for the facility, which is expected to be able to assemble up to 10,000 vehicles a year. Hyzon and Modern Group plan to incorporate a joint venture company, Hyzon Motors Middle East, to focus on supplying Hyzon-branded commercial vehicles throughout Saudi Arabia.
NEOM is part of the portfolio of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world.
Earlier, Hyzon signed a separate MOU for a joint venture with renewable fuels company Raven SR. The two plan to build up to 100 hydrogen production hubs across the United States and globally. As part of the deal, Hyzon said it would acquire a minority interest in Wyoming-based Raven.

The team is developing solar energy storage systems using retired batteries from electric vehicles. For their submission, researchers developed solar energy storage systems using retired batteries from electric vehicles. They said the goal is to reduce the cost of solar energy storage systems by 50%. Their approach is bolstered by the fact that the cost of electrical vehicle retired batteries is lower, and can be used to fuel energy storage systems with newly developed active life-balancing technologies. Retired EV batteries may still hold up to 85% of their original storage capacity.
Supported by the Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the prize is a $3 million competition designed to transform the best ideas around solar into technology solutions that are ready for market. Last year, 121 teams submitted ideas to the three-stage competition. In December, semifinalist teams were selected to move on in the competition. And in early April, finalist teams were announced, each earning a $100,000 cash prize, $75,000 in technical support funding, and a spot to compete in the final contest this September.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/29/seia-releases-tool-aimed-at-increasing-solar-supply-chain-transparency/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 29, 2021",SEIA releases tool aimed at increasing solar supply chain transparency,"The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released a tool that it said will increase supply chain transparency and help ensure that solar components are “made ethically throughout the solar value chain.”
The Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol is a set of guidelines intended to help solar companies meet compliance obligations and “provide customers with assurances that their solar products are free of unethical labor practices.” (Read the protocol here.)
“Solar customers expect their products to be ethically produced, and this protocol helps ensure that solar products coming into the United States are not made using forced labor,” said John Smirnow, SEIA’s vice president of market strategy.

In early February, some 175 solar companies, including some of the top solar manufacturers in the world, signed an SEIA-led pledge opposing forced labor in the solar supply chain. In an interview with pv magazine, SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said that the industry trade group became aware of the forced labor issue late in 2020 and had been communicating with our companies that “they need to move their supply chains.” She set a goal of late June for companies to have adjusted their supply chains to avoid conflict regions.
The SEIA supply chain traceability document said it is intended to have “universal application” across product lines intended for export to the U.S. market. It expected key adopters to include equipment manufacturers and U.S. importers. It said that while its aim is to focus on “the provenance of material inputs,” it also recognizes the importance of independent, third-party audits and a “strong corporate social responsibility and import compliance platform.”
SEIA said that the U.S. government has “identified forced labor as an area of concern for the solar supply chain.” It said that U.S. solar customers also are “increasingly seeking assurances that the products they purchase are truly sustainable and, in particular, free of forced labor.”
SEIA said that that the new tool “by itself will not stamp out forced labor, companies need to go through the steps laid out by the protocol.”
In a statement released by SEIA, George Hershman, president of Swinerton Renewable Energy and SEIA board chair said, “This important tool provides a consistent set of guidelines rooted in equity, security and sustainability to thousands of solar companies across the country.”
The protocol is a set of recommended best practices that SEIA said is designed to prevent forced labor in the solar supply chain; help companies meet their U.S. import compliance obligations; and provide customers value chain transparency. SEIA said the tool has been structured as an industry specification or de facto standard, with the expectation that it will be further developed into a formal industry standard.
The protocol includes an audit mechanism intended to measure a company’s implementation and compliance. SEIA said that in assessing conformance, “no single factor will be dispositive.” It said that auditors would assess conformance based on a “holistic approach.”
SEIA also updated its Solar Commitment, which defines common labor, health and safety, environmental, and ethical standards and expectations for solar companies. The update includes guidance on workplace safety and ethical labor practices.
In addition, the standard includes recycling and refurbishment best practices, information on energy consumption tracking, procedures to avoid the use of conflict minerals in solar products, and additional guidance that companies can follow to hold suppliers to the standards.
SEIA also released a Solar Buyers’ Guide on Traceability, which summarizes the protocol and offers a set of questions that customers, developers, financiers, and other stakeholders should ask suppliers about products in the solar + storage value chain.
