The partnership will tap Qcells for its solar modules, as well as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services.
The massive power procurement by the tech giant represents the equivalent of powering over 400,000 homes. Qcells will work with Microsoft on developing the solar projects, which will advance Microsoft’s progress toward its goal of covering 100% of its energy needs with renewable energy production by 2025. It will also help support a new US-based energy supply chain.
“Building a resilient solar energy supply chain is essential to advancing a global green energy economy. Microsoft’s partnership with Qcells will help make this vision a reality by bringing innovation and investment to rural Georgia,” said Brad Smith, vice chair and president, Microsoft.
Qcells, owned by Seoul-based Hanwha Solutions, announced that it will invest more than $2.5 billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the United States, from polysilicon sourcing through module production. This will make Qcells the first company to establish a fully integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the United States.
The company cites Senator Ossoff’s Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, now part of the Inflation Reduction Act, as playing a key role in promoting additional investments in the US. The IRA offers numerous tax credits for clean energy manufacturing.
Qcells intends to break ground on the new, state-of-the-art facility in Bartow County, Georgia, where it will manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells and finished modules. The company also has a facility in Dalton, Georgia, where it will assemble an additional 2 GW of modules. With plans to boost the Dalton production by another 5.1 GW, Qcells anticipates that its total production in Georgia will be 8.4 GW in 2024.
“Today’s Hanwha Qcells announcement to make the largest solar investment in US history is a big deal for Georgia’s working families and the American economy. And, this investment is a direct result of my economic plan and the Inflation Reduction Act,” said President Joe Biden.
Microsoft ranks as the fifth largest corporate procurer of solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, though this high-profile transaction will likely move it up the list. There are now 23 US companies that have installed at least 100 MW of solar capacity, up from 11 companies in 2019. Eighteen of the top 25 companies ranked in this report are pursuing 100% renewable energy or carbon neutral goals.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/25/former-tesla-employees-design-ev-chargers-in-disadvantaged-communities/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 25, 2023",Former Tesla employees design EV chargers in disadvantaged communities,"Orange Charger, an EV charging infrastructure startup formed by a group of ex-Tesla employees, has designed a charging station solution for low-and-moderate income communities in apartment buildings.
The company closed a $2.5 million pre-seed funding round this week from early-stage investor Baukunst. The funding will help to scale affordable EV charging for apartment communities by leveraging lower-powered charging systems.
Orange’s business model is centered around creating affordable charging networks from the ground up that provide site owners with a compelling return on investment while maintaining equitable costs in order to bring EV charging to disadvantaged communities.
Orange installs alternating current (AC) chargers with enough energy to satisfy daily driving needs using standard 120-volt and 240-volt solutions. More stations can be installed on the same circuit making EV charging possible for the largest concentration of residents at each site.
The company says its Orange Outlet system is designed to provide EV charging to some apartment residents at 70% cost savings over other EV charging solutions.
The Orange Outlet 520 model operates at 120 volts, delivering 1.92 kWh of charging capacity, adding five miles per hour of driving range at 16 amps continuous current. The Orange Outlet 620 model operates on 240 volts, delivering 3.84 kWh of charging capacity, adding 15 miles per hour of driving range at 16 amps continuous current.

The company reports that both Outlet systems retail at $400 MSRP (excluding taxes and shipping), are wifi and cellular phone enabled and come equipped with Bluetooth interconnectivity.
The Outlet measures 4.9 inches x 4.9 inches square, with 1.5 inches of depth into the wall, slightly larger than traditional electrical outlets. The Orange Outlet is designed for installation over an existing outlet socket without further modifications as are necessary for higher powered charging. The Outlet is UL-915 certified and carries a three-year manufacturer’s warranty.
The proprietary OrangeNet software management system used at each charging site allows the property owner to manage outlets across multiple EV charging sites.
“Orange has achieved equitable access to electricity by re-thinking the entire process of vehicle charging by creating a system specifically for apartment communities, rather than pushing a public charging model that doesn’t fit onto them,” said Nicholas Johnson, chief executive officer of Orange Charger.
“At Baukunst, we believe a charging solution designed specifically for affordability and rapid adoption in apartment communities will catalyze the equitable EV movement,” said Matt Thoms, general partner of Baukunst, a San Francisco technology venture capital (VC) firm that formed in 2022 with an initial capital fund of $100 million.
The early-stage VC investor was joined in the pre-seed funding of Orange by angel investors that include Tesla co-founders Marc Tarpenning and Martin Eberhard, as well as Johnathan Crowder, founder of Intellus Capital, and Sven Thesan, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist.
Redwood City, California-based Orange Charger formed in 2020 by Nicholas Johnson, who was previously chief technology officer of LYT, and from 2015 to 2017 was an electrical engineer in Tesla’s climate control and thermal systems group.  Other Orange team members include chief operating officer Neil Joseph, Tesla’s former head of delivery organization, and head of sales Don MacNeil, Tesla’s former regional representative for New England.
Currently the company is offering charging solutions in San Mateo County, California and the Eastern Bay Area, where Orange can qualify for incentives under Peninsula Clean Energy’s EV Ready program.  Under PCE’s program, building owners can receive $2,000 to $5,500 in incentives per port for Level 1 and Level 2 EV charging deployments. New building constructions can receive $1,000 to $2,500 per port for the same deployments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/25/falling-costs-15-gw-of-us-solar-module-production-and-topcon-trends/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 25, 2023","Falling costs, 15 GW of US solar module production, and TOPCon trends","The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures. The bill includes over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain. This historic level of investment is key to achieving American manufacturing independence and clean energy security.
A recent report from Wood Mackenzie, Solar: What to watch for in 2023—Solar technology and market update, indicates that developers, engineering procurement construction (EPCs) companies, and manufacturers will be on the lookout for guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS for clarity in order to strategize new solar development and investment in new manufacturing facilities within the United States.
The report looks at trends in this burgeoning industry, including a focus on TOPCon modules over heterojunction (HJT), growth in the global residential inverter market, an expansion of tracker manufacturing, an expected drop in solar project costs and a look at challenges going forward.
TOPcon vs. PERC
TOPCon, which stands for tunnel oxide passivated contacts, is expected to outrace heterojunction (HJT), and the Wood Mackenzie report notes that mono PERC “is the technology that balances maturity and efficiency”, indicating that TOPCon has the highest growth potential due to process improvements and cost optimization.
A year ago Stefan Gunz, the head of division photovoltaics research at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE), told pv magazine, “The PERC panel technology has also a very fast learning curve and the balance between them will depend on which one will be able to increase its efficiency or reduce cost faster than the other one.”
Wood Mackenzie analysts estimate that TOPCon modules have reached a 25% efficiency in mass production and may climb to 28.7%
Upgrading manufacturing from mono PERC production to TOPCon is a simple and relatively low-cost investment, and the analysts estimate that a lab efficiency of 27% could be achieved through improvements in metallization and thinner wafers. Wood Mackenzie notes that some manufacturers expect the average wafer thickness for large-format TOPCon modules to decrease 20 μm this year to 120 μm, which will drive most of the price reductions in 2023.
The Inflation Reduction Act is stimulating US module manufacturing as a result of the $30 billion in production tax credits as well as the $10 billion investment tax credit to build clean technology manufacturing facilities. Wood Mackenzie expects US module production capacity to surpass 15 GW by the end of this year.
The big question, however, is the definition of “domestically made equipment”, and whether it means that the modules are assembled in the United States, or if all components are made in the US. The challenge for module makers is that there is virtually no wafer or cell manufacturing in the US, although that is changing with recent announcements by companies including Qcells and CubicPV. The difference in the interpretation of domestic content “could dramatically affect module manufacturing capacity in the next five years”, the report contends. The analysts estimate that almost 45 GWdc of new capacity announcements will come online by 2026.
Inverters, trackers and more
The expected growth of solar in the US will ripple through the supply chain, boosting growth in inverters and trackers, among other supporting components. The Wood Mackenzie report notes that recent policy changes, including the EU’s REPowerEU, India’s implementation of Production Linked Incentives (PLI) and the US IRA, will accelerate solar adoption in these countries, thus helping the countries reach their net zero goals.
According to the report, the residential inverter market will grow throughout the world in 2023. With rooftop solar gaining momentum, especially in countries like India and Germany, there will be a corresponding boost in the market for microinverters, string inverters and DC optimizers, the most popular inverter choices for rooftop installations. Notably, string inverters with multiple maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) will see increased market prevalence in 2023.
Residential inverters will see increased use of artificial intelligence in its algorithms. Module-level power electronics (MLPEs) and single-phase string inverters, the most popular in rooftop solar installations, will see an 11% market share in global inverter shipments in 2023. Inverter manufacturing will increase with major players adding production lines and new entrants joining the market, and the ensuing competition will trigger a price drop from 2% to 4% in 2023.
A continuing challenge for inverter manufacturers is the global chip shortage, which the Wood Mackenzie analysts expect to continue through 2023 and spill over into 2024. The shortage has caused inverter manufacturers to source the chips from lower-tier manufacturers before conducting rigorous in-house testing to ensure their inverters’ quality, efficiency and lifespan. Wood Mac predicts that inverter price won’t come down until later this year.
Domestic tracker production is accelerating in several parts of the world due to government incentives as well as the logistical issues experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Wood Mackenzie analysts, tracker prices will drop in India and in the United States. They expect more stability in the steel supply in the US and India, especially with expansion of existing steel manufacturing. Europe, however, will still face an imbalance in the steel market. As over 60% of tracker composition is steel, this rebound in steel demand will result in increased competition in tracker market share for vendors, says Wood Mackenzie analysts, projecting that 2023 pricing for trackers will fall by 5% in the United States, Brazil and China.
Solar costs
Capital expenditure costs will continue to drop, driven in part by increased use of TOPcon modules. Wood Mackenzie analysts also expect polysilicon prices to decline this year and they estimate that the existing 300 GW of global capacity will reach 900 GW by the end of 2023.
“We forecast that over 1 million Mt of polysilicon expansion will come online by 2023. Most of the new capacity will be in China. However, we believe the approximately 10% slated to be outside China may command a price premium as it may be free of tariffs and other policy risks.”
Moving forward
An ongoing challenge is the uncertainty around antidumping/countervailing (AD/CVD) tariff costs. With the US Department of Commerce expected to announce its final determination in May 2023, Wood Mackenzie estimates that duties can range from 16% to 254% based on the country of origin. The preliminary determination, released in December 2022, found tier 1 companies, like Trina, BYD, Vina (a unit of Longi) and Canadian Solar, circumventing Chinese tariffs. The preliminary determination cleared Hanwha and Jinko which will result in some relief in module availability in 2023.
In the United States, developers will continue to focus on requirements of the IRA, including the prevailing wage and domestic content bonus additions for utility-scale projects starting construction in 2023. For projects to claim the full 30% investment tax credit or the production tax credit, all projects larger than 1 MWac must pay its workers a prevailing wage and institute an apprenticeship program.
In Europe, the REPowerEU policy aims to install 320 GW of solar PV by 2025 and 600 GW under its EU solar energy strategy. To meet these ambitious targets, it needs to build a robust manufacturing hub within the region. The new European Solar Photovoltaic Industry Alliance, will create a framework to help secure financing for manufacturing and promote research and innovation in module technology, among other zero-carbon technologies.
A final challenge to PV manufacturing in Europe, according to Wood Mackenzie analysts, is the cost competition from the APAC region due to its higher cost of energy, labor and material, but it could benefit from customers willing to pay a premium for better technology and transparency in the supply chain.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/25/50-states-of-solar-incentives-illinois/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ILLINOIS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 25, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Illinois,"Solar in Illinois practically did not exist until 2019, when the Illinois Shines program was introduced, creating richly valued solar renewable energy credits that pay residential and commercial solar asset owners based on their system’s production.
The state has also introduced a community solar offering under Illinois Shines and has a healthy mix of residential, commercial, and community solar installations. The utility-scale sector had its landmark year in 2021, and this is expected to continue to accelerate. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects Illinois will add just under 5 GW of solar over the next five years, placing it within the top 10 states for solar development outlook.
Illinois is driven by a strong renewable energy portfolio standard, requiring 25% of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2025. The amount of solar capacity installed in Illinois is expected to grow by more than 1,700% over the next five years, said SEIA. SEIA continues to actively advocate for “Path to 100” HB2966/SB 1781 in Illinois, which increases the renewable portfolio standard from 25% by 2025 to 40% by 2030 and increases renewable energy credit procurement from 10 million credits by 2020 to 45 million by 2030 with 50/50 split from solar and wind.
Incentives
Illinois Shines created the Adjustable Block Program, an incentive that awards solar owners one solar renewable energy credit (SREC) for each MWh of electricity produced over a 15-year span. This leads to savings of $10,000 for an average residential solar array. The program offers a capped amount of solar capacity to be offered the incentive each year.
Illinois also offers net metering, which involves the utility crediting a customer for any excess solar production sent to its distribution system. Net metering rates vary by utility and by customer type. In most cases, net metering credits do not carry over year-to-year, which is why utilities suggest installing a system that covers about 85% of the home’s needs. However, with attached battery energy storage, covering 100% of home energy needs can be economical.
The Solar Calculator from SolarReviews offers a look at the solar and savings potential of a home based on up-to-date net metering rates and other relevant costs and benefits.
The Illinois Solar For All program established incentives for eligible low-income homeowners and renters for residential properties, properties that house non-profits and public facilities, and community solar projects. Participants will see no upfront costs, and ongoing costs and fees will not exceed 50% of the value of the energy generated from the solar project.
Commercial and industrial customers are offered an incentive based on system size from ComEd, one of Illinois’ largest utilities. Systems of 2,000 kW of capacity and below are offered $250 per kW.
Like most states, Illinois makes solar exempt from property taxes. Like all states and territories, Illinosians are offered the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which cover 30% of system costs. The ITC is now available to many customers as a direct payment following new provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.
Notable project
A brownfield site turned green when Ameresco and Inovateus Solar announced the completion of a 2.62 MW solar project on a rehabilitated plot of land. The project was built on a former General Motors powertrain division plant. Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company, an independent power producer and green energy investment company, is the owner of the installation.
 The Danville solar project began construction in November of 2020 and reached completion in May of 2022.
The project consists of over 6,600 solar modules and is connected to the Ameren utility grid. The completed project is expected to generate over 3.6 million kWh of electricity and offset over 1,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, or the equivalent to powering 350 Illinois homes and removing approximately 480 cars from the road each year.
“We can turn a serious problem into a tremendous opportunity by siting solar on closed landfills,” said Tyler Kanczuzewski, vice president of sustainability at Inovateus. “The Danville Solar project is making productive use of land that might otherwise lie dormant, while avoiding construction in more pristine areas.”
This project contributes to Illinois’ Future Energy Jobs Act, which requires 2.7 GW of solar to be installed in Illinois by 2030 and that 2% of those projects are installed on brownfield sites.
Look for a feature piece on the US push for cleantech brownfield restoration in the upcoming February print issue of pv magazine.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/25/former-chevron-hq-goes-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 25, 2023",Former Chevron HQ goes solar,"A multi-use office and retail establishment that served as the corporate headquarters of oil major Chevron will now offset 90% of its energy usage with solar. Bishop Ranch, a 600-acre multi-use commercial campus in San Ramon, California, has entered the second phase of building a 25 MW solar development by adding 15.5 MW of solar generation and 7.1 MW / 14.2 MWh of battery energy storage systems. 
DSD Renewables is working with the property owner Sunset Development to add 35,000 solar panels across the multi-use development’s office rooftop space. Expected to be completed by Q1 2024, the second phase of Bishop Ranch’s solar development will see the community provide 22.24 million kWh of clean energy that will offset its energy usage by 90%.
The first phase of Bishop Ranch’s development began in 2021 when DSD developed a 1.33 MW system combining rooftop and canopy PV systems on the community’s City Center Bishop Ranch. At 300,000 square feet, Sunset Development reports that the shopping center is the largest retail space in the world to receive the LEED Platinum certification for sustainability and green building design.
“As we continue to transform Bishop Ranch into a vibrant downtown, DSD remains the ideal partner to assist in getting us one step closer to our ultimate goal of relying 100% on clean, renewable energy,” said Alexander Mehran, Jr., president and chief executive officer of Sunset Development.
Sunset Development is a third-generation, family-owned Tri-Valley, California, property owner that has developed and managed properties in the Amador Valley, San Ramon Valley, and Livermore Valley region since 1951.  The company purchased Bishop Ranch from electric company Western Electric in 1978, overseeing the area’s transition into a suburban community.
In September, Chevron downsized its corporate campus, selling a 92 acre, 1.3 million square-foot office space portion of the Bishop Ranch complex back to Sunset Development, according to local business reports.
Chevron signed a lease to a 400,000-square-foot office space at Bishop Ranch, a 1.8 million-square-foot office building on which DSD Renewables is installing the rooftop solar. Chevron Park is expected to accommodate 2,000 employees and be complete in late 2023, according to Sunset Development. The new office will be owned by Sunset Development and MetLife Investment, and designed by engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.
Chevron has been based in San Ramon since the 1980s, and has produced oil and gas in California for over 140 years. In June, the company announced that it would sell Chevron Park, and downsize to a smaller location in San Ramon. In the process it subsidized the relocation of approximately 6,000 workers to its Houston, Texas office, according to local business reports.
The oil major’s $14 billion capital expenditures budget for 2023 calls for $11.5 billion in continued upstream oil and gas production, $1.9 billion for downstream refining operations, and just $600 million toward other investments such as the energy transition. Chevron has recently invested in carbon capture technology company, Svante, compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling company, Beyond6, and geothermal developer, Baseload Capital.
Formerly GE Solar, DSD was spun off of General Electric in mid-2019 with backing from BlackRock Real Assets. Since then, DSD has expanded into community solar and asset acquisition in 2020. Earlier this week, for example, DSD Renewables partnered with the Home Depot to install 13 MW of rooftop solar across a 25-store portfolio in California. The rooftop portfolio will begin construction in early 2023, and upon completion is expected to generate more than 17 million kWh of clean energy annually.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/25/new-mexico-law-seeks-solar-on-every-roof-and-an-ev-charger-in-every-garage/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,NEW MEXICO",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 25, 2023","New Mexico law seeks solar on every roof, and an EV charger in every garage","Senator William Soules of New Mexico has submitted SB 77 for consideration with the state’s legislature. The proposed law, which is currently only a few sentences, proposes that in July of 2023, all newly built homes must be constructed with a solar power system and a plug for electric vehicles.
The law states that for each square foot of heated area, a new home must have at least one watt of solar photovoltaics. Specifications for the electric vehicle charging receptacle were not provided.
For homes of 1,900 square feet to 3,000 square feet, the law would require a solar power system of at least 1.9 kWdc to 3.0 kWdc. If we assume that a solar installation costs $3 per watt at the time of construction, the law would add between $5,700 and $9,000 to the price of a new home. However, the effective price of such a system would actually be $3,450 to $5,000, after applying New Mexico’s 10% income tax credit and the 30% federal tax credit.
The price of electricity in New Mexico is generally lower than most of the country, but the amount of sunlight is above average. As a result, the payback period in the state is likely to fall in the seven to nine year range. New Mexico also has a strong net metering program.
Because no specifications were provided for the electric vehicle charger plug, we are not able to estimate the cost. However, it could be argued that the vehicle charger requirement does not add to construction costs, because an electric car can be plugged into any socket. If the law requires a 240-volt plug to be installed at time of new construction, the cost could be as low as a few hundred dollars, which would be for labor, copper, and a circuit breaker. Homes that already planned to install 240-volt plugs in their garage would see no additional expense.
The Senator has also submitted SB 60, which requires that new public schools built after July 1, 2023 – that also receive state grant assistance – must include a solar system that meets the school’s energy needs.
California law already requires that all new construction – residential and commercial – contain a minimum amount of solar power based on structural characteristics.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/25/startup-begins-producing-40-efficient-thermophotovoltaic-cells/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,RESEARCH,CALIFORNIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 25, 2023",Startup begins producing 40%-efficient thermophotovoltaic cells,"Antora Energy has started production at its 2 MW thermophotovoltaic cell factory in Sunnyvale, California.
“The cells are based on III-V semiconductors, which have a higher performance than conventional solar cells, and produce 100 times more power than similarly sized devices,” CEO Andrew Ponec told pv magazine. “The cells can convert any source of high temperature heat into electricity and their most important application is for energy storage,” he added referring to thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) consisting of a low-cost, grid-scale energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity above 2,000 C.
Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) is a power generation technology that uses thermal radiation to generate electricity in photovoltaic cells. A TPV system generally consists of a thermal emitter that can reach high temperatures, near or beyond 1,000 C, and a photovoltaic diode cell that can absorb photons coming from the heat source.
The technology has drawn the interest of scientists for decades, because it is able to capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. However, the efficiencies reported thus far have been too low to make it commercially viable, as TPV devices still suffer from optical and thermal losses.
“Until now, TPV technology has met neither the efficiency threshold required to compete with traditional heat engines nor the manufacturability threshold required to produce the technology at scale,” said Antora Energy. “Now, Antora has met both of these critical thresholds, demonstrating heat-to-electricity conversion efficiencies greater than 40%, and demonstrating the capability to manufacture TPV at scale.”
The startup said it has secured funding from the California Energy Commission to build the TPV manufacturing line in California in 2021.
“Some of Antora’s earliest funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to develop TPV technology in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Arizona State University,” said the company.
In April, a group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) unveiled a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell featuring III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV. This cell achieved an efficiency of 41.1% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 C. The group presented the device in “Thermophotovoltaic efficiency of 40%,” which was recently published in Nature.
