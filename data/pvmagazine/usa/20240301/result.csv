Net metering is a process by which solar customers export their excess electricity production to the grid in exchange for credit on their utility bills. The rate structure has been a primary driver in distributed, rooftop solar across the nation.
DPU’s order now allows municipal and state-owned solar asset owners to take advantage of net metering. It also enables the transfer of net metering credits between utilities. And large commercial solar facilities are exempt from net metering caps. These moves, along with a restructured cost recovery plan, are estimated to save ratepayers $10 million.
Massachusetts has tapped 10.8% of its rooftop solar generation potential, among the highest adoption rates in the country, according to Environment America. The new regulations are expected to help spur the deployment of solar facilities across the state, support Massachusetts’s move towards electrification, and cut costs for residents and businesses.
This regulatory change bucks a national trend set by California, a state that has sent its rooftop solar industry reeling with its transition to Net Energy Metering 3.0. After slashing its net metering credit rates by about 75%, among other moves, the state has suffered over 17,000 job losses, major bankruptcies, and a sharp drop in rooftop solar installations. Analysts say that California is now off-track for reaching its climate goals. Other major rooftop solar markets, including North Carolina, Arizona, and others have followed California in cutting net metering rates, despite the industry tailspin.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts has doubled down on net metering, recognizing the system-wide cost and resilience benefits of rooftop solar.
“Net metering enables customers to cut their energy costs,” said DPU chair James Van Nostrand. “This is another example of the important nexus between the clean energy transition and maintaining affordability for Massachusetts residents.”
Massachusetts sets caps on how much capacity of rooftop solar can be eligible for net metering. It used to have an exemption for small systems of 10 kW or less. Now, the exemption threshold is expanded to 60 kW, meaning that almost all residential accounts and many small commercial accounts are now eligible for net metering.
Changes to the program include:
DPU said the moves were made to help the state adhere to its 2021 climate action plan. The full summary of net metering revisions can be found here.
Why rooftop?
Recent modeling from Environment America found that rooftop solar has technical potential to meet 45% of U.S. electricity demand. Today, it only represents about 1.5% of the electricity used.
“Today, in Massachusetts, you can get your energy straight from your roof,” Neumann told lawmakers. “It’s making less and less sense to pay for power from a distant plant spewing pollution when we can soak up the sun on our rooftops.”
Rooftop solar “has myriad benefits for the environment and consumers,” said the report. This includes reducing the need for dirty power plants and expensive transmission lines, providing lower costs, and can help to increase the grid’s resilience to extreme weather and other shocks.
Distributed solar helps squeeze other emitting sources off the grid. Take the 1.4 GW Mystic Generating Station serving the ISO New England grid operator region. The natural gas plant used to be fired up in the winter to prevent blackouts, but the grid operator said increased solar capacity has made the grid reliable enough to shut Mystic down. Over 5.4 GW of solar, most of it rooftop, has helped enable the transition away from fossil fuels, even in the harsh New England winter.
Another environmental benefit of rooftop solar is the reduction of land use for energy development, sometimes referred to as “energy sprawl.” For each gigawatt of rooftop solar installed in lieu of utility-scale projects, over 5,200 acres of land are saved.
Further, rooftop solar can save the nation on rising transmission needs and costs.
“Because rooftop solar generates power that can be used on-site reduces the need for transmission from central generating stations, potentially saving states and municipalities time and money on their energy transitions,” said the report. “To reach renewable energy targets, some expansion of transmission infrastructure will be necessary, but maximizing the potential of rooftop solar can help to minimize the amount we need to build.”
Solar is also now the most cost-effective new generation source in most markets and most conditions in the United States. On average, new-build solar costs 29% less than the next-cheapest fossil fuel alternative, said Ernst and Young.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/01/alberta-lifts-moratorium-on-renewable-energy-projects/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CANADA",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-03-01,Alberta lifts moratorium on renewable energy projects,"From pv magazine global
The government of the western Canadian province of Alberta has ended an almost seven-month long moratorium on approving renewable energy projects. The pause started in August 2023, when the Alberta Utilities Commission began an inquiry into land use and reclamation.
Upon lifting the ban on Feb. 29, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said the government would now take an “agriculture first” approach to future renewables projects. It plans to ban renewable power projects on agricultural land deemed to have excellent or good irrigation potential, in addition to setting up 35 km buffer zones around areas the government classifies as having pristine views.
The Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA) welcomed the end of the ban, and said it did not affect operational projects or projects already under construction. However, it said it expects the impact to be seen in the coming years. It said the ban on approvals has “created a climate of uncertainty with negative consequences for investor confidence in Alberta.”
“While the pause has lifted, there remains significant uncertainty and risk for investors wishing to participate in Canada’s hottest market for renewables.,” said CanREA President and CEO Vittoria Bellissimo. “It is critical to get these policy changes right, and to do so quickly.”
The association said the government’s decision to make some parts of the province off-limits for renewables is “disappointing.” It said it means local communities and landowners will miss out on the benefit of renewables, such as associated tax revenues and lease payments.
“Wind energy and solar energy have a long record of co-location with productive agricultural land use,” said the association. “CanREA will work with the government and the AUC to seek opportunities to continue these beneficial approaches.”
Alberta is at the forefront of Canadian renewables development. Figures from CanREA show that the province accounted for more than 92% of Canada’s overall growth in renewable energy and energy-storage capacity in 2023. It added 2.2 GW of installed renewables capacity last year, including 329 MW utility-scale solar and 24 MW of on-site solar.
CanREA said another 3.9 GW of projects with the potential to come online in 2025 are in the pipeline, alongside another 4.4 GW of proposed projects with later commissioning dates. But it warned that these are all now “at risk.”
Figures from the International Energy Agency show that at the end of 2022, Canada’s cumulative solar capacity hit 4.4 GW. Alberta had the second-most installations, at 1.3 GW, only exceeded by Ontario at 2.7 GW. The country has set a target of 35 GW of total solar capacity by 2050.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/01/debunking-solar-myths-what-about-nuclear/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,2024-03-01,Debunking solar myths: What about nuclear?,"‘Uncle Bob’ is that proverbial character who shares at family gatherings all he believes to be true about solar and why it just isn’t a good idea. Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker, has had this experience. Based on his 33 years in the solar industry, he offers short, fact-based responses to Uncle Bob’s assertions, which range from “solar is taking coal jobs” to “solar is unreliable”.
In this part three of the series, Shugar debunks myths about nuclear energy.
The proverbial Uncle Bob asks, “What about nuclear? That’s reliable runs all the time. Why don’t we do more of that?”
You could say, “Listen, Uncle Bob, there are things we like about nuclear. We know you don’t believe in global warming. But we like that nuclear is a zero-carbon option.”
Then explain that there are only two problems with nuclear. First, there’s radioactive waste, and second, it’s too expensive.
Let’s ignore the radioactive waste that is around for hundreds of years. Let’s talk about money.
A new nuclear plant today is about $180 a megawatt hour. A new solar plant today is $60 a megawatt hour. That’s about a third of the cost. And if you add batteries, it’s about $75 a megawatt hour. That’s well under half the cost rather than dollars per megawatt hour.
Now let’s just talk about money of real plants. When I started in my career, in 1985, the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant was just finishing the original budget of that plant was $380 million. And the plant was actually completed at five and a half billion dollars, half of PG&E’s net income was being absorbed by the interests of the plant.
In more modern history, the two Vogtle units, one of which is operational in Georgia and the other is supposed to come on online shortly, were under construction for over 10 years and had an original budget of about $14 billion. They came in at about $30 billion, which is very expensive.
Speaking as an environmentalist, I really hope nuclear can have a resurgence, including the modular nuclear power plant designs that have been under development for decades. But I want to underscore the bar keeps going up because solar and wind costs are going down. While reliability keeps improving nuclear power is just too expensive Uncle Bob.
Episode three: What about nuclear?…
We’ll continue this series with fact-based responses to additional myths such as: Solar takes too much land–there’s gonna be no room for farms if we have solar panels…
Stay tuned as we unpack these objections, so you’re ready for your next dinner party with Uncle Bob.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/01/module-prices-steady-as-market-mulls-price-hikes/,"COST AND PRICES,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,WORLD",,2024-03-01,Module prices steady as market mulls price hikes,"From pv magazine global
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for mono PERC modules from China was assessed at $0.110 per W, stable from the previous week while TOPCon module prices were flat at $0.119/W week to week. Prices have held steady for the seventh consecutive week as market participants adopt a wait-and-see approach for a clearer price trend to emerge.
Market sentiment was mixed. There were some talks in the market of possible domestic Chinese price increases of CNY0.03-0.05 ($0.042-0.069)/W in March but other market participants were uncertain if the price hikes would materialize given ample inventory in the market.
Other market participants attributed the possible price hikes to suppliers’ reluctance to accept orders at previously lower prices and the fast conversion of p-type to n-type in the market had resulted in a drop in P-type supply. “Cell makers had increased P-type prices before the Lunar New Year but did not increase n-type prices”, a market source said.
One seller held on to the view that any price increases in the Chinese market would be for p-type modules as production had reduced and that N-type modules could see some price declines. However, other market participants said this remains to be seen.
The outlook for March was improving with demand expected to recover in Q2-Q3 as overseas projects usually start construction after winter, while in China, module tenders are generally carried out in the first half of the year and construction in the second half of the year, a solar veteran said. The Chinese market will see 30-40% of demand in the first half of the year, with most of the demand concentrated in the second half of the year, the veteran added.
Module makers are expected to increase their operating rates as demand improves in the coming weeks. China is expected to produce more than 50 GW of modules in March, according to the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/01/baltimore-gas-and-electric-installs-battery-storage-system-to-manage-winter-peaks/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARYLAND",KAVYA BALARAMAN,2024-03-01,Baltimore Gas and Electric installs battery storage system to manage winter peaks,"Maryland’s largest utility, Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE), has turned to a 2.5 MW/9.74 MWh battery energy storage system to meet high electricity demand during the winter months in Fairhaven, located just south of Annapolis.
The battery system, which is installed at the Fairhaven substation near Chesapeake Bay and began operating in November, is built largely with Hitachi Energy products. It has two battery containers with 48 racks of lithium-ion batteries, the company said, as well as a control system and two new distribution transformers. 
The Fairhaven energy storage system was installed to solve a very specific reliability challenge in BGE’s footprint – unlike the rest of Maryland, which tends to see peak electricity demand during the summer, Fairhaven experiences a winter peak due to the usage of electric heaters. Because of this, the area’s total electricity load sometimes topped the capacity of the 34.5kV line in the region. 
The new storage system helps address that issue by absorbing energy during times of low electricity demand and then discharging it back to the grid when demand increases. The battery system also allowed BGE to avoid the costs of upgrading some 10 miles of electric distribution infrastructure, according to Hitachi. And after the winter months, when it’s most needed, it can also participate in regional transmission organization PJM’s footprint.
“Participating in these sorts of markets can also help companies align with broader energy goals. Battery projects like the Fairhaven BESS contribute to grid stabilization, offering rapid response capabilities that are crucial for balancing supply and demand,” a Hitachi Energy spokesperson told pv magazine USA. 
More broadly, energy storage plays an important role in ensuring reliability throughout different U.S. markets, including the PJM region, which includes 65 million people spread across 13 states and the District of Columbia, the spokesperson said. 
“As the energy landscape evolves, the strategic deployment of [battery energy storage] technologies not only optimizes existing infrastructure but also fosters a resilient grid capable of adapting to changing demands, unforeseen events such as extreme weather, and the increasing prominence of renewable energy sources,” they added. 
Maryland is aiming to deploy 3,000 MWh of energy storage resources by 2033, and the Fairhaven project is part of this goal, per the 2019 Maryland Energy Storage Pilot Project Act. BGE also deployed a separate battery project in the region – a 1 MW/2 MWh battery located in Chesapeake Beach – in January, 2023, also aimed at shifting energy to times when electricity demand is highest, especially in the winter months. 
Both residential and grid-scale energy storage installations are growing across the U.S. A recent report from Wood Mackenzie and American Clean Power Association (ACP) found that the industry installed 13.5 GWh of storage in the first three quarters of 2023, compared to 12 GWh for all of 2022. This figure that could have been much higher, were it not for some 80% of projects in the pipeline being delayed.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/01/achieving-compatibility-between-solar-project-developers-and-mineral-estate-holders/,"BUSINESS,GUEST POST,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,2024-03-01,Achieving compatibility between solar project developers and mineral estate holders,"Texas and California lead the country in terms of solar energy generating capacity, while also maintaining major oil and gas production operations, which demonstrates that it is possible for these uses to successfully coexist, even if doing so can be complicated.
As solar energy projects cover almost the entire surface of the land that they utilize with solar panels, it is necessary to understand the rights of the mineral estate holders to utilize the surface, especially in areas with historical and current oil and gas production.. Any compatibility issues with the mineral estate holder(s) need to be addressed before a solar energy project can be constructed and financed.
Understanding the rights of the subsurface estate
When the mineral and surface estates are held separately in Texas, the subsurface owner has a right to use as much of the surface as is reasonably necessary to produce and remove the oil, gas and/or minerals below the surface. Similarly, in California, mineral estate owners are permitted to use the surface as is necessary and convenient to produce and remove the oil, gas and/or minerals below the surface. However, mineral estate owners in both states are generally not permitted to impose a greater burden on the surface estate than reasonably necessary for the mineral estate owner to fully exercise their rights. These standards have proved difficult to interpret and apply with predictability in practice, which causes uncertainty about how a surface owner’s and subsurface owner’s rights might intersect in a specific situation.
For any solar energy project, the solar developer must understand: (1) whether the mineral estate has been severed and who holds title, (2) the magnitude and nature of the risks related to possible surface use by the mineral estate and, (3) if there are risks, how to reduce those risks and/or obtain title insurance satisfactory to insure against the risk of forced removal of solar facilities.
Determining rights in the subsurface estate
Title companies will provide information and insurance for the ownership of the surface estate, but generally will not provide vesting information or insurance for the subsurface/mineral estate. Accordingly, project developers typically have to look to a “landman” to search the real property records to establish ownership of the mineral estate underlying the solar project lands.
Landmen, sometimes in conjunction with legal counsel, can help project developers obtain surface waiver agreements, surface use and/or accommodation agreements, and mineral estate purchase agreements to help procure a financeable project site with sufficiently secure surface rights.
Surface waiver and accommodation agreements
An effective surface rights waiver will prohibit the mineral interest holder, and its successors and assigns, from disturbing the surface of the solar project site. When possible, surface rights waivers should be absolute, waiving all rights of the mineral owner to use the surface of the property—including for exploration, testing, and general access—not just production. In addition, it should waive the right to use the surface to access any mineral or subsurface material, not just oil and gas. In order to fully bind sublessees, successors, and future grantees, a waiver of surface rights must also be recorded in the real property records.
When a mineral estate owner is unwilling to entirely waive its rights to the surface of the property, an alternative is to utilize an accommodation agreement that (1) sets aside certain areas on the property which are reserved for oil, gas and minerals activities, (2) includes a surface waiver from the mineral estate holder for the benefit of the surface owner on the remainder of the property, and (3) contains other agreements designed to allow the parties to share the use of the surface estate.
Alternatives to surface waivers or accommodation agreements
Ideally, a developer should obtain surface waivers or accommodation agreements from 100% of the mineral interest holders, but if this is not possible, a project developer should not despair.  Many oil and gas producers are unwilling to take mineral leases or develop minerals based on a lease from only a small, fractional mineral owner. As a result, it is often sufficient to obtain surface waivers or accommodation agreements from less than 100% of the mineral interest holders. While there is no established standard agreed to by title companies and attorneys in the industry as to what percentage of the mineral interest surface waivers is required to be sufficient, it is universally agreed that sufficient does not mean 100%.  In this situation, the developer may also pursue other strategies to ensure that it holds secure rights to the surface of the project site and obtain the title insurance it needs.
Title insurance related to mineral rights risk
Title insurance covering the mineral risk issue will be required in order to obtain construction financing for a project. Texas has four different types of promulgated title insurance endorsements to address mineral issues when a title insurance company issues a lender’s or owner’s title policy with an exception or exclusion for mineral estate coverage: Forms T-19, T-19.1, T-19.2 and T-19.3. In California, the ALTA Form 35 endorsements (ALTA 35, 35.1, 35.2, 35.3) are typically used to address mineral issues.
Note also that these endorsements insure against some of the losses that a solar energy project owner or lender may be exposed to related to the mineral estate, such as coverage for the value of the real estate rights and improvements lost if mineral development forces the solar project operator to relocate or remove solar facilities. However, the endorsements don’t provide coverage for the revenues and profits the project may lose as a result of the forced removal, or for project downtime or other business-related aspects of the project. Other forms of commercial insurance may be available to address such risks.
