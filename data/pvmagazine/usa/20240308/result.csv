Cumulative solar capacity stood at 177 GW by the end of the year, and utility-scale solar alone added 22.5 GW, a record year.
Solar has been on an upswing across the nation, with more than half the states with 1 GW of total installed solar capacity.
The industry has been lifted in part by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a largest-ever spending package for climate and energy. The legislation contains numerous provisions to support the U.S. solar industry, among other clean energy technologies, including a long-term extension of the federal investment tax credit, significant domestic manufacturing incentives, labor standards, energy production tax credits and more.
Since passage of the IRA, over $240 billion has been invested in clean energy manufacturing and infrastructure projects, according to a White House report. This includes over $86 billion invested in nearly 300 new solar, wind, and battery energy storage projects.
Tracking this growth, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released rankings for the top five states in terms of solar deployment across sectors.

Ohio ranked fifth in solar deployment, increasing its installation totals year-over-year by 1,230%, with 1.3 GW installed. The state has 3 GW across 20 projects in the pipeline for development.

Colorado ranked within the top five for the first time since 2010, with 1.6 GW installed. This is nearly ten times the total installed in 2022.

Florida maintained its spot as number three in solar deployment for the fifth year straight, adding a record 3.2 GW in 2023. Over 50,000 residents installed rooftop solar on their homes last year, and nearly half of Florida’s 220,000 residential solar arrays were installed in the last two years.

California ranked second, adding 6.2 GW of new solar. However, California Public Utilities Commission have significantly damaged California’s rooftop solar sector. In total, the state’s solar market is expected to decline 36% across all market segments in 2024, said SEIA.

Texas has moved to the front for solar installations, adding 6.5 GW in 2023. The 15 GW added since 2021 was more than the entire solar cumulative total installed in the United States in 2019.
“From 2024-2034, Texas will lead the nation with nearly 100 GW of new solar capacity additions, outpacing the next closest state by a two-to-one margin,” said SEIA.

This includes over $86 billion invested in nearly 300 new solar, wind and battery energy storage projects, according to a recent report from Intersolar North America and Energy Storage North America. In addition, over 170,000 direct jobs have been created since IRA and the Intersolar report forecasts as many as 1.5 million new jobs in clean energy can be expected by 2030.

Battery prices tumble: From July 2023 through summer 2024, battery cell pricing is expected to plummet by over 60% due to a surge in EV adoption and grid expansion in China and the U.S. Driven by these price declines, grid-tied energy storage deployment has seen robust growth over the past decade, a trend that is expected to continue into 2024. The U.S. is projected to nearly double its deployed battery capacity by adding more than 14 GW of hardware this year alone.
Another California misstep: California missed another opportunity when the California Public Utilities Commission asserting in its proposed decision on the Community Renewable Energy Act that the Net Value Billing Tariff outlined in the Act “conflicts with federal law and does not meet the requirements” of the bill. Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA, a national trade association and the bill’s sponsor, said the CPUC missed an opportunity to become a national leader in community solar.

IRS final guidance on elective pay for clean energy tax credits: The IRS issued its final guidance on the elective pay rules for clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act. The guidance removes any temporary regulations and enacts the final rules. The IRS provided updated elective payment frequently asked questions, which includes a step-by-step guide on how to become eligible for direct pay or credit transfers, and how to file these transactions.
New York bill would increase rooftop solar tax credit to $10,000:  Senate Bill S3596B aims to increase the maximum state income tax credit for those who install residential solar projects at their residence. Since 2006, New York’s Solar Tax Credit has been capped at $5,000 per household installing solar. The new bill would double that cap to $10,000, allowing customers to offset state income taxes with a credit. For eligible low- to moderate-income residents, the tax credit would also be available to be collected as a tax refund.

Massachusetts expands net metering: Bucking the national trend of squashing net energy metering, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts instead expanded access, showing a commitment to distributed energy. It used to have an exemption for small systems of 10 kW or less, but this cap is now lifted to 25 kW, and behind the meter systems over 60 kW, and up to 2 MW are now exempt from the cap. The Department of Public Utilities expects to save ratepayers $10 million with the regulatory change.

Canadian solar simulator developer G2V Optics and Sinton Instruments, a US-based PV characterization specialist, have created a solar simulator for solar cells and modules.
The new instrument supports both characterization and a Class AAA light in a single tool. It is designed to test all solar cell technologies, but with a focus on perovskite-silicon tandem cells and encapsulated mini-modules. It contains a fully programmable and tunable spectrum steady-state LED light combined with Sinton Instruments’ solar cell testing hardware and advanced characterization analysis software.
Named FCT-650SE, the instrument has a multi-source LED solar simulator with up to 36 tunable channels for spectrum control, integrated current versus voltage (IV) curve recording, and Suns-Voc measurement capability. It can perform both flash and continuous lighting tests. Also supported are maximum power point tracking (MPPT), light soaking, and automated measurement sequences.
Some of the supported tests and measurements include full IV curve, short circuit current, open circuit voltages, maximum power point, fill factor, efficiency, series resistance, shunt resistance, and Suns-Voc. For silicon devices, it can also measure bulk lifetime, lifetime at max power, substrate doping, substrate thickness, and power loss analysis.
The system has a footprint of approximately 4,645 cm2, which the manufacturer said is on par or slightly more compact than other solar simulators with similar illumination areas.
Its voltage and current range are 40 V and 20 A for silicon and 2.4 A for perovskite tandem devices. The temperature-controlled chuck can accommodate samples that range in size from 2 mm2 to 210 mm2. Custom chuck designs for unusual sizes are available from the manufacturer.
The testing instrument is available from both companies. Several units have already been built and delivered to customers, according to the manufacturers.

Electric vehicles are the dominant driver of demand, and both home energy storage and grid-scale batteries are expected to contribute as well.
A report from Clean Energy Associates (CEA) outlined that by 2025, global manufacturing of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells is expected to triple from 2022 levels. It said the U.S. is expected to produce more battery cells than the European Union, largely due to incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
“The IRA attracted outsized investments in domestic cell production capacity with $35 per kWh tax credit available and bolstered by an additional $10 per kWh tax credit for assembled modules,” said the report.
CEA is a manufacturing quality assurance firm with insight into global battery energy storage systems supply chains. Its Q4 2023 report focuses on emerging trends in this space.
While the U.S. and Europe have a sizeable share of the global LIB battery production supply chain, it is still heavily dominated by China, said the report.
CEA said the U.S. has taken an “aggressive approach” to LIB supply chain expansion, offering a “raft of incentives” via the Inflation Reduction Act. However, upstream legs of the supply chain take a long time to set up, with brine mining, refinement, separators, and more requiring considerable time to reach operations. CEA said western markets need “a sense of urgency” if supply chain diversification is a desired goal.
CEA said collapsing lithium prices has led to a cooling-off in demand for chemical alternatives to the mainstream nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) chemistries. This leads to a negative impact on commercialization for new technologies like sodium-ion batteries. However, CEA said more evolutionary chemistries like lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) may find their way into electric vehicles and energy storage sectors as early as 2025.
Growth in midstream production capacity is helping push cost reductions for LIB cells, said the report. Cathode active materials and anode active materials are being produced with increasing capacity, lowering the overall cost of batteries.
The report said that supply chain growth is outpacing demand as major economies aim public policy at localization of battery cell and cell subcomponent production assets.
A report from Goldman Sachs forecasts a 40% reduction in battery pack prices over 2023 and 2024, followed by a continued decline to reach a total 50% reduction by 2025-2026. Goldman predicts that these price reductions will make electric vehicles as affordable as gasoline-powered vehicles, leading to increased demand.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/08/polysilicon-prices-further-decouple-adverse-factors-thwart-contract-negotiations/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,2024-03-08,"Polysilicon prices further decouple, adverse factors thwart contract negotiations","The Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), the OPIS benchmark for polysilicon outside China, was assessed at $24.25/kg this week, down $0.55/kg, or 2.22% from the previous week, reflecting buy-sell indications heard.
According to market sources, conversations regarding contract negotiations between buyers and certain non-Chinese polysilicon vendors have encountered challenges. It has been reported that there are disagreements between the buyer and seller regarding certain aspects of the new long-term contract, as stated by an integrated player.
According to a China-based source, the pricing mechanism is considered the most challenging aspect of long-term contracts for both buyers and sellers to agree upon. The source further explained that disputes may arise between the parties regarding whether the pricing mechanism should be linked to the fluctuations in Chinese polysilicon prices.
An industry veteran has highlighted the high manufacturing costs as another major obstacle for the operation of polysilicon producers outside of China. The insider explained that the production cost for polysilicon manufactured outside of China has risen to a range between $15 and over $20. Factors contributing to this increase include global inflation and the growing trend of certain firms purchasing metal silicon from sources outside of China.

China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon prices in the country were assessed at CNY61.25 ($8.52)/kg, up CNY0.58/kg, or 0.96% from the previous week amid a rise in wafer producers’ demand for p-type polysilicon.
As per an upstream source, the product quality of certain polysilicon manufacturers, particularly the newer ones, has reached a stable level. Consequently, wafer producers have augmented their procurement of premium p-type polysilicon and blended them with n-type polysilicon to generate n-type wafers, thereby reducing production costs.
To produce n-type wafers, it is technically required that the metal impurities in the n-type polysilicon do not exceed 0.5 parts per billion by weight (ppbw). However, in practice, wafer producers usually blend n-type polysilicon in a specific ratio with polysilicon that contains metal impurities up to 10 ppbw, the source added.
The increase in production costs, primarily manifested by the rise in power prices, has played a role in driving up the price of polysilicon in China. A market observer asserts that Yunnan and Sichuan, which are home to several significant polysilicon factories, have seen an increase in electricity prices due to their low hydropower output during the current dry season.
Nevertheless, the duration of the rising polysilicon pricing trend in the domestic market of China is uncertain. A market participant notes that the sales volume of polysilicon for the previous week was moderate, suggesting that there is still a divergence of opinion between buyers and sellers regarding the pricing of polysilicon for the upcoming round. Furthermore, polysilicon factories currently hold approximately 80,000 MT of inventory, equivalent to approximately two weeks’ worth of production. It is important to note that this figure does not include the stock of polysilicon held by wafer companies.
According to this source, the present circumstances place a lot of strain on the new polysilicon players. This source further mentioned that a brand-new, 100,000 MT polysilicon project, whose construction had begun in February last year, was recently found to have been put on hold midway through. In addition, the producer of a 50,000 MT polysilicon project, which commenced production in June of last year, is presently seeking buyers; however, the process was said to have encountered some difficulties.
As per a market expert specializing in the polysilicon segment, it is projected that polysilicon prices will likely remain around the current level until June. However, as production of polysilicon intensifies in the second half of the year, prices are expected to decrease again, potentially falling within the range of CNY50 to CNY55/kg. At this point, there may be a possibility of certain capacities being phased out.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The testing of the drive system was performed according to the Accelerated Mechanical Cycling section of the IEC 62817 standard, GameChange reported. This standard ensures that testing for things like water ingress, cracks, loose screws, etc., is consistent and follows standard industry procedures, which result in a pass/fail criterion.
The company performed its testing at an outdoor site in Brimfield, Mass., where it put the drive systems through accelerated testing, simulating 40 years of continuous movement.
GameChange said the testing demonstrates that the Genius Tracker drive system will hold up to 40-years of trusted performance, resulting in reduced maintenance costs and a lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The Genius Tracker drive system is self-contained and is designed to need no greasing over its lifetime.
“Traditional drives that require regular greasing increase maintenance expenses,” said Derick Botha, chief commercial officer at GameChange Solar. “Testing of our Genius Tracker drive system indicates that its design significantly reduces, and possibly eliminates, the need for any greasing throughout its design life. This feature improves the cost savings that our Genius Tracker product provides to customers.”
GameChange recently announced its expansion to 35 GW of annual U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity for key components. This is an increase of 11 GW from its output in 2023.
To date the company reports it has delivered over 26 GW of solar tracker and fixed tilt systems. For example, Catalyze, a national independent power producer, completed two solar projects in Lancaster, New York that use GameChange trackers. The installations, one of which is a community solar project, sit on a 197-acre decommissioned landfill in Erie County, New York.

A warm end to winter hit most of North America this February. In the west, during February mild air from the Pacific banked up clouds and depressed irradiance by 10-20%, according to analysis completed using the Solcast API. In the east, persistent high pressure in the upper atmosphere led to irradiance as high as 30% above normal, and new records for solar generation and temperature.

A clear east/west divide is present in the irradiance anomaly this month. A strong low pressure system sat further east than normal over the Atlantic which brought calm, drier and sunny conditions to the Eastern U.S. and Mexico. Sunnier than normal conditions delivered 20-30% more irradiance than normal from Texas to New England. On the west coast however, high pressure was further west over the Pacific, so that coastal low pressure systems pulled moist air from equatorial regions, leading to increased clouds, blocking irradiance.
Clear skies and higher than normal irradiance will have benefited both large and small scale, solar producers. Residential ‘behind the meter’ solar performed strongly this February all over the East Coast. Solcast’s Grid Aggregation model for NYISO shows residential solar peaked at 3.52GW, and saw 23% more solar generation than last year after adjusting for capacity increases. By contrast, CAISO’s residential solar generation was down 12% on the long term capacity-adjusted average.

Utility-scale generation in ERCOT also hit and surpassed their generation peak record, hitting 17.2GW on February 20th. A 50.1% increase in peak generation in February 2023, is mostly a function of capacity increases in the last year.
But it wasn’t just grid performance breaking recent records, temperature records were broken across the country, with the average temperature, more than 4 degrees above normal. Killeen in Texas saw a peak temperature of 38 C (100 F), and Jacaranda trees in Mexico City have been in full bloom all month, 6-8 weeks earlier than normal. Despite the heat further south, areas in Eastern Canada saw significant snowfall caused by a low pressure system stalling over the area, drawing in continuous cold air from the Atlantic. This caused one of the heaviest snowfall events in 20 years, blanketing parts of Nova Scotia with more than a meter of snow.
This extreme weather is reflective of an overall pattern being seen globally, as February 2024 was Earth’s warmest month on record for the 9th consecutive month.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

An international research team led by Germany’s Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg has built a large area organic photovoltaic (OPV) panel with a world record efficiency of 14.5%.
The result was certified by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE). For the same module type, the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg achieved an efficiency of 14.46% in December 2023. That result was a jump up from the previous record of 13.1 % recorded for a 57-cell encapsulated module by Taiwan-based OPV specialist, Ways Technical Corporation (Waystech) and Nanobit.
The module relies on 216 individual 4 mm² solar cells. The devices were built with a substrate based on glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on zinc oxide (ZnO), an absorber made of an organic material known as PM6:Y6-C12:PC61BM, a hole transport layer (HTL) relying on the polymer PEDOT-F, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The group used P1, P2, and P3 laser scribing for building the monolithic interconnections that add voltages between cells in modules. It constructed a module with a size of 143 mm × 143 mm and an active area of 204.11 cm².
The scientists said that, in the cell-to-module scaling up process, there were lower resistive losses thanks to an accelerated blade coating technique that reportedly enabled homogeneous coatings with a thickness deviation of less than 5%. The ETL, the absorber, and the HTL were all blade-coated from non-halogenated solvents in ambient air.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the module achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 15.1% and a fill factor of 76.0%, which the scientists said is the same as that of the individual solar cells used in the panel.
These results should appear soon in the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) champion PV module efficiency chart. “This work presents cutting-edge upscaling research on OPVs that aims at closing the efficiency gap between high-performance cells and modules,” the researchers said.
The new OPV module was presented in the paper “Large-area organic photovoltaic modules with 14.5% certified world record efficiency,” published in Joule. The research team comprised academics from Germany’s Nuremberg Institute of Technology, Canada-based OPV material supplier Brilliant Matters, and China’s Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
