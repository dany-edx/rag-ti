With new projects supported by state and federal incentives and a higher frequency of extreme weather comes an increased premium for insurance protection.
NARDAC Insurance Services, a Newport Beach, California insurance underwriter, announced the launch of its Community Solar platform, an online platform for insuring commercial and industrial-scale solar photovoltaic sites such as community solar projects across the U.S.
Retail clients can access quote and bind to insure “middle market” U.S. commercial and industrial solar projects with limits on replacement cost of $2 million to $20 million per project site location, the company said.
NARDAC’s online platform generates quotes from uploaded underwriting information for each solar site. Initially, operational risks and business interruption coverages will be offered, with plans to expand coverages through 2024, said Hannah Webb, underwriting partner at NARDAC.

“We have designed an efficient solution to underwrite an under-served market segment that is full of entrepreneurial insureds, while lowering the barrier to entry for insurers seeking to actively support the energy transition,” said Jatin Sharma, managing partner, NARDAC. “This innovation will disrupt the U.S. commercial and industrial solar insurance market.”
Insurance products for distributed generation and utility-scale solar have been few and far between since the August 2022 passing of the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, providing a vast gap of coverage for novel products to protect new solar installations. kWh Analytics launched a put insurance product early this year for primarily the utility-scale solar segment.
The lack of insurance products comes amid a heightened frequency of natural catastrophe (NATCAT) losses. According to global insurer SwissRe, insured NATCAT losses were at least 42% higher in 2022 compared to the 10-year average. Losses from Hurricane Ian in September 2022 alone accounted for roughly half of the $115 billion in insured losses for the year.
In the U.S., demand for new renewable energy projects is concentrated largely on the east and west coasts, which coincides with the most severe weather events such as wildfires in the west and hurricanes along the east coast. Financing such projects in more constrained land areas has proven to be more difficult and requiring new insurance and other solutions for assets whose contractual lifetime is often 20 or more years, the company said.
Project finance lending structures are risk averse. According to BloombergNEF, in 2021 around $50 billion was invested in U.S. renewables. Assuming half the financing structure was equity financed, that leaves $25 billion of exposed assets. With a 70% shareholder equity to debt ratio for projects, this leaves leaves lenders to absorb up around $18 billion in annual risk.
Lenders will seek full-limit insurance policies where possible. NARDAC says the reality is that insurers are more reluctant than ever to give full-limit coverage for exposed projects. When full-limit is unavailable, the company’s insurance products can structure standalone NATCAT solutions to bridge the gap.
Formed in August 2020, NARDAC is an employee-owned brokerage firm whose management team has insured 150 GW of renewables assets at previous firms GCube Insurance Services, Lloyds London Insurance and Willis Ltd., as well as project developer Bechtel.
The company’s Community Solar underwriting platform is led by Canopius Syndicate 4444 with a panel of A-rated Lloyd’s and Company Market issuance capacity. Syndicate 4444 is an insurance company managed by Canopius Managing Agents Limited, the ninth-largest global managing agent.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/11/solar-carport-boosts-renting-appeal-for-california-research-center/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 11, 2023",Solar carport boosts renting appeal for California research center,"Commercial real estate owner H&S Properties engaged SolarEdge to install a solar carport and rooftop array on a research and development campus in Redwood City, California. The facility is expected to lower on-site costs for electricity and cut carbon emissions, making the research center a more attractive location for businesses looking to cut costs and environmental impact.
The 623 kW system is expected to offset 78% of the research center’s total energy use and provide its four tenants a 10% discount of electricity. The SolarEdge DC-optimized system is forecast to produce 950,000 kWh each year. MYNT Systems installed the array.
“For building owners, the biggest issue keeping them up at night is the thought of properties lying vacant. Providing access to sustainable, lower-cost energy is incredibly appealing to prospective tenants,” said Robert Hymes, chief development officer, MYNT Systems.
The solar installation features 1,299 bifacial solar modules attached to SolarEdge power optimizers, two DC-optimized SolarEdge inverters, and a battery for energy storage. The optimizers help boost production by overcoming traditional string inverter related issues in shading, module degradation and soiling. The optimizers also enable design flexibility around module layout and placement, getting more productive area out of the rooftop and carport space.
The SolarEdge system is able to monitor each pair of modules independently and in real time. This approaches the monitoring and operational granularity of microinverters, which can monitor each individual module, but retains the string inverter level of conversion efficiency. Conversion efficiency is typically a percentage point or two higher than its microinverter counterparts.
The granular view into module production helps identify any potential issues with the system, leading to fast repair responses and limited downtime, said SolarEdge.
For the real estate owner, this translates to a more attractive long-term cost for electricity, sweetening the pot for both the property owner and tenant. It also helps to boost the value of the property, while being exempt from increased property taxes in most states.
“Solar is much more than a technology that reduces energy bills – for [commercial real estate companies] it actually provides an opportunity to increase the value of their buildings,” said Hymes.
“When speaking with clients, we tend to talk less about kW per hour production and more about the impact solar has on rental prices and tenant retention,” he said. “Our clients are not solar experts, but they understand those metrics very well. By speaking the industry’s language, we are able to convey the advantages of solar power to a much wider audience.”

SEG Solar has unveiled a new all-black solar module based on n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPcon) technology. The Yukon 108-cell modules feature M10 (182 mm) n-type TOPCon cells.
SEG Solar is offering four versions of the panels, with power outputs ranging from 425 W to 440 W. The efficiency ratings range from 21.76% to 22.53%. The open-circuit voltage is between 38.70 V and 39.15 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.91 A and 14.13 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panels measure 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 20.5 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and 1.6 mm semi-tempered glass. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and an operating temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
“The Yukon TOPCon Black Diamond Series module features an innovative 1.6mm lightweight glass material, reducing weight by approximately 15% compared to conventional 2.0mm modules,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 30-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0%. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
The manufacturer currently produces its panels at factories in Vietnam and Indonesia. It is also planning a 2 GW TOPCon module manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas.

Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed a new electrolyte additive that may prove to be a breakthrough for flow batteries, boosting both capacity and longevity. Using a simple sugar that is used in food additives and pharmacological applications, the PNNL researchers were able to achieve a 60% boost in peak power in a research flow battery.
The additive, called β-cyclodextrin, is able to speed the electrochemical reaction that stores and releases the flow battery’s energy. The sugar is able to catalyze the reaction as a dissolved solution, rather than a solid applied to a surface, which is a first for flow batteries, according to the results published in Joule.
In the test battery, the sugar additive accepts positively charged protons, which helps balance out the movement of negative electrons as the battery discharges.
 
“This is a brand new approach to developing flow battery electrolyte,” said Wei Wang, PNNL battery researcher. “We showed that you can use a totally different type of catalyst designed to accelerate the energy conversion. And further, because it is dissolved in the liquid electrolyte it eliminates the possibility of a solid dislodging and fouling the system.”
The results are part of an effort to lower the amount of rare-earth minerals and toxic materials in battery energy storage. The researchers are hopeful the results are a step toward a more sustainable approach where chemicals can be synthesized in large amounts like in the pharmaceutical and food industries, rather than through heavy minerals mining.
In further research, the team is experimenting with other compounds that are similar to β-cyclodextrin, but smaller. Like adding honey to tea, the simple sugar makes the liquid thicker, which poses some complications for a flow-based system. However, the researchers found its catalytic benefits outweighed its viscosity drawbacks.
This research is part of a larger PNNL program to develop and test grid-scale energy storage technologies. The university is slated to open a Grid Storage Launchpad in 2024.

Sumitomo Electric, a unit of Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo Corp., has unveiled the results of tests on a vanadium redox flow battery system it deployed in 2017 at a facility owned by utility SDG&E in Bonita, near San Diego, California.
Sumitomo said that external experts collected data from the 2MW/8MWh Redox Flow Battery Demonstration Project until the end of 2021. A preliminary analysis conducted in December revealed that the battery system achieved a 99% operating rate in the final year of the project. Sumitomo believes that the battery system has the potential to retain a capacity rate of 90% or more for 20 years in the electricity market.

The experts assigned a rating of 2.6 out of three to the overall project results. Sumitomo said that the demonstration project successfully showcased the business feasibility of using storage battery technologies for electric power market bidding and the fundamental capabilities of redox flow batteries in microgrid applications. The battery operates within a microgrid, supplying power to 66 residential and commercial customers for approximately five hours.
Sumitomo and SDG&E set up a microgrid by integrating the battery into an electrical distribution network. This setup demonstrated the battery’s dual operation capability, allowing it to serve the wholesale electricity market under normal conditions and provide grid resilience during emergencies. The battery also features black start capability, enabling it to initiate and sustain service even after a complete power outage.
The project received support from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and California’s GO-Biz. Development of the project commenced in 2015. Sumitomo has already deployed 37 redox flow battery systems across multiple countries, with a total capacity of 47 MW/162 MWh.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/11/the-geotechnical-side-of-solar-installations/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"JULY 11, 2023",The geotechnical side of solar installations,"Under President Biden’s clean energy investment plan, the largest in U.S. history, the renewable energy sector is at a turning point. As part of the broad goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work toward making the country carbon neutral, the Biden administration has allocated substantial federal funding to accelerate the development and transition toward renewable energy solutions.
In response to the national directive, development and construction companies have begun responding by diversifying their portfolios to take on more renewable energy projects. As a result, solar is one area that’s booming in terms of demand, scale and impact. In fact, according to the Department of Energy, it’s become the country’s fastest-growing and most affordable source of new electricity.
Industrial-scale solar power plants include solar panels, electrical substations, battery storage, inverters, high-voltage transmission lines (above and below ground), roads, grading, and environmental impacts. All of these components make industrial solar projects challenging and increase the need for a trusted geotechnical consultant. Due to the scale and complexity of developing large-scale solar projects, high-quality, performance-based geotechnical recommendations are essential.
Geotechnical engineering
It is best to integrate the geotechnical engineer(s) into the project’s development and design team project, rather than simply bringing on a geotechnical consultant who provides a report. Leveraging the geotechnical consultant as a member of the development team leads to a more holistic approach to the design and construction of the solar project and allows them to provide valuable cost-saving advice and recommendations.
The geotechnical work for a solar project begins during site selection and the due diligence period. Geotechnology experts conduct site investigations using a combination of traditional exploration techniques (e.g., exploratory borings, test pits) and geophysical methods (e.g., refraction microtremor and/or seismic refraction surveys, electrical resistivity) to identify geological hazards, characterize the near and subsurface soils, provide a corrosivity assessment, and provide design recommendations. Unlike most geotechnical projects where one or a few foundations are required, hundreds of thousands of individual foundations may be required for utility-scale solar projects. It is this scale of these projects that warrants, if not requires, the geotechnical consultant to develop performance-based recommendations, identify value engineering opportunities, and integrate quality control/assurance aspects into the design.
The more refined and accurate the geotechnical work, the more optimized the design recommendations are, creating the opportunity to decrease material quantities and installation time — reducing the project cost. A geotechnical consultant who provides robust evidence-based performance recommendations can save a project hundreds of thousands of dollars.
For instance, I recently spearheaded a value engineering effort for the inner array roads of a large solar project, where additional geotechnical services resulted in a cost savings of more than 10 times the geotechnical service fee. Through the collaborative value engineering efforts between the ownership group, general contractor, and geotechnical consultants, the design-build general contractor turned the geotechnical consultants into a profit center. On another solar project, through additional pile load testing and reanalysis of the preliminary design recommendations, we were able to provide updated performance-based recommendations that resulted in saving the project greater than $200K in materials alone.
While the geotechnical work is vitally important for any project, solar projects present a unique opportunity for geotechnical consultants to take a holistic approach to design and construction. Through a comprehensive investigation, the geotechnology experts can, and should, add value for both the ownership and construction teams.
As the solar market continues to rapidly grow, renewable energy developers need geotechnology experts as part of their core teams to optimize a project’s safety, quality, longevity, and cost-effectiveness for continued success.
For an industry that is projected to continue booming as much as solar, especially amid current legislation, you need more than a geotechnical report. You need a geotechnical consultant willing to take a collaborative, holistic, performance-based approach to any project.

The proposal would set up a state-recognized and utility-supported community solar program allowing for widespread subscription to shared local solar projects by residents and small businesses.
Now Columbia, one of the state’s more progressive cities, has seen its utility formulate its own community solar framework ahead of the state’s next legislative session.
Municipal utility Columbia Water & Light (CW&L), which provides water and electric services to the city of Columbia’s near 129,000 residents, this week filed a new report that serves as framework to provide accessibility to locally-developed community solar.
The initial framework calls for CW&L to distribute solar energy using a net billing system from its first two projects in the municipality, Truman and Bernadette Fields, whose combined 1 MW of clean energy capacity from 10 MW of total capacity projects is divided into 1.5 kW blocks for residential customers.
The local program is providing 100 blocks representing about 15% of the city’s initial community solar platform to low-income eligible customers as well, according to the utility’s report. Further details of CW&L’s platform include:
Customers will be charged $25 in monthly fees to receive locally generated solar, which includes a fixed $14.23 solar subscription fee and a $10.77 utility operations fee, which may be adjusted over time at a variable rate. An additional one-time fee of $27 is required for application to the residential program.
Eligible low-income residents will not be required to pay the application fee, and will be charged a reduced fixed monthly solar subscription fee of $12.69 and $10.77 utility operations fee.
The Missouri municipal utility’s program estimates a standard $0.63 per month cost for a standard customers. The utility estimates low-income customer benefits of $27 in savings over the first seven months of participation, providing $0.91 in monthly electric bill savings in the first year of the program.
In 2022, the Columbia revised a 2004 ordinance, making a net zero pledge to become 100% renewable powered by December 2030. As of December 2022, CW&L purchased or generated 18.2% of its total electricity from renewable energy resources, of which wind (12.9%), landfill gas to energy (2.9%) and solar (2.3%) represented its renewable portfolio.
Statewide ambitions
Penned by Senator Bill White (R-Joplin), Missouri’s prior community solar legislation, SB 824, proposes the state would implement a community solar pilot program which run for a three-year phase, from 2023 through 2025. The legislation calls for electric utilities to honor the pilot program until the total solar demand from community program subscribers equals 2% of the electric utility’s sales for the previous year.
CW&L joins the state’s largest utility provider Ameren in providing shared access solar. To date, Ameren has offered local participation in a Lambert, Mo. 900 kW solar project and a 5.7 MW project in Montgomery County.

Last  year, APS released an RFP, and those projects, which will deliver just over 1 GW of solar and wind power combined, are expected to start next year. The energy generated will be enough to serve close to 160,000 Arizona homes. New energy storage projects with a capacity to store more than 1.4 GW of solar power are also planned.
“Our customers depend on us for top-quality service and we’re powering our state’s growth with our 2023 RFP and new clean energy projects coming online soon to continue to keep homes cool and electricity flowing to customers,” said Justin Joiner, vice president of resource management at APS.
This RFP is open to all technologies, including supply side and non-supply side resources. Of the 1 GW of resources, APS is seeking at least 700 MW of renewable resources. Proposed projects must be in service beginning in 2026 through 2028.
APS will use the PowerAdvocate platform to support the administration and evaluation of the RFP responses. The RFP is available to any entity that registers in PowerAdvocate and sets up an account. All RFP instructions, associated documents, instructions, and Q&A will also be available through the PowerAdvocate platform, and is also available here. The RFP process will be monitored and reviewed by a third-party independent monitor.
APS has a clean energy commitment that calls for 100% clean and carbon-free by 2050 , and that goal includes a nearer-term 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of its generation portfolio coming from renewable energy. APS has also announced its intention to exit from all coal-fired generation by 2031.
An example of its clean energy commitment, the 150 MW Agave Solar plant owned by APS, is expected to come online this summer and provide enough energy to power 24,000 Arizona homes. Agave features more than 400,000 First Solar modules installed on trackers from Nextracker. APS is also investing in energy storage and announced plans to add storage to the Agave plant.
APS, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, serves more than 1.3 million homes and businesses in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties. The utility reports that its current energy mix is 51% clean energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/11/meeting-prevailing-wage-and-apprenticeship-requirements/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 11, 2023",Meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements,"The upward trajectory of the solar industry in the United States brings new challenges, not the least of which is building a workforce. The challenge is not just finding workers, but preparing workers for the clean energy transition, but the opportunities are many.
The growing clean energy economy offers excellent career opportunities for displaced workers from fossil fuel industries, such as from shuttered coal plants. It also offers some opportunity for traditionally under-represented populations. New workforce-related requirements were put into place by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that aims to address training, pay, diversity and job development in underserved areas.
In the recent Intersolar webinar, Clean Energy Workforce Development, Bernice Diaz, labor & employment associate at Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP shed light on prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements added to the Internal Revenue Code, which she said has “substantially changed existing federal income tax benefits for renewable energy”.
Diaz explained that there is now a two-tiered system that provides a base credit equal to 20% of the maximum credit and an increased credit equal to an additional 80% that would be only available to taxpayers after certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied. In the past taxpayers were could receive the full amount of the tax credits without paying prevailing wage or employing the applicable number of apprentices.
Prevailing wage requirements are not new in the construction industry. As specified in the Davis Bacon Act, a federal law that stipulates that all laborers employed for the construction alteration or repair of certain federally funded or assisted contracts be paid the prevailing wage. Until now, clean energy projects did not have to abide by the Davis Bacon Act, but the IRA is effectively closing that loophole, according to Diaz, “by conditioning the majority of the tax credit on payment of prevailing wage and, and hiring a certain amount of apprenticeships.”
The guidance was published in the Federal Register on November 13, 2022, and projects that begin before January 29, 2023 are exempt from the requirements, Diaz noted. She added that “even without complying with those requirements, they’re able to take the full tax credit under the law”.
To satisfy the wage requirements, the taxpayer must not only pay the prevailing wage, but they must also “maintain and preserve sufficient records to substantiate that they did pay the prevailing wage rate,” said Diaz.
Prevailing wage differs by location, as it is determined by the Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division, which does surveys on local wages paid to laborers and mechanics in different areas across the country.
Apprenticeship
To meet apprenticeship requirements, taxpayers must ensure that, for construction that begins before January 1, 2023, at least 10% of labor is performed by qualified apprentices. This steps up to 12.5% for construction that begins after December 31, 2022, and before January 1, 2024. And then bumps up again to 15% for construction that begins after December 31, 2023. A taxpayer will be deemed to have met the requirement if the employer contacted a registered apprenticeship program for workers and the programe failed to respond within five business days.
California, which long has had one of the largest, solar markets in the country, has a growing need for a clean energy workforce. The need is further escalated by the state’s goal to be carbon neutral by 2045. Tyson Eckerle, senior advisor for clean infrastructure and mobility for Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, discussed on the webinar ways in which his office is supporting quality jobs and equity.
With a budget of $2.1 billion, his office focuses on jobs that combat climate change, assist, justice involved population and create opportunities to recruit, hire, train, in advance, ethnically and culturally inclusive workforce. “Our strategies include apprenticeship and hybrid training, partnerships and other earn to learn things,” he said.
With the giant caveat in the apprenticeship requirement that employers are exempt if they haven’t heard back from a program, the California Office of Business and Econonic Development wants to make sure that that doesn’t happen. “We’re trying to make sure that there is when a company does reach out for apprenticeships and apprentices that those apprentices are there, they’ve been trained, they’re ready, they’re ready to go,”,according to Eckerle.
Part of the agency’s strategy is to bring together major stakeholder groups to try to solve the problems today, Eckerle said, noting that there are really four pillars of the market: vehicles, infrastructure, users and workforce. “If we’re short on workforce, we won’t have the infrastructure needed to enable the vehicles and end users to be successful,” he said, adding that, “Our labor agency is laser focused on making sure that we are creating the job training and opportunities and connecting those opportunities to the market.”
Apprenticeship programs are popping up across the country, rising up to meet the projected need for workers. Another webinar panelist, Jeffrey Clary, senior director of climate strategies at the Foundation for California Community Colleges spoke about how partnerships with community can be a catalyst for clean energy workforce development. For example, solar developer Sunation recently partnered with the Suffolk County Community College in New York to train a clean energy workforce on Long Island. Its inaugural class started in the fall semester of 2022, working toward completion of the solar installer Certificate Program that features an entry-level solar curriculum coupled with a paid externship and job interview process upon graduation of the 50-hour program.
“Community colleges really are some of the foundations of professional training in this nation,” Clary said. He noted that there are about 1100 community colleges in the country; 116 of which are in California, making up a total of 1.8 million students. Combined, he said it’s the largest higher education institution in United States, possibly in the world. One key difference between community colleges and other instututions of higher learning is that community colleges accept all applicants. “We work with everybody and help them get on their professional track to get where they want to go,” said Clary.
Clean energy training through community colleges has a number of advantages, according to Clary. They’re one of the biggest pools for a potential workforce. They are training students who live in the communities where they will work. They also tend to be locally governed, Clary said, making them able to respond to regional economic conditions. There are also mechanisms in place for partnerships with companies that are in need of trained workers.
Implementation
Many questions remain about the apprenticeship requirements, and Diaz acknowledged that additional guidance is needed on many fronts. For example, questions remain about the “good faith exemption” for companies that have unsuccessfully reached out to an apprenticeship program. There are also questions about what determines whether an apprenticeship program is “registered.” Diaz said that state programs are supposed to be approved by the Department of Labor under the Fitzgerald Act, but would an employer receive credit if a program is not registered? And, last but not least, the big looming question is whether there will be enough people seeking training in order to join the clean energy workforce. With a trend away from skilled labor jobs, a new challenge emerges.
