Emissions from the electricity sector remained stable in the first half of 2023, increasing by just 0.2% (equivalent to more than 12 million tons of CO2) from the same period the previous year, according to UK consultancy Ember.
The most significant reductions in emissions were observed in the European Union, followed by Japan, the United States, and South Korea. The reductions were primarily due to decreased coal generation, particularly in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea.
Ember said that achieving “peak” fossil emissions in the electricity sector is a critical milestone in the transition to a clean, electrified economy. The report noted that accelerating the deployment of wind and solar energy will be essential to achieving a rapid decline in emissions this decade.
Ember said the primary measure governments can take to put the world on a 1.5 C path is to triple global renewable capacity by 2030. In the first half of 2023, wind and solar were the only two sources of electricity that significantly increased their share of the global electricity supply, rising to 14.3% from 12.8% the previous year. However, their generation growth was slower compared to the same period in 2022, with solar increasing by 16% (compared to 26% in the first half of 2022).
In the first half of 2023, 50 countries achieved new monthly records for solar generation, with China leading in solar generation growth, followed by the European Union, the United States, and India.
Wind energy grew by 10% in the first half of 2023, compared to 16% in the same period in 2022.
Despite these gains, fossil generation increased slightly to compensate for the hydroelectricity deficit (-8.5%, or -177 TWh). According to Ember, emissions from the electricity sector would have decreased by 2.9% if global hydro generation had remained at the same level as the previous year.
However, lower electricity demand helped limit further global emissions growth, with global electricity demand increasing by only 0.4% in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year. This is significantly lower than the average annual growth rate of 2.6% between 2012 and 2022. High-income economies, including Japan, the European Union, the United States, and South Korea experienced a decline in demand, leading to lower fossil fuel consumption. In contrast, India saw demand growth of 3.1%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/11/perch-energy-raises-30m-to-expand-community-solar/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 11, 2023",Perch Energy raises $30M to expand community solar,"Perch Energy announced a $30 million investment from Nuveen, a real estate investment manager. The partnership will provide Perch with access to Nuveen’s portfolio of affordable housing units and residential apartments, a target market for community solar subscribers.
Boston-based Perch, formerly BlueWave Solar, is a company that offers community solar subscriber acquisition and management services to community solar asset owners.
Nuveen is the $1.1 trillion asset manager of TIAA and one of the world’s largest real estate investment managers. The Series B growth investment will help Perch expand its clean energy technology platform by funding expansion into new sales channels, products and community solar markets.
“Nuveen’s financial and strategic support comes at a pivotal moment which will not only accelerate Perch’s growth and clear focus on supporting our solar developer clients, but will create opportunities for consumers of all economic backgrounds to join in on clean energy savings, especially the millions of people who can’t afford or don’t have a home suitable for rooftop panels,” said Bruce Stewart, Perch Energy president and CEO.
Community solar is especially applicable for those in affordable housing or for those who do not own their own homes because it enables them to reap the benefits of clean energy (including lower and/or stable electricity rates), without the upfront costs of going solar.
And the market for community is flourishing. For example, in August, pv magazine USA reported that the community solar market in the U.S. would add at least 7 GWdc of generation capacity in existing markets over the next five years, based on a report by analyst Wood Mackenzie and the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).
Perch currently provides acquisition and management services for more than 140 active community solar projects owned by developers and asset owners, and it reports that it has more than 740 MW)of contracted capacity in its operating portfolio and backlog. Following its launch and Series A closing in early 2022, Perch reports that it has doubled the number of clients and markets it serves while expanding with current clients.
Perch Energy said that combining its project pipeline with Nuveen’s established real estate portfolio will help get community solar to more households who stand to benefit most.
“Community solar is key to providing a renewable energy option to those Americans who do not have access to rooftop solar,” said Radhika Shroff, Managing Director, Private Equity Impact at Nuveen. “We are excited to bring our impact expertise and broader Nuveen platform to Perch to provide inclusive access to solar energy for households. Our investment in Perch is emblematic of our focus on investing in companies that deliver both financial returns to our investors as well as an inclusive transition to a low carbon economy.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/11/swedish-battery-manufacturer-to-open-factory-in-canada/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,CANADA",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"OCTOBER 11, 2023",Swedish battery manufacturer to open factory in Canada,"Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt announced plans to develop a fully integrated lithium-ion battery gigafactory in Quebec, Canada. Located just outside Montréal, Northvolt Six will mimic the sustainability-centered design of Northvolt’s other facilities to accommodate 60GW/h of annual cell manufacturing capacity.  
Northvolt produces lithium-ion cells based on Lingonberry lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide or NMC.They come in cylindrical and prismatic formats. The 2170 cylindrical cells are available in three formats: Energy, Power and Life. Alternatively, prismatic cells are custom-made. The company assembles cells into battery systems for customers in energy storage and industrial markets.
Northvolt reports that it uses wind and hydroelectricity to power battery cell proanganese cobalt oxide or NMCduction. The company pairs its cathode production plant with a wastewater treatment plant, separating ammonia metals and sodium sulfate from wastewater. The pure water is then circulated back into various production practices, while the recovered ammonia is recycled for battery cell production. The sodium sulfate is purified and reintroduced to the battery market. Northvolt also repurposes 95% of the nickel manganese and cobalt in old batteries. The organization hopes to recycle 50% of all raw materials necessary for cell production by 2030.
Northvolt sources raw materials from mines and refineries whose practices adhere to international standards. Moreover, the company reports that it only works with mines and refineries with complete traceability and transparency. The Northvolt Sustainability and Annual Report 2022 states that the organization is building an in-house sourcing process to control mining and refining practices better.
Stakeholders chose to construct Northvolt Six in McMasterville and Saint-Basile-le-Grand just outside Montréal due to its proximity to raw battery materials and renewable energy. The Port of Montréal is a gateway for various minerals necessary for cell production, and it will be located close to many U.S. automotive manufacturers, which are key customers. Furthermore, Quebec hydroelectricity can provide 100% renewable energy to power Northvolt Six’s battery cell production. 
Development of the first 30 GWh phase of Northvolt Six is expected to start before the end of this year, with operations projected to begin in 2026. According to Northvolt, it will cost $5 billion to cover construction and the wages of up to 3,000 people.  The new facility is be ing developed with strong support from the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec. It represents the largest private investment in Quebec’s history, the company reports.
Northvolt uses a combination of customer off-take contracts supply contracts and limited recourse financing to fund its projects. According to Northvolt’s 2022 Sustainability report, customer contracts worth $55 billion of backlog revenue will be allocated toward developments over the next seven years. 
The company is also continuing partnerships within its group of 18 lenders and financial institutions committing credit guarantees to generate funds for future developments. Northvolt’s global shareholders also play a significant role in its execution of development projects. As of 2022, Volkswagen Finance Luxembourg SA Goldman Sachs Asset Management funds and Vargas Holding AB were Northvolt’s biggest shareholders, owning 21.1% 19.4% and 7.3% of the company’s stock, respectively. 
Northvolt co-founder Paolo Cerruti will head this project as CEO of Northvolt North America, headquartered in Montréal. He said that this facility will accelerate Quebec’s emergence as a key actor in the global energy transition. The comopany reports that Northvolt battery cells are currently designed and developed at Northvolt Labs in Västerås, Sweden, and Northvolt Cuberg in San Leandro, California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/11/electrolyzer-manufacturer-electric-hydrogen-completes-380-million-financing/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"OCTOBER 11, 2023",Electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen completes $380 million financing,"Electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen has completed an oversubscribed $380 million Series C financing, bringing the company new capital to ramp up the manufacturing and deployment of green hydrogen systems.
The funding round was led by several companies, including Fortescue, Fifth Wall and Energy Impact Partners, and also included new investors like bp Ventures and Oman Investment Authority.
The company manufactures 100 MW electrolyzer systems, each of which it says can produce almost 50 tons of green hydrogen each day, at low costs. In total, it has raised more than $600 million since it was founded three years ago. 
Hydrogen produced from clean sources could play a key role in decarbonizing the U.S., especially when it comes to “hard-to-decarbonize” sectors – for instance, heavy transportation, as well as industrial and chemical processes. 
It has also emerged as a key priority for the Biden-Harris Administration. In June, the administration issued a national clean hydrogen strategy and roadmap, charting a pathway to domestically produce 10 million metric tonnes (MMT) of clean hydrogen annually by the end of the decade, 20 MMT annually by 2040, and 50 MMT annually by 2050. In addition, the administration plans to invest $8 billion in building regional hydrogen hubs.
This August, the administration also launched an inter-agency task force to create a  “whole of government” approach to clean hydrogen. The task force will be co-chaired by Mary Frances Repko, White House deputy national climate advisor and David Turk, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). 
Some experts feel that the key to building out a green hydrogen economy is driving down the cost of solar electricity to produce that hydrogen. 
Electric Hydrogen’s electrolyzer technology is more efficient and lower cost, said Dave Eaglesham, the company’s chief technology officer.
“Now we’re scaling up rapidly to produce and assemble large electrolyzer systems for our industrial customers who are leading the shift from grey hydrogen to renewable green hydrogen,” he said. 
Electric Hydrogen is in the process of setting up manufacturing equipment in a 1.2 GW facility in Devens, Massachusetts. The factory is slated to begin manufacturing commercial electrolyzer systems early next year, and deliver them later in 2024. These deliveries include a system that will be installed at a New Fortress Energy green hydrogen project in Texas, which is scheduled to begin producing hydrogen in the fourth quarter of 2024, and reach full commercial operation in 2025. 
One of Electric Hydrogen’s lead investors and possible customers is Fortescue, a global metals and green energy company. 
“Fortescue is committed and focused on supporting the creation of green technology to help heavy industry decarbonize and producing green hydrogen at scale globally is integral to that,” said Mark Hutchinson, Fortescue Energy CEO.
