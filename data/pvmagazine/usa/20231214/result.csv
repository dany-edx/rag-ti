Full guidelines can be found here. 
The tax credits, made available as part of the $369 billion in climate and energy spending set forth by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, are designated for clean energy components manufactured in the United States. Credits are paid at a varying dollar per Watt rate and are organized by component classification. 
The law creates production tax credits for various clean energy components through 2032.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) celebrated the new guidance. Specifically, it said the inclusion of contract manufacturers for credit eligibility was a strong move that will further accelerate U.S. clean energy manufacturing. 
“America is undergoing the largest expansion of domestic solar manufacturing in history, and today’s developments will help support this economic boom,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, SEIA. 
The guidance also provides credits for power optimizers, a boon for providers like SolarEdge. Power optimizers will be offered the same 11 cent per Watt credit as long as they are sold together with a DC-optimized inverter. 
Language in the issued guidance suggests that manufacturers like U.S.-based First Solar will be eligible for a credit at the wafer, cell, and module level, meaning that it will be able to take advantage of a $0.175 per Watt credit, said Roth Capital Partners. 
Lucrative tax credits have been attracting clean energy manufacturers worldwide to build factories in the United States. Now with the guidance issued, these companies can begin to move forward with their plans.

“Over the past year, nearly $100 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments have been announced, with plans for close to 100 new facilities across the U.S.,” said José Zayas, executive vice president of policy and programs for the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). 
“However, this remarkable progress is only just beginning,” said Zayas. “Projections show the Section 45X manufacturing tax credit will help spur billions of dollars in new economic activity over its life.” 
The guidelines will undergo a 60-day period of public comment before final guidance is issued.

The cumulative volume installed across all sectors between Q1 and Q3 of this year totals 13.5 GWh, compared to the 12 GWh installed in all of 2022. It would have been much higher, noted Vanessa Witte, senior research analyst with Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team, had 80% of projects in the pipeline being delayed.
In Q3 grid scale increased deployment by 37% quarter on quarter for 2.2 GW/6.8 GWh. This boost led to a record-breaking quarter for both MW and MWh installed.
“Energy storage deployment is growing dramatically, proving that it will be essential to our future energy mix,” said Frank Macchiarola, ACP chief policy officer. “This industry will serve as the backbone of our modern grid. As we continue to build a strong domestic supply chain, streamlined permitting and evolving market rules can further accelerate the deployment of storage resources.”

The grid-scale sector’s 2023 forecast increased just slightly due to strong Q3 volume, however, the remainder of the forecast lowered by 7% on average. This sector faced multiple challenges, which caused volatility in the market and hindered project completion, according to Witte.
“Grid-scale declines were more focused on challenges not only with supply and permitting, but also with the backlog of applications in most ISOs interconnection queues that are preventing projects to move through the development process,” said Witte.
In the community, commercial and industrial (CCI) storage sector, deployment fell 7% quarter on quarter, with an estimated 30.3 MW and 92.9 MWh installed. While California had a growth of 35% in energy storage this sector in Q3, Massachusetts recorded none, which lowered the overall percentage for the nation.
Interconnection queue issues affect all solar sectors but was especially felt with CCI deployment. Despite challenges, which also include state incentives and community solar programs, the CCI sector is forecast to double in 2024, and to “become a larger share of the forecast in 2025 and beyond, which will bring more geographic diversity to the U.S. market,” said Hanna Nuttall, a research analyst with Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team.
The residential energy storage segment contracted 14% over 2022, deploying a combined 88.31 MW in Q3. California had a slow first half of the year when it saw a contraction of 31% over the first half 2022. But it did much better in Q3 with 78.4 MW of energy storage deployed, an increase of 35% year over year.
Regional deployment
Regionally, California almost doubled its installed capacity of energy storage quarter over quarter to finish with 78.4 MW installed—the largest increase in the country. All other states deployed a combined total of 88.31 MW, a slight decrease over Q2, which saw 89.53 MW deployed.
At the grid-scale level, California and Texas had 694 MW and 758 MW installed, respectively, accounting for 67% of Q3 capacity. Arizona came in third with 508 MW installed.
The CCI sector is strong in California and is expected to double in 2024 as California opens its community solar-plus-storage program.
The 2023 residential forecast increased by 4% as the California market began to pick up in Q3 after the passage of NEM 2.0. The residential segment is expected to double between 2023 and 2025, but growth slows later in the forecast period as solar penetration increases in California.
Looking at the duration of grid-scale storage by region, the report indicates that California California led with 2.7 GWh for a 40% share of Q3. Texas came in second, with 1.5 GWh. The average duration for the quarter clocked in at 3.1 hours.
Key drivers
Drivers of energy storage markets include price declines coupled with lower demand for electric vehicle batteries. The report estimates that, for example, median grid-scale lithium-ion battery storage system prices declined 23% quarter over quarter as a result of easing supply chain challenges and lower commodity pricing.
Where prices are increasing is in balance of plant (BoP) and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), which the report contends is mostly due to high labor demand along with administrative cost increases due to try to meet the new prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements brought about by the Inflation Reduction Act.
While the future looks bright for energy deployment, the report revised the Q2 forecast down 5%, estimating that the U.S. storage market will install approximately 63 GW between 2023 and 2027 across all segments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/14/form-energy-awarded-30-million-for-100-hour-iron-air-battery-project-in-california/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 14, 2023",Form Energy awarded $30 million for 100-hour iron-air battery project in California,"Form Energy, developer of grid-scale multi-day iron-air batteries, has received a $30 million award from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to develop an energy storage project in Mendocino County, California. The award was issued via its Long Duration Energy Storage funding program.
The company’s iron-air batteries can continuously discharge electricity for 100-hour durations. Such long duration energy storage installations are desired for their ability to convert intermittent renewable generation like solar and wind into firm, dispatchable baseload power.
“This project will enhance our ability to harness excess renewables during nonpeak hours for use during peak demand, especially as we work toward a goal of 100 percent clean electricity,” said David Hochschild, CEC chair.
CEC commissioned Form Energy to develop a 5 MW / 500 MWh battery. The project is expected to begin operations by the end of 2025. California regulators estimate more than 48 GW of battery storage and 4 GW of long-duration storage will be needed to meet the goal of 100% clean electricity by 2045.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air, creating rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
The technology is less energy-dense than its lithium-ion counterparts, making it a better fit for large grid-scale applications. This may come as an advantage for the company, as EV batteries are in competition for lithium, a metal with geo-political mining concerns and battery fire risks.
The product is touted for its cost benefits, delivering capacity at an approximate $20/kWh – a stark contrast to the $176/kWh of a conventional 6-hour lithium-ion solution. It’s worth noting that although Form Energy’s product does greatly increase system efficiency, its round-trip efficiency is under 50%, in contrast to lithium-ion’s 85%.
Form Energy said an individual battery module is about the size of a side-by-side washer/dryer set and contains a stack of approximately 50 one-meter-tall cells. The cells include iron and air electrodes, the parts of the battery that enable the electrochemical reactions to store and discharge electricity. Each of these cells are filled with water-based, non-flammable electrolyte, like the electrolyte used in AA batteries.
These battery modules are grouped together in environmentally protected enclosures. Hundreds of these enclosures are grouped together in modular megawatt-scale power blocks. Depending on the system size, tens to hundreds of these power blocks can be connected to the electricity grid. For scale, in its least dense configuration, a one-megawatt system comprises half an acre of land. Higher density configurations would achieve > 3 MW/acre.
“Form was founded with a unified mission to develop a multi-day energy storage battery that would unlock the power of extremely low-cost renewable energy to transform the electric grid,” said Mateo Jaramillo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Form Energy.
CEC also issued $31 million for a 60 MW renewable backup power microgrid in San Diego County and $32 million for a 20 MW microgrid project in Tehama County as part of its Long Duration Energy Storage program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/14/using-waste-heat-from-pv-panels-to-generate-residential-hot-water/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 14, 2023",Using waste heat from PV panels to generate residential hot water,"From pv magazine global
Researchers at the Multiphysics Interaction Lab (MiLab) in the Los Angeles have developed a new photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) system design that uses waste heat from PV panels to generate residential hot water systems.
The system is based on parallel water pipes that are attached to the backside of the solar panels and reduce their operating temperatures. “Our study introduces a simple and practical cooling approach that enhances the electrical efficiency of PV panels while simultaneously offering a sustainable solution to residential hot water needs,” the scientists said.
The experimental system relies on a south-oriented 250 W polycrystalline PV panel with a temperature coefficient of -0.45%/C and a tilt angle of 30 degrees. The copper cooling pipes are connected via upstream and downstream headers and are covered by an aluminum cover to secure them to the backside of the PV panel.
The experimental setup includes a hot water storage tank and an 11 W centrifugal pump that maintains a constant flow rate of 3 L/min.
“The water flow rate is monitored using a flowmeter,” the scientists explained. “To gather accurate data, a set of thermocouples is strategically placed to simultaneously measure various temperatures, including the inlet and outlet water temperatures of the PV/T system, the PV panel’s surface temperature, and the ambient air temperature.”
The system also uses a multimeter to measure the PV module’s output power and a pyranometer to assess solar radiation.
The academics compared the performance of the cooled PV panel to a reference panel without cooling during May at the Notre Dame University-Louaize campus, located in Zouk Mosbeh, Lebanon.

Their analysis showed that the PVT panel can generate 4% more power than the PV module, thanks to the cooling effect of the copper pipes. They also warned, however, that a saturation effect related to the hot water stored in the tank not being effectively utilized, may limit the ability to optimally cool the PV modules at a certain stage.
“This reduction is likely due to the absence of residential water demand in the waste heat recovery system,” the researchers further explained. “This absence causes the cooling water temperature in the hot water reservoir to gradually increase, reducing thus the rate of heat removal from the PVT system.”
The tests also showed that the PVT panel achieved an average electric efficiency of 11.5% while the PV panel without cooling reached an average efficiency of 10%. The scientists also revealed that the PVT system’s total efficiency reached around 75% and that of the reference PV system was only about 10%.
“The average thermal efficiency, representing the ratio of recovered waste heat to the solar energy absorbed by the PV panel, was approximately 60% in the cooled PV/T system,” they also stated. “The cooled PV/T system not only generated a higher fraction of electric power but also exhibited an approximately 40% higher rate of heat loss from the back side of the PV module, indicating the efficient waste heat recovery.”
The system was presented in the paper “An experimental analysis of a hybrid photovoltaic thermal system through parallel water pipe integration,” published in the International Journal of Thermofluids.

The $1.4 billion, 580-mile 525-volt HVDC transmission line is said to be the largest clean energy infrastructure project in North American history.
“The men and women of the IBEW are proud to partner with Pattern Energy and Quanta Services, Inc. on this historic energy infrastructure project. SunZia won’t just slash carbon emissions, but create good, middle class jobs throughout the region, and this transmission PLA guarantees that,” said IBEW International President Kenneth W. Cooper. “More good-paying, union jobs will create an economic ripple effect throughout Arizona and New Mexico, pouring money back into local communities.

The transmission line originates at a planned substation in near Corona, New Mexico, and traverses eight counties in New Mexico and Arizona before terminating at an existing substation in Casa Grande, Arizona. It will provide more than 3 GW of renewable wind power from central New Mexico to an estimated 3 million homes in central Arizona.
The IBEW labor union represents over 800,000 workers and retirees in the electrical industry in the U.S., Canada, Guam, Panama, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. IBEW reports that more than 500 IBEW members will be employed in construction of the project. Pattern Energy reports that once construction is complete, approximately 150 permanent jobs will remain.
“The IBEW leads the way in recruiting and training the highly skilled workforce needed to build out a clean energy infrastructure and a resilient and modern grid,” Cooper said. “As the best trained, most experienced electrical workers in North America, the IBEW is ready to play a leading role in America’s renewable energy future by getting to work making SunZia a reality.”
Pattern Energy reports that, in addition to jobs, the project will bring multiple benefits to the region. Of the developer’s estimated $8 billion investment, Pattern says an estimated $1 billion will go to governments, communities, schools and landowners in both states in the form of sales and use taxes, property taxes, and land payments to federal, state, and private landowners.
Pattern Energy is a U.S.-based developer with a portfolio of more than 35 power facilities and transmission lines globally.
