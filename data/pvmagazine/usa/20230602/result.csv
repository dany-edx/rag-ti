While it had lagged other states with similar sized economies in the past, in 2022 Washington ranked 15 among the states in terms of solar capacity, nearly doubling its cumulative installed capacity to 585 MW.
This equates to enough solar to power just under 60,000 households, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA estimates that $1.3 billion has been invested in solar in the state, with nearly 150 companies and 4,000 employees working in the industry.
SEIA projects that another 1.4 GW of solar will be added over the next five years, more than doubling cumulative installed capacity once again.
Incentives
Solar customers who install systems of 100 kW of capacity or below are eligible for net metering in Washington. The policy was enacted in 1998 and remains available today from the three main utilities operating in the state. Net metering involves a solar customer sending excess daytime energy production to the grid in exchange for credits on their utility bills.
 The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission website contains links to net metering specifics for the three major utilities Avista Corporation, Pacific Power & Light, and Puget Sound Energy.
Washington residents also have vested rights to solar easement laws. This means that neighbors cannot build structures that shade an existing solar array. Furthermore, Washington’s solar rights laws prohibit homeowners’ associations from blocking residential solar projects.
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Washington residents and all U.S. residents alike are offered the Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC). The credit applies to 30% of the installed system cost and can be rolled over if you do not have a large enough tax appetite in year one.
Based on a 4.9 kW system, informational site SolarReviews estimates the price of a Washington solar array to be an average of $11,647 after receiving the federal ITC. This equates to $2.77 per Watt.
In April 2022, Washington passed a solar incentive program aimed at expanding the opportunities for low-income residents to access renewable energy through an increased focus on installing community solar projects in the state. HB 1814 created a new $100 million incentive program, which began in 2023, that will provide funding for low-income households and low-income service providers’ installing solar.
Like the state’s previous solar incentive programs, Washington State University (WSU) Energy Extension will manage the $100 million in funding, providing grants to community solar projects around the state.
Notable project
This February, Avangrid announced the completion of construction and activation of a 150 MW solar project in Klickitat County, making it the largest solar facility in Washington by a large margin. Lund Hill solar sits on roughly 1,800 acres of mixed-use land leased from private owners and the Washington Department of Natural Resources, the state’s solar power land lease.
The project supplies electricity as part of utility Puget Sound Energy’s (PSE) program called Green Direct, which enables governments and large commercial customers to purchase 100% renewable energy contracts from dedicated local sites.
Governor Jay Inslee celebrated the activation, commenting, “with our efforts this upcoming session, this should be the first of many clean energy projects that bring good-paying jobs and affordable, zero-emission energy to Washingtonians.”
The project will supply electricity for PSE’s second round of the Green Direct program. So far, the program has connected more than 40 customers with renewable energy, including six state government agencies, like the Washington Department of Health, Ecology, and Transportation. PSE targets 100% clean energy by 2045, as mandated in Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/02/senate-passes-debt-ceiling-bill-in-mixed-bag-for-energy-and-environment/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 2, 2023",Senate passes debt ceiling bill in mixed bag for energy and environment,"The U.S. Senate voted 63-36 to pass a bill to raise the nation’s debt ceiling in attempt to avert a debt default before Monday’s deadline. 
While President Joe Biden had expressed desire to pass a “clean” debt raise with no other provisions attached, he ultimately reached a compromise with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that includes some significant changes to environmental review processes and permitting for energy projects. Biden is expected to sign the bill into law on June 2, delivering a speech at 7:00 PM EST. Full text of the bill can be found here. 
The compromise reached by Biden and McCarthy stripped out some provisions the Republican representative had included in an earlier draft that was set to gut Inflation Reduction Act.  
The earlier draft, which Biden rejected in negotiations would have repealed the Production Tax Credit, the Investment Tax Credit, and other core IRA provisions, which would have been devastating to the momentum of the clean energy transition. 
Included in the revised bill that Biden is expected to sign, however, are significant changes to permitting and environmental review processes. The law is expected to be a boon for energy developers of all types, from solar to oil, but may challenge the nation’s environmental protection agencies. 
The bill shrinks the requirements for energy project reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), requiring that agencies focus specifically on “reasonably foreseeable environmental effects” instead of longer-term downstream impacts. 
NEPA has been a cornerstone of U.S. environmental law since 1970, requiring federal agencies to perform environmental reviews on any major infrastructure projects.
Most NEPA reviews on energy projects will be capped at a year, with a two-year review for significant projects that may have larger environmental impacts.
Harrison Godfrey, managing director of Advanced Energy Economy, said the bill includes “positive steps” on permitting reform, including language that requires a lead federal agency for permitting processes, improvements project timeline transparency, and a more efficient environmental review process.
“The debt ceiling agreement includes an important down payment on much-needed reforms to improve the efficiency of the permitting process for clean energy projects, including reasonable timelines for completing environmental reviews, common-sense lead agency authority and expedited consideration for qualifying energy storage projects,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer, American Clean Power.
Grumet added that while the changes are a step in the right direction for the development of energy projects, more work is needed to ensure a clean energy transition.
“Absent significant improvements in the siting and construction of new clean power transmission capabilities, our nation will fail to achieve critical economic, national security and climate goals,” he said. “We look forward to working with lawmakers in both parties to advance more comprehensive bipartisan permitting and transmission reform legislation in the weeks ahead,” said Grumet.
While the bill is expected to accelerate the buildout of clean energy projects, furthering progress towards key climate and environmental goals, it is a mixed-bag that also limits the power of NEPA. It also makes possible the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a major oil project that is expected to contribute 89 million metric tons of carbon emissions, equal to the impact of adding 19 million gas-powered passenger vehicles per year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/02/brightnight-developing-2-gw-bluegrass-solar-portfolio/,"BUSINESS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,KENTUCKY",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 2, 2023",BrightNight developing 2 GW Bluegrass solar portfolio,"In 1954, Elvis Presley added a rockabilly swagger to the bluegrass ballad, “Blue Moon of Kentucky.” The many renditions of the Bill Monroe country staple carried a sense that the unexpected was right around the corner.
In a similar fashion and location, BrightNight, a utility-scale renewable energy developer, has set out to deploy 2 GW of solar projects across the Bluegrass State of Kentucky, where coal has historically been king.
The Florida-based developer recently signed long-term power purchase agreements with utilities Louisville Gas & Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities for Gage Solar, a 115 MW project in Ballard County, Ky. The utility project has a target timeframe of commissioning in 2026.
Gage Solar is BrightNight’s second PPA with the two Kentucky investor-owned utilities, with a previous PPA signed in 2021 for the Ragland Solar project, a 125 MW project in development in McCracken County, Ky., overlooking the Ohio River border with Illinois near Paducah, Ky.
“LG&E and KU are clear leaders in developing multiple sources of energy,” said Martin Hermann, chief executive officer of BrightNight. “We are working together to meet the need for more power in Kentucky, as legacy generating assets are retired and demand grows – and we are doing it in a sustainable way.”
Along with the utilities’ parent company PPL, the offtakers have adopted a goal to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions across their business operations to net zero by 2050, with interim targets of a 70% reduction from 2010 levels by 2035, and an 80% reduction by 2040.
According to a PPL investor presentation, the Kentucky utilities are retiring 300 MW of coal generating capacity in 2024, followed by an additional 297 MW and 897 MW in 2027 and 2028, respectively. Over the next five years, the utilities have committed to adding 637 MW of solar PPA assets, 240 MW of solar owned resources, and 125 MW of energy storage deployments. A remaining 1.24 GW buffer to displace the curtailed coal generation (1.49 GW) will be filled with combined cycle gas turbine generation as part of the utilities’ five-year capital budget spend of $2.1 billion to replace its coal fleet with clean energy.
With the current portfolio across Kentucky, the estimated total statewide investment impact from BrightNight construction of its 2 GW portfolio is estimated at over $400 million dollars and will generate significant tax revenues for the state and localities.
The constructed renewable energy infrastructure will serve as a nexus for economic development. The company is also investing in the communities it will serve, providing educational and emergency assistance programs.
Agrivoltaics in coal country
The Gage Solar project is also located in western Kentucky and is exploring agrivoltaic solutions on site. The project solutions support local farms in parallel with its energy production.
Agrivoltaics is the practice of dual use solar and agriculture on the same land area. Although this land use system is still relatively new and limited in scope in the U.S., it’s generating interest among farmers, officials and solar developers alike.
“Being a good neighbor is a critical part of our work in bringing these projects to communities across Kentucky,” said Hermann. “Ballard County has been a collaborative partner helping shape the project that will meet our customer’s needs and the community’s preferences.”
Russell Wilkerson, chief communications officer at BrightNight told pv magazine USA that the developer is evaluating the use of both sheep grazing and bee pollinator habitats at the Kentucky solar sites. The developer also has a screening technology to blend the project in with the landscape, he added.
In a letter to the Kentucky State Board on Electric Generation and Transmission Siting, the Ballard Industrial Development Authority wrote, “We look forward to the success of these projects and the benefits they will provide and we [Ballard County] wish to become a leader for renewable energy in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.”
In a 2022 Kentucky agrivoltaics briefing by the American Farmland Trust, the non-profit farming agency addresses opponents of solar on rural farmsteads. Citing data from the National Renewable Energy Lab, an expert from the Kentucky Office of Energy Policy said that under average scenarios, solar is predicted to impact only about 1% of the state’s 12 million acres of farmland. They acknowledged that if solar development is concentrated in certain areas—say, on farmland with premium siting characteristics close to transmission infrastructure—some counties and regions will see a disproportionate impact.
Headquartered in Inlet Beach, Florida, BrightNight is a utility solar, wind and storage developer backed by Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investor.  The company develops projects in excess of 200 MW and currently has about 2.5 GW of active projects under development in the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/02/minnesota-puc-finds-energy-justice-relevant-to-xcels-ratemaking-process/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MINNESOTA",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 2, 2023",Minnesota PUC finds energy justice relevant to Xcel’s ratemaking process,"Minnesota’s Governor Walz recently signed into law a new climate bill that aims for 100% clean energy by 2040. The state enacted its first net metering law in 1983. In 2013 it became the first state to establish a community solar law. In 2007 it set its renewable portfolio standard (RPS).
While the Governor has been working to advance clean energy in the state, Xcel Energy, a utility that’s headquartered in Minneapolis and provides energy to millions of residents in eight Western and Midwestern states, filed a  rate increase proposal in October 2021 that was criticized by clean energy, environmental and social justice advocates. They noted that it comes at a time when Minnesotans are feeling the strain of inflation and the rising cost of living. Over 500 concerned ratepayers pushed back against the proposed rate hike by attending public hearings and submitting written comments.
The new Minnesota climate bill encourages utilities to take energy justice into account, and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) found that energy justice is relevant to Xcel’s ratemaking process and the PUC just released a decision in Xcel Energy’s electric rate proposal that has energy justice provisions.
Some of the provisions include lowering Xcel’s proposed return on equity from the company’s requested 10.2% to 9.25%, a rejection of proposed investments that would have stalled local clean energy growth. The proposal also rejects Xcel’s request that ratepayers foot the bill for excessive executive compensation.
The Just Solar Coalition, which includes Community Power, Cooperative Energy Futures, Minnesota Interfaith Power and Light, and Vote Solar–represented by the Environmental Law and Policy Center–urged the PUC to address racial and wealth disparities in bill affordability. One impetus behind this work is the so-called “Minnesota Paradox,” a term coined by University of Minnesota Professor Samuel L. Myers. He noted that “African Americans are worse off in Minnesota than they are in virtually every other state in the nation,” and explained that while Minnesota may be the best state to live in, it is the worst state for people of color, hence the paradox.
A recent report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) found that U.S. residents that need the most support on their energy bills are stuck with costs 27% higher than their neighbors on square-foot-basis. The report said EIA said that energy-insecure households have reduced or forgone basic necessities to pay energy bills, kept their houses at unsafe temperatures because of energy cost concerns, or been unable to repair heating or cooling equipment because of cost.
According to Vote Solar, a low-income household in Minnesota can expect to spend 8% of their income on utilities, four times the average for a non-low-income household. These disparities are especially harmful to customers of color, who are likely to face the highest energy burdens, while also being excluded from programs designed to save energy costs and build wealth.
“A key function of the state utility commission is to ensure that the utility rates are just and reasonable. Today, they seized upon an important opportunity to do that—and they clearly recognized the relevance of Energy Justice within the ratemaking process,” says Erica McConnell, staff attorney with the Environmental Law & Policy Center, who represented the Just Solar Coalition. “However, it was troubling to see the Commission move some critical issues out of the rate case and into other forums with less accountability and fewer financial repercussions for the utility.”
While the Just Solar Coalition advocated for mandate on increased  procedural justice and public participation utility regulation, such mandates were excluded from the order.
“True energy equity requires that the most impacted stakeholders are empowered to participate fully in these critical decision-making processes,” said Jenna Warmuth, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar. “I’m proud that our coalition was able to make room at the table for groups that have been historically and systematically excluded. Unfortunately, the PUC failed to implement solutions that would have advanced public participation and access.”

The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) confirmed the result.
The Maxeon 7 module is based on interdigitated back contact (IBC) technology. The manufacturer hosts a Maxeon 7 pilot assembly line in the Philippines and has recently announced it will expand the cell manufacturing capacity for the “record-breaking” module to 500 MW.
Maxeon also announced efficiency improvements to its existing IBC products, with Maxeon 6 and 3 panels achieving efficiencies of 23% and 24%, respectively.
“Our technology team continues to increase the performance of our IBC technology platform to efficiency levels that were not anticipated when we launched our first commercial products almost twenty years ago,” said Bill Mulligan, Maxeon’s CEO. “Most importantly, these achievements are not one-off laboratory results but mainstream production technologies that increase customer value and extend our differentiation versus our competitors.”
Maxeon recently priced a public offering of shares to raise $157.4 million. It said it would use the funds for Maxeon 7 module production and general corporate purposes.

The portfolio consists of:
Nearly 800,000 U.S.-manufactured First Solar panels and solar trackers from Array Technologies, also U.S.-made, will be used on both new projects.
“By leveraging domestic content incentives offered in the Inflation Reduction Act, both the Honeysuckle and Prairie Ronde solar projects provide exciting examples of the IRA’s benefits in real action,” said Kevin Smith, chief executive officer of the Americas, Lightsource bp. “With the right policies, we can boost made-in-America products, create jobs and reduce our nation’s foreign dependence.”
Collectively, the projects will abate more than 235,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year, the equivalent of taking about 85,000 oil and gas-burning cars off the road.
Honeysuckle and Praire Ronde Solar have created 450 construction phase jobs, with the energy company focused on recruiting from local labor pools.
Lightsource bp arranged the new project debt financing from Bank of America, ING Capital, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest and Societe Generale. Over the last four years, Lightsource bp has raised over $3.7 billion in project financing for solar projects in 11 states from the lenders, among other financial institutions.
Pollinator-friendly solar
The two utility solar projects will also participate in lightsource bp’s “Responsible Solar” ethos, which encourages project development in conjunction with agrivoltaics practices, which combine solar generation with agriculture use case.
In St. Joseph County, Indiana, Honeysuckle becomes one of the first participants in the Bee & Butterfly Habitat Fund’s new “Solar Synergy” program, fostering habitat for bee and butterfly pollinators across the site.
The Indiana program provides  tools and expertise to utility-scale solar developers seeking to cultivate high-quality pollinator habitats at their projects. Some of the benefits of this program include:
“The greater the diversity you have in there, the more pollinator species and the more benefits you’ll be able to impact,” said Pete Berthelsen, executive director of the Bee & Butterfly Habitat Fund.
On site, a first mix of wildflower plants will grow beneath rows of solar panels across the entire project, containing 25 species of grasses and flowering plants. A second plant mix, which will grow into what’s called a “high-density” pollinator garden, will be seeded on more than 20 acres around the solar site perimeter and contain more than 50 species of plants.
Additional information on Honeysuckle Solar’s pollinator program, including a video clip on honey production from solar sites, can be found here and below.
Meanwhile, at Prairie Ronde, Lightsource is making plans to restore coastal prairie habitat and also provide nesting grounds for Eastern Bluebirds. A long-term Land Management and Biodiversity plan will establish habitats to increase biodiversity through creation of pollinator habitat and natural undergrowth below the panels to  manage water runoff and drainage at the St. Landry Parish, Louisiana project site.
Lightsource bp has a pipeline of projects under development in Indiana and Louisiana. In the Hoosier State, the company built the 173 MW Bellflower Solar project near Indianapolis in March 2023. In the Pelican State, lightsource is also developing the 345 MW Oxbow Solar (fka Ventress Solar) project with LPL Solar serving as the contractor.
