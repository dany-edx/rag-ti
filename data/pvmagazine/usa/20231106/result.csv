The legislation, which includes Senate Bills 271, 273 and 502, calls for 50% renewable energy by 2030, ramping up to 60% by 2035 and 100% by 2040. The rooftop solar cap will be increased from 1% to 10% of each utility’s average peak load. The legislation also sets an energy storage standard of 2.5 GW.
Michigan is known as the center of U.S. automotive manufacturing, with three major automobile companies headquartered in the Detroit area. However, it has also been a trendsetter as far as moving to clean energy. If passed, Michigan would be the ninth state to enact a 100% clean electricity standard. It would also be the first Midwestern state to enact an energy storage standard.
“If this legislation passes and makes the state a leader in energy storage development, it can also be a model for other states seeking to improve distribution grid reliability,” Laura Sherman wrote in an OpEd on pv magazine USA. Sherman is president of Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council (EIBC). She added that, “Michigan has long been one of the worst-performing states for reliability, and recent severe power outages following an ice storm illustrate this vulnerability.”
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Michigan ranks 23rd with just over 1 GW installed, or enough to power 223,888 homes. SEIA projects that the state will install another 3.4 GW over the next five years to be ranked 16th.
The legislation also calls for Michigan Public Service Commission to consider equity in its Integrated Resource Plan.
Earlier this year, a report by Evergreen Action and the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council found that in addition to saving Michigan households an average of $145 a year in energy costs, these policies supported by additional measures would secure $7.8 billion more in federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and drive the creation of nearly 160,000 quality jobs. The report also found that 65% of voters supported legislation to transition the state’s energy grid to 100% clean energy.

The company announced an agreement with Solarcycle, a technology-based solar recycling company, to recycle solar panels damaged or broken during construction and operation.
With the rapid growth in solar energy in the U.S., there is also growing concern about what will happen to solar panels at the end of their useful life. Without an increase in solar recycling, the U.S. will contribute 10 million metric tons of trash in landfills and other waste facilities by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). To put into context, the U.S. dumps almost 140 million tons of waste each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
“As a company, we have committed to developing the recycling capability of our clean energy assets, starting with solar,” said Edgar Puerto, associate director, strategic procurement at EDF Renewables. “We view this as a key strategy for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and catalyzing a new domestic supply chain for made-in-America solar products.”  
Solarcycle reports that its proprietary technology allows for the extraction of 95% of the value from recycled panels, including silver, silicon, copper, aluminum, and glass. After extracting the raw materials from the solar panels, Solarcycle intends to sell the materials for the next wave of solar manufacturing in the U.S.
Solarcycle currently has facilities in Odessa, Texas and Mesa, Ariz. Jesse Simons, chief commercial officer and co-founder, told pv magazine USA that the company intends to break ground on a third in the Southeast soon. The intention is to have a facility within 500 miles of 80% of the installed solar in the U.S.
“We have a team of reverse logistics professionals who are experts in optimizing the number of panels on a truck to ensure we are using the fewest number of trips in order to bring panels to our sites, lowering costs and lowering carbon emissions,” said Simons.
The company has performed a lifecycle assessment, which determined that the carbon benefits of Solarcycle’s recycling process, which requires centralization and scale, far outweigh the carbon involved in transport.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/06/nrel-anticipates-rising-utility-scale-costs-decreasing-residential-costs/,"COST AND PRICES,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 6, 2023","NREL anticipates rising utility-scale costs, decreasing residential costs","The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in collaboration with the Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), recently released its U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmarks, With Minimum Sustainable Price Analysis: Q1 2023. 
This year’s analysis indicates a contrasting trend: While utility-scale solar project costs are on the rise, residential project expenses are decreasing. An 8% increase in utility-scale costs can be attributed to rising labor expenses, which have been influenced by the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) implementation of new prevailing wage requirements tied to a 30% tax credit. Conversely, residential solar benefitted from reduced prices in modules, inverters, logistics, and customer acquisition, resulting in a 16% overall decrease in residential costs despite rising financing expenses.

For 2023, NREL has refined its cost-modeling methodology by integrating feedback from industry stakeholders and updating its economic assessments to reflect the IRA’s impact on labor and hardware expenses. The analysis now also includes the effects of rising interest rates, which have become a more prominent cost factor than in prior years.
The report also reveals that while U.S. module prices decreased from 2022, module prices are still a bit higher than they were in 2021. Commodity market prices for copper and other metals have settled near their 2021 levels, reducing this year’s costs for racking, and for the electrical balance of system. However, with the Consumer Price Index signaling a 15% inflation increase during the covered period, inflation remains a substantial factor in cost hikes.

The report expands its scope to include operations and maintenance (O&M) costs and community solar projects for the first time. To accommodate this, pricing data for commercial solar projects ranging from 500 kW to 2 MWdc was excluded. Energy storage costs, as in prior years, are now factored into all project sizes.
The findings show significant insurance expenses for residential solar projects and the management of community solar customers. This suggests higher costs for third-party owned assets, given most homeowners typically do not need to increase their coverage. Additionally, long-term O&M costs for energy storage systems appear heavily influenced by the need to replace battery cells.

This year’s NREL report introduces refined cost benchmarks, reflecting a more nuanced analysis of the solar and energy storage markets. Emphasizing the influence of the IRA, the updated benchmarks incorporate fresh industry data to more accurately portray labor and hardware costs. The benchmarks also account for the financial implications of rising interest rates for the first time, underscoring their growing impact on the solar industry’s economics.
The methodology revision includes a shift from commercial to community solar project analysis, aligning more closely with current market trends. Despite these changes, the core premise of the Q1 Benchmark remains: A ground-up approach modeling the best-case scenario for pricing. For a practical, “real world” perspective on pricing, the report directs readers to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Tracking the Sun report.
A key insight from the NREL benchmarks is the distinction between the “modeled market price” (MMP) and the “minimum sustainable price” (MSP). The MSP aims to identify the lowest prices that ensure suppliers’ financial viability over the long term, based on input costs that similarly allow for their suppliers’ sustained solvency.

Despite the savings from lower residential hardware prices, the increased cost of borrowing has partially offset these advantages, resulting in a 15% increase in the financial aspect of residential solar pricing, with community solar and utility-scale solar up 18% and 19%.
An intriguing aspect, though potentially elusive for the average buyer, is the report’s inclusion of possible cost savings attributable to the IRA’s 45X manufacturing tax credits, which suggest lower hardware prices. The modeled discounts are as follows:
The report highlights that without the 45X credit applied to domestically assembled modules and inverters, the cost for a residential PV system would stand at $2.90/Wdc. However, with the IRA’s benefits fully realized, this cost is projected to decrease to $2.68/Wdc.
Moreover, some industry experts suggest that the IRA’s framework may have positioned the United States to become an exporter of solar modules.

“By pairing the EP760 with two to four B500 battery packs, users can create an energy storage system ranging from 9,920 Wh to a maximum of 19,840 Wh,” Bluetti said, noting that the EP760 inverter delivers up to 7,600 W of single-phase power in grid or off-grid mode.
Bluetti said the system has been designed to respond to growing calls for an affordable home backup system and takes less than 10 milliseconds to switch from grid power to battery power.
The EP760, which operates at 240 V, can be integrated with existing or future solar systems, supporting up to 9,000 W solar charging.
“Even without solar panels, the EP760 offers an intelligent peak load shifting feature that enables homeowners to charge the system when grid electricity is cheap and discharge it during peak hours, reducing overall energy costs,” the company said.
The inverter measures 636 mm x 325 mm x 370 mm and weighs 44 kg. It has three maximum power point tracking (MPPTs) with an input voltage range of 150 V to 550 V and an efficiency of 97%. The maximum PV input voltage is 500 V. Each battery module measures 636 mm x 325 mm x 338 mm and weighs 58 kg.
The EP760 system comes with a 10-year warranty. It operates in temperatures ranging from -20 C to 40 C. The new storage system features IP66 protection and can be stacked on a floor rather than being wall mounted.

The company said that NREL has confirmed the results, which represent a world record for this cell typology. The previous record was held by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), which achieved a 33.7% efficiency for a device with the same configuration in June.
“The theoretical efficiency of perovskite-silicon tandem cells is 43%, which makes them the most feasible alternative to current mono-junction silicon cells,” said Longi President Li Zhenguo, without providing technical details.
In June, Longi reported an efficiency of 33.5% for the same cell. The European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) certified the results, which represented a significant increase on its previous 31.8% efficiency rating, which was announced during the SNEC conference in late May in Shanghai, China.
Longi has broken the world record for solar cell efficiency 15 times since April 2021. It claimed the world’s highest efficiency for silicon cells in November 2022, with a 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified heterojunction solar cell.
