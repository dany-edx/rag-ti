Fresh off of a trio of M&A deals including most recently Standard Solar for $540 million and Scout Clean Energy for $1 billion, the Canadian project development company aims to accelerate project development efforts later in the next decade, said Connor Teskey, Brookfield Renewable’s CEO, on the company’s Friday Q3 2022 earnings call.
“Three years from now, when we look to the next three years, we’ll be looking to build far more than 10GW out in that period as well,” Teskey said on the company’s Q3 22 call.
The Scout Clean Energy acquisition brings a sizable 22 GW project pipeline to BEP’s long-term portfolio of utility wind and solar projects, while Standard Solar adds a 500 MW development portfolio and 2 GW of long-term pipeline distributed generation (DG) solar projects.
Its recent acquisitions combined with its active portfolio bring BEP’s development pipeline to more than 60 GW of wind, utility solar, distributed generation projects and storage
During its Q3 earnings call, BEP’s management disclosed that the company commenced commissioning of a 1.2 GW Brazilian solar project while continuing to execute on a 19 GW development pipeline.
Capitalizing on the accelerating energy transition, BEP reported $2.82 billion in revenues for the nine months ending September 30, a 14.6% year over year increase from $2.46 billion generated in the 2021 period.
The company’s shares traded at $29.90 this afternoon, down 23% from $38.64 a year ago, with a $10.9 billion market capitalization.

The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) said that a lithium-ion battery – possibly in an e-bike or e-scooter – triggered a blaze in a 37-floor Manhattan apartment building, injuring more than three dozen people, according to the Associated Press. Chief Fire Marshal Daniel Flynn reportedly said there were at least five bikes in the apartment where the fire started. Citywide, nearly 200 blazes and six fire-related deaths this year have been tied to micromobility device batteries, marking “an exponential increase” in such fires in recent years, said Flynn. The FDNY has urged users of such batteries to follow charging and storage instructions, in addition to other safety guidance.
In September a fire broke out in a battery energy storage facility housing a 182.5 MW Tesla Megapack system, where at least one of the battery units caught on fire. The facility is operated by utility PG&E and is located in Monterey County, California, in the United States. The Californian facility is one of the biggest utility-owned, lithium-ion battery energy storage systems in the world. A Tesla Megapack also caught fire last year in the Victorian Big Battery in Moorabool, Australia.
In June a joint recall was issued with Health Canada, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (US CPSC) and SunVilla Corporation for all 10-foot solar LED Market Umbrellas. The umbrellas have LED lights on the arms of the umbrella that are powered by a lithium-ion battery charged with a small solar panel. The recall was issued after reports of batteries overheating and causing fires in the United States and Canada. In three reported incidents, the solar panels caught fire while charging via the AC adapter indoors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/07/a-majority-of-new-solar-panels-will-retain-80-production-after-30-years/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 7, 2022",A majority of new solar panels will retain 80% production after 30 years,"Sandia National Laboratories concluded a five-year early-life solar module degradation study that examined 834 fielded PV modules, representing 13 types from seven manufacturers in three climates.
The report, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, studied 23 systems in total. Six of the studied were determined to have degradation rates that will exceed panel warranty limits in the future, while 13 systems demonstrated the ability to extend their lifetime beyond 30 years. “Lifetime” in this study is defined as the amount of time a panel produces electricity above 80% of its beginning-of-life rate.
The report said that module costs have fallen 85% since 2010 due to economies of scale, higher efficiencies in cell designs, production line automation, larger modules, and changes to bill of materials components like backsheets. It cautioned that while decreased costs have led to solar becoming a central part of energy infrastructure buildout today, cost-cutting design and materials changes could lead to a lowered degradation rate, which in-turn could cancel out many of the positive results of lower module costs.
The degradation study found that degradation is highly nonlinear over time and seasonal variations are present in some module types. Mean and median degradation rate values of −0.62%/year and −0.58%/year, respectively, are consistent with rates measured for older modules.
The report said the market share of cell types has shifted dramatically in recent years. In 2018, conventional aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) designs dominated the global solar cell production, representing up to 90%. By 2020, the market share shifted to only 15% AI-BSF and 80% high-efficiency cell concepts like passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), passivated emitter with rear locally diffused cell (PERL), passivated emitter rear totally diffused cell (PERT), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), and tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon). The report said there is a lack of long-term field data for these new cell and module technologies.
This study aimed to tackle that lack of data, studying each of these technologies in the field over time. It included 55% of the 2020 market in terms of number of companies represented.
Nameplate power rating differences ranged from around −3.6% to 4% with initial power stabilization varying from −3.3% to +0.6%. Flash-over-flash measurements showed variable performance with seasonality amplifying the variations.
Overall, the degradation rates found in the work were within the values observed in the past from 1979 to 2014 module technologies for more expensive conventional PV technologies. It concluded, although the costs declined sharply in the last decade, module degradation rates do not seem to be affected, at least for the sample investigated in the report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/07/idaho-utility-plans-to-slash-rooftop-solar-60/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,IDAHO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 7, 2022",Idaho utility plans to slash rooftop solar net metering 60%,"Private investor-owned utility Idaho Power plans to slash net metering rates for rooftop solar by as much as 60%. Net energy metering (NEM) is a process in which solar owners send their excess daytime production to the grid in exchange for credit on their utility bill, covering nighttime and cloudy day energy use. The process has been instrumental in launching distributed rooftop solar across the United States, helping homeowners secure a more resilient source of energy while saving on bills.
Those who follow the solar industry have heard a similar story numerous times before. There are ongoing high-profile NEM rulemaking cases in California and Florida, and more utilities continue to push the idea that local, distributed clean energy causes grid issues and cross-subsidization of the rich by the poor. These concepts have been debunked in California, and now an independent study of the Idaho energy market appears to have found critical issues with Idaho Power’s analysis of the value of rooftop solar.
“Idaho Power’s study fails to quantify important benefits of distributed solar that are known and measurable, will impact rates, and will benefit Idaho ratepayers and citizens,” said the report.
Idaho Power’s internal study determined that excess power generated by rooftop solar owners is worth 2.8 to 4 cents per kWh, while an independent study by Crossborder Energy determined that same energy is worth nearly five times that value at 18.3 cents per kWh. Currently, net metered rooftop solar is paid at the retail rate of energy, about 8 to 10 cents per kWh.
“This study shows what many of us already expected, that Idaho Power would use a biased approach to protect its own interests of owning and profiting from solar power,” said Lisa Young, Director of the Idaho Chapter of the Sierra Club. “Regulators need to step up here and make sure Idahoans interested in rooftop solar have a chance to produce their own affordable, clean energy.”
Crossborder determined that Idaho Power used outdated data and made poor assumptions to arrive at lower compensation rates. It neglected to include benefits like the long-term hedge against natural gas price volatility, rate impacts of carbon emissions, and infrastructure benefits like avoided line losses and transmission buildout deferral. It also over-valued the cost of integrating rooftop solar by a factor of five, said the study.
“Blaine County has set a goal to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035. If Idaho Power doesn’t correctly value customer generated roof-top solar, it will hamper our ability to generate local electricity, an important tool to achieve this goal,” said Scott Runkel, member of Climate Action Coalition of the Wood River Valley.
The Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) is currently reviewing Idaho Power’s study, along with Crossborder’s independent study. Those interested in signing a petition to support fair rooftop solar rulemaking in Idaho can use this link provided by the Sierra Club Idaho.

GameChange Solar unveiled a new fixed-tilt racking system for ground-mounted projects. It has a 5-degree or 10-degree east-west landscape configuration.
The MaxDensity system is designed to maximize the number of modules packed onto a site, with a ground coverage ratio of up to 98%. It can be installed in blocks of up to 7 MW, in configurations of up to 12,000 modules. It supports all commercially available framed modules, according to the company.
The system can handle up to 120 mph wind and heavy snow loads. The company claims a cost of $0.039/W in the United States and $0.029/W globally for a typical 105 mph wind load with moderate soil corrosion.
“MaxDensity has much fewer part types than a typical fixed tilt racking system, making it faster than conventional fixed tilt structures,” it said in a statement. “There is no heavy equipment such as pile drivers required, only handheld tools are needed.”
GameChange Solar has an established footprint in both the United States and globally. The company has demonstrated steady growth since founding in 2012 and in 2020 was ranked the third largest solar tracker company in the United States and sixth globally by Wood Mackenzie.
In December 2021, GameChange Solar Holdings Corp., received an investment of $150 million from Koch Strategic Platforms (KSP), a subsidiary of Koch Investments Group. The preferred stock investment, if converted, would represent a minority stake in GameChange. In addition to capital investment, Koch and GameChange are exploring further synergies across Koch Industries, including KBX, a global transportation, logistics, and technology arm, and Koch Engineered Solutions.
In August GameChange Solar announced that a new, 6 GW tracker tube line will begin operations in the Midwest in February 2023, supporting the rapid growth of solar power plants in the United States. With the addition of the highly automated facility GameChange will bring its U.S. tracker tube capacity to 14 GW. The exact location in the Midwest had not been disclosed at press time.

The investment is expected to have positive cascading effects for a wide range of industries. Vacuum pumps are an essential component of the manufacturing processes for semiconductors, solar cells, modules, and ingots.  Located in Genesee County in upstate New York, this new facility is expected to create 600 jobs within the 1,250-acre STAMP mega-site, which features high-capacity, low-cost 100% renewable electricity in a strategic tech corridor.
After the COVID-19 pandemic revealed weaknesses in global supply chains, there has been a push to secure them domestically for vital manufacturing components. For the solar supply chain, the fraught trade relationship with China, and the global energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have further emphasized this.
“Against a backdrop of growing demand, clearly showing a greater need for investment in manufacturing capabilities that are located close to our customers, we continue to commit significant investment in our operational footprint,” said Kate Wilson, president of Edwards’ Semiconductor business.
Building upon Micron’s recent $100 billion investment in semiconductor production in central New York, the Empire State is quickly rising as a global leader in the semiconductor and renewables manufacturing industries.
This transformation has been driven in part by New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act, and the combination of state and federal CHIPS bills. Substantial progress is still needed to meet the CLCPA’s goal of 70% renewable energy by 2030, including 10 GW of distributed solar, 3 GW of storage, and to reach a carbon-free electricity sector by 2040.
The next part of New York’s energy saga will be determined on Nov. 8, as voters go to the polls for the gubernatorial election and the Environmental Bond Act of 2022, which proposes a $4.2 billion issuance in green bonds from the state, with $1.2 billion going to climate mitigation and renewable energy.

The Ohio facility features a 40,000 square foot technology lab staffed by CSA experts providing solutions that include electrical safety evaluation, megawatt scale fire testing, environmental simulations, energy efficiency verification, performance testing, cybersecurity and grid interoperability evaluation solutions.
“With more industries seeking to decarbonize, the demand for energy storage and microgrid products continues to increase, and so does the need for testing, evaluation and certification services to help manufacturers demonstrate the safety, efficiency and performance of these products,” said David Weinstein, CSA Group’s president and CEO.
The testing solutions group’s DER laboratory expands CSA Group’s existing energy storage solutions in the North America, Europe and Chinese markets. Formed in 1969, CSA Group provides testing and standardization solutions to the power generation sector developed and followed by UL, IEC, ANSI, SCC and UN regulations.
Energy Storage System (ESS) standards CSA Group covers include:
1) ANSI/CAN/UL-1973 – Standard for Batteries for Use in Stationary, Vehicle Auxiliary Power and Light Electric Rail (LER) Applications
This bi-national safety standard covers cells, modules, and battery systems used in stationary applications. It includes specific safety criteria for well-known battery chemistries as well as construction and testing criteria. The standard is typically used in product testing and certification for storage battery evaluation in North America.
2) UL/CAN 9540 – Standard for Energy Storage Systems and Equipment
This bi-national standard applies broad requirements for all types of ESS, including stationary ESS connected to the power grid. It also sets standards for specific functional safety measures, including safety analysis and safety-related electrical and electronic controls. Electrical, mechanical, and environmental tests are included, as well as measures to evaluate inherent system design and performance, and how the system interfaces with infrastructure.
3) UL 9540A – Test Method for Evaluating Thermal Runaway Fire Propagation in Battery Energy Storage Systems
UL 9540A offers a test method for evaluating thermal runaway propagation in battery ESS. Referenced in the draft National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 855 standard, it aims to provide quantitative data to characterize potential fire events in ESS. Testing is to be done at the cell, module, unit, and possibly the installation level. UL is expecting to take this to the Standards Technical Panel (STP) process later this year, in order to begin to build industry consensus on the test procedure.
4) NFPA 855 – Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems
NFPA 855, which is expected to be published in 2019, outlines the requirements for installing stationary ESS. It covers lead acid and Ni-Cd systems greater than 70 kWh, lithium-ion and sodium systems greater than 20 kWh, and other systems greater than 10 kWh, all of which must be listed to UL 9540. The standard specifies minimum water fire suppression rates, or allows for alternate fire suppression if large scale testing is conducted. It also sets size and separation requirements.

“Following the adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, the need for a competitive clan technology tax credit in Canada is more important than ever,” the government said in its Statement.
The clean-tech tax credits will be offered to those who invest in net-zero technologies, battery storage and clean hydrogen. The move follows passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S., which was signed into law in August by President Joe Biden. The IRA includes a 10-year extension of the ITC at 30% of the cost of the installed equipment, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Years of uncertainty about the ITC created instability in the clean energy sector in the U.S., but the ten-year extension is seen as the kind of assurance that U.S. investors need in order to embrace clean technologies.
“While the IRA will undoubtedly accelerate the ongoing transition to a net-zero North American economy, it also offers enormous financial supports to firms that locate their production in the United States – from electric vehicle battery production, to hydrogen, to biofuels, and beyond,” the government said in the economic update. “Without new measures to keep pace with the IRA, Canada risks being left behind.”
The new 30% Canadian tax credit will apply to investments in renewable energy generation and storage, as well as in as low-carbon heating and zero-emission industrial vehicles. The Canadian government also plans a tax credit for hydrogen production, the design of which has yet to be determined.
The tax credit is just an initial part of Canada’s response. The Canadian government also proposed a 2% tax on corporate stock buybacks, that is meant to “encourage corporations to reinvest their profits in their workers and business,” the Statement said.
It is estimated that the tax will generate $1.5 billion over five years and will come into force on Jan. 1, 2023. It will also launch a growth fund, first announced in April, by the end of the year with a capitalization of $15 billion to help mitigate the risks private investors take on when investing in new technologies and infrastructure.
In next year’s budget, Canada will introduce new measures to increase advanced manufacturing competitiveness, the document said.
“What Canadian workers need is a government with a real, robust industrial policy; a government committed to investing in the net-zero transition, to bringing in new private investment, and to helping create good-paying jobs from coast-to-coast-to-coast,” said Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/07/federal-agencies-are-pursuing-37-rd-areas-to-help-reach-climate-goals/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 7, 2022",Federal agencies are pursuing 37 R&D areas to help reach climate goals,"The U.S. government is pursuing 37 research and development (R&D) opportunities to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050, says a White House report.

The R&D opportunities are listed in the chart above. The Department of Energy is taking the lead on most of them.
The report credits the importance of existing technologies such as solar, land-based wind, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles, saying they will “still be primary drivers” of decarbonization. But the report cites an International Energy Agency projection that “almost half” of the emissions reductions needed globally will “come from technologies that are currently at the demonstration or prototype phase.”
Identifying the 37 R&D priorities is “a first step toward a coordinated and accelerated national net-zero innovation strategy,” the report said.
Three recently enacted laws that support this strategy, said the report, are the CHIPS and Science Act, which allows for R&D that can include earlier-stage net-zero innovation, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which enables demonstration of clean hydrogen and carbon removal, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which accelerates deployment of clean energy technology through tax credits, loan guarantees, grants and rebates.
The report did not discuss specific funding levels available for R&D.
Power grid
Within the priority area of a net-zero power grid and electrification, the report focuses on four R&D opportunities.
“Transformational change” in electricity distribution is needed, the report said, to enable widespread electrification of vehicles, appliances and industry; integration of customers’ generation, storage, and flexible demand resources; and new grid architectures.
To advance transmission, the report said “innovations are needed” in transmission planning, grid-enhancing technologies, grid architecture, and operational control.
Beyond that, enabling transmission along the 48,000-mile interstate highway system, plus 140,000 miles of freight rail lines, could “accelerate siting and reduce the costs” of adding transmission. Meanwhile, R&D efforts could develop advanced construction methods for undergrounding high-voltage and high-capacity AC and DC cables.
As for long duration energy storage, the Department of Energy aims to reduce its cost by 90% within the decade.
Solar, wind R&D
Describing “advanced solar” opportunities, the report points to “innovative thin-film solar cells,” including solid-state perovskite, that could be easier and less energy-intensive to manufacture than silicon solar cells, and have higher efficiency, with “even higher” efficiency when used in tandem with silicon.
“Advanced wind” opportunities are seen for floating wind turbines, aimed at reducing costs for deep-water offshore wind to $45 per MWh. To get the power to shore, the R&D opportunity is to advance technologies and control systems for high-voltage direct-current long-distance transmission.
 The report sees a key role for net-zero hydrogen and ammonia, which could be produced with renewable power.
Other priorities
The other four priority areas listed in the report are efficient building heating and cooling, net-zero aviation, fusion energy at scale, and low-carbon industrial processes.
The White House report is the result of an interagency process, and is titled “U.S. innovation to meet 2050 climate goals: assessing initial R&D opportunities.” The list of R&D opportunities is subject to future revision, the report said.

The European Commission and the U.S. government have set up a task force to address EU concerns over the recent introduction of the IRA.
“The task force will address specific concerns raised by the EU related to the IRA,” the commission said in a statement in late October. “Both sides agreed on the importance of close coordination to support sustainable and resilient supply chains across the Atlantic, including to build the clean energy economy.”
Valdis Dombrovskis, the executive vice president of the European Commission, said the issue is a major concern for concern for many countries and businesses.
“It would appear that many of the green subsidies provided for in the act may discriminate against EU automotive, renewables, battery and energy-intensive industries,” said Dombrovskis.
According to Bloomberg, Brussels has asked the US government to remove discriminatory production requirements included in the act, as they could lead to “reciprocal or retaliatory measures.” The news outlet also reports that the European Commission is seeking an amicable solution to the matter, although it hasn’t excluded the possibility of bring the matter to the World Trade Organization.
The IRA – known technically as H.R. 5376 – Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 – covers a wide range of areas, including energy-related legislation. It increased the Investment Tax Credit for renewable energy projects from 26% to 30% and extended it to all storage projects. It also includes tax credits to manufacture solar panels, inverters, and racking components. In addition, there are more tax credits for electric vehicles, electrical panels, heat pumps, and many other products directly related to the renewables industry.
