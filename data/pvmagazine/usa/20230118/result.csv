https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/18/crafting-a-california-community-solar-market/,"COMMUNITY,EVENTS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 18, 2023",Crafting a California community solar market,"Championed by assembly member Chris Ward, AB 2316, the Community Renewable Energy Act takes aim at four acute problems in the California power market: reliability, rates, climate, and equity.  
The law creates a community renewable energy program, including community solar-plus-storage, to overcome access barriers for nearly half of Californians who rent or have low incomes. Community solar typically involves customers subscribing to an off-site solar facility, receiving a utility bill credit for the power it generates. 
pv magazine USA joined industry players, community stakeholders, and political leaders in San Diego this week at the RE+ Community Solar Power Summit, to discuss the foundations of this emerging market in California and countrywide. 
Now that the law has been passed following a signature from Governor Gavin Newsom, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will undergo a rulemaking process. Public comment will close Friday, January 20, and will be revisited in February once the Internal Revenue Service offers guidance on how to access funds contained in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). 
Ward delivered a keynote speech at the conference, noting that there is “strong political will” throughout the state legislature to “leave no stone unturned” in pushing forward toward the state’s clean energy goals. He promised that he has been “holding the CPUC’s feet to the fire” to move through the rulemaking process in a timely manner, as the board has been notorious for dragging its feet in the past. 
The law, which was passed in under a year, moved through legislation must faster than usual because it represents a “product market fit,” said Richard Caperton, vice president of policy and market development at Arcadia, a cleantech data provider.  
Caperton presented in a panel along with representatives from Solar Landscape, Dimension Energy, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The panel generally shared the sentiment that the law has come just in time to address the needs of California’s grid and its ratepayers. 
This “good timing” comes as the state has proceeded to slash incentives for rooftop solar, while the federal government opens up funds via the IRA to boost cleantech over the next decade. The panel members and other industry stakeholders are working actively with CPUC to ensure that this window of opportunity is not missed. 
Two attempts have been made in the past in California to set up a community solar market, and they have generally been considered failures due to poor structuring. The Enhanced Community Renewables within the Green Tariff Shared Renewables program (GTSR) has zero projects in operation after nine years due to unfinanceable rates, said the Community for Solar Access (CSA). CSA said another model, the Community Solar-Green Tariff program is also ineffective as it is expensive, fails to support disadvantaged communities, and a mechanism for controlling cost shift onto non-participants is limiting the program’s growth. 
The panel expressed that AB 2316’s language is stronger than those programs of the past. It is based on New York’s program, which has established the state as the nation’s leader in community solar. While past community solar programs (and rooftop solar programs) have been nixed due to cross-subsidization of participants by non-participants, this new program bases compensation rates on this “cost shift.”
The new program will base its bill credit rates on the Avoided Cost Calculator (ACC), which aims to maximize compensation rates while leading to no cost shift. While the ACC has been criticized for being more friendly to investor-owned utilities and less so to ratepayers, the panel noted that it can be updated every two years. Rick Umoff, senior director and council, California, SEIA, said that deferred transmission and distribution costs need to be more properly evaluated in future ACC rate calculations.
Umoff shared that a proposed decision on the rules of this program could come as early as July 2023, but there is a possibility that the procedure lasts until late 2023 or even early 2024. 
Rates, reliability, climate, equity 
Umoff described the new community solar program as “Wholesale DG” (distributed generation). This model of building power generation touches on the four problems of rates, reliability, climate, and equity. 
It addresses ratepayer problems by adding low-cost energy to the grid. The Department of Energy estimates community solar subscribers save an average of 20% on their bills. The distributed nature of community solar generally requires significantly less transmission and distribution infrastructure to support it when compared to the traditional centralized model of power generation, which should pass forward to ratepayers as savings. 
When paired with energy storage, the technology vastly improves resilience. Under ever-increasing extreme weather threats, a decentralized structure of power generation lessens or negates the downtime caused by a downed transmission wire or knocked-out central power source.
Community solar fights climate-change causing emissions and furthers the march towards a decarbonized energy sector. The Biden Administration set a goal this year to sign up 5 million community solar households, achieving $1 billion in bill savings by 2025. The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. This target would entail a jump from 3 GW installed capacity to 20 GW by the target year.

The program has energy equity baked into its structure, working to make sure Californians of all income levels participate in the benefits of the energy transition. Not only does it open solar access to renters, the law ensures that at least 51% of subscribers are low-income customers, which is expected to make projects eligible for a 10% tax credit adder under the IRA. 
Plus, fossil fuel peaker plants, which are known to cause a myriad of serious harms to public health, are typically located in low-income communities. By building solar in these communities, California can accelerate the retirement of fossil fuel plants. 
The Community Renewable Energy Act was sponsored by the Coalition for Community Solar Access, and met with strong support from groups like SEIA, GRID Alternatives, Vote Solar, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and many others.
Notably, investor-owned utilities, which serve over 75% of the electricity usage in the state, opposed the bill. Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, and Southern California Edison all signed on in opposition to the bill.
“Community renewable energy is a proven powerful tool to help close California’s clean energy gap, bringing much needed relief to millions struggling with high housing costs and utility debt,” said Alexis Sutterman, energy equity program manager at the California Environmental Justice Alliance. “All families will finally have a choice to save on electric bills while unplugging from dirty power and joining the fight against climate change. As this program takes off, California will build the affordable and reliable clean energy supplies needed to retire polluting fossil fuel-powered plants in environmental justice communities and pursue a cleaner, safer future.”

Located in Maricopa County, Arizona, the 285 MWdc solar and 215 MWac / 860 MWh storage project will be the largest solar-plus-storage project in Longroad’s operational portfolio.
“Arizona is an important growth market, and Longroad currently has a 4 GW operating and development portfolio in the state.  Longroad believes the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act will enable further development in the state and provide significant benefits for utilities and ratepayers,” said Paul Gaynor, chief executive officer of Longroad Energy.
Sun Streams 3 will provide enough electricity to power 90,000 homes, which will be purchased by APS under a long-term power purchase agreement.
Longroad acquired Sun Streams 3 from First Solar in early 2021 as part of a transaction that included multiple projects in Arizona, including the 200 MWdc Sun Streams 2 solar project. Sun Streams 2 came online in 2021 and has a 20-year revenue agreement with Microsoft for the project’s energy, renewable energy credits, and offtake capacity, which will support a Microsoft datacenter region known as West US 3.
First Solar is supplying Series 6+ solar modules for the Sun Streams 3 project. The battery energy storage system (BESS) will be delivered by Powin, a U.S.-based energy storage system provider. The BESS will include SMA inverters and cells from Envision AESC. Nextracker is supplying trackers for the project and SunGrow is supplying the inverters.   Operations and maintenance services will be provided by NovaSource and Longroad’s affiliate Longroad Energy Services.
Debt financing was led by CIBC and KeyBank, and included ANZ, Commerzbank, PNC and Silicon Valley Bank. KeyBanc Capital Markets and CIBC served as Coordinating Lead Arrangers.  U.S. Bank is the project’s tax equity investor.
“We believe everyone has a role to play in creating a sustainable future and helping reduce the impacts of climate change,” said Eric Barr, business development officer with U.S. Bancorp’s Environmental Finance team. “Investments like this are one way we can do our part and we’re proud to partner again with Longroad to expand access to clean energy.”
During construction, Sun Streams 3 is projected to employ over 300 people. McCarthy Building Companies, which also built the adjacent Sun Streams 2 project, was selected as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor on the project.
The project represents 460,000 metric tons of avoided CO2 emissions annually, or the equivalent of taking ~100,000 cars off the road for as long as the project operates. Sun Streams 3 will generate more than $65 million in revenue for Arizona schools through long-term leases with the Arizona State Land Department.
Longroad Energy was one of five companies ranked in Mercom’s 2022 solar funding report among the top corporate financings, with $500 million raised in August 2022 from MEAG, the asset management arm of Munich Re, and prior investors the NZ Super Fund and Infratil.  Formed in 2016, Longroad has developed or acquired 4.3 GW of renewable energy projects across the United States and has raised $10 billion of equity, debt, and tax equity to support completion of its portfolio. Today, Longroad owns over 2.4 GW of wind, solar, and storage projects and operates and manages a total of 4.0 GW on behalf of Longroad and third parties.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/18/coram-energy-to-deploy-646-mwh-abc-batteries-in-southern-california/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CALIFORNIA,MICHIGAN",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 18, 2023",Coram Energy to deploy 646 MWh ABC batteries in southern California,"The Palm Desert region of southern California was an early innovator in renewable energy, with picturesque Tehachapi Pass wind farms dotting the horizon and utility-solar projects cropping up over the last decade. To fully harness the daily potential of wind and solar energy, the region will soon unveil a new grid-scale energy storage system portfolio from a project developer whose roots lie in its renewable energy market.
Advanced Battery Concepts received a 646 MWh order from Coram Energy, a renewable energy project developer, to deploy battery storage systems in utility-scale projects in Los Angeles and the Coachella Valley of southern California.
Coram Energy’s founder Brian O’Sullivan was the original developer of the Tehachapi Pass wind farms in the Palm Desert region.  In 2012, Coram sold a 50% interest in a 102 MW wind project portfolio plus 22 MW of operated wind farms in the Tehachapi region to Brookfield Renewable Partners.
ABC secured the agreement by offering a solution to storing excess local wind and solar generation at what it says was lower acquisition, operation, maintenance and lifecycle costs, resulting in an improved levelized cost of stored energy and return on investment for the operator, versus lithium-ion competitors.
The battery system is based on ABC’s recently released BOX-BE Energy Storage System, a DC battery pack that stores and delivers 341 kWh of daily energy at power delivery rates up to 1.8 MW, using the EverGreenSeal bipolar battery cell.
The Coram supply agreement is built on an initial project consisting of three phases: an initial demonstration followed by two installations at two sites representing 646 MWh, using 2,000 BOX-BE systems.
“Coram in striving to improve renewable source power reliability for California customers, seeking the best available energy storage products for present and future economical operation from a company with matching values,” said Dr. Edward Shaffer, founder and chief executive officer of ABC. “ABC’s BOX-BE ESS embodies our priorities of economic, social and environmental responsibility.”
Following the sale of the Tehachapi wind farms to Brookfield, Brian O’Sullivan headed Mexico Power Group, a Mexican wind project developer that partnered with private equity investor First Reserve in 2015 to build the first utility-scale wind farm south of the border, La Bufa (130 MW) wind in Zacatecas, Mexico.  Volkswagen Mexico produces cars in Zacatecas using clean power produced from the La Bufa wind farm, whose power-purchase agreement expires in 2033.
Formed in 2009, Clare, Michigan-based Advanced Battery Concepts has advanced a lead-acid battery that recycles numerous components found in traditional batteries.  The company has raised $16.75 million in growth equity to date from Nuveen Global Impact Fund and other investors.  Founder Ed Shaffer told MiBiz on January 9 that ABC is in the midst of raising an additional $50 million equity round.
The California Public Utilities Commission filed a 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP) which adopts a target of 25.5GW of supply-side renewable energy and 15GW of energy storage and demand response capacity by 2032. The renewable capacity targets would effectively raise the state’s portfolio to 73%.
With the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, California sees significant incremental energy storage additions, at 6.5 GW from 2022 to 2030, according to BloombergNEF’s second half 2022 Energy Storage Cost Outlook. While batteries are already the preferred choice for system capacity shortfalls in the state, the standalone investment tax credit in the IRA makes the economics of storage projects much more attractive.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/18/new-mexico-hvdc-transmission-line-to-carry-4-gw-of-renewable-energy/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,ARIZONA,NEW MEXICO",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 18, 2023",New Mexico HVDC transmission line to carry 4 GW of renewable energy,"The proposed $2 billion, 400-mile high-voltage direct current (HVDC) North Path transmission line will have the capacity to move up to 4 GW of renewable energy produced in northeastern New Mexico to the state’s Four Corners region, powering the equivalent of two million homes in New Mexico and across the Southwest. The project will advance through a partnership between the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority (RETA) and Invenergy Transmission.
The North Path line is expected to begin construction in 2025 and reach completion in 2028. The power will flow through Union County, which RETA estimates has the highest potential in the state for wind energy generation and strong solar potential.

The project will create 3,500 jobs during construction, and generate tens of millions of dollars in annual tax payments to tribal, state and local governments.
“New Mexico North Path will deliver not only clean energy but a wide array of benefits across New Mexico, and we are glad this partnership with RETA shows the project is aligned with the state’s long term energy strategy and goals,” said Will Consuegra, director of transmission development at Invenergy.
Southwestern states have great renewable energy potential, but lack of transmission capacity has been a challenge. With new development of HVDC and AC power lines, the southwest region’s renewable energy generation can be more widely distributed.
Another major transmission project was approved recently by the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC).  SunZia is a 550-mile 525-volt HVDC transmission project. Separately, the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission issued two approvals of Pattern Energy’s SunZia Wind project, a 3.5 GW proposed wind project in New Mexico that will provide power across the transmission line to Pinal County, Arizona. Once complete, the SunZia Transmission and Wind project represents the largest clean energy project in the U.S., including $8 billion in total investments. It will provide power from central New Mexico to what is estimated to be more than 3 million residents of central Arizona.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/18/cca-must-procure-1300-gwh-of-supply-to-meet-last-37-gwh-of-demand/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 18, 2023","CCA must procure 1,300 GWh of supply to meet last 37 GWh of demand","Peninsula Clean Energy is a community-controlled, not-for-profit Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) program that serves 20 cities and towns in San Mateo County, Calif., and it’s setting an aggressive pace.
The program has developed and released at no cost a tool called MATCH (Matching Around-The-Clock Hourly energy). The tool projects how the CCA will reach their 100% clean energy goals by 2025. In its analysis, the group found that in order to supply around 3,700 GWh of clean energy each year, it will need to procure a capacity of nearly double that amount.
Making the final leap from 99% to 100% comes at a cost. Peninsula found that while moving to a 100% clean energy supply increases costs by 27%, a 99% clean energy supply would increase costs by only 9%. These cost increases are based on the current trajectory of their portfolio, which is on track to procure 71% of its hourly time-matched electricity by 2025.

In a world where Peninsula can sell excess renewable energy credits and resource adequacy from its excess capacity, the pricing for its customers will be much lower. However, as Peninsula notes, some time in the future clean credits will no longer carry value because everyone will have clean energy. At that point, we will need to do something else with the excess electricity (like transmission, storage, EV charging, hydrogen production, etc). For Peninsula’s customers in 2025, however, the expected resale will produce a financial gain that benefits their wallets. That’s because in 2025 there will still be plenty of ratepayers seeking to purchase RECs to offset their carbon sins.
The region’s 810,000 residents, who hold 310,000 residential and business accounts, should be happy to learn that a 99% hourly match of clean electricity will increase the cost of their electricity by only 2%. And that last 1% bump, to reach 100%, would add only 10% to the total cost of electricity. At 100% clean electricity, Peninsula will be able to resell 75% of their renewable energy credits. 
Key to understanding the accounting behind ‘matching’ is the concept of annual versus hourly time-matching. Peninsula currently gets 100% of its annual electricity from renewable and carbon free sources; however, “in the hours where renewable supply is insufficient to meet customer demand, generic energy from the system is used to serve customer demand. The generic energy is typically from fossil fuel generation, which, in California, is mainly from methane gas.”

So, while Peninsula’s annual renewable energy is already at 100%, this is achieved by purchasing the same number of clean GWh that are consumed in a year irrespective of when energy is actually consumed. In the 100% hourly matching scenario, each hour of customer demand must be supplied by renewable energy that is either generated or dispatched from storage in that same hour.
The MATCH model that did all of this work was developed by Peninsula along with Jesse Jenkins of Princeton University’s Andlinger Center for Energy & Environment. It is open source and free for public use.

By 2025, Peninsula expects the majority of its generation to be produced by solar power, either directly at time of generation or via energy storage. That last 1% comes with additional costs beyond a price increase of 18%. It comes with excess generation capacity:
Matching the last 1% of demand requires procuring 34% more supply. That is, for our load of approximately 3,700 GWh per year, in order to serve the last 37 GWh of demand, we must procure an additional 1,300 GWh of supply.
Excess electricity produces a lot more than additional costs – it also provides new opportunities. The table below suggests that if the CCA reaches its 100% 24/7 clean electricity target, it will result in an 80% generation surplus.

Unless the U.S. becomes very efficient at deploying nationwide power grid transmission upgrades, along with significant distribution upgrades, Peninsula will see a large quantity of battery deployments.
In the hourly 100% scenario of the capacity deployed table above, Peninsula ranks energy storage as its second largest source of served electricity. Going forward, the CCA notes that pricing is likely to get more competitive as newer long-term energy storage technologies become more cost effective.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/18/department-of-defense-maintains-strong-commitment-to-renewable-energy/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",BRIAN SAVAGE,"JANUARY 18, 2023",Department of Defense maintains strong commitment to renewable energy,"The Department of Defense (DoD) is no stranger to the deleterious effects of climate change. The DoD notes that climate change has helped drive $13 billion in damages from natural disasters and extreme weather events to more than ten DoD bases from 2017 to 2021.
Notably, Air Force Base Tyndall in Florida suffered $4.7 billion in damages in 2018 from Hurricane Michael. The DoD estimates over 1,700 installations could be affected by sea-level rise. As a study from the U.S. Naval College noted in 1990, this threat goes beyond environmental changes to our oceans, coastlines, and temperatures, but offers risks to national security, and demands fundamental changes.
Adversaries of the U.S. may have already weaponized energy and the world’s dependence on fossil fuels. Russia’s recent attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have exposed critical vulnerabilities that microgrids could prevent. Deploying renewable energy effectively lowers risks in the field of operations as well.
A 2009 report from Deloitte directly correlated this risk noting the “increasing number of convoys required to transport an ever-increasing requirement for fossil fuels is itself a root cause of casualties” due to the usage of explosive devices.  The issue was further highlighted in 2019, when Iranian drones attacked Saudi oil facilities, knocking out 5% of the world’s oil supply, and causing a 20% spike in crude oil prices. As General James Mattis stated in 2003, the U.S. military needs to be “unleashed from the tether of fuel.”
Today that “tether” remains strong. The 2021 DoD Annual Energy Management and Resilience Report notes the “DoD is the largest single energy-consuming entity in the U.S., both within the federal government and as compared to any single private-sector entity,” and that “DoD operational and installation energy consumption represents approximately 76% of federal energy consumption,” 14 times higher than the next government agency, the postal service.
To curtail these massive emissions, the DoD has two federally mandated renewable energy goals. The DoD aims to reach 25% renewables by 2025.  Under Section 203 of the Energy Policy Act, the DoD is forecast to consume at least 7.5% renewable energy as a percentage of total electricity consumption after 2013. These early goals have helped drive the adoption of renewables across all military branches. In 2021 the DoD reached an average production or procurement of 15.8% renewable energy, and consumption of 6.5% of total facility electricity consumption from renewables, or 1.92 GWh across 2,127 renewable energy projects.
As a result, in 2021 the DoD achieved a 30.1% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2008 baseline.

Image: Office of the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer
Recent changes signal a focused and structured effort than past federally mandated goals. In 2021, President Biden issued Executive Orders 14008 and 14057. EO 14008 requires that climate considerations “be an essential element of United States foreign policy and national security.” EO 14057 requires the “Federal government to lead by example in order to achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050.”  In 2022, each military branch published a climate strategy with actionable goals and objectives to enhance their respective forces and meet these new standards.
The Army Climate Strategy (ACS) is perhaps the most robust of these. The ACS identifies goals of a 50% reduction in the Army’s net GHG emissions by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, net zero Army GHG emissions by 2050, and an incorporation of the security implications of climate change into strategy, planning, acquisition, supply chain, and other processes. There are three “lines of effort” that link the necessary tasks with these goals.
The first line of effort targets installations with the strategic outcome being enhanced resilience and sustainability by adapting infrastructure. To accomplish this, the Army is aiming to install a microgrid on every installation by 2035 and to secure 100% carbon-pollution-free electricity for Army installations by 2030. Microgrids use solar or other local energy sources combined with energy storage to generate power for a building or group of buildings, enabling them to operate in “island mode” by disconnecting from the grid.
One of the Army’s resiliency goals is to install a microgrid on every installation by 2035. These will include renewable generation and large-scale battery storage, with the goal being able to “self-sustain its critical missions” on all Army installations by 2040. In addition, the Army aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half from its buildings by 2032, compared to 2005. Part of the plan is for light-duty non-tactical vehicles to be all-electric by 2027, and all non-tactical vehicles would be electric by 2035.
In August 2022, the Biden administration announced the Climate Smart Building initiative, which aims to modernize federal buildings while cutting emissions. A $140 million infrastructure and energy resilience project at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) in New Jersey is a part of that initiative and will include a 32 MW solar facility with a 2 MW/ 4 MWh battery energy storage system.
In addition to cutting emissions on military bases, the DoD is targeting acquisition and logistics to “increase operational capability while reducing sustainment demand and strengthening climate resilience.” This includes developing resilient supply chains and a clean procurement process. This will involve attaining net-zero GHG emissions from all Army procurements by 2050, which may catalyze defense contractors to make significant investments in renewable energy.
Another step involves the training of personnel in sustainability. For example, West Point recently announced a partnership to create a Sustainable Infrastructure, Resilience and Climate Consortium to “educate future Army leaders on how sustainability and resilience can increase the readiness of the force while simultaneously addressing the threats of climate change.”
Bipartisan solution
These goals are not empty promises, nor greenwashing to score political points. As the U.S. military is one of the biggest sources of emissions, its sustainability efforts will not only have a positive effect on the environment, but serve as an example of the potential of investing in clean energy.
The DoD is in the unique position of being able invest in sustainability efforts with significant bipartisan support. For example, the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, passed in December with a vote of 83-11. The new bill includes $247 million in funding to improve energy on efficiency and mitigate logistics risk; $807 million is allocated for clean energy research and development; and another $2 billion allocated for climate resilience.
