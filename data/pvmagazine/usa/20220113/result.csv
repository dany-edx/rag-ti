The capacity is set to come across three separate installations, all of which Silicon Ranch will fund, construct, own, operate, and maintain, while Green Power EMC will purchase all the energy and environmental attributes generated by the facilities on behalf of its member cooperatives.
Snipesville III is expected to be the first project in the portfolio to reach commercial operation, a 107 MW slated for construction in Jeff Davis County, west of Savannah. Construction is expected to commence later this year, and the facility is scheduled to be operational by mid-2023. The site will be in close proximity to its two sibling projects: Snipesville I, and 86 MW installation which became active in December 2020, and Snipesville II, a 107 MW installation completed in December 2021.
The second project, chronologically, is set to be DeSoto II, a 65 MW solar facility located in Lee County, nearby to Jeff Davis County. Silicon Ranch expects to begin construction in late 2022 and plans to bring the facility online by late 2023. Much like the Snipes projects, DeSoto II will be built next to DeSoto I, a 250 MW installation that recently began construction. The DeSoto I facility will serve Walton EMC to support Meta’s Georgia operations.
Last but not least, the Ailey solar project will be an 80 MW solar facility located in Montgomery County, also west of Savannah. Silicon Ranch plans to construct the project in 2024 and projects the facility to be online later that year.
The companies also share that Silicon Ranch will focus on hiring local craft workers in Jeff Davis, Lee, and Montgomery Counties to construct the projects over the next three years, adding benefits to the community beyond the tax revenue they will provide.
Each of the projects will integrate Silicon Ranch’s Regenerative Energy model, through which the company co-locates solar energy production with regenerative agriculture practices. Upon completion and operation, Silicon Ranch will restore the land  each project is located on to a functioning grassland ecosystem, managing any vegetative growth around the projects via sheep grazing using regenerative pastureland management practices.

The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) reports the U.S. solar industry employs about 230,000 workers, and SolarReviews estimates that as many as 68,000 jobs are at stake due to the value-slashing nature of the proposed decision.
A recent survey held by SolarReviews found that 95% of active California solar shoppers would decline to go solar if the proposed decision is passed in its current form.
In a webinar held by ROTH Capital Partners, grid and rate design expert Dr. Ahmad Faruqui condemned the proposal, saying that it would expand the payback period for a typical solar system to 20 years or beyond.
The proposal includes a roughly 80% reduction in the payment for excess solar energy sent to the grid, and tacks on an $8 per kW monthly charge for all solar customers, regardless of whether they have battery energy storage or not. A common-sized 8 kW system would be charged $64 a month, a fee that makes solar cost-prohibitive for most customers.
NEM 3.0 is set to be decided on January 27th by the CPUC.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/13/survey-says-95-of-shoppers-would-not-buy-solar-under-nem-3-0/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 13, 2022",Survey says 95% of shoppers would not buy solar under NEM 3.0,"The California Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 proposal is set to be decided upon on January 27th, and many are calling the policy a potential death blow to the California solar industry, with one grid expert even dubbing it a “proposed dystopia.” 
The proposal calls for a slashing of payments to homeowners for their excess solar generation, reducing the payment from a retail rate ($0.22-$0.36/kWh) to an avoided-cost rate ($0.04-$0.05/kWh). The reason behind this change is to fix a growing problem of a cost shift that solar customers (particularly ones without energy storage) dump onto non-solar customers. Payments to solar customers for excess generation at the retail rate creates an increased cost for utilities, which is then spread among all customers in the form of rising rates. 
While this is damaging to the value of non-battery solar, existing customers on NEM 1.0 and 2.0 are grandfathered in to their old rates for an additional 15 years. New solar customers face a rate structure where it doesn’t make much financial sense to buy a system without a battery. Batteries represent a significant increased cost, and while they offer savings from smart import/export rates, are supported by the SGIP rebate, and offer backup power, the picture has worsened for prospective solar shoppers overall under the new rates, said informational site SolarReviews. 
Andy Sendy of SolarReviews joined pv magazine to discuss the findings of a recent survey of 4,000 actively shopping solar customers in California, and the results were damning. It found that under the proposed net metering payment changes, 68.4% of people actively considering going solar said they would no longer be interested. 
However, the rate change was not the worst element of the proposed decision in Sendy’s view, and SolarReviews website reflected that sentiment. The proposal also calls for an $8 per kW grid participation charge, or as Sendy calls it “a tax on solar customers.” This means each month a solar customer with a typical 8 kW system would pay $64 every month just to be connected to the grid.  
The survey’s results spell doom for the California residential solar industry: 95.4% of respondents said they would no longer buy solar under a decision that lowers payments and adds a grid access charge. 
Sendy said that this solar industry-killing proposal is built off false assumptions, and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) use of a 2013 grid study to justify the plans is outdated and misguided. He said that if the grid access charge is meant to pay for the cost-shift created by NEM 1.0 and 2.0 customers, it will struggle to generate revenue if nobody wants to buy solar anymore.
For solar shoppers interested in understanding how the NEM 3.0 would affect the economics of buying solar, SolarReviews has integrated the assumptions from the proposed decision into its Solar Calculator.
Another area of concern for Sendy is that the proposed decision is agnostic to new customers whether they have a battery attached or not. He believes battery-attached systems should be treated differently, as they minimally affect the cost-shift problem that standalone solar causes through import-export rates.

Batteries even help reduce costs for the grid, and thereby Californians at large, said Sendy. As electrification of appliances and vehicles commences, and more generation sources enter the grid, a need for upgraded transmission and substations is created. A substation comes with multi-million-dollar upgrade cost, which would then be shifted down to Californians in the form of rate raises.
Sendy said, rather than upgrade the grid and penalize prospective solar owners, why not incentivize batteries? Batteries lessen the need for localized transmission, making the grid more flexible, and reducing the need for substation rebuilds.
Sendy said he’d like to see the $8/kW charge reduced or removed, or only placed on new solar customers who decide they do not want battery energy storage. “For solar to become the dominant energy source, we need to accept that storage is an essential piece,” said Sendy. He suggested the SGIP rebate, which lessens the cost of a battery, to be increased to $350/kW to encourage more storage.
In a state facing increasing extreme weather, wildfires, and blackouts, due to rapidly growing energy demand, an investment in batteries would improve resilience for Californians.
Another chilling possibility Sendy sees as a result of the proposed decision is its negative impact on the California mandate that requires solar on all new buildings. He said because of the very poor cost picture, builders would likely integrate a very small, maybe 2 kW, “token” system that keeps the building in compliance with law. These small systems would represent a lost opportunity for a state pursuing steep decarbonization goals.
In a recent statement, Governor Gavin Newsom said that there is still “work to do” on the proposed decision, indicating that there is a possibility the proposal is changed in some way.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/13/all-solar-is-equal-rooftop-solar-is-more-equal/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 13, 2022","All solar is equal, rooftop solar is more equal","Cornell Researchers find in their paper, “Are big and small solar separate things?: The importance of scale in public support for solar energy development in upstate New York”, that while there is strong support for solar overall, support wanes when system size and site location are taken into account.
Cornell University
Data from Cornell’s mail polling shows support for rooftop solar at 4.37 out of 5, and support for distributed community solar at 3.94. ‘Large-scale solar’ had a rating of 3.04 – which is just above the survey’s mean.
Interestingly, at the time of the survey, large-scale solar power plants had not been built in the region that was polled.
The authors quoted residents who spoke at town meetings, as well as individuals who followed up on their mail card polling. Many residents took the time to explain that they do, generally, support solar. Respondents frequently approved of rooftop solar, but took exception to large-scale solar. For this reason, the researchers decided to separate solar into three distinct categories and to poll respondents with more specific questions based on a solar project’s scope.

Rooftop solar was defined as being individually owned, and sized according to onsite electricity use. Community solar was defined as a distributed asset, generally smaller than 50 acres, and based on subscription. Utility-scale solar may be owned either privately or by a corporation, and was defined as being larger than 100 acres. Utility scale was also required to be ‘grid connected for long-distance transmission’.
Data presented by Pew Research suggests there is very strong support for solar power on a national scale. However, this data also reveals that support for solar has fallen in recent years. Anecdotally, this decline in support aligns with a marked increase in large scale solar power development.

Delving a little deeper into the data, we find very strong support for rooftop solar in figure 3 (above). In all regions, slight + strong support for rooftop solar is above 80%. And while community solar development shows broad support around 60-80%, the Western region reported nearly 30% opposition to community solar.
Opinions on utility-scale solar provide a stark contrast from those on rooftop solar. In the Western region of the state, large-scale solar actually found more opposition than support.

Despite the opposition, opinions on large-scale solar development were considerably more nuanced when residents considered siting location. Support increased dramatically for siting on landfills. Unfortunately, the places that garnered the most support for utility-scale solar are typically too small to build utility-scale solar. Although landfills offer 60 gigawatts of untapped capacity in the United States, that volume represents a small fraction of the multiple terrawatts of capacity we need.
These polls give politicians some insights into how they should direct their efforts when suggesting future legislation. The numbers tell the story: rooftop solar has strong support, and significant potential – hundreds of gigawatts – certainly enough to support our power grids.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/13/navigating-the-foundation-risk-vs-reward/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 13, 2022",Navigating the foundation: risk vs. reward,"Developers or contractors typically must identify their choice of foundation before choosing their racking partner, sometimes even before completing the required extensive geotechnical assessments.
But picking the wrong foundation can leave your project dead in the water.
Each project’s unique profile contributes to understanding the financial and schedule implications of different foundations; a site fraught with rocks, boulders, or steep slopes poses different risks than a soft site. And an owner’s or contractor’s risk tolerance shifts depending on project financials and construction time of year. End-of-year projects are driven by compressed deadlines to get systems online in time to meet PPA production schedules. Others may have more time flexibility but face tighter budget constraints. The amount of risk developers are able to absorb varies and requires a case-by-case assessment.
Trawling for value across imperfect sites
Developers know all too well that “perfect” sites come at a price premium. Consequently, they’ve turned to constructing PV on rocky, hilly terrain to take advantage of the higher margins these discounted parcels can offer. While these opportunities may look lucrative at the start, unforeseen construction issues can make waves, turning a good project bad.
The trick is figuring out how to weigh the costs and benefits properly to pencil out strong projects able to deliver the best returns.
Selecting the right ground-mount foundation is key to optimizing a project’s cost and risk profile. On rockier, more rugged sites, refusal risks associated with hard soils, caliche, boulders, and other unexpected subterranean conditions must be considered. But even premium sites can present unique factors that carry varying ramifications for schedules and budgets.

Tacking between ground screws and pile foundations
There are costs and advantages to both pile foundations and ground screws.
Ground screws demand higher up-front material and construction costs but eliminate 100% of the refusal risks, minimize land grading, and slash other civil expenses. Paired with adaptable racking designed for flexible land use, ground screws can deliver reliable returns from unreliable sites.
On the flip side, pile foundations are the standard option for cost-effective PV. From a material and construction standpoint, they can be deployed quickly and reliably — on typical sites. In rugged or sloped terrain or in unpredictable conditions, however, pile foundations can leave your project high and dry, presenting costly and schedule-derailing refusals.
Digging deep to chart the right course
We brought together combined experience and field knowledge of seasoned engineers to compare two 10-MW sites — one with limited slopes and soft soil and the other with a more rugged, rocky profile that poses high refusal risks. For both sites, the team compared component material costs, installation costs, and time using either piles or ground screws.
The team first defined a baseline to identify the resources required to deploy each type of foundation. It then assessed the cost and schedule impact of remediating piles driven to refusal using different methods, synthesizing data for a high-refusal site with 50% refusals. The goal was to identify a break-even point within that environment above which ground screws would deliver better results.
At first glance, ground screw prices are higher than pile systems; screws cost 26% more. But screws are faster to deploy — 40% more ground screws can be installed in a day than piles.
Ground screws do not, however, require refusal remediation. When refusal costs are factored in, piles can quickly erode budgets and schedules. Using a standard drill-and-drive method, remediation adds an additional $250 per foundation to the initial $68 per unit install price. They also require more deployment time at the rate of 50 units per day. Scenarios that allow for a “cut and drill” remediation add $75 per pile and 100 foundations per day to the schedule.
Ensuring smooth sailing in a high-refusal environment
Refusals on a project can swing both ways. But defining a standard approach to each site using a scenario with a 50% risk of refusal allows for a cost and schedule comparison between the two types of foundations.
The table below highlights the advantages of using piles in a soft environment while also showing the risks they pose in a high-refusal project. For a soft 10-MW site, piles cost $7,238 less than screws, can be installed for $200,000 less, and go in four days faster than screws. Net result: A $0.021 per watt cost advantage.
But that same 10-MW project with a 50% refusal rate tells a different story; piles are no longer an effective option. While ground screw costs and time requirements remain constant, piles cost $19,575 more in materials, $143,000 more to install, and require a whopping 24-day extension to the construction schedule. In this scenario, ground screws offer a $0.016 per watt advantage over piles.
Bear in mind that the delayed schedule has severe repercussions. When estimating the actual cost of delays, the team found that the impact on other contractors and additional ancillary services can cost up to $25,000 per week — in this case exceeding $100,000 in losses for the developer over a four-week period.
Fishing for the ideal foundation
Admittedly, a 50% refusal site is not the norm. The question then becomes: At what refusal percentage do ground screws outperform piles? And what are the implications from both a cost and schedule perspective? The final step of the study involved identifying break-even points for both cost and installation time to determine an acceptable rate of refusal.
Installation costs alone indicate that a 29% refusal rate makes a site a good candidate for ground screws. Above this break-even point, installation cost for piles would exceed the $400,000 needed to install a ground screw system.
Refusals also impact schedules. In this scenario, both the pile and the ground screw systems would require a 26-day schedule, allowing for a refusal rate of up to 7%. Beyond that break-even point, each additional 15% of pile refusals would add another day to the schedule.
Plumbing the depths to deliver strongest returns
While a 29% refusal rate is the breakeven point in this scenario, we understand that every site is different, and each customer has their own set of goals and priorities. Although there is no one-size-fits-all, sites with a 20%-30% refusal rate require geotesting and engineering expertise and a complete foundation portfolio to ensure you have the best solution for your project.
Owners, developers, and contractors can stem the tide of project risks with an objective understanding of each site’s underground profile. Look for a racking partner with a broad mounting portfolio and deep experience across various types of foundations to steer your project toward stronger returns. A partner experienced in working with a variety of subterranean profiles can ensure cost and schedule certainty, unlocking maximum value for any project.

The Saint Solar plant, located in Coolidge, Arizona, is operational and currently serving customers. The 100 MW battery, expected to be operational in June 2023, will provide four hours of storage energy.
“The early deployment of large-scale battery storage systems will help us acquire operational experience with this new technology that will play a critical role in decarbonizing the power system,” said Kelly Barr, SRP’s Chief Strategy, Corporate Services and Sustainability Executive.
Negotiation of this contract began prior to SRP’s issuance of its current all-source request for proposals (RFP) and does not affect the amount of generation SRP is seeking through that process.
The Saint Solar plant is owned and operated by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. SRP selected the plant for the first phase of its Sustainable Energy Offering, through which SRP delivers solar energy to 11 of its largest business customers, giving them the ability to lower their carbon emissions by receiving a portion of their energy from solar power. The addition of battery storage at the Saint Solar plant will not reduce the amount of solar energy that those customers receive.
This project brings SRP’s battery storage commitment to nearly 500 MW by 2023.
“SRP should be commended for its commitment to battery storage, which will enable it to better serve its customers with renewable energy over more hours of the day, even when the sun isn’t shining,” said Matt Handel, senior vice president of development for NextEra Energy Resources. “We are very pleased to add energy storage to Saint Solar and continue to support SRP’s renewable energy goals.”
Under the terms of the agreement, NextEra Analytics, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, will provide the company’s proprietary Optos software platform to SRP for three years. Optos is an end-to-end energy management solution using artificial intelligence. It leverages data from nearly 5 GW of renewable energy assets owned and operated by NextEra Energy Resources and will help SRP optimize its renewable energy use.
SRP has contracted with NextEra Energy Resources for additional Arizona-based solar and battery storage projects including the Sonoran Energy Center, which will be the largest solar-charged battery project in the state. Sonoran Energy Center will be an approximately 260 MW solar system with the ability to charge a 1 GW/h energy storage system, and it will be built south of Buckeye. Additionally, SRP contracted for the output from an 88 MW solar and battery storage system called the Storey Energy Center to be built in the City of Coolidge. Both projects will be operated by subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources and are scheduled to become operational in June 2023.
SRP has also recently placed into service a 25-MW battery storage facility at its Bolster Substation, which is adjacent to its Agua Fria Generating Station, located in Peoria. The battery system consists of a series of Tesla Megapacks that are connected directly to SRP’s energy grid. SRP is also contracted for output from the Pinal Central Energy Center, a 20 MW solar plant paired with a 10 MW solar-battery system located in Pinal County, and the Dorman battery storage system, which is a 10 MW standalone battery storage system located in Chandler.
The utility has also closed the Navajo Generating Station, which was the largest coal plant in the Western U.S. and will have retired 2600 MW of coal-fired generation by 2032. SRP has a commitment to reducing carbon intensity (from 2005 levels) by more than 65% by 2035 and 90 percent by 2050.

Enphase Energy, a specialist in microinverter-based solar and battery systems, today announced that Enphase installers in Colorado are also seeing increased deployments of the Enphase Energy System, powered by IQ Microinverters and IQ Batteries, across the state.
“Colorado residents are often subject to extreme winter conditions that can cause power outages,” said Jay Bure, owner at Green Electrical, an Enphase Gold installer. “These weather events show the immense value Coloradans gain from investing in clean, reliable home backup power, allowing our customers to gain the energy independence they are looking for.”
Enphase delivers a safer solar-plus-battery solution that the company reports does not expose installers or homeowners to high-voltage DC. The Enphase IQ Battery features Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, which provides thermal stability that Enphase says results in a long cycle life and safer operation. The batteries are equipped with Enphase Power Start technology, which helps seamlessly power-up air conditioners and well-pumps. The Enphase App gives homeowners insight into the system, as well as the ability to go off-grid.
“With an average of more than 300 sunny days per year, Colorado has tremendous solar potential,” said Dave Ranhoff, chief commercial officer at Enphase Energy. According to SEIA, Colorado is currently ranked 13th in solar energy production, with 4.4% of the state’s electricity coming from solar. The growth projection is bright, anticipating an increase of 3,819 MW over the next five years, popping the state into 11th place.
