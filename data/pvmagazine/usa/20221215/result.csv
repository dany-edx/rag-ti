https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/15/california-pulls-the-plug-on-rooftop-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",California pulls the plug on rooftop solar,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) unanimously voted to approve Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM), slashing payments for excess solar production sent to the grid by 75%.
CPUC voted to cut the average export rate in California from $0.30 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh, making the cuts effective on April 15, 2023. Customers who have new systems installed and approved for grid interconnection before the effective date in April will be grandfathered in to NEM 2.0 rates.
During the vote, the Commission said the balancing of costs and benefits continue to be “quite generous” under the decision.
Currently, average net metering rates range from $0.23 per kWh to $0.35 per kWh, and the new proposed decision cuts those rates to an average of $0.05 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh. This is set to be the largest cut of export rates in U.S. history, in a market that represents roughly 50% of the nation’s residential solar market.
Payments were cut as a result of a reported cost shift where non-solar owners cross-subsidize solar owners for maintaining the grid. The utility-backed concept suggests poorer Californians are paying higher utility rates to pay for lost profits that utilities endure in order to pay solar owner for delivering clean energy to the grid.
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory studied the effect, and found that for the vast majority of states and utilities, the effects of distributed solar on retail electricity prices will likely remain negligible for the foreseeable future.” The study found that distributed solar “likely entails no more than a 0.03 cent/kWh long-run increase in U.S. average retail electricity prices, and far smaller than that for most utilities.”
Return on investment periods are estimated to move from an average of about 4.5 years to 6.5 years to 14.5 years, said Centrica Business Solutions.
As exported power loses its value, Californians now have their hand forced to adopt batteries with their solar installations if they want a reasonable return on investment.
“We believe this would represent a potential 70-85% drop in economic value for solar-only systems, which would suggest California would effectively become a 100% solar and storage end market, which ultimately makes solar much less accessible and affordable,” wrote Phil Shen, managing director, ROTH Capital Partners. 
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said the decision is “too abrupt” and will slow rooftop solar deployment in the state. “The failure to adopt a more gradual transition to net billing risks putting solar out of reach for millions of residents across the state,” said SEIA.
In 2016 to 2018, the state of Nevada went through massive oscillations in rooftop solar deployment after a similar net metering value reduction was approved. A $35 solar penalty fee, and a 75% drop in fees led to a nearly 90% drop in rooftop deployment growth in the state. 
“California’s residential solar segment could be down 30% year-over-year in the 12 months after this becomes effective,” wrote Shen.
The California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) said the state is currently installing roughly 30,000 batteries compared to 200,000 solar systems. High costs, supply chain constraints, inflation and permitting and interconnection delays and challenges means it could take years for storage to catch up to solar, said CALSSA.
Currently roughly 1.5 million consumers in California use net metering, including thousands of churches, farms, and affordable housing units. In total, 13 GW of distributed solar capacity has been installed across the state, the size of six Diablo Canyon nuclear sites.
Rooftop solar is valued for its ability to efficiently deliver clean power, limit the amount of transmission infrastructure needed to support generation, provide backup power and grid services, support small business, and more.
The CPUC found that California must triple the amount of local, distributed solar to reach the clean energy mandate laid out by the state’s Senate Bill 100. The California Solar and Storage Association forecast rooftop solar could save California ratepayers $120 billion by 2050, or $300 per person per year.
(Read: “Coalition received $1.7 million from three California utilities to push NEM 3.0, a rooftop solar ‘killer’“)
Environment California found that, based on a state regulator estimated deployment of 28.5 GW of rooftop solar through 2045, rooftop solar could prevent the development of 148,000 acres of land versus a centralized utility-scale-only model. That is an area about half the size of Los Angeles that could be preserved.
“[The decision] comes as climate-related disasters continue to intensify and the electric grid remains vulnerable to aging infrastructure and volatile global energy markets,” said SEIA. “Distributed solar and storage helps strengthen the grid and boost our resilience to these threats.”
Mark Jacobson, fellow and professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, said rooftop solar is important in protecting human health and minimizing risks. Replacing overhead wiring, overloaded transformers, and natural gas piping, rooftop solar replaces harmful and dangerous infrastructure from the built environment.
“The argument this proposal will help disadvantages communities is wrong… it will disproportionately kill them,” said Jacobson.
In 2017, electric utility PG&E’s downed transmission wires were found to be the cause of massive wildfires and leaving many Californians without homes. The company was stuck with a $7.5 billion bill as it was found at fault for negligence in maintaining vegetation around its centralized transmission wires. These costs incurred by the utilities are harmful to all Californians, as the financial fallout from these disasters is picked up by ratepayers in the form of a higher bill.
CALSSA called the new decision a “loser” for California. “For the solar industry, it will result in business closures and the loss of green jobs. For middle class and working class neighborhoods where solar is growing fastest, it puts clean energy further out of reach. For our grid reliability needs, it fails to promise robust growth in battery storage. And for California’s race to clean energy, it puts us behind our goals and out of step with the national pro-solar agenda,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director, CALSSA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/15/deep-retrofits-and-building-emission-laws-offer-new-opportunities-for-solar-in-nyc/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",BRIAN SAVAGE,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",Deep retrofits and building emission laws offer new opportunities for solar in NYC,"It’s no secret, buildings are one of the largest sources of emissions. The IEA found that in 2021 the operation of buildings accounted for 30% of global final energy consumption.  In New York City, buildings are responsible for about 70% of its greenhouse gas emissions. With 90% of buildings in NYC today expected to be standing in 2050, and with many of them having been built at the turn of the century, there is significant potential for long-term carbon reduction.
NYC’s 2019 Climate Mobilization Act put these existing buildings in center focus with aims to reduce the city’s emissions by 40% by 2030 from a 2005 baseline.  The cornerstone of this legislation package was Local Law 97, which set statutory carbon caps on buildings larger than 25,000 square feet with steep fines for noncompliance. This is especially relevant if New York is to meet goals laid out in the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLPA) of an 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and the governor’s goal to achieve 10 GW of solar by 2030.
These caps are increasingly stringent over time with limits starting in 2024 for the worst-performing 20% of buildings, and 2030 for the rest. In total, Local Law 97 covers about 50,000 buildings and nearly 60% of the city’s building area, with 59% being residential, and 41% commercial. The Urban Green Council estimates this could turn NYC into the largest retrofit market in the country with 141,000 new jobs in the metro area by 2030, and a $20 Billion retrofit market over the next decade.
What this means for solar
Recently proposed rules for Local Law 97 allow building owners to offset emissions from their building electricity use by purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs) from renewable energy connected to the NYC grid. Solar and wind could see significant growth alongside this retrofit market depending on the implementation of this carbon trading program. However, concerns remain that RECs could weaken the law’s potential if this compliance is possible without the addition of new renewable energy sources.
An innovative New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) program called RetrofitNY takes this pairing of retrofits and solar a step further. Based on the successful Dutch “Energiesprong” program for deep retrofits, RetrofitNY aims to cultivate cross-industry innovation and collaboration to revolutionize retrofits in a manner that is streamlined, cost-efficient, and scalable.
The technical approach is simple and standardized: prefabricated insulated cladding to the exterior, a new insulated roof over the existing roof, a photovoltaic system, heat pumps for space and water heating, and replacement of doors, windows, and ventilation. This deep retrofitting can be quickly completed without disturbing tenants, can be paid for through energy savings over time, and can utilize economies of scale to further save on procurement while also offering 50% to 80% energy use reductions. Early pilot programs have found that solar PV systems offer the best value for money on a fully electrified, deep retrofitted home over the long term.
While there are new challenges for the program to face in the United States, RetrofitNY is already catalyzing change through “five key actions”:
As cities and states across the country begin to adopt similar laws on building emissions, the success of Local Law 97, and RetrofitNY could set a far-reaching precedent. In 2018, Washington D.C. approved a policy for buildings over 50,000 square feet, and in 2019 Washington State adopted the Clean Buildings bill targeting large commercial buildings.
Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and St. Louis have also begun to implement performance requirements for existing buildings with fines for noncompliance. While the language and focus of each law vary slightly, there is a shared goal of building decarbonization that offers new opportunities for the twin forces of solar and retrofits.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/15/speculation-on-lawsuit-against-bidens-two-year-tariff-pause/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",Speculation on lawsuit against Biden’s two year tariff pause,"ROTH Capital believes that Auxin Solar – the company that filed the 2022 anti-circumvention lawsuit – is readying a new series of lawsuits. The lawsuits are aimed at reinstating two year suspension of liquidation of – which leaves the window open for collection of duties in the future – on companies that were found to be circumventing the 2012 tariff ruling.
The companies – or their subsidiaries – found in violation were: BYD, Longi, Canadian Solar, and Trina. ROTH speculated that these companies were found to be both importing solar cells made from Chinese solar wafers, and buying at least three of six subcomponents (silver paste, aluminum frames, glass, backsheets, ethylene vinyl acetate sheets, and junction boxes) from Chinese manufacturers. However, other sources have suggested it’s a much more nuanced decision to determine exactly which companies were considered circumventing.
Companies found to not be in violation of the ruling would not be affected by this lawsuit.

ROTH Capital asked K&L Gates LLP partner Stacy J. Ettinger what she thought about the lawsuit’s potential for success, and what that process might look like. That webinar can be accessed here.
Ettinger said that it will mostly likely be a two part process, with each part having its own chance of success. The first required action would be a Temporary Restraining Order against the suspension of liquidation, which may be coupled with a request to reinstate cash deposits. Ettinger believes Auxin has a “50/50 shot” of obtaining the restraining order, but only a 10% chance of winning the request to reinstate cash deposits. After that, the case would move toward a request for a Preliminary Injunction.
If the temporary restraining order were to be removed, that would open the door for the reinstatement of tariffs on the circumventing companies’ solar panels. Ettinger confirmed to Roth that there is no risk of retroactive tariffs on imports between April 1, 2022 and the start of the tariff waiver on June 6, 2022.
It was suggested that once the suit is filed, determination on the restraining order could come quickly, within two weeks. However, other legal actions would have to go through a longer process.
This article was amended on Dec. 16, 2022 to clarify that ROTH speculated that four companies were importing and buying from Chinese manufacturers, rather than that they had been found doing so.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/15/mcdonalds-logistics-group-signs-virtual-ppa-for-renewable-energy-from-texas-solar-plus-storage-project/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",McDonald’s logistics group signs virtual PPA for renewable energy from Texas solar-plus-storage project,"Can I get a large fries with those RECs?  Today McDonald’s and a five-member restaurant group the North American Logistics Council (NALC) signed a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) to purchase renewable energy and REC certificates from a 189 MW Enel North America solar plus 88.2 MWh storage project in Texas.
The virtual PPA agreement and corporate aggregation purchasing power with logistics partners means the electricity load of McDonald’s USA’s entire logistics supply chain will be sourced from renewable energy resources going forward.
McDonald’s partners in the NALC group include the Anderson-Dubose Company, Armada, Martin Brower, Mile Hi Foods and Earp Distribution.
Located in Grimes County, Texas, about 71 miles northwest of Houston, Enel’s Blue Jay solar project is expected to be operational in 2023. Once complete, McDonald’s and its suppliers’ combined electricity purchase is expected to amount to average over 470,000 MWh of renewable energy each year. This is equivalent to over 80 million trucking miles driven each year.
The group’s combined purchase of 189 MW of renewable power, equivalent to more than 900 U.S. McDonald’s restaurants-worth of renewable energy per year, is intended to help the restaurant chain and NALC members meet their climate commitments.
“This deal is a unique example of how McDonald’s and its logistics partners are combining efforts to leverage their reach and scale to tackle supply chain emissions together,” said Bob Stewart, senior vice president and chief supply chain officer of McDonald’s. “We are excited about our collective potential to help address climate change and drive continuous improvement.”
According to the World Resources Institute, logistics supply chain emissions are categorized as Scope 3 emissions and account for 75% of all corporations’ greenhouse gas emissions, making emissions difficult to measure and address based on the transport and distribution of products.
“While major corporations are increasingly encouraging and advising their partners on how to reduce their carbon emissions, McDonald’s took it one step further by becoming the anchor buyer alongside its suppliers,” said Danny Fahey, vice president of U.S. strategy at Martin Brower, a logistics company with operations in 18 countries.
About 275 construction jobs have been created for Blue Jay Solar’s development, which is expected to generate more than $41 million in new tax revenue for state entities. Additionally, Enel is committing over $216,500 to fund STEM and upskilling programs for local schools and colleges in the Grimes County region since the start of the project’s construction began in May 2021.
Coho Climate Advisors advised the restaurant logistics group’s virtual PPA aggregation.
In September, McDonald’s signed an additional virtual PPA with EDF Renewables North America for energy from the 332 MWdc Apollo Solar project that EDF Renewables is constructing in south Texas. The solar project is expected to begin operations in June 2024.
In 2020 McDonald’s announced a climate pledge to achieve net zero emissions across its global operations by 2050. The company joined the U.N. Race to Zero campaign and signed the Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign.
The first net zero McDonald’s was opened in 2020 at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The building is covered with 55.8 kW of Onyx Solar photovoltaic glass, and also has vertical gardens to absorb the CO2 already present in the atmosphere.
Other recent VPPAs
German chemical producer BASF signed a 250 MW wind and solar power virtual PPA in August to offset the grid-supplied electricity used at more than 20 manufacturing sites in the U.S.  The chemical giant is purchasing 100 MW of power generated by Dawn Solar. An additional 150 MW of renewable energy capacity will be added through transactions with EDF Energy Services.
Telecom company AT&T signed a VPPA in February for 155 MW of solar power from Vitol. The two VPPA agreements encompass an 80 MW and 75 MW solar project in Maryland and Pennsylvania, respectively. The deals support AT&T’s 2035 net zero goals and bring its total renewable energy portfolio to more than 1.7 GW.
Finnish paper packaging products company Huhtamaki signed a 42 MW solar virtual PPA in February to procure renewable energy under a 12-year agreement with NextEra Energy Resources. Under the agreement Huhtamaki is powering 30% of its North American operations with renewables.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/15/u-s-grid-scale-and-residential-energy-storage-hit-installation-records-in-q3/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",U.S. grid-scale and residential energy storage hit installation records in Q3,"Grid-scale or utility-scale storage has set another record quarter for deployment, installing 4.7 GWh in Q3, 2022, building on the previous record of 4.6 GWh set in Q1, 2021, reported Wood Mackenzie. This is enough battery storage to power 150,000 homes for a day.
“Demand in the grid-scale and residential storage segments continues to increase, despite rising costs and lingering supply chain challenges,” said Vanessa Witte, senior analyst with Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team.
The market is highly consolidated for grid-scale storage, with 96% of total installed capacity this quarter occurring in California and Texas, which are also the largest markets for utility-scale solar. Front-of-the-meter grid-scale storage is more highly concentrated in these markets than behind-the-meter residential energy storage.
“California’s reliance on energy storage to meet record peak demand this September shows why it’s absolutely critical that policymakers and grid operators remove barriers to supply to ensure reliability,” said Jason Burwen, vice president of energy storage, American Clean Power Association.
Forecasts for 2022 to 2026 increased 109% quarter-over-quarter, with the U.S. market expecting nearly 65 GW over this period. Grid-scale installations are expected to account for 84% of that capacity.
“Installed capacity is expected to more than double next year, driven by new grid-scale project announcements and increased residential and non-residential volumes in CA due to the introduction of a community solar program and NEM 3.0,” said Witte.
Residential energy storage enjoyed a record quarter as well, with 400 MWh installed, hurdling the previous record of 375 MWh from Q2, 2022. California, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Texas led the market. Wood Mackenzie forecasts this segment to grow to 2.2 GW in 2026.
Meanwhile, community, commercial, and industrial storage had another quarter below expectations, with 56.6 MWh installed in Q3. Wood Mackenzie said it expects this segment to grow as well, benefiting from demand on the residential and grid scale.
The trend of project delays due to supply chain constraints continues to hamper development in the near term, however 2022-2028 interconnection queues have increased 120% quarter-over-quarter.
“Some developers have considered delaying projects into 2023 to receive tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, but this only applies to a very niche segment of projects,” said Witte.
Witte said supply chain issues and interconnection queue backlogs may push project installations ahead in the forecast. Due to this, Wood Mackenzie has bumped up 2024-2026 projections by 9-13% per year.
EIA projections
Grid-scale energy storage capacity is expected to surpass 30 GW, 111 GWh of installed capacity by the end of 2025, according to a report by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Battery storage capacity in the U.S. was negligible prior to 2020, at which point storage capacity began to ramp up. As of October 2022, 7.8 GW of utility-scale storage assets are operating, with 1.4 GW of additional capacity to be added by the end of 2022.
The EIA forecasts another 20.8 GW of battery storage capacity will be added from 2023 to 2025.
Growth in energy storage capacity is outpacing the pace of early growth of utility-scale solar. U.S. solar capacity began expanding in 2010 and grew from less than 1.0 GW in 2010 to 13.7 GW in 2015. In comparison, the EIA sees energy storage increasing from 1.5 GW in 2020 to 30 GW in 2025.
At present, the 409 MW Manatee Energy Storage in Florida is the largest operating battery storage project in the U.S. Developers have scheduled more than 23 grid-scale battery projects, ranging from 250 MW to 650 MW, to be deployed by 2025.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/15/cubicpv-plans-10-gw-of-conventional-silcon-wafer-production/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",CubicPV plans 10 GW of conventional silicon wafer production,"CubicPV announced plans to establish 10 GW of conventional mono wafer capacity in the United States. Driven by incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, the wafers produced by the new facility could fill a void in the domestic supply chain as well as create 1,500 new direct jobs.
“The IRA represents a titanic shift in the global solar landscape, and the U.S. is poised to become the world’s most competitive location to manufacture solar. We’re excited to have a role in the U.S. manufacturing renaissance while accelerating our business plan and supporting the development of our next generation tandem module technology,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO, Cubic.
CubicPV was formed last year from the merger of Hunt Perovskite Technologies and 1366 Technologies, a company that was founded in 2008 and headquartered in Bedford, Mass. 1366 Technologies was known for its direct wafer technology, which forms wafers directly, using molten silicon, instead of silicon ingots sawn into wafers. The advantage is less loss because it uses a kerfless wafer production that does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers, a time-consuming process that wastes material as silicon dust. Instead, 1366’s technology forms wafers directly, using molten silicon.
Founded in 2013, Texas-based Hunt Perovskite Technologies specializes in metal halide perovskite in single-junction solar panels for the utility-scale market. By merging Hunt with 1366, the result was a new production process that combines 1366’s direct wafer process and Hunt’s printed perovskite solar photovoltaic technology.
While CubicPV reports that its new factory will produce conventional silicon wafers, the company said it will continue research and development of its tandem modules, which reportedly offers more than 30% greater efficiency than the highest efficiency conventional modules. The design stacks two solar cells, with silicon on the bottom, powered by CubicPV’s Direct Wafer technology, and perovskite on the top, the company claims that the tandem design “will dramatically increase the power of every acre of solar deployed.”
CubicPV has not yet chosen a site for its U.S. facility, but says the design has begun. The company expects to finalize the site choice in Q1 2023. Construction is anticipated to be completed in 2024 with the factory fully ramped in 2025.
“The Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition applauds CubicPV for bringing the first global-scale wafer manufacturing facility to the United States,” said Mike carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition. “Their planned 10 Gigawatt facility to manufacture conventional mono wafers will serve as a major catalyst in our efforts to create a fully American solar supply chain.”
CubicPV recently attracted new investors including Synergy Capital and SCG Cleanergy, in support of Its silicon perovskite tandem module development, and reports that it raised $26M in Series B financing. Synergy and SCG were joined by return lead investors including Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Hunt Energy Enterprises.
“This is the proverbial win-win scenario,” said Carmichael Roberts from Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “Cubic has the opportunity to become a leader in U.S. wafer manufacturing for the current generation of solar technologies while also continuing to develop the next generation in tandem cells and direct wafer manufacturing. This is a powerful combination that should set the course for the U.S. to be a global leader in solar innovation while also establishing a robust manufacturing base and secure supply chain for this critical industry.”
The U.S. factory is the first for CubicPV in the U.S., but not the first announced by 1366 or CubicPV to be built in other parts of the world. In 2019, 1366 Technologies and Hanwha Q Cells announced a 700 MW supply agreement, which included constructing a wafer factory near Hanwha’s existing cell and module factory in Malaysia to facilitate direct wafer delivery to the Korean manufacturer. In April of this year, CubicPV announced a deal to supply 1 GW of direct wafer silicon solar cells per year to Indian manufacturer Waaree Energies under a five-year contract. The cells will be supplied from what was then announced as an upcoming 2 GW factory in India.
Mike Carr noted that the SEMA Coalition members told Congress that if they got the right policy support, “they would build a strong, secure, and resilient solar manufacturing supply chain – from polysilicon through module manufacturing – to meet our current and future deployment needs, achieve our ambitious climate goals, and create manufacturing jobs across the country. Today’s announcement is proof that the Inflation Reduction Act is working, and we know many more such announcements will follow.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/15/meta-procures-720-mw-of-solar-for-southeast-data-centers-from-silicon-ranch/,"INSTALLATIONS,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,GEORGIA,TENNESSEE",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",Meta procures 720 MW of solar for southeast data centers from Silicon Ranch,"Facebook owner Meta Platforms will power additional data center operations around the Southeast with 720 MW of new solar developments in Georgia and Tennessee with Silicon Ranch.
Silicon Ranch is partnering with the Walton Electric Membership Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to supply power from seven new solar facilities to power Meta’s data centers in the two Southeast states, respectively.
In Georgia, Walton EMC signed contracts with Silicon Ranch for three solar projects with 560 MWAC  to be constructed over the next three years.
In Tennessee, TVA signed agreements with the developer for four projects with 160 MWAC that will be built over the next three years for the social media company. The TVA projects are included in the regional electric cooperative’s Green Invest program, a Tennessee Valley solar procurement program designed for corporate and industrial clients.
Including the seven projects, Meta is partnered with Silicon Ranch on 16 solar projects in Georgia and Tennessee with total capacity of 1.50 GW. Eight of the projects are operational generating 630 MW of power.
Silicon Ranch, a Nashville-based utility-scale solar developer backed by Shell, said it is nearing completion on two near-term Meta solar facilities, the 125 MWAC DeSoto I Solar Farm in Lee County, Georgia, and the 70 MWAC McKellar Solar Farm in Madison County, Tennessee.
Each of the Meta projects uses Silicon Ranch’s transformative Regenerative Energy agrivoltaics model of land management, a solar design and construction approach that co-locates renewable energy production with regenerative agriculture practices.
“Meta’s commitment to support their operations with 100% renewable energy is directly responsible for our own commitment to invest more than $2.3 billion across more than a dozen rural communities in Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky,” said Reagan Farr, president and chief executive officer of Silicon Ranch.  “As a company that calls this region home, we look forward to being active members of each community for decades to come.”
“TVA is building the energy system of the future, and this public-private partnership with Meta and Silicon Ranch demonstrates the strength of TVA’s public power model to attract capital investment and high-quality jobs into the communities we serve while helping businesses meet their sustainability goals,” said Doug Perry, senior vice president of commercial energy solutions for TVA.
The southeastern solar projects highlight Meta’s renewable energy leadership, as highlighted by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) in its recent Solar Means Business 2022 report. According to SEIA, Meta has procured more solar since 2020 than any other U.S. company.
TVA serves 10 million people across an 80,000 square mile territory in the southeast U.S., extending beyond its home state borders. The company stated goals of targeting up to 10 GW of solar by 2035, and more than 200,000 EVs on roadways by 2028. The utility expects to have about 2.8 GW of solar in TVA operation by 2024.
According to TVA’s 2021 sustainability report, the regional utility cooperative owns just 1 MW of operational solar capacity. TVA instead has developers such as Silicon Ranch play the role of owner-operator, so that they can access the federal investment tax credit incentive, an option that TVA, as a government entity, cannot access.
TVA said its Green Invest program has led to nearly $3 billion in solar investments since 2018. A large driver of growth in this program is through contracts with corporations like Google, Meta, and others.
In total, the SEIA said Tennessee has 609 MW of installed solar capacity through Q3 2022. The state employs over 4,109 people in solar, and there has been an estimated $900 million in solar investment in the state.

Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, will manage battery cell production at the three facilities to address the growing U.S. consumer demand for EVs.
The company produces large format, pouch-type cells that use a nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum chemistry to deliver what the company says is more range at less cost. They can be arranged in different combinations of flexible modules and battery packs to to provide energy for a range of vehicles. 
DOE estimates the battery cells manufactured by these facilities could reduce gasoline use by 480 million gallons per year.
The project is expected to create approximately more than 11,000 good-paying jobs—6,000 in construction jobs and 5,100 in operations—across the three facilities, including more than 700 United Auto Worker jobs in the newly-organized Warren, Ohio facility.
This loan comes from the government’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program, which has $17.7 billion in loan authority to support the manufacture of eligible light-duty vehicles and qualifying components, authorized by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This loan closing will directly support the President’s goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and having EVs make up half of all new vehicle sales by 2030.
“DOE is flooring the accelerator to build the electric vehicle supply chain here at home—and that starts with domestic battery manufacturing led by American workers and the unions that support them,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “This loan will jumpstart the domestic battery cell production needed to reduce our reliance on other countries to meet increased demand and support President Biden’s goals of widespread EV adoption and cutting carbon pollution produced by gas-powered vehicles.”

As the battery maker is a joint venture between GM and LG, this technology will be used in GM’s light-duty vehicles, in which the company plans to eliminate 100% of tailpipe emissions by 2035. GM has plans to install capacity to produce more than one million EVs annually in North America and make its global products and operations carbon neutral by 2040.
Today’s announcement marks the DOE’s Loan Programs Office first closed loan exclusively for a battery cell manufacturing project under the program.
