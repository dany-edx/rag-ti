The company said it has acquired France-based commissioning specialist BALIAN Energy, marking NovaSource’s first European acquisition and expanding its international presence. Financial details were not disclosed.
NovaSource, a Texas-based portfolio company of Canadian private equity firm Clairvest Group, announced a merger with California-based SunSystem Technology in late January.
NovaSource also took over the O&M businesses of SunPower and First Solar last year. The company said it currently manages more than 3.5 GW of commercial, industrial, and utility-scale projects.
BALIAN Energy adds global experience to NovaSource’s team, having commissioned over 1 GW of PV power plant projects in 16 countries.
According to NovaSource, additional services include performance optimization, construction/design due diligence capabilities, and enhanced engineering solutions.
NovaSource CEO Jack Bennett said the company has seen demand for independent commissioning services “grow rapidly as the solar industry continues to mature.”
Thibaut Coly, founder and CEO of BALIAN Energy, is slated to lead NovaSource’s global field service and commissioning operations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/02/alliant-energy-to-ditch-coal-early-add-more-solar-in-wisconsin/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WISCONSIN",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 2, 2021","Alliant Energy to ditch coal early, add more solar in Wisconsin","Alliant Energy announced plans to retire the two coal units at the Columbia Energy Center by the end of 2024, meaning the utility would become coal-free in Wisconsin about 15 years ahead of its previous goal.
The 1.1 GW coal plant went into operation in 1975 and is located near Portage, Wisconsin. Alliant Energy co-owns the facility with Madison Gas & Electric and Wisconsin Public Service, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group.
Collectively, the utility companies intend to retire Unit 1 by the end of 2023 and Unit 2 by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals.
The decision positions Alliant Energy to achieve its Clean Energy Vision, including a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 and eliminating all coal from its generation fleet by 2040.
The plant retirement is also part of the the company’s Clean Energy Blueprint, which includes adding community solar, customer-hosted solar, battery storage pilots, and at least 1 GW of new utility-scale solar in Wisconsin.
Last May, Alliant Energy announced plans to add 675 MW of solar energy generation to its portfolio. In the coming months, the company expects to announce details about the next phase of its solar plans.
“The closure of Columbia is truly a historic moment as we stop burning coal in our Wisconsin operations and fully turn our attention to generating cleaner energy,” said David de Leon, president of Alliant’s Wisconsin energy company.
He added that analysis shows the closure will avoid millions of dollars in long-term costs for customers, and Alliant Energy is dedicated to helping Columbia’s employees and the surrounding community amid the transition.
The decision is the result of Alliant Energy’s comprehensive resource planning process, in which Sierra Club and other stakeholders began participating in 2019.
Sierra Club applauded Alliant Energy for “putting words into action at a critical time.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/02/report-assesses-solar-impact-on-isos-and-reliability/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 2, 2021",Report assesses solar impact on ISOs and reliability,"Researchers at the U.S. Energy Department’s Berkeley Laboratory released a report assessing the contribution to reliability, trends in market value, and impacts on the bulk power system of solar deployed in the U.S. through the end of 2019.
The report covered the seven organized U.S. wholesale power markets and was based on historical hourly solar generation profiles for each individual plant larger than 1 MW, or county-level aggregate profiles for smaller-sized solar.
The report found that solar deployment in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), where solar generation was equivalent to 18.7% of annual load in 2019, far exceeded the level in other ISOs.
The New England Independent System Operator (ISO-NE) had the second-highest penetration, with solar generation equivalent to 4.3% of annual load in 2019. All other ISOs had annual solar generation shares at or below 2%, the report said.
Solar’s contribution to the power system’s overall resource adequacy was measured by its capacity credit. While calculation methods vary across ISO/RTOs, summer capacity credits for solar in 2019 ranged from 45-76% of a system’s nameplate capacity, the report said. Capacity credits have remained largely stable over the past years except in CAISO, where solar’s capacity credit “steeply declined” in 2018.
The market value of solar, defined in the report as the sum of the energy and capacity values, varied across regions and years. This was largely because of variations in average energy prices and capacity market prices. The energy value, based on the hourly solar generation and real-time power prices at pricing nodes near each solar plant, was the largest component of the market value across ISOs.

The report said that in 2019, the average energy value ranged from $24/MWh in CAISO to $60/MWh in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The report said that solar’s capacity value was based on the capacity credit of solar and the capacity price. In 2019, the capacity value was highest in the Southwest Power Pool ($25/MWh), although capacity prices there were based on estimates of bilateral capacity transactions rather than transparent organized capacity market prices. The capacity value was lowest in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (less than $1/MWh).
The report said the market value of solar in CAISO declined between 2012 and 2019, both overall and relative to annual average energy and capacity prices. In 2012, solar’s market value in CAISO was 40% higher than the value of a flat block of power (representing the market value of a generator that operates at full nameplate capacity in all hours of the year).
By 2019, however, solar’s value was 31% lower than a flat block of power’s value. The report said this was because of a solar-induced shift in the timing of high and low energy prices, as well as a reduction in solar’s capacity credit. In contrast, the market values of solar in regions where solar penetrations were low did not decline relative to average prices.
As solar’s market value declined in CAISO, its cost—measured in the report by levelized power purchase agreement (PPA) prices—declined at a similar pace, maintaining solar’s overall competitiveness.
The report said that solar was more competitive in the PJM market and among non-ISO utilities where the market value in 2019 exceeded the levelized PPA price of contracts signed in 2019.
Solar was more competitive in ERCOT in 2018, and the report said the energy value of solar was “significantly higher” in 2019 than in 2018. It also said that data to report an average PPA price were insufficient in 2019.
In CAISO, the net load shifted to resemble the well-known “duck curve,” with particularly low net load during spring days and high ramps as the sun sets. Similar patterns emerged in real-time prices, with lower prices during the day and higher prices in the early evening.
Ancillary service requirements, particularly regulation reserves, have increased during the day, as have regulation prices. Negative real-time prices during low net-load days in the spring suggest growing challenges with providing flexibility, the report said. However, broader shifts in the system—including growing participation of utilities in the Western Energy Imbalance Market and variations in hydropower levels—appeared to ease some challenges in 2019 compared to 2017, even with greater solar deployment in 2019.
Impacts to the net load shape from solar were seen in a number of non-ISO utilities in the Western U.S.—for example, in Arizona and Nevada. The report said that with much less solar deployment in the other ISOs, solar impacts on the bulk power system were less obvious.
A free webinar summarizing key findings from the report will be held by the Berkeley Lab on February 23 at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/02/sunrise-brief-tesla-fluence-and-res-are-leading-storage-system-integrators-report-says/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 2, 2021","Sunrise brief: Tesla, Fluence, and RES are leading storage system integrators, report says","Today is Groundhog Day, the U.S. and Canadian celebration of solar energy! Legend has it that if a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow because of abundant solar, then it’s back into his burrow for six more weeks of winter. If clouds trim solar production at his Pennsylvania den, then it will be an early spring. This year’s result: good news for solar producers but bad news for everyone hoping for an early spring. The rodent saw his shadow. Six more weeks of winter!
Analyst firm Guidehouse Insights released a report that examines the strategy and execution of 13 utility-scale energy storage system integrators, and says that Tesla, Fluence, RES, Powin Energy, and Nidec ASI rank as the leading market players.
With cumulative utility-scale energy storage deployment revenue projected to top $188 billion by 2029, the market represents a significant opportunity, the firm said. As the market matures, systems integrators play a key role in ensuring that projects are successfully built and that they become profitable.
“These companies are actively pushing the boundaries of how energy storage is viewed by stakeholders in the industry, and they are working to open new markets,” says Ricardo F. Rodriguez, research analyst with Guidehouse Insights.
According to the report, since 2018, system integrators have shifted from turnkey project development (including systems integration) to a more pure-play systems integrator and operator role.
The market is moving toward specialized system integrators being hired by project developers, the firm said. This shift has occurred as integrators become better at optimizing the value of energy storage across multiple revenue streams using software and controls.
Duke Energy said it has formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, eTransEnergy, to provide unregulated services to assist school districts, transit services, and companies across the country adopt electric vehicles.

“Electrifying vehicles represents an incredible opportunity for our customers and communities to reduce carbon emissions,” said Doug Esamann, executive vice president of energy solutions for Duke Energy.
The company will work with commercial electric original equipment manufacturers to provide customers with access to the vehicle that best meets their needs. More broadly, Duke Energy said it will work with local utilities nationwide to support updates to the energy grid and other infrastructure as needed.
Duke Energy has pledged to convert 100% of its nearly 4,000 light-duty vehicles to electric and 50% of its approximately 6,000 combined fleet of medium-duty, heavy-duty and off-road vehicles to EVs, plug-in hybrids or other zero-carbon alternatives by 2030.
Montreal-based Boralex Inc. closed its previously announced acquisition of the controlling interests in a portfolio of seven solar plants in the U.S., for a purchase price of $215.6 millions.
The seven solar plants have a total gross installed capacity of 209 MW. The solar plants are located in California (5), Alabama (1), and Indiana (1), and were commissioned between 2014 and 2017. They all operate under long-term Power Purchase Agreements with the Regents of the University of California, Alabama Power Co., PG&E, Southern California Edison, City of Palo Alto, and Indianapolis Power & Light.
Following the transaction, Boralex’s total installed capacity worldwide stands at 2,455 MW.
Energy management services and consulting firm Priority Power Management said it has acquired Satori Energy Solutions.
Chicago-based Satori serves more than 55,000 industrial, municipal, and residential clients in 25 states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and Mexico. Satori also has experience energy transition issues, including community solar aggregation and behind-the-meter installations.
“The addition of Satori is consistent with our and our financial partner Ara Partners’ vision to create the leader in climate-conscious power solutions on a national basis,” said John Bick, managing principal at Priority.
David C. Wiers, founder and president of Satori, has joined Priority as a member of the executive management team.
Fourth Wave Energy will spin off its smart home technology subsidiary, GeoSolar Technologies. Once complete, the transaction will form two separate and independent publicly traded companies.
Under terms of the deal, GST will receive all commercial rights to the GeoSolar Plus technology and patents in exchange for the issuance of approximately four shares of GST common stock for each outstanding common share of Fourth Wave.
The GeoSolar Plus system is designed to reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions in residences and commercial buildings and is comprised of a number of components including solar PV and geothermal.
GST plans to move its headquarters to Colorado where it will work to set up a national sales program to market the GeoSolar Plus system for new and existing homes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/02/wells-fargo-to-install-nearly-100-solar-arrays-on-u-s-properties/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JEAN HAGGERTY,"FEBRUARY 2, 2021",Wells Fargo to install nearly 100 solar arrays on U.S. properties,"Financial firm Wells Fargo is partnering with Ameresco to install 30 MW of new onsite solar arrays on nearly 100 of its retail and administrative offices in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Texas.
“There may be opportunities to do more. The cost of [solar] technology has been coming down, and panel efficiency has been going up,” said Curt Radkin, senior vice president in sustainable strategy for Wells Fargo’s corporate properties group. “The  economics just make sense.”
For its first wave of projects, Wells Fargo selected states with relatively high power costs and/or favorable incentive programs for onsite solar, and locations where it has a lot of employees and customers. The bank’s new projects range from a 6 kW  rooftop array on a branch in Connecticut to a 6.5 MW carport and rooftop system at the bank’s Chandler, Arizona, campus.
Other larger projects will include a 5.5 MW combination rooftop/ground mount system to serve an administrative property in San Antonio, Texas, and a nearly 2 MW ground mount system next to a Wells Fargo campus in Des Moines, Iowa.
With the new strategy, RECs, which the bank has been using to meet its electricity needs since 2017, will make up a smaller part of its renewable energy play; installing behind-the-meter solar offers the opportunity to have a greater impact.
When the first wave of projects are completed next year, Wells Fargo is expected to overtake Bank of America as the leading U.S. financial services company helping to support new renewable generation capacity via its operations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/02/a-look-inside-rhode-islands-most-successful-solar-incentive-program/,"FINANCE,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RHODE ISLAND",,"FEBRUARY 2, 2021",A look inside Rhode Island’s most successful solar incentive program,"In January 2020, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order directing the state’s electricity mix to become 100% renewable by 2030.
By the end of the third quarter of last year, the state had installed 351 MW of solar power (in more than 7,000 unique installations), 25 MW of offshore wind power, and 140 MW of onshore wind. Additionally, a contract for the 400 MW Mayflower offshore wind farm was signed.
Image: SEIA
More than three-quarters of the state’s solar is small-scale, according to the Energy Information Administration, part of the U.S. Energy Department. It stands to reason that the smallest U.S. state should have relatively few large-scale ground-based solar projects!
pv magazine USA has covered Rhode Island solar NIMBY-ism multiple times, so we thought it appropriate to cover what is arguably the state’s most successful solar program. The Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth (REGrowth) program offers a 20-year feed-in tariff for non-residential renewable energy projects sized between 25 kW and 5 MW.
To optimize the price of electricity paid by electricity users, project owners bid their project price per kilowatt-hour up to a ceiling amount that is designed to creep downward slowly every year.
The program structure requires that each solar project be a standalone system. That means it has to have its own electricity meter and sell 100% of its power directly to the electric utility. For the 2020 procurement year, the state’s goal was to deploy 40 MW of renewable energy capacity, with solar vying to grab as much of that as it could.
When presenting the financial model of an REGrowth project to a building owner, two aspects really drive the process.

First and foremost, the solar project must provide an attractive return on investment. An ideal solar installation on a Rhode Island commercial rooftop could be fully paid off and in the black after 4.6 years (including tax benefits), as shown in the table. More complicated projects could take up to 7 years–still a seductive opportunity.
A second big factor is the 20-year, fixed contract between the rooftop owner and the electric utility, which is backed by the state itself. This structure helps banks feel secure when it comes to project underwriting.
As already noted, these systems are required to have their own electricity meter. Thus, they’re an asset with a revenue stream that provides a direct deposit once a month into a known, fixed, bank account (which can be captured by law if need be). If a project is priced well, then the revenue should generate enough to cover the note, even if the customer runs away with the tax benefits.
This standalone electric meter requirement adds a nuance that allows some installations to generate more energy from solar than their occupants use. This maximizes solar generation capacity, while also lowering the average cost per solar installation due to economies of scale.
So, under a standard net metering/behind-the-meter program, a building owner/occupant that uses 100,000 kWh/year would be able to install only about 80 kW of solar power. That capacity roughly matches the building’s annual usage.
However, the REGRowth program lets owner/occupants produce as much solar as the roof can support, with 100% of the energy sold to the power grid.
This is a greatly under-appreciated aspect of the program. In this author’s professional (and tax-paying citizen’s) opinion, it should be adopted nationwide!
The program’s main challenges have to do with timing, risk capital, and the confidence business owners have when asked to invest up to seven figures in energy and efficiency upgrades.
First, customers must apply for interconnection to the utility, which for most of Rhode Island is National Grid. If the customers feel the project risk is low, then they apply for interconnection. The process costs a few thousand dollars and typically takes some months to complete.

Even with risk perception mitigated via insights gained by a utility-provided hosting capacity map, this part of the process isn’t without its unknowns. For example, an interconnection application might come back saying that large upgrades are needed, or that a project installation can’t occur for years. After all, National Grid has had challenges projecting new solar power volume in the New England power grid region.
Then, once the interconnection work is complete, the owner/occupant can apply for the REGrowth program. This step allows the applicant to finalize what the expected payback will be and ultimately learn whether the project has been accepted into the program.
Customer must have confidence that they have bid well, that their building can handle the added weight of the solar, and that their grid connection will not require upgrade improvements whose cost often kills project finances.
Generally, business owners are open to accepting risks and unknowns. However, they mostly want unknowns that lie within the realms of their expertise. Obviously, though, projects are being installed, which suggests that solar developers are able to bridge both the trust and the risk gaps.
Overall, the program seems to be installing a decent amount of rooftop solar power at rates that benefit local business and with great transparency. However, it is likely that the process’s slow progress from project conception to interconnection, and ultimately to grid connectivity, has slowed Rhode Island’s much-needed clean energy deployment.
