Once operational in 2026, the factory is expected to contribute to the company’s 14 GW in the U.S. and 25 GW globally. 
The factory will produce First Solar’s Series 7 modules, which are expected to be manufactured with 100% U.S.-made components identified in the current domestic content guidance issued by the US Department of Treasury. 
The company has over 78 GW in its order backlog, driving the addition of more factories. First Solar continues to book module orders well into the future as demand for U.S.-made solar components remains red hot due to domestic manufacturing incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act and an increased emphasis on renewables in utilities and corporate procurement plans. 
Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar celebrated the company’s growth, highlighting, “the industry’s strongest balance sheet, a repeatable vertically integrated manufacturing template, and a proven technology platform.” 
Over the last year, First Solar has announced over $2.8 billion in capital investment in 7.9 GW of manufacturing capacity additions, all in the United States. The company previously announced an approximately $1.3 billion investment in a new 3.5 GW manufacturing facility in Alabama and a 0.9 GW expansion of its existing manufacturing footprint in Ohio, both of which are expected to be completed at the end of 2024. 
“By expanding America’s solar manufacturing base, and the value chains that support it, we are working to ensure that the U.S. enters the next decade in a position of strength, fully capable of producing the technology it needs to complete its transition to a sustainable energy future,” said Widmar. 
First Solar currently has 2,500 employees across the country. The company estimates that the new facility will add over 700 new jobs, which when combined with the 850 new manufacturing jobs expected to be created in Alabama and Ohio and over 100 new R&D jobs planned in Ohio, takes its total number of direct jobs in the U.S. to over 4,000 people across the country by 2026. The company said the newest facility, of which the location is yet to be disclosed, will be contingent on necessary permits and approvals.
First Solar released its Q2 earnings report for 2023. Highlights included:
“The second quarter of the year continued the steady progress established in the first, as we ramped up production and delivery of our next-generation Series 7 modules, reinforced our global leadership in thin film PV with a strategic acquisition, and continued our strong bookings and ASP momentum,” said Widmar on the earnings call.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/27/how-big-must-hailstones-be-to-damage-pv-systems/,"QUALITY,ITALY,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JULY 27, 2023",How big must hailstones be to damage PV systems?,"From pv magazine Italy
The recent hail storms that occurred in northern Italy have drawn attention to the damage that these sudden and violent atmospheric events can cause to photovoltaic systems. Several system owners have posted photos of damaged plants on social networks, clearly demonstrating the violence of the hailstorms and, above all, the size of the hailstones, which in some cases even reached 20 cm in diameter.
But how big do these grains have to be to damage a photovoltaic system? What can be considered a critical threshold beyond which the damage becomes significant?
pv magazine Italy tried to answer these questions by dusting off a 2019 report by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) which had investigated the insurance damage data of a historic hailstorm that occurred in June 2016 in the Netherlands.
According to the conclusions of the Dutch researchers, damage to solar panels occurs primarily with hailstones with a maximum size of at least 3 cm. “Larger hailstones (more than 4 cm) cause more damage on average than smaller hailstones, but they also show greater variety in the amount of damage to solar panels,” they explained in the paper “The vulnerability of solar panels to hail.”
Starting at 3 cm, both invisible and visible damage can occur, but starting at 4 cm, the percentage of visible damage increases significantly.

The smallest cracks (microcracks) do not form in the front glass layer but in the silicon, resulting in no reduction of the initial yield. After a few months, however, the damaged areas may begin to show a rapid drop in power, and after about a year the micro-cracks also become visible on the outside of the panel. All damage then reduces the lifespan of a solar panel.
The orientation of the roof relative to the direction of the hail can greatly affect the damage caused by hail to solar panels, the researchers explained, noting that this factor could be even more decisive than the size of the hailstones.
Then there is some empirical evidence – on the other hand, not too significant – that even the angle at which the solar panels are installed can influence the damage to the solar panels. A greater inclination, according to the conclusions of the scientists, would help to moderate the damage.
The study also shows that the frequency of hailstorms is increasing in Europe and the Netherlands, as is the damage caused by hailstorms. This indicates that exposed items, such as solar panels, could become more vulnerable in the future.
“Hail risk and the vulnerability of solar panels to hail should be included in risk models and climate adaptation strategies,” the Dutch researchers concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/27/doe-invests-20-million-to-extend-solar-lifecycle-cut-waste/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 27, 2023","DOE invests $20 million to extend solar lifecycle, cut waste","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) announced an opportunity that will provide $20 million over three years for research, development, demonstration, and commercialization projects that minimize materials in solar energy systems, improve installation quality and resilience of PV systems, and improve the reuse and recyclability of solar panels.
This funding opportunity will also set up a Solar Partnership to Advance Recycling and Circularity to improve materials recovery and develop safe end-of-life practices for PV system components.
Recycling of solar components is an increasingly important topic as cost reduction, supportive policy, and large-scale electrification means solar could supply 40% of U.S. electricity in 2035, and 45% in 2050, as forecast by DOE’s Solar Futures Study. That would require average annual growth of 30 GW in new solar capacity this year and next, rising to 60 GW extra per year from 2025 to 2030, for a terawatt of new solar capacity by 2035. This kind of growth will see corresponding growth in used solar modules and materials that can be re-used or recycled.
One estimate, by the International Renewable Energy Agency predicts that without changes to the current structure of solar panel retirements, the world could witness some 78 million tons of solar trash disposed in landfills and other waste facilities by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). It predicts the U.S. will contribute 10 million metric tons of trash to that 2050 total. To put into context, the U.S. dumps almost 140 million tons of waste each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But it is possible to recycle and reuse the materials. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory projects that by 2040, recycled panels and materials could help meet 25% to 30% of U.S. domestic solar manufacturing needs.
“Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, we are creating a robust PV recycling industry that will help us achieve a clean energy future through rapid deployment of solar energy,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “This announcement will enhance PV systems throughout their lifecycle to lower costs and reduce impacts on the environment, while ensuring that we have a plan for taking solar panels offline in an efficient and economical manner that boosts the domestic supply chain.”
With reduced use and improved recovery of critical materials, PV system deployment will become less dependent on supply chain limitations and can sustain the expected growth in clean energy.
The Materials, Operation, and Recycling of Photovoltaics (MORE PV) funding opportunity asks teams to identify ways to optimize solar systems throughout their lifecycle to lower costs, facilitating rapid deployment of solar energy. SETO encourages teams from institutions of higher education, for-profit entities, non-profit entities, state and local government, and tribal entities to apply.
An informational webinar will be held on July 26 at 1 p.m. ET. Prior to submitting a full application for this opportunity, applicants must submit a letter of intent by September 6 at 5 p.m. ET and a concept paper by September 13 at 5 p.m. ET.
This funding opportunity supports DOE’s Photovoltaics End-of-Life Action Plan, which aims to halve the cost of recycling by 2030 and reduce the environmental impact of solar energy modules at end-of-life. It also builds on recent investments to develop durable and recyclable solar technologies as part of the 2022 Photovoltaics Research and Development funding program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/27/debunking-anti-solar-arguments/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 27, 2023",Debunking anti-solar arguments,"As we continue our analysis of the secretive “Citizens for Responsible Solar” group, we debunk their arguments against solar power. Our initial article cast a skeptical eye on their claim that their group represents “Solar Local Communities” advocates, a ‘grassroots group of concerned citizens’ promoting responsible solar and other renewable energy. Mounting evidence suggests this group may be little more than a smokescreen for fossil fuel interests, with its vague identity and murky funding shielded by Citizens United.
The group’s primary strategy is a tactic known as “gish gallop”; bombarding opponents with numerous bad-faith arguments and conspiracy theories that appeal to their base. For solar developers, the optimal counter to this tactic is meticulous project planning and precise documentation. This includes accurate mapping of setbacks and wetlands, proactive community engagement, detailed decommissioning plans, and strict compliance with local zoning laws, especially when applying for variances. Remember, seeking a variance presents an opportunity for opposition; public opinion can sway the voting decisions of those who vote on your request for variance.
Debunking the ‘solar toxic waste’ fear-mongering tactic:

Source: Citizens for Responsible Solar
The ‘Citizens for Responsible Solar’ website (above) features a collection of outdated articles fraught with misleading language and a tenuous grasp on reality. One glaring example tries to equate obsolete solar panels with spent nuclear plant uranium. We would dismiss these claims as laughable if they were not so effective at convincing rural residents to infringe upon their neighbor’s property rights and propagate politically-motivated misinformation.
Indeed, these falsehoods crumble under scrutiny. Our national institutions possess a deeply-informed understanding of solar panels, built through comprehensive analysis. While solar panels may contain heavy metals such as copper and silver, associated risks are easily and effectively mitigated through proper training and handling.
A big move was made in California when the state reclassified decommissioned solar panels from hazardous to universal waste. This initiative simplifies management and promotes recycling of decommissioned panels, treating them in the same manner as other universal waste items like batteries and electronic devices. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other state programs have taken note of such policy advancements to inform their approach to end-of-life directives for solar panels.
For further details on solar panel regulations at the state level, the EPA advises individuals to consult their respective state’s environmental agency website.
California’s ruling, rooted in rigorous scientific research, underscores the expertise of the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. The department’s data-driven approach helped to create and enforce this regulation in accordance with the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, receiving endorsement from the EPA.
Additional clarity on the issue can be found in a simple, yet comprehensive brochure from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. The document outlines the state’s pragmatic perspective on solar panels, and points out that most commonly installed silicon modules are explicitly non-hazardous. And while some panels may be classified as hazardous waste, First Solar is one manufacturer that provides a recycling program for used modules.

Moreover, recycling technologies have been consistently improving. For example, one newer technique reportedly delivers recycled silicon with a purity of up to 99.9984%. With countries like France boasting the capability to recycle 100% of old modules, these advancements are gaining global recognition.
Even as the ‘Citizens for Responsible Solar’ warn of a future flooded with disposed solar panels, the reality is that solar and the clean energy industry are still in their infancy. According to Bloomberg, the battery recycling industry has experienced such growth that supply of recycling factories may soon exceed the number of batteries available for recycling.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory suggests that a decade of solar retirements is needed before the solar recycling industry matures. However, a market currently exists for used solar panels. Companies are already buying old solar capacity from large power plants.
This spurious “toxic waste” argument insinuates that solar modules could ‘leach’ heavy metals into local water supplies. But much like any robust piece of infrastructure that’s engineered to withstand the elements, solar panels, some engineered to last fifty years or more, simply do their job without complaint or troublemaking. Silent, motionless and harmless, solar panels are sealed from rain and wind. They admit only sunlight and ‘leach’ only electricity.

Lastly, it is crucial for solar developers to maintain a solid decommissioning plan, ensuring community trust. For guidance, the State of New York has issued a document to help guide developers formulate a decommissioning plan. The plan includes a sample estimate of potential decommissioning costs for a ground-mounted 2 MW solar panel system. Additional assurances can be found in the form of a surety bond costing around 2% to 3% annually of the total cost twenty years out. That works out to around $200 to $300 per year for a $4 million, 2 MWdc solar facility.
Developers, armed with a clear exit strategy and a comprehensive documentation package can efficiently navigate the zoning process, even in the face of well-funded opposition from ‘concerned citizens.’
This article was amended to remove the assertion that First Solar’s modules are hazardous.  The cadmium telluride photovoltaic (CdTe PV) solar panels have been characterized as non-hazardous waste in accordance with the U.S. federal waste Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure test, which is designed to simulate 100 years of landfill conditions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/27/scaling-clean-energy-by-and-for-black-farmers-in-florida/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JULY 27, 2023",Scaling clean energy by and for Black farmers in Florida,"The Black Farmer’s Collaborative (the Collaborative) is working with the U.S. Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers to scale the implementation of clean energy technology, intended to increase income and provide opportunities to build generational wealth.
The first is building solar panels on Cetta Barnhart’s demonstration farm in Monticello, a city in Jefferson County. Otherwise known as agrivoltaics, her PV system will benefit crops by increasing their resistance to extreme weather, thus growing the farm’s crop yield. 
The second project will take place 25 miles east of Tampa in a town called Bealsville, where solar panels will be installed on churches and commercial buildings in and around the area. 
Agrivoltaic system
Barnhart, the Collaborative, and NREL agrivoltaics researchers worked together to design six possible systems to support her farm’s crops. Models of the panels helped stakeholders gauge installation costs, energy output, and crop production.
“We chose to do it on a demo farm run by a woman who is respected and known in the community,” said Velma Deleveaux, the Collaborative member and managing partner of the business consulting firm Veaux Solutions. 
Barnhart’s 14.5-acre farm provides fresh foods to families in Northern Florida that they can pick up or deliver. She hopes her new system becomes a model for other farmers in the area who can scale their business with higher, more favorable crop yields while saving on water and electricity costs. 

“That’s the real gist of what this team is looking for. How can we bring change into our community that’s long-lasting and impactful to Black farmers?” Barnhart said.
In Bealsville, NREL researchers worked with local stakeholders and community members to develop a guide for installing solar panels on churches and other commercial-scale buildings across the state. 
They had to consider what type of PV system would work best on which building; understand installation regulations and figure out how to secure solar contractors while planning for maintenance and decommissioning services – as well as looking at funding resources. 
The Biden Administration’s Justice40 benefit plan and the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could supply support as each provides capital for clean energy and clean air investments in Black Brown Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities. Bealsville was founded by formerly enslaved people in 1865, and it’s been home to Black farmers increasingly affected by pollution and climate change since.  
If funded and scaled, projects like these provide educational and employment opportunities aligned with President Biden’s Build Back Better Plan. Bealsville community members are working towards partnering with correctional facilities to train former inmates in building installing and maintaining solar panels. 
Perry Blackmon III, a community activist, sustainable cattle farmer, and member of the Collaborative Selma, AL., said agrivoltaics farms like Barnhart’s could be a school trip destination for K–12 students to learn about solar energy.
“Inspiring a generation of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals,” added Charis Consulting Group President CEO and member of the Collaborative Saundra Johnson Austin. 
For the Bealsville and Monticello communities, establishing trust with NREL before partnering with the laboratory was critical to the success of the farming and rooftop solar panel effort.
The Collaborative spent almost two years specifying Bealsville’s energy needs, gathering support, and building a relationship with NREL researchers before applying for assistance through the Clean Energy to Communities (C2C) Expert Match program. An initiative that helps communities find project-specific technical assistance to meet their sustainability goals. Including the perspectives of various invested community members like farmers local and state leaders educators and consultants was also important and will continue to be essential to effectively scaling solar domestically. 
Even with good intentions, the historical legacy of manipulation subjugation and discrimination when researchers businesses or organizations enter BIPOC communities is well-documented. A recent example is Vision Solar’s active license despite numerous racial linguistic and disability discrimination lawsuits from customers. So trust between everyone involved in building an equitable and clean energy future is mandatory.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/27/thermal-batteries-unlock-new-opportunities-for-solar-developers-financiers/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"JULY 27, 2023","Thermal batteries unlock new opportunities for solar developers, financiers","When we think of energy sector emissions, we tend to think of electricity. But the electricity grid only accounts for one-third of fossil fuel emissions: the direct combustion of fossil fuels, used to power industrial processes and heat buildings, has an emissions profile roughly the same as the electricity sector in the U.S. and other countries.
One of the biggest opportunities to eliminate these emissions is in the industrial sector, the single largest source of global emissions. The heat that powers industrial processes, such as the production of steel and chemicals, accounts for two-thirds of industrial energy demand and the majority of industrial emissions.
The electrification of industrial heat with renewable generation not only has the potential to bend the curve towards net-zero—it has the potential to open up one of the biggest and most actionable opportunities that the solar industry has ever seen.
Thermal batteries
At first glance, the intermittency of renewable generation seems to pose a massive problem for decarbonizing industrial facilities, which require process heat every hour of every day. But, when paired with new low-cost thermal battery technologies, solar and wind can unlock the decarbonization of process heating, creating a massive new market for renewable generation.
While easily achievable from a technology perspective, electrifying industrial heat has rarely been economical to date: using grid electricity to create industrial heat is about five times more expensive than burning natural gas onsite. Ultra-low power prices during peak renewable-generating hours enable electrified heat to undercut fossil fuels on cost, but only for a small portion of the time. Traditional energy storage technologies like lithium-ion batteries certainly have the potential to smooth out this variability, but they add costs that largely negate the benefits of cheap renewable electricity.
Industry, however, has a key advantage that unlocks the potential of renewables: most industrial energy use is in the form of heat. Instead of storing electricity and then turning it into heat, we can immediately convert the electricity into heat and then store that heat using low-cost, scalable, and abundant materials. In this approach, low-cost electricity is used to heat up a “thermal battery” to hundreds or thousands of degrees, which can store that heat for hours or days and output it on-demand.
Thermal batteries are a radically simple approach to energy storage, circumventing a reliance on expensive and scarce minerals in favor of low-cost materials like carbon, which is used by companies such as Antora Energy. Carbon is about 50 times less expensive than traditional battery materials and has about three times the energy density of lithium-ion. And with a supply chain of over 30 million tons every year—more than 50 times that of lithium—it can quickly scale up alongside demand.
Using thermal batteries, industrial facilities around the world are already turning electrification from impractical to profitable.
Electrifying heat loads
Thermal batteries open a path to rapidly build a decarbonized energy system that circumvents one of the biggest barriers to deploying new wind and solar generation: interconnection.
The Biden Administration is taking important steps to reform the years-long interconnection process for new-build renewables, and thermal batteries can offer an important complementary approach by enabling clean energy projects to make greater use of existing generator interconnections or circumvent the grid entirely.
First, thermal batteries create an opportunity to double the amount of renewable generation capacity installed at already approved interconnections through a “net-zero interconnection,” a process in which new wind or solar is added to an existing project without changing its maximum power output to the grid. By adding thermal batteries alongside new generation, excess power can be used to charge the thermal battery behind-the-meter—avoiding the need to upgrade the grid connection and wait in lengthy interconnection queues.
When renewable generation is lower, the new capacity can be exported to the grid through the already-approved but previously underutilized interconnection, effectively “firming” the renewable resource from the perspective of the grid. Such net-zero interconnections can forgo the need for new siting and interconnection while accelerating the pace of renewable energy deployment.
In other cases, new renewable power projects could avoid interconnection to the grid entirely while still directly offsetting fossil fuel combustion. By pairing new renewable power development with large, steady, and year-round energy loads, thermal batteries can enable industrial facilities to serve as a reliable offtaker of all of the energy generated by a wind or solar project.
For developers and financiers, thermal batteries open up thousands of new solar and wind projects that offer a unique hedge against many of the development risks and barriers that projects face today. By unlocking a reliable long-term offtaker that circumvents power market congestion and grid connection wait times, thermal batteries can reduce project risk and cut off years of expensive waiting time.
These factors combine to create robust, financeable projects, all enabled by a low-risk storage technology that reconfigures proven systems to convert electricity into heat and store it for days on end.
Cross-sectoral decarbonization
As solar and wind continue to saturate markets such as California and the U.S. Midwest, we’re beginning to see the problems of renewable overproduction, which causes power prices to crash as generation approaches or exceeds demand. When powered by thermal batteries, thermal loads have the potential to mitigate issues of overproduction by providing a large, flexible source of demand for renewable energy during peak generating hours.
As more and more of our economy is electrified, we need to lean into the advantages of wind and solar—namely, their ability to produce ultra-low-cost energy when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing—to cost-effectively decarbonize across sectors. In doing so, we have an opportunity to circumvent the biggest barriers to the growth of renewables, avoiding curtailment and interconnection issues. In the industrial sector, thermal batteries are the key that unlocks this potential, with the ability to catalyze gigawatts of new projects and eliminate gigatons of industrial emissions.
