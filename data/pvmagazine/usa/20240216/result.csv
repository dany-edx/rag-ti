Not surprisingly, so has the demand to improve operations and maintenance (O&M) efficiency – the single largest component of a utility-scale solar asset’s post-construction budget. 
Whether an asset owner performs O&M in-house, outsources to a third-party, or utilizes a hybrid mix of the two, getting strategically smart about O&M can substantially boost efficiency. Four strategies to consider are people, equipment, construction and technology.
#1 – People strategy: Know what business you are in  
Hiring and retaining competent people is one of the biggest threats that could impede the global transition to clean energy. In 2022, 44% of solar industry employers said it was “very difficult” to find qualified applicants. That’s the highest such percentage ever recorded in the U.S. Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) National Solar Jobs Census. Competition, a small applicant pool, and lack of training and technical skills all contribute to the peril.
With 16,585 reported solar operations and maintenance jobs in the U.S. that’s a hefty challenge, which falls heaviest on asset owners who aren’t technically in the ‘people business’. But O&M service providers are — especially large national players.
It’s complicated. Getting bogged down in the day-to-day of hiring, training and managing talent can be a risky distraction for asset owners, steering their focus away from their number one priority: performance and production of the solar asset. It’s especially challenging when the asset resides in remote, or less desirable locations. Yet, ensuring preventative and corrective maintenance is mission-critical to the asset’s performance. And that requires highly trained people with superior technical and safety skills. 
One solution for asset owners is to get out of the people business, and instead leverage resources whose business is people: third-party O&M service providers. For staffing challenges, service providers with a national presence have the ability to pull the right resources to meet immediate needs. And for remote assets, they may already service density in the area, meaning they might already have other assets they operate and maintain nearby. 
Outsourcing to a qualified partner alleviates an asset owner’s workforce development headaches too. Becoming a master solar field technician takes years, and with the proliferation of new technologies, the learning curve never stops. While inhouse solar installers may amass years of experience building projects, they are not likely to develop all of the skills needed to become a field technician, much yet to climb the company’s career ladder and move into critical project management roles. Asset owners provide limited opportunities to field technicians requiring  specialty electro-mechanical training or mentoring.
Alternatively, O&M service providers are in the business of growing talent at scale. Larger, national firms have invested heavily in workforce development infrastructure – from breaking ground on a multimillion-dollar renewable energy training facility to a mobile university that takes the training right to the job site. 
Ensuring that technicians receive vital safety training, certifications, and recertifications needed to comply with OSHA requirements is squarely in the service provider’s wheelhouse as well. 
#2 – Equipment strategy: Think O&M first
Solar supply chain issues have been a new-world reality since the pandemic. Even as availability concerns ease, managing panel, inverter, and other equipment inventory to meet preventative and emergency maintenance needs at multiple field sites is a major challenge, especially for owners of large asset portfolios.  
Ten different projects could require maintaining inventory from 20 different panel and inverter suppliers – not surprisingly as the projects were likely built by different EPCs who sourced parts from those available at the time. Unfortunately for the asset owner, that adds up 100 different types of parts  – or 200+ spares to ensure swift replacements and avoid dreaded and costly downtime. That’s a big challenge for asset owners who maintain their own spare parts inventory. Even if they’ve outsourced to a third-party spare parts provider, they’d face the daunting task of contracting separately for each project.
As the solar industry matures, forward-thinking asset owners are factoring their equipment needs into their O&M strategy. They are standardizing requirements for new projects. When replacing worn out panels and inverters, they contractually require EPCs to source from a short list of preferred manufacturers and OEMs. By leveraging similar equipment across  multiple projects, asset owners can allocate capital to make bulk purchases of fewer types of panels and inverters to alleviate spare parts and inventory challenges. Or, if they outsource spare parts inventorying to a third party O&M provider, they can put a master service agreement in place to cover all projects and substantially reduce the time and effort associated with contract negotiations.
Not only does this strategic approach lessen inventory issues for spare parts, it enables asset owners to proactively ensure that their projects are being built with the highest quality components, and optimize procurement pricing in bulk. Training needs diminish too, as technicians are servicing fewer types of equipment. Less equipment variation also results in faster knowledge transfer and more rapid deployment of technicians from one project to another for corrective maintenance or some unforeseen catastrophic issue.
 #3 – Construction strategy:  Pick two – Fast, cheap, or high quality
Selecting an EPC is one area where the old adage of ‘pick two: fast, cheap, or high quality ’ holds true, especially from an O&M perspective. Fast and cheap have the potential to lead to long-term issues that erode the performance and productivity of an asset, not to mention catastrophic failures.
Choose an EPC with a reputation and history of delivering quality projects on time and on budget. Be sure to have a 100 percent complete site design before entering into the EPC contract. Don’t leave the final details to chance – that’s where panels get installed and where the wiring and cabling takes place and where many O&M nightmare begin. 
That’s because some EPCs normally employ a handful of experienced in-house professionals and outsource a lot of the labor to install panels and wiring. When it comes to labor, make sure the EPC isn’t picking cheap over quality.  
#4 – Technology strategy: Automate monitoring & data analytics
Condition monitoring is a vital O&M task which requires sifting through and analyzing substantial amounts of data – from power outages to identification of faulty modules, calculation of module efficiency, and compliance to grid standards – to ensure optimal PV system performance.  
Traditionally, condition monitoring has been manual and dispersive. Fortunately advancements in condition monitoring automation and data performance analytics are changing that. Today, sophisticated asset owners are turning to remote condition monitoring software to inform their O&M strategies and corrective maintenance plans. Monitoring takes place in remote operations centers – like the Pearce world-class NIRC/CIP Remote Operating Center, designed to meet the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards. At these centers, performance analytics specialists have a bird’s eye view of multiple production sites at once.  
Automated condition monitoring gives Pearce 24×7 visibility into any site’s performance levels, identifying inefficiencies and performing data analysis to pinpoint the root cause of a problem. Analyzing and diagnosing a challenge remotely without sending a technician to the job site to assess the situation helps manage cost. And it accelerates the ability to get a project online faster, significantly reducing downtime.
Condition monitoring systems are making O&M servicing smarter and more efficient. Armed with data about the exact point of failure – whether a dirty filter panel, a faulty PV connecter, or a malfunctioning inverter – the asset owner or their outsourced O&M service provider can deploy a technician with the right knowledge to exactly the right place to resolve the problem faster. 
The journey continues
Utility-scale solar has come a long way since the first solar park was built nearly four decades ago. As the industry continues to evolve, O&M best practices and technology will too, paving the way for asset owners to deploy smarter strategies and achieve greater  performance.

It’s set to double in 2024,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory, releasing projections for high-probability electric generation capacity additions for 2024. 
EIA expects nearly 63 GW of new capacity this year, adding significantly more than the 40 GW added in 2023. Last year was the largest boom in grid capacity additions since 2023, and 2024 is set to blow that out of the water. 
What’s more, solar and batteries are dominating the project queues. Solar represents 58% of expected capacity additions in 2024, and batteries take second place with 23% of the mix. This represents a record 36.4 GW of solar and 14.3 GW of battery energy storage. These figures only include utility-scale projects, meaning solar has an even larger piece of the pie when including distributed solar like rooftop residential and commercial behind-the-meter projects. 
EIA’s 36.4 GW projection of utility-scale solar nearly doubles last year’s 18.4 GW increase, which was already a new deployment record.  
Texas is expected to be the head-and-shoulders frontrunner, adding 35% of the nation’s utility-scale solar in 2024. This is followed by California (10%), and Florida (6%). 
Meanwhile, total cumulative battery energy storage is expected to nearly double this year. In its entire history, the U.S. has installed about 15.5 GW of grid-scale batteries. EIA expects 14.3 GW more storage to be installed and operational in 2024. 
The two leading technologies are followed by wind (13%), natural gas (4%), and nuclear (2%). There zero coal-fired plants planned in 2024, and more decommissioning projects are on the way.

Florida-based Merida Aerospace is developing perovskite solar cells tailored for space applications.
The cells are geared to enhance performance and economy for low-Earth-orbit satellites, which often rely on solar panels as their primary power source.
Merida Aerospace is billing perovskite solar cells as a “promising alternative” to gallium arsenide solar panels, which have traditionally been the go-to for space solar applications. The company said that perovskite cells have a simplified manufacturing process for better cost-effectiveness.
It said perovskite cells are also flexible and versatile, making the material suitable for a diverse range of applications.
“Perovskite solar cells have demonstrated remarkable resilience to high-energy radiation in space conditions, thanks to a self-healing effect,” said research engineer Andrea Marquez. “The arrangement of perovskite crystals is influenced by space temperatures, enhancing their light absorption capabilities.”
The aerospace company said perovskite solar cells also offer environmental benefits. It said its components are “abundant and involve a less energy-intensive manufacturing process, aligning with global shifts toward cleaner and sustainable energy technologies.”
In January, an Australian research team said they were able to remove the element of human error in the development of perovskite solar cells by harnessing artificial intelligence.

Wafer FOB China prices trended flat this week due to limited trading activity during the Lunar New Year holiday. Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafer prices remain steady at $0.246 per piece (pc) and $0.357/pc, respectively, without any change from last week.
The fact that the supply of wafers greatly outpaces downstream demand explains why prices for wafers have been steady for the past four weeks, even if the price of polysilicon in China has increased somewhat, an upstream source explained.

OPIS has learnt from its market survey that downstream manufacturers have made significant production cuts since February, and China’s cell production output in February is expected to be between 35 GW to 40 GW only. However, according to the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, February’s wafer output in China would be roughly 55 GW. The trade body also noted that there hasn’t been a noticeable decline in wafer market operating rates.
“In February, wafer inventory might quickly build up,” a market watcher told OPIS.
A market participant sees the outlook for the short-term wafer market as bleak, stating that the link between supply and demand will govern wafer prices. Given that wafer output has been consistently strong thus far, the insider advised that it is important to monitor if wafer manufacturers will have to significantly scale back production output in late February.
A polysilicon insider meanwhile offered a relatively optimistic signal: cell producers may accelerate their purchases of wafers because there is typically a pickup in end-user demand globally starting in March. The insider predicts that at that point, the price of wafers might rise or at least level off.
There have been several instances of cancellations or delays in the announced solar manufacturing projects in the past two months. China’s wafer producer, Beijing JYT Corporation, announced on December 26 that it would postpone the production time of a 22 GW ingots and wafering project at the Leshan base from the original plan of January 2024 to December 2024, partly due to intensified competition in the wafer manufacturing market and significant fluctuations in wafer prices.
Chinese solar manufacturer, Mubang High-tech Co., LTD., announced on February 8 that the implementation of its new 5 GW a year n-type wafers facility in Tongling, Anhui, carries a risk of project termination due to uncertain financing sources.
Although these developments may appear negative, they are a positive move for the industry as consolidation becomes necessary, according to a market observer. The companies with the best strategies will survive this round of industry consolidation and foster an improved solar manufacturing ecosystem, the source added.
Another source concurred, stating that the next phase in the solar manufacturing business, which is currently running at a loss overall, is to remove obsolete and redundant production capacity. “Any price hike or stability before this might only be temporary,” the source added.

Corporations globally announced 46 GW of solar and wind PPAs in 2023, according to the latest report from BloombergNEF.
The figure represents a record high in a calendar year and a 12% year-on-year increase from 2022. The global PPA market has now grown by about one-third on average since 2015.
BloombergNEF said improving economics in key regions such as Europe, alongside imminent company clean energy goals, were the main drivers.
“It has never been easier to buy clean energy as a corporation,” said Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability for BloombergNEF. “For the first time, a variety of contracting structures are now widely available around the world to help companies decarbonize their energy consumption. These contracts are now the centerpiece in many companies’ sustainability strategies, rather than a nice-to-have.”
Between 2022 and 2023, Europe saw its corporate PPA volumes grow 74% to 15.4 GW – by far the largest growth of any region. BloombergNEF said that as “supply chain woes eased and gas balances normalised following the region’s energy crisis in 2022, corporate PPA prices in the region dropped, often faster than power prices.”
The United States remained the largest market for PPAs, with 17.3 GW of deals announced, but was 16% down year on year on the record 20.6 GW achieved in 2022.
BloombergNEF said that economics for signing PPAs were weaker in the United States than in Europe in 2023.
“Power prices didn’t rise at the same rates, resulting in buyers holding off on signing deals until the market recalibrates,” said BloombergNEF.
Amazon was the world’s largest corporate clean energy buyer for the fourth consecutive year. It announced 8.8 GW of PPAs across 16 countries, including 5.6 GW of solar PPAs. Amazon was followed by Meta, which announced 3.1 GW of PPAs, all in solar.
BloombergNEF said companies with 100% clean energy targets under the RE100 initiative will need an additional 105 GW of solar and wind by 2030.
“With the rise of artificial intelligence, electrification of transport and increased need for manufacturing, we expect power demand from the private sector to surge in the coming years,” said Harrison. “Clean energy, especially through PPAs, will likely be many companies’ first, best option.”
Companies signed deals with more than 150 developer counterparts in 2023. French utility Engie led the way, selling 2.4 GW of deals. It was the first time Engie topped the leaderboard since 2019.
Earlier this year, a report by Mercom Capital Group found that solar companies raised $34.3 billion in corporate funding in 2023 – the largest amount in a decade.

Verde Technologies, a spinoff of the University of Vermont, developing lightweight and flexible perovskite solar modules, has made progress with its thin film coating technology in a pilot with Verico Technology, a contract manufacturer located in Connecticut.
The partners completed the deposition of perovskite solution on a flexible substrate measuring 76.2 cm x 6,096 cm using standard manufacturing processes, equipment, and environmental conditions. The novel coating tool and process is dubbed Verde Slot Coating.
“Verde Slot Coating achieves the scalability associated with slot-die coating, while significantly accelerating iteration cycles and film optimization,” Verde Technologies CEO, Skylar Bagdon, told pv magazine.
“This means we can make rapid progress on a small scale but unlike spin-coating or blade coating, the findings are transferable to large commercial roll-to-roll systems, as the pilot with Verico makes clear,” said Bagdon.
The Vermont-based company intends to develop single junction and all thin-film tandem perovskite solar technologies. Its perovskite cell technology has reportedly a lab-scale power conversion efficiency of above 21%.
Looking ahead, Bagdon said, “Verde’s next phase of development will be focused on outdoor testing of modules with early customers.” He added that the team will be doing testing with the Perovskite PV Accelerator for Commercializing Technologies (PACT) consortium and at new solar research and testing facility recently opened in Burlington, Vermont.
The company’s commercial roadmap is to initially target repowering projects, typically utility scale projects exchanging end-of-life panels with higher-performing panels, before expanding to other lightweight PV segments, such as “large commercial metal and membrane” rooftops.
Verde was able to tap into national U.S. research and development programs. For example, last summer Verde entered a collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Northern Illinois University (NIU) which gives it access to some of NREL’s perovskite breakthroughs, such as lead sequestration and active encapsulation.
Verde also has an exclusive partnership with the University of Toledo to commercialize its perovskite cell technology with promising stability performance.
Most recently, the company was the grand prize winner in the latest round of the US Department of Energy’s Perovskite Startup Prize for its progress, focus on domestic solar manufacturing, scalability and collaboration , according to Bogdan.

The project is expected to generate the amount of electricity needed to power more than 17,000 homes while avoiding nearly 294,000 tons of CO2.
Soltec, a Spanish tracker specialist, will supply 164 MW of its SF7 tracker for the project. The SF7 was introduced to the U.S. market last month, and it is not only designed to adapt to terrain, but it can be locally manufactured, the company reports.
By reducing pile counts, the tracker is designed to be easy to install in the field. The tracker’s mounting tolerances range from 20 to 40 inches, and Soltec reports that the solar tracker can be installed on slopes of up to 17% and can be customized.
The SF7 tracker features wireless communication designed to withstand low temperatures. It uses Soltec’s TeamTrack system to ensure maximum production, delivering up to 6.8% more yield, Soltec reports. This works by minimizing shading losses between rows, especially on uneven terrain. Bifacial tracking also boosts efficiency, the company says, optimizing its position to make use of both sides of the module.
“It is a pleasure for us to continue contributing to the decarbonization of the American economy alongside Blue Ridge Power, who is a repeat customer for Soltec,” said Raúl Morales, CEO of Soltec.
Soltec sees the U.S. as a growing market. Europe currently accounts for about 27% of its turnover, with the U.S. accounting for 25% and Latin America 47%.

The portfolio of ground-mounted community solar facilities includes three sets of sites across Illinois. Six sites have a 47 MW capacity, four have a 12 MW capacity and another four have a 25 MW capacity. Construction is scheduled to begin this year, with some projects expected to be completed on or before December and others throughout 2025. 
Standard Solar and New Leaf Energy have collaborated on 20 other projects across three states.
In March 2023, Standard Solar acquired New Leaf Energy’s 21 MW portfolio of projects in New York and Massachusetts. The Copicut facility in Freetown, Mass., has 12 MW of solar and 22 MWh of storage. The 2.79 MW Main Street Newbury site is a ground-mounted solar array in Byfield, Mass., and the Saunders Settlement project in Sanborn, New York, features over 6 MW of solar and is expected to produce about 8,861 MWh each year. 
In November 2023, Standard Solar acquired New Leaf Energy’s 12 MW community solar portfolio in Chatham and Kilmarnock, Va. Standard Solar states its two Kilmarnock Va., projects with a combined capacity of over 7 MW will serve the energy needs of low-and-moderate income customers. 
Standard Solar’s new 84 MW portfolio is expected to significantly contribute to Illinois’ renewable energy goals, which include establishing 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050. 
Illinois Shines
The Illinois Shines program moving the state toward its clean energy targets. Launched by the Illinois Power Agency (IPA), the scheme provides financial incentives for community solar projects across six categories: small distributed generation, large distributed generation, traditional community solar, community-driven community solar, public schools, and equity-eligible contractors. Incentives are provided through the purchase of renewable energy credits (RECs), which are issued when a renewable energy source produces 1 MWh of electricity.
Illinois sets incentive amounts for each REC generated by participating solar projects each year. Incentives are paid to qualifying approved vendors, which pass savings onto customers. Approved vendors are entities that submit project applications to the Illinois Shines Program and demonstrate they will assume financial liability in the Illinois Shines contracts with utilities. 
“Amidst a year of record-breaking temperatures and rising energy costs in the state, Illinois is providing its residents a clear path to clean, affordable energy for a more sustainable future,” said Harry Benson, the director of business development at Standard Solar.

The plan, which falls under the commission’s clean transportation program, outlines investments for charging and refueling infrastructure for light, medium, and heavy-duty zero-emission vehicles in California – “creating the most extensive charging and hydrogen refueling network in the country,” according to the agency.
The money comes from the $48 billion California Climate Commitment, a comprehensive climate plan pitched by Gov. Gavin Newsom, which includes a $10 billion carve out to decarbonize the transportation sector. With the latest funding, state regulators expect to install 40,000 new chargers across the state, on top of the 94,000 public and shared private chargers that have already been deployed. In total, California is set to install some 250,000 chargers over the next few years, when taking into account previous funding plans, federal funding and other utility programs.  
The funds, which span 2023 to 2027, include $657.6 million for light-duty electric vehicle charging infrastructure and $1.02 billion for zero-emission truck and bus infrastructure. In addition, $130 million is earmarked for zero-emission port infrastructure, and another $5 million for workforce development in the zero-emission vehicle space. The funds will be made available over the next four years and projects can apply for them through competitive grants. 
The investment plan also has a heavy focus on equity, with at least half of the funding going to benefit “priority populations.” Regulators need to ensure that the state’s zero-emission refueling infrastructure is for everybody, Patty Monahan, lead commissioner for transportation with the CEC, said. 
“By investing a bulk of funds to benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities, the state is making sure communities most in need have better access to chargers and less pollution from trucks and buses,” she added. 
At the same time, regulators in California are facing a tension between rapidly deploying zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and ensuring that it’s grid friendly. 
“It costs more to make it grid-friendly – pairing it with solar-plus-storage means you build less chargers,” Monahan said, during a commission business meeting. 
“I will say that this is a tension that we face, because we need to build as many chargers as we can as fast as we can… and we need to be attentive to the grid at the same time. So we’re trying to juggle these two,” she added. 
In fact, without proper resource management, California utilities might need to spend up to $50 billion to prepare their distribution grids for a high level of EVs, electric heating in buildings, and other distributed energy resources by 2035, a study by power software and consultancy Kevala, Inc., conducted for the California Public Utilities Commission concluded last May. The study found that electrifying more end uses would drive up peak load, thereby necessitating grid capacity upgrades. 
Transportation electrification, in particular, drove a significant portion of the distribution grid impacts, the study noted, and the costs associated with preparing the grid for the influx of zero-emission vehicles will “escalate in earnest in 2030 and dramatically increase by 2035 regardless of scenario.”
