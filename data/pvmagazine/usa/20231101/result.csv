https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/01/u-s-has-enough-clean-energy-to-power-65-million-homes/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023",U.S. has enough clean energy to power 65 million homes,"In its 2023 Q3 market update report, American Clean Power (ACP) noted that solar continues to lead the way as the prominent clean energy source being actively built in the United States.  
Cumulatively, operational clean power capacity in the U.S. has reached 243 GW, enough to power 65 million homes. 
With nearly 56 GW online, Texas continues to be the state with the largest operational clean power portfolio. California has nearly 32 GW of clean power online, ranking second, and is the national leader in solar and energy storage active capacity. 
ACP said that of the 5.5 GW of utility-scale solar, wind, and battery storage that came online in Q3, 3 GW of the total was represented by solar. Utility-scale solar capacity additions increased 31% year-over-year for Q3. Additionally, over 60% of clean power projects in project pipelines across the U.S. are solar PV. 
The largest project that came online during the third quarter was the 265 MW first phase of NextEra’s Dunns Bridge Solar in Indiana. This was followed by Intersect Power’s 250 MW Oberon I Solar Project, and 7X Energy’s 203 MW Taygete II Solar Project in Texas. 
Battery storage installations continue to grow rapidly, growing 63% year-over-year in Q3. The amount of battery energy storage projects in the pipeline have increased 50% year-over-year, said ACP. Battery storage saw its strongest third quarter ever, with 2.1 GW/6.2 GWh added. NextEra’s 325 MW / 1,300 MWh Desert Peak energy storage project was the largest standalone battery project brought online this quarter. 
Power purchase agreements (PPA) are the main transaction type tied to these projects. Clean power buyers announced 3.2 GW of PPAs in Q3, a 55% decrease year-over-year. ACP said the slowdown was driven by a drop in corporate and industrial buyer announcements, while activity from utility buyers actually increased slightly in the third quarter. 
While solar represents the bulk of the projects coming online and being developed for future installation, wind has the most active renewable capacity on the grid with 147 GW. This is followed by 83 GW of solar, 13 GW/38 GWh of battery storage, and 42 MW of offshore wind. 
For the second quarter in a row, California led the nation in clean power installations with 1.9 GW of solar and storage added in the third quarter. Texas followed with 949 MW of clean power reaching commercial operations, and Arizona took third (516 MW). Only ten states added more than 100 MW in Q3. 
At the end of Q3 2023, the nation’s solar project pipeline stood at 85 GW, representing roughly 60% of clean power capacity in the pipeline. Overall, 23 states had solar project pipelines exceeding 1 GW while five additional states have over 500 MW of solar capacity under development. Solar continues to be the most geographically diverse technology, said ACP.
As for projects actively under construction, solar had nearly 38 GW underway at the end of Q3. It represented 76% of the nation’s total of actively constructed projects at the time of the report.
NextEra leads as the largest clean power developer, with over 12 GW actively under development, representing 8% of the nation’s total. Invenergy holds second place with nearly 8 GW, followed by AES (6.1 GW), Orsted (5.9 GW), and Origis Energy (4.8 GW). Orsted’s development capacity is mostly dedicated to offshore wind, while the other market leaders are developing a mix of solar, energy storage, and some land-based wind.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/01/first-solar-delivers-on-earnings-margins-falls-short-on-revenue/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023","First Solar delivers on earnings, margins, falls short on revenue","First Solar, a U.S.-based manufacturer of cadmium telluride thin-film solar modules, announced its Q3 2023 earnings, posting a miss on revenues, but beating expectations on earnings per share.
The company delivered $801 million in revenues, falling short of expectations of $892 million. It reported an earnings per share of $2.50, exceeding expectations by 22.5%. In the same quarter last year, First Solar delivered a loss per share of $0.46 and $629 million in sales, showing a strong move toward profitability and sustained revenue growth.
The company shipped 2.7 GW of solar module orders in-quarter. Its backlog of orders has reached 82 GW, and year-to-date orders have accumulated to 28 GW.
Notably, First Solar delivered gross margins significantly higher than Wall Street expectations. Gross margins came in at 47%, higher than the consensus of 39%. Gross margins improved based on lower sales freight costs, higher module average sales prices, and a higher volume of U.S.-produced modules, which make them eligible for the 45x tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act.
“We believe the future belongs to thin film,” said chief executive officer Mark Widmar on the company’s earnings call.
The company continues to open more manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and abroad to meet the growing backlog of orders booked through the near- and mid-term. First Solar produced 2.5 GW of Series 6 modules in the third quarter. Its third Ohio factory is operating a Series 7 manufacturing line, producing 15,000 modules per day. Cumulatively, the company’s Series 7 module production in the U.S. has surpassed 1 GW.
First Solar targets 25 GW of global manufacturing capacity by 2026.
The company has also begun producing bifacial thin-film modules, which the company said is a first for the industry.
“The technology features an innovative, transparent back contact pioneered by First Solar’s research and development team, which, in addition to enabling bifacial energy gain, allows infrared wavelengths of light pass through rather than be absorbed as heat and is expected to lower the operational temperature of the bifacial module and result in higher specific energy yield,” said Widmar.
The company secured an average per Watt sales price of $0.296 in-quarter.
“We expect to qualify for an IRA credit of approximately $0.17 per watt for each module produced in the U.S. and sold to a third party, which is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales in the period of sale,” said Alexander Bradley, chief financial officer, First Solar. “During the third quarter, we recognized $205 million of such credits compared to $155 million in the second quarter.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/01/topcon-the-likely-choice-of-new-u-s-solar-manufacturers/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,QUALITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023",TOPCon the likely choice of new U.S. solar manufacturers,"With a huge volume of tax credits available to clean technology manufacturers under the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. is beginning to see an influx of solar module makers setting up shop. While the clock is ticking on the opportunity to take advantage of the tax credits, establishing a vertically integrated facility quickly is no small task. At the recent RoundtablesUS 23, Jonathan Gifford, editor-in-chief of pv magazine moderated a panel session that discussed what technologies are best suited to both the rapid rollout and also long-term competitiveness.
Panelists include Alex Barrows, head of PV at Exawatt, Tristan Erion-Lorico, VP of sales and marketing at PVEL, MinWah Leung, senior engineer, solar technology at DNV, and Kim Primerano, vice president, energy and infrastructure development, Estuary Power.
In the panel on how the IRA is changing the landscape of solar manufacturing in the U.S., four experts discussed how realistic it is to reduce our dependence on Chinese imports, what the challenges are for manufacturers in setting up shop in the U.S., how we fill in anticipated gaps in the U.S. supply chain, and more. Alex Barrows kicked off the next panel session by noting that while a lot of module manufacturing announcements have come out, not all will get built. But he estimates that if every company does what they say they intend to do, we could have 90 GW of module capacity by 2026, 20 GW of cells and potentially 20 GW of wafer.
Clearly the mismatch in capacity leaves U.S. manufacturers beholden to importing cells and wafers, which presents a myriad of challenges, not the least of which is for developers to claim the domestic content adder. Erion-Lorico pointed out that there’s a lot to be done, but that there are challenges remain, ranging from the current transformer shortage to the challenge of hiring skilled workers. Erion-Lorico sees the workforce issue as a huge challenge. He estimates that we’ll need 4,000 to 5,000 people to run 100 GW of plants.
The TOPCon choice
With the majority of announced manufacturing facilities intending to produce solar modules, the question is, which module technology will be manufactured. MinWah Leung of DNV said that they see TOPCon as the big player. She thinks that heterojunction (HJT) will play a role in the future, but that TOPCon will be “the main technology, at least in the next few years.”
Leung said there are two pieces that DNV looks for in assessing module quality and risk: One is the design of the module—and what the technology risk is in terms of the design of the module. The second piece is the risk in terms of production quality on the manufacturing side. As DNV specializes in assessing risk, she said that it comes down to extended duration testing, which speaks to the design of the module. To assess manufacturing quality DNV also looks at factory audits, production quality, reports, monitoring, and pre inspection reports.
From the developer’s standpoint, Kim Primerano of Estuary Power said that she is risk averse and she doesn’t “usually like to be the first one off the production line”. While Estuary is closely monitoring the buildout of U.S. solar manufacturing, the company is not currently modeling domestic content. She noted that if the numbers that Barrows was projecting come true, it’ll result in the prices coming down while driving capacity up. At that point, she said, Estuary would start to look at domestically manufactured modules.
In terms of technology choice, however, Primerano said Estuary is definitely looking at TOPCon and planning to use it in an upcoming project. Erion-Lorico spoke of what PVEL is finding in its testing. He said both HJT and TOPCon introduce new risks and there’s a range of results, but over time the modules have industry leading low degradation rates. Developing TOPCon is a sensitive process, and the production window is tighter, he said. But they are seeing great results from factories overseas in PID for TOPCon and they’re seeing great results in thermal cycling in HJT. However, he noted that it’s “a wider range that’s going to take time to tighten”.
Another thing we’re starting to see is U.S.-made encapsulants and backsheets, according to Erion-Lorico, which is a result of the push to onshore the whole solar supply chain. He pointed out that this brings risk as well because manufacturers like Trina have long relationships with materials suppliers, they know how the materials will perform. And yet, to get to that 40% domestic content, some manufacturers will be looking to source materials from new U.S. manufacturing lines.
Automation in manufacturing, installation
With these risks come opportunity. Leung pointed out that we’re seeing a lot more automation not just of factories but of solar construction. She that we are starting to see robot and smart technologies being used for manufacturing, delivery, pile driving, mounting modules, and more. “It’s going to require a lot of coordination in the industry between not just module manufacturers, but also mounting system and inverter manufacturers, to EPCs and developers to see how everything can be automated on a larger scale”.
From a quality standpoint, Erion-Lorico said that PVEL has seen good results in automation of manufacturing, especially with glass glass modules. He added that even with multi-busbar modules, such as TOPCon, cell cracks matter less, so that may help to accelerate these less standard transportation methods. Leung added that a benefit that could result from automation is the standardization of mounting and module equipment so it can be installed more quickly.
“With the amount of solar that all of these renewable energy goals are looking towards, and the acceleration of installation, I think it will necessitate some form of automation in the future, Leung said. “It’s an emerging technology and it’s not perhaps quite there yet.”
Perovskites
Looking at emerging module technologies, Barrows noted that there are a number of companies looking at perovskites, but he doesn’t think they can move fast enough toward commercialization to make use of the IRA incentives. He said we’re likely looking at HJT by in the early 2030s, but there’s definitely still a bit of work to be done.
At the same time, there’s a lot of talk about tandem and about that being a path to domestic content advantage, Erion-Lorico said. “Instead of competing with modules from Southeast Asia or elsewhere, the U.S. is actually bringing back innovation and setting ourselves apart on an efficiency and technology level.” He said he’s bullish on tandems and perovskites—“people are working on it and they want to do it in the U.S., so that’s exciting.”
The drawback with perovskites right now, however, is durability. Erion-Lorico expressed optimism, however, because—just as in developing the rest of the solar supply chain, there are a lot of brilliant minds focused on overcoming the challenges.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/01/masked-engineer-highlights-strangest-mistakes-in-solar-deployment/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,BRAZIL",ALESSANDRA NERIS,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023",Masked engineer highlights strangest mistakes in solar deployment,"From pv magazine Brazil
The Instagram channel “Solar da Depressão” has a mission to highlight the most significant installation errors in the Brazilian rooftop PV market. It has already amassed more than 62,000 followers.
It is also sponsored by 12 companies interested in ensuring the quality of services provided by Brazilian integrators.
The channel humorously showcases mistakes in PV installations, while emphasizing the importance of choosing reputable companies committed to safety and quality standards.
The page’s creator, who prefers anonymity and uses the moniker “The Masked Man,” began collecting photos and videos of subpar installations from WhatsApp groups. He aims to educate customers about the significance of selecting companies dedicated to quality and safety standards.
Image: Solar da Depressão
During the recebt 360 Solar event in Florianópolis, “O Mascarado” – the creator of Solar da Depressão – discussed his reasons for launching the channel in a conversation with pv magazine.
“I told my clients, ‘Price is not everything, so be very careful because not just anyone can execute a quality photovoltaic project and strictly follow the technical standards and best practices in the sector’,” he said.
To preserve the photos and videos stored on his phone, he set up an amateur Instagram account specifically to share them with clients.
“It was a completely unpretentious thing because I spent a lot of time looking for that video of the guy stepping on the module. The idea was just to show it as a warning to customers about the risk of hiring unprepared companies,” he said. “If you have a budget that is much cheaper than the market standard, you need to be careful. What I suggest is a survey of the facilities that the company has already carried out.”

“The name Solar da Depressão was the first one that came to mind and when I searched, this account was available, so I didn’t think twice,” he said. “I also didn’t ask people to follow the account and I didn’t spend money to boost the channel. Everything happened organically and unexpectedly.”
Common errors
The Solar da Depressão channel receives photos and videos sent by its followers almost daily. The most common mistake is for installers to step on the modules during installation.
“I always say that one of the great advantages of solar energy is that the modules have a 25-year warranty and when you step on them, it is impossible to remove the internal microcracks,” said the engineer. “When you go to claim the warranty, the first thing that is done is mapping using a thermal camera that immediately identifies the footfall.”
The channel’s creator cited an example in which an inverter was incorrectly installed outside a residence, exposing it to weather conditions and potential theft.
The channel started in 2020 and gained its first sponsor, Canadian Solar, after a year and a half. The creator then started wearing a mask for anonymity during live interactions to protect the identity of installers and maintain a clear focus on preventing mistakes in the solar sector.
The page now has 26 sponsors with annual contracts, including companies such as JA Solar, Sungrow, and Solplanet. Its creator, an engineer with an MBA and more than 15 years of experience in large infrastructure projects, has become a managing partner in a solar energy integrator firm that has completed more than 11 MW of projects.
“O Mascarado” has told pv magazine about the main errors that lead to Solar da Depressão posts:
1 – No technical visits before closing a contract
2 – Not reading the manufacturer’s manual
3 – Making corrections to roof structures
4 – Lack of prior structural assessments for rooftops
5 – Incorrect locations for inverters
6 – Inverters installed incorrectly
7 – DC/AC device in the same panel/conduit
8 – Lack of planning for circulation/maintenance areas
9 – Walking on PV modules
10 – Wrong choice of inverter technology
11 – Installations with constant shadows

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/01/department-of-energy-commits-1-3-billion-to-three-multi-state-transmission-projects/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023",Department of Energy commits $1.3 billion to three multi-state transmission projects,"The Department of Energy (DOE) has announced a $1.3 billion commitment to fund the development of three transmission lines crossing six states.
These projects would add a combined 3,500 MW of capacity to the domestic grid, said Gregory Wetstone, president and chief executive officer, American Council on Renewable Energy. Construction of the transmission lines would result in the addition of over 13,000 direct and indirect jobs across the country. 
The projects include:
The projects are part of the Biden Administration’s Investing in America Agenda, and includes making strategic public investments through educating the workforce in clean energy jobs. In addition, incentivizing the development of green technology to saturate the market, thus lowering costs and helping small and medium enterprises in the industry thrive. 
Specifications for each project will reference findings from the National Transmission Needs Study (Needs Study). Conducted by the DOE, the Needs Study explores the financial and strategic factors influencing the DOE’s trilateral approach to upgrading the domestic grid. The DOE’s scheme aims to improve transmission planning, streamline the permitting process, and secure the necessary financing to support and sustain this build-out. 
The Needs Study also considers how each project will contribute toward achieving 2030 electric emissions savings targets outlined under section 60107(5) of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
According to the DOE, the Cross-Tie project will move the Mountain region 14% closer toward constructing the 2300 GW miles of new transmission necessary to support 2030 CO2 emissions savings targets. Southline will move the Southwest region 14% closer toward building the 935 GW miles of new transmission needed. Lastly, Twin States will move the Northeast region 79% closer toward developing the 1.5 GW of new transfer capacity needed with its neighbors to reach the IRA’s 2030 CO2 target emissions savings.
Funding 
The Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP) is financed by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s $2.5 billion revolving fund. The money is meant to help cover costs associated with developing and renovating large-scale transmission lines and connecting all domestic microgrids. 
The DOE is allowed to borrow the $2.5 billion in three ways. The first involves capacity contracts, where the DOE could agree to cover financial obligations and consequences of up to 50% of planned transmission lines for up to 40 years, at which point it could sell the contract to recover costs. The DOE is entering capacity contract negotiations for the three proposed transmission lines.
The second method is securing direct loans from the DOE. 
Finally, the DOE could enter public-private partnerships in areas where the proposed transmission line would run through (national interest electric transmission corridors). 
The DOE estimates releasing a second round of TFP funding totaling $1 billion early next year. This would happen through a combination of public-private partnerships, loans and capacity contracts.

Solar module microcracks are emerging as an increasing, recurring issue detected by visual inspections combined with electroluminescence (EL), a new report from Clean Energy Associates (CEA) shows.
The Denver-based clean energy advisory company came to this conclusion by testing samples from 16 countries over eight years.
“EL testing of more than 300,000 PV modules at 148 sites has shown that 83% of the sites had line cracks, 78% had a soldering anomaly, and 76% had complex cracks,” the report said. “The most surprising finding was the recent massive increase in microcracks.”
According to the report, published yesterday, CEA experts found that about 29% of the sites were impacted by edge-ribbon cracks, as well as 81% of sites with half-cut cells. There was an exponential growth of microcrack cases in the first half of 2023, with line and complex cracks both growing 47% compared to a year earlier, the report said.
CEA said roughly 55% of the sites had unwanted substances or debris that were not present within the module, and 52% had cell-to-edge glass defects. The report said that 45% of the sites had glass stains and encapsulant defects, while 41% had stringing wire/ribbon offpad defects.
Additionally, the survey found 41% of sites had cell-to-cell defects and laminate bubbles.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/01/transformer-shortages-new-bottleneck-of-the-energy-storage-supply-chain/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023",Transformer shortages: New bottleneck of the energy storage supply chain,"From pv magazine global
While the BESS supply chain has stabilized in terms of prices and supply of raw materials, lead times for certain components, such as transformers, have greatly extended.
“While global battery supply eased in 2023, after experiencing tightness in supply the previous year, the limited supply of transformers has become the new bottleneck of the energy storage supply chain,” says Kevin Shang, a senior research analyst in Wood Mackenzie.
Transformers are critically important as they enable the BESS connection at all grid levels by stepping up the output voltage to the same level as the grid voltage. Presently, the global transformer market is observing shortages and subsequent increases in prices, mainly due to increased raw material demand, pandemic-related shortages and backlogs, labor constraints, shipping issues, and geopolitical tensions. In some parts of the world, the shortages are acute.
“We have seen a significantly tight supply of transformers in the U.S. and European markets. The prices of transformers used to trend with metal prices. Nowadays, the prices of transformers are more driven up by demand and the industry will have to pay whatever is needed,” Shang tells pv magazine.
According to Shang, there is a minimum lead time of more than one year for transformers of all sizes. “This has a direct impact on system integrators as transformers are integral for grid connection,” Shang says.
In 2022, the global BESS integrator market grew increasingly competitive. According to WoodMac, the the top five global system integrators accounted for 62% of overall BESS shipments (MWh).
Leading vendor, Sungrow dominated the market with 16% of global market share rankings by shipment, followed by Fluence (14%) and Tesla (14%), Huawei (9%), and BYD (9%).
“A common feature behind the leading BESS integrators is that their global presence allows them to access a larger customer base and unlock additional revenue streams. In addition, many BESS integrators have been seeking to enhance the vertical integration of their supply chain,” Shang says.
BESS integrators are usually responsible for procuring individual components, assembling the system, providing a wrap on warranties, integrating the controls and energy management system, and often providing project design and engineering expertise. The are also providing operation, monitoring, and maintenance services.
As the energy storage market continues to expand so does the number of companies active in this space. In China, the BESS integrator market is becoming increasingly competitive, squeezed by both upstream and downstream supply chain participants.
“Possessing manufacturing capacity on key components, like cell, PCS, BMS and EMS, tends to be a necessity rather than a plus as bid requirements for energy storage projects become more detailed and stringent,” Shang says.
In such a surrounding, price has become the most significant distinction and key winning bid factor in the region.
“The price war among system integrators has started in China. We’ve observed an increasing number of players willing to sacrifice profits in exchange for market share, dragging down the profitability of the whole industry,” Shang says.
Consolidation seems imminent in the short and middle term. “We forecast that aggressive bid strategies with little margin will not be sustained. Intensifying market competition will make it difficult for companies with low profitability and no clear competitiveness to survive over the coming years,” Shang says.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, mainland China battery energy storage market grew by over 400% in 2022 and is exclusively supplied by local players. This has led to Chinese system integrators moving up on the global rankings. “Competition in international markets will intensify as these Chinese suppliers look to expand globally offering highly competitively priced products,” says S&P Global.
According to the number of installed projects completed as of July this year, S&P Global ranks Sungrow, Fluence and Tesla as the top three BESS integrators globally, followed by Wartsila and Hyperstrong.  Together, these five company have installed over a quarter of global BESS projects, S&P said.
The analysts have also highlighted oversupply as a key reason behind the intense competition in the BESS integrator market amid a large number of battery manufacturing announcements targeted exclusively at the energy storage industry.
“By offering easy-to-install direct current (DC) containers and looking to offer standardized alternating current (AC) solutions in the future, cell manufacturers will further add to the competition in the space,” S&P Global writes in its recently released article.
