https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/05/50-states-of-solar-incentives-oklahoma/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,OKLAHOMA",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Oklahoma,"Oklahoma is “where the wind goes sweeping down the plains,” with wind energy providing about 24% of the Public Service Company (PSC) of Oklahoma’s energy mix. However, despite strong levels of solar irradiance, the state has not yet matured its solar market, though recent procurement efforts may aid this.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reported that Oklahoma had 100 MW of solar installed through Q2 2022, ranking it in the bottom-five state in terms of capacity. To date, SEIA estimates that 868 people are employed in solar in the state across 26 companies, and $189 million has been invested in the technology.
SEIA’s forecast for Oklahoma’s solar future looks sunnier, as it expects nearly 3 GW of projects to come online in the next five years, ranking it 15th in the state deployment forecast. Prices have fallen 53% in the last 10 years, making solar an ever-more attractive investment in the Sooner State.
Much of Oklahoma’s solar-generated electricity is sourced from out-of-state facilities in the Southwest Power Pool. In 2021 PSC issued request for proposals to solicit bids to buy solar energy resources of up to 1,350 MW and wind energy resources of up to 2,800 MW. Proposals included a battery energy storage system as an option, with the optional storage no larger than 40% of the nameplate solar energy resource, and sized for 4 and/or 8 hours of capacity.
Incentives
There’s not much to be said about solar incentives for home and business owners in Oklahoma. The state does have a net metering requirement for utilities, but the requirement is loose.
Net metering involves the utility paying customers for their excess solar generation sent back to the grid. It helps the utility serve its customers and allows the homeowner to get a better return on investment for purchasing the clean technology.
However, SolarReviews said Oklahoma state law only requires systems 100 kW and below to be offered net metering, but the utility is not required to purchase the excess generation. Customers can request net metered payments, but the decision to pay rests with the utility.
When paid, net metering rates are the low “avoided cost” to the utility of about $0.02 per kWh to $0.03 per kWh, which solar advocates argue is an unfair rate that improperly evaluates the avoided cost to the utility.
Solar-interested Sooners can still benefit from the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which extended the 30% Investment Tax Credit for the next decade. The act allows for direct payment of 30% of eligible system costs, including any attached or standalone home battery systems.
EnergySage reports that Oklahoma’s average installation cost ranges from $11,305 to $15,295. On a cost per watt ($/W) basis, a solar panel installation in Oklahoma ranges in price from $2.26 to $3.06, said EnergySage. When compared to the state’s current electric rates, EnergySage estimates an average return on investment period of about 11 years.
Landmark project
Solar installer EightTwenty, launched in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, aims to bring more distributed solar to the state, which it views as a relatively untapped market.
Oklahoma is the sixth sunniest state in the nation, and OKC is a top-30 sunniest city, said EightTwenty. Even so, CEO Tony Capucille said there are only 2,500 solar homes, few commercial installations, and only one large-scale project.
EightTwenty created a charitable outreach, called Give Solar, which installed its first project for RestoreOKC, a non-profit restorative justice organization. The array powers a community center and farmer’s market that contains hydroponic facilities for urban vegetable farming, bringing fresh vegetables to a community that struggles with nutritional diversity as a food desert. The company said the solar array is large enough to meet 100% of its energy demand.
The company said it aims to be flexible in its installation techniques, expanding past rooftop solar to also provide ground mounts, pergolas, canopies and carports.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/05/virginia-homeless-shelter-and-recovery-center-adds-313-kw-solar-array/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,VIRGINIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Virginia homeless shelter and recovery center adds 313 kW rooftop solar array,"A Mid-Atlantic homeless shelter and addiction recovery center will now generate its electricity from renewable sources after installing a 313 kW rooftop solar system from Secure Solar Futures.
Non-profit CARITAS, or Congregations Around Richmond To Assure Shelter, powered up its CARITAS Center facility in central Virginia with 782 Heliene solar panels and Chint CPS SCA25 KTL-DO power inverters, making the system the largest array on the East Coast providing solar energy to a homeless shelter or recovery center.
Secure Solar Futures, a Staunton, Virginia-based solar installer, deployed solar equipment at no upfront cost to the non-profit organization and will operate the system under a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement. Over that term, CARITAS will purchase all the electricity generated by the solar system from Secure Futures at a cost lower than available at the local grid.
To fund the project, CARITAS is using a $17,000 grant from the RVA Solar Fund, which is administered by the Community Foundation for greater Richmond. 
“Solar power will save money on energy that CARITAS can apply to their mission of helping people improve their lives,” said Ryan McAllister, chief executive officer of Secure Solar Futures. “The flat roof of the former warehouse building that they transformed into a beautiful energy efficient space was perfectly suited to hosting a solar power system large enough to make CARITAS a leader on clean energy.”
The CARITAS Center was built in 2020 in a 150,000 square foot renovated tobacco warehouse. The facility features additional energy efficiency solutions such as 45 solar tubes, which filter natural light throughout the center, as well as Energy Star appliances, and toilets with automatic shut-off functions.
The non-profit center features a women’s recovery program and sober-living apartment community in addition to its emergency shelter, workforce development program, and Furniture Bank programs.
With more than 100 employees, the CARITAS Center and a nearby facility in 2021 provided an aggregate of 36,000 nights of shelter at its recovery program and 15,653 nights of shelter at its emergency shelter location.
CARITAS was incorporated in 1987 in Richmond after starting out with an all-volunteer program effort called “Winter Cots” in response to a rise in homelessness in the early 1980’s. In September, the non-profit announced that long-time president and chief executive officer Karen Stanley will retire at the end of the year after serving for 22 years at the helm of the regional non-profit.
Effective January 1, 2023, non-profit organizations are eligible for the 30% solar ITC credit as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. After 2024, systems larger than 1 MW need to meet specific domestic manufacturing requirements to receive the full 30% credit. If they do not, they’ll only receive a portion of the credit, depending on the year. Systems smaller than 1 MW will receive the full 30% ITC credit regardless of domestic equipment.
Secure Futures Solar is a commercial-scale solar developer in central Virginia. In June, the company launched a solar apprenticeship program for high school students in the coalfield region of Southwest Virginia. After classroom training, Secure Futures Solar students moved on to install rooftop solar on their public school systems in Lee and Wise counties. At the conclusion of the program, qualifying graduates will be offered permanent local positions. For further details on the Virginia solar apprenticeship program visit here or the company’s website.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/05/inside-the-ira-updated-energy-community-maps-and-questions-from-charles-river-associates/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WISCONSIN",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Inside the IRA: Updated Energy Community maps and questions from Charles River Associates,"Like many aspects of the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) “Energy Community” clause – and its 10% incentive adder – is still under review, with the U.S. Department of Treasury to offer guidance to the market.
The Department released partial Prevailing Wage & Apprenticeship guidance last week.
pv magazine USA covered various groups defining which geographic regions are expected to benefit from the Energy Community’ clause. All groups noted that these maps are still developing, and that interpretations are evolving.

One of the groups, Charles River Associates, recently updated its maps and submitted them to the U.S. Senate with commentary on the changes that were made. They also presented some of the items they are seeking further clarification on.
Charles River has requested clarification on two questions: whether a coal plant that was converted to gas would qualify, and whether a retiring power plant that is powered by multiple fuel sources – including coal – would qualify. The group suggested that if the latter were considered eligible, then roughly 5% of Wisconsin’s land area would be eligible.

Charles River also noted that the currently available datasets must be refined before they can be fully put to use. They found that the data recording the latitude and longitude of sites in the Mine Safety and Health Administration’s database was frequently incorrect. Some mines had been improperly attributed to areas where mining hadn’t occurred for decades, and some active mines were marked as abandoned, or closed.
This led Charles River to check the sites manually, resulting in the removal of 15% of the potentially qualifying facilities from its database. In its August update, the group suggested that 18% of the nation might qualify as a coal energy community. In their latest update, that number was scaled back to 16%.
So far, there have been no indications as to how solar asset owners will verify to the IRS that their facility is located in a coal energy community. Since these taxes will be filed in the 2024 calendar year, the wait for these procedures to be introduced may continue.
A second path to getting the 10% Energy Community adder is through fossil industry employment. The IRA notes any region that “has (or at any time during the period beginning after December 31, 2009, had)”:
Charles River says that this clause of the Energy Community section will be the most challenging to manage. They note that maps will need to be agreed upon, and that there are many granular, localized calculations to make regarding unemployment, fossil employment, and tax revenue.

The group notes that the challenges to data calculation are compounded by the fact that the maps and data must be updated annually. However, Charles River finds that using their current data and calculations, 34% of the nation could be eligible for the 10% adder due to the fossil employment clause, (shown in green in the map above).
Brownfields also have a 10% adder opportunity, however, similar challenges can be found within its dataset as well. Charles River says that brownfield data will become available in limited quantities and will vary heavily from state to state in terms of collecting, defining, and reporting. Furthermore, the definitions of a brownfield in the IRA don’t exactly line up with the definitions in existing datasets.
The group suggests that a unique database will have to be created.
Charles River is closely monitoring the Treasury’s clarification and implementation of the rules surrounding Energy Communities. They estimate that 10% to 20% of the hundreds of gigawatts of solar installed under the IRA could be affected.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/05/pnnl-team-proposes-how-storage-as-transmission-could-earn-market-compensation/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,WISCONSIN",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",PNNL team proposes how storage as transmission could earn market compensation,"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) researchers have investigated how energy storage used as a transmission asset could also be operated and compensated as a market participant, primarily in energy markets.
As an example of storage used as transmission, Jeremy Twitchell, a senior energy analyst at PNNL, said on a webinar that Midwest grid operator MISO selected a $12 million storage project as a transmission asset in Wisconsin, instead of a $13 million transmission project. MISO’s storage-as-transmission project will recover its cost through MISO’s transmission system rates, approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), he said, and will not participate in energy markets.
The opportunity for dual use of such a project arises because “even on fully contracted, heavily used transmission lines, there is unused capacity most of the time,” Twitchell said. “This makes sense,” he added, because “we build the grid based on peak needs plus reserve margins, but we’re only at that peak a few hours a year.”
That means storage, when it’s not being used as transmission, “can go do other things,” he said.
FERC “recognized this in 2017,” Twitchell said, and issued a policy statement saying that storage deployed as a transmission asset can also provide market services. “FERC was doing this to reduce system costs,” he said, adding that FERC cautioned that a storage asset cannot recover all its costs as a transmission asset, and also recover all its costs as a generation asset, “and keep it all,” because in that case there’s no cost reduction.
Both California grid operator CAISO and MISO began exploring how to respond to FERC’s nonbinding policy statement, Twitchell said, with CAISO considering how market revenues could be shared with customers, but both closed their proceedings without resolving the complexities of market participation and compensation for dual-use storage.
Without clear compensation mechanisms to enable developers to recover the costs of energy storage investments, the investments “will not go forward,” said Charlie Vartanian, a senior technical advisor at PNNL who moderated the webinar.
So Twitchell and fellow researchers at PNNL developed a framework for compensating dual-use storage in a way that meets FERC’s goal of reducing both system and customer costs. “Our hope,” he said, “is that a grid region and its utilities and stakeholders get together and say, ‘Hey, we want to do this, here’s this resource that helps us figure this out. And we’re going to do it in a way that makes sense in our region.'”
The researchers presented their framework in a paper published in February. In March, MISO opened a new proceeding to consider dual-use storage, Twitchell said, while New York grid operator NYISO is putting the idea on its study agenda for future consideration.
PNNL’s proposal
The PNNL researchers said that to overcome the barriers between regulated transmission operations and competitive market operations, a dual-use participation process must answer “three basic questions.” The first two questions are when will the asset participate in the market and how will it participate. The third question is what costs will be recovered from regulated transmission rates, and what costs will be recovered from market operations.
A key principle, they said, is that a dual-use asset’s market participation “must not jeopardize” its ability to serve the transmission function for which it was initially selected.
The researchers identified three key elements of a dual-use participation model, and the “points of flexibility” for grid operators and stakeholders to adapt the model.
One element of the framework is to establish in advance the windows for market participation by dual-use storage, for example at least a day ahead, based on projected transmission needs, and to manage the device’s state of charge to maintain sufficient capacity to meet the transmission need at any time.
Another framework element is to balance cost recovery mechanisms between regulated transmission compensation and competitive market compensation, to incentivize market participation.
The PNNL webinar is the latest in a series of PNNL webinars on storage.
The PNNL team’s paper separately maintains that current practices “create barriers against the identification of energy storage in the transmission planning process,” and identifies “best practices” for including energy storage in the planning process. The paper is titled “Enabling principles for dual participation by energy storage as a transmission and market asset.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/05/enphase-to-add-4-8-gw-to-7-2-gw-of-u-s-solar-microinverter-manufacturing-capacity/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES,WESTERN EUROPE",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Enphase to add 4.8 GW to 7.2 GW of U.S. solar microinverter manufacturing capacity,"Enphase CEO Badri Kothandaraman shared on a ROTH Capital Partners webinar that his company will be adding four to six microinverter manufacturing lines in the United States.  
The new lines are expected to add between 4.8 GW to 7.2 GW of new capacity, producing up to 18 million microinverters annually. 
Kothandaraman said that his firm believes it will be able to keep a majority of the $0.11 per Watt production tax credit (PTC) released under the Inflation Reduction Act, though uncertainty remains on how these credits will be paid out. He said that Enphase will not make a significant investment in U.S. manufacturing unless his firm can secure a significant return on investment and retain 50% or more of the PTC value. 
Enphase said it plans to work with three contract manufacturers on the new capacity, two of which are current partners. Kothandaraman said his company will commit to at least three lines regardless of the PTC credit results to meet expected growth. 
Kothandaraman said that Enphase expects steady growth in the U.S. residential sector, while the EU region has “hyper growth.” He expects that 2022 EU growth will more than double year-over-year, after already doubling in 2021. ROTH said there remains potential for another doubling in 2023, though Enphase’s management has set more conservative guidance. 
The ROTH webinar also touched on future plans for Enphase’s next model of microinverter: the IQ9. The new product is expected to be introduced in 2024, and may be powerful enough to support up to 650 W panels. The IQ8 is expected to reach 50% to 60% of the company’s sales mix by the end of 2022 and is on pace to reach 90% of Enphase sales by Q2, 2023. The company also shared it does not expect any price increases on its products in the near-term. 
Kothandaraman expressed optimism that Enphase will be able to keep “the majority” of the PTC, which ROTH earlier had advised as unlikely. This development was received as positive for ROTH, which reiterated a “buy” rating and revised its share price target for ENPH from $310 to $360.
Enphase’s leading product, the IQ8, is a microinverter capable of forming a microgrid during a power outage, allowing for backup power without the need for a battery. The IQ8 can limit energy capture to just what the home is consuming, switching seamlessly between on-grid and off-grid operations.
“We began piloting the product in the third quarter of 2021 with select installers and the feedback has been great. Homeowners not only get backup power with sunlight, but also have the flexibility to add more solar or batteries in the future as their needs change,” said Kothandaraman.
The Enphase Energy System with IQ8 comes in four different configurations: “Solar Only”; “Sunlight Backup” with no battery and the addition of IQ Load Controller to only support essential loads during an outage; “Home Essentials Backup” with a small battery; and “Full Energy Independence” with a large battery. While the first configuration is a standard grid-tied system, the remaining configurations are grid-agnostic systems that need the Enphase IQ System Controller 2 (formerly called Enpower smart switch) to island the home during an outage.
“After installing IQ8 it’s clear that this technology could be a breakthrough moment for reliable home solar power,” said Mike Teresso, president of Baker Electric Home Energy, an Enphase installer partner based in California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/05/wisconsin-utility-decision-could-spur-more-rooftop-solar-development/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,WISCONSIN",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Wisconsin utility decision could spur more rooftop solar development  ,"The Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) late last week ruled that a bid from a Stevens Point, Wisconsin family to access electricity from an 8 kW rooftop solar system would not conflict with a legacy public utility law.
On December 1 the PSC voted 2-1 in a Declaratory Ruling to uphold a petition filed in May 2022 by Vote Solar, a national solar advocacy group, on behalf of the family, one of its members.
The ruling clears the way for the family to purchase solar power under contract with third-party installer Northwind Renewable Energy Cooperative instead of the family purchasing the system and absorbing the costs upfront.
Existing Wisconsin law does not prohibit third-party ownership of residential generating equipment, however, it does not expressly sanction this type of third-party arrangement either.
In testimony and briefs opposing Vote Solar’s petition, electric providers argued that any provision of electricity to the family, whether under a lease or a power purchase agreement, would automatically make Northwind a public utility operating illegally in another utility’s territory.
Wisconsin utilities have in recent years denied residential PV interconnection to customers. Vote Solar felt it necessary to request a Declaratory Ruling on behalf of the family to clarify that the family was not “the public” and Northwind was not a public utility.
“The utility position that two homes with the same equipment, installed the same way, connected to the same utility—with absolutely no functional difference—should be categorized differently simply because of the way the system is financed defies logic and common sense,” said Kurt Reinhold, president and managing director of Legacy Solar Cooperative.
“If a family or an institution decides they want to use solar power to meet some of their power and energy needs, and rely less on fossil fuels, and lower their electric bills in the process, then no utility or regulatory authority should impinge upon the rights of the customer to do that,” Reinhold said.
Affirming the legality of the Wisconsin family’s PV project will not lead to dismantling Wisconsin’s regulatory utility model, as demonstrated in neighboring states like Iowa.
“Back in 2014, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in favor of a similar petition filed by a local solar contractor, affirming the legality of third-party-owned generation serving host customers. That decision removed a significant economic barrier that kept nonprofit entities from pursuing onsite solar power,” said Michael Vickerman, policy director of RENEW Wisconsin.
Several of those who commented in the Vote Solar docket referenced a number of innovative clean energy projects that have used third-party financing. Among those is Bad River Tribe’s Ishkonige Nawadide solar microgrid project, commissioned in 2021, consisting of 524 kW of solar and 1,000 kWh of storage capacity.
“As a clean energy company based in Menasha, we recently completed a microgrid project for the Bad River Tribe using TPF [third party financing], sometimes referred to as an energy-as-a-service model,” said Dan Nordloh, senior vice president and general manager of EnTech Solutions.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Wisconsin is ranked the number 28 state in the U.S. for solar development, with 861 MW cumulative installations through Q2 22.  The state employs 2,942 solar industry workers and has a sizable 4.9 GW project development pipeline over the next five years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/05/longroad-energy-acquires-98-mw-titan-solar-project-from-sunpin/,"ACQUISITIONS,INSTALLATIONS,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Longroad Energy acquires 98 MW Titan Solar Project from Sunpin,"Longroad Energy recently closed on the acquisition of the 98 MWdc Titan Solar project from Sunpin Holdings, LLC. Titan is an operating project located in Imperial County, CA that produces enough energy for approximately 30,000 customers in Southern California. Great Bay Renewables made a royalty investment in Titan to finance the acquisition.
Located in the Imperial Irrigation District territory not far from the U.S-Mexico border, Titan sells power into the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) via firm transmission from IID. The single-axis tracker project is situated on a 569-acre parcel between the Salton Sea and Anze Borrego Desert State Park. It reached commercial operations in December 2020.

“Titan is an attractive project as it allows Longroad to expand our footprint in the important CAISO market, while offering an opportunity to optimize value with our operations and development expertise,” said Charles Spiliotis, Longroad Energy’s Chief Investment Officer. “It is the first acquisition since closing our $500 million equity investment, demonstrating Longroad’s objective of rapidly growing our operating portfolio. We are also pleased to partner again with Great Bay Renewables on this acquisition.”
Morgan Stanley is providing tax equity for the project. Allen & Overy served as Longroad’s counsel on the transaction.
The addition of Titan expands Longroad’s total of operating solar projects in California to approximately 340 MWdc.
Longroad Energy is a Boston-based company that was founded in 2016 by the former executive team of First Wind. The company currently owns 1.5 GW of wind and solar projects across the United States and operates and manages a portfolio of 3.5 GW of wind and solar projects on behalf of itself and third parties.
Longroad recently announced received financing and notice to proceed of the Three Corners Solar project, a 152 MW (DC) facility in Kennebec County, Maine, which upon completion by early 2024, is said to be the largest solar facility in the state. Longroad has developed many other large-scale solar projects, including a 200 MW facility for a Microsoft datacenter, and a 294 MW Muscle Shoals, Alabama solar facility it sold to Ørsted for operation in Tennessee Valley Authority territory.
In addition, Longroad announced in June that it made a strategic investment in Valta Energy, a California developer, owner, and operator of distributed solar projects. Longroad has the option to expand its equity investment over the next three years as part of the deal.  This equity investment will provide growth capital to Valta’s development pipeline, which currently exceeds 200 MW of contracted solar assets in development, construction, or operations. Valta’s operating assets are primarily in Massachusetts, California, and Hawaii.

They have found that PV glazing technologies can be easily integrated into existing double- or triple-glazed substandard windows to significantly reduce building energy use and carbon emissions.
The team created glaze units using three types of PV window technology: a non-wavelength-selective technology using perovskite-based thin-film; a wavelength-selective technology, or so-called transparent PV; and dynamic PV technology, which is a recent innovation combing dynamic glazing technology with PV conversion.
They reportedly translated the nanoscopic glazing unit simulations to large-scale building energy simulations using the EnergyPlus and OpenStudio physics-based building energy simulation tools. They used weather data inputs from the Typical Meteorological Year database to simulate the energy consumption profiles of buildings in terms of heating, cooling, and lighting in 15-minute intervals over the course of a year.
The results showed that “PV glazing with a power conversion efficiency as low as 6% reduces energy use by more than 30%,” according to the researchers. They said increases in efficiency translate into additional energy use reduction. At efficiencies of 12.5%, perovskite thin-film and transparent PV technologies reach 42% energy-use reduction when integrated into double- or triple-glazed windows.
Dynamic PV glazing reaches almost 50% energy savings and “has the highest potential savings amongst PV technologies,” according to the researchers. However, they noted that the technology has only achieved an efficiency of 11% in a lab setting, so it needs further development to reach its full potential.
The results also showed that dynamic PV glazing generates more electricity in hotter months, with more than 1,200 gigajoules (GJ) of generation in June and September, but less than 200 GJ from December to January.
“In contrast, static wavelength-selective PV consistently generates more than 500 GJ each month but never exceeds 1,000 GJ for any single month,” said the researchers, who shared their findings in “Photovoltaic windows cut energy use and CO2 emissions by 40% in highly glazed buildings,” which was recently published in One Earth.
