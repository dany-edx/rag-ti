The credit facility is composed of a $275 million term loan, a $175 million revolving credit facility, and a $150 million letter of credit facility. The syndicated corporate credit facility was by Apterra infrastructure capital, a company of Apollo. Joint lead arrangers were Barclays and HSBC. 
The funds build on an August 2022 funding round of $500 million led by Infratil, New Zealand Superfund, and MEAG. The 2022 investment marked a pivot for Longroad from a project sales-based business to one focused primarily on project ownership and operation. 
“This additional capital will fuel the expansion of our owned operational fleet to more than 9 GW by 2027 and support our robust 30 GW pipeline of development projects,” said Paul Gaynor, chief executive officer, Longroad Energy. 
Longroad was founded in 2016 and has developed or acquired 4.9 GW of renewable energy projects across the United States and raised over $12.8 billion of equity, debt, and tax equity to support completion of its portfolio. Today, Longroad owns over 3.1 GW of wind, solar, and storage projects and operates and manages a total of 5 GW on behalf of third parties. 
Arizona project 
The company recently announced the financial close and start of construction of a 377 MWdc solar project in Maricopa County, Arizona. It also contains a 300 MW / 1200 MWh battery energy storage system, making it among the largest solar-plus-storage projects in the nation. It is expected to begin operations in mid 2025. 
The project will use bifacial solar silicon panels supplied by Ohio-based First Solar, with power ratings of 480 W and a 0.3% annual degradation rate. Automotive Energy Supply Corporation (AESC) will provide inverters along with lithium-ion cells for the energy storage system. The BESS will be integrated with Powin’s Centipede energy storage system. 
Longroad said the project will add over $100 million to Arizona’s economy through long-term leases with the Arizona State Land Department and tax remittances. The project is expected to produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of 120,000 Arizona homes.

The region includes D.C., Northern Viriginia, and parts of Maryland. Currently, there are about 72,000 rooftops that have solar panels installed, meaning that 178,000 more rooftops are targeted in the 2030 goal.
In 2020 MWCOG passed a climate and energy action plan to reduce emissions by 50% from 2005 levels. The climate plan also calls for about 2% of the region’s energy to come from local, distributed renewable energy sources like rooftop solar.
“It’s super ambitious, there’s no doubt about it,” said Robert W. Lazaro Jr., executive director for the Northern Virginia Regional Commission. “When you look at contributors to greenhouse gases, buildings are going to be [among] the biggest drivers.”
One of the initiatives in the region that is expected to help achieve the 250,000 target is Solar For All. The Department of Energy funds the program, which partners with organizations across the District to install solar on multi-family buildings. Program managers of Solar For All said participants should receive roughly 50% savings on their electricity bill for 15 years under the program.
The program is funded through the District’s Renewable Energy Development Fund. At the state level, Maryland’s community solar program has a low-income “carve-out,” meaning that about 125 megawatts (MW) of the total 418 MW statewide cap is set aside for projects focused on low- and moderate-income customers.
The D.C. area’s ambitious goal would represent about 24% of single-family homes adding rooftop solar, a level of market penetration only approached by Hawaii today. MWCOG’s energy procurement target also calls for a 10% compound annual growth rate in clean power purchases through 2030.
MWCOG’s climate action plan also recognizes the need for pairing intermittent generation sources like solar with energy storage. The 2030 goal establishes that roughly 10% of on-site solar installations will need to be paired with energy storage systems.
“COG will continue to work with its regional partners to evaluate project-level feasibility and cost-effectiveness of measures to meet the 2030 goals of reducing GHG emissions 50 percent below the 2005 levels,” said the climate action plan. “The next ten years of action will set the stage for the 2050 vision for achieving 80% [greenhouse gas] emission reduction and a resilient metropolitan Washington.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/27/study-frames-out-ev-charging-network-for-the-western-national-park-system/,"EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"NOVEMBER 27, 2023",Study frames out EV charging network for the western National Park system,"Electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to grow 30% to 50% by 2030. However Consumer Reports said that deciphering where and when to charge and range anxiety are some of the top roadblocks to scaling non-commercial EVs. 
To see how stakeholders can address the public charging infrastructure gap between large cities or highly populated areas, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted a study. The report investigates the quantity and location of charging infrastructure needed to accommodate the projected 32 to 40 million light-duty EVs hitting the road by 2030.
The study was concentrated in areas surrounding national parks and monuments in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. This region was selected due to the number of domestic and international visitors the parks attract yearly (41 million). California was excluded because previous statewide analysis has been conducted for regulatory and planning purposes in the region.
The study assumes that on-route charging stations will use direct current fast charging (DCFC) technology as it reduces traveler charging time. According to the Department of Energy, DCFC stations can charge an EV from 0% to 80% in 20 minutes to an hour.
Comparatively, Level 2 alternating current charging stations, typically used in residential and commercial spaces, can charge an EV from 0% to 80% in four to 10 hours. Researchers also estimate that most trips to and from national parks in the region total about 100 miles.
These assumptions provided the basis for investigating three proposed aspects of fast-charging infrastructure, that allow EV road trips to and from national parks in the western U.S.
They include:
Assuming there are nearly 40 million EVs on the road by 2030, researchers suggest the region needs between 2,350 and 4,610 DCFC ports. Moreover, this figure would depend on high (100%) or low (50%) utilization rates. Lastly, when drawing this estimate, researchers accounted for a 50-mile gap between stations and hybrid charging behavior. It’s also important to note that while California was excluded from the study area, researchers say the state still significantly influences the region as it has charging ports inter and intra-region drivers may use.
Regarding load profiles, researchers assumed the peak network-wide on-route DCFC load would be 140 MW.
“This load is roughly equivalent to 0.5% of the current electrical load for the northwest,” said the report. In this scenario, charging would peak at around 4 pm, stations would be about 50 miles apart and there would be high EV penetration.
As for level 2 chargers, researchers estimate that 50 to 100 additional ports need to be added to parks conducive to onsite charging. Spaces with larger parking areas and longer visiting times would work better than those with spread out, smaller parking areas and/or visitors who move their cars frequently.
Additionally, between 1,000 and 2,000 ports would need to be added to overnight lodges to fully accommodate the projected 1,000 to 2,000 hybrids and battery EVs. It’s important to note that not all EVs will need to be charged during park visits, and some visitors may opt out of staying at a lodge overnight.
Researchers leveraged the Federal Highway Administration’s Traveler Analysis Framework to better understand the current volume and pattern of passenger car road trips to, from and within National Parks in the western U.S. It also helped them estimate battery capacity and driving range for 2030 EV models.
They then paired each trip with short-range cars (SR-CAR), long-range cars (LR-Car) and pickup trucks (PUT). SR-CARs were assumed to have a 170-mile range at full charge and a 45kW/h battery by 2030. LR-CARs were expected to have a 450-mile range at full charge with a 125 kW/h battery in 2030. Lastly, PUTs were expected to have a 400-mile range and 125 kW/h battery in 2030. Various vehicle identification numbers were assigned to each pair to differentiate location, speed, energy consumption rate, charging demand, and charging power.
Researchers also used NREL’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure for Road Trips (EVI-RoadTrip) tool. It calculates EV-charging station needs for long-distance travel based on individual simulations that allow it to pinpoint on-route charging needs and demands within a specific radius. This process was scaled to accommodate all the road trips in the study area, resulting in a proposed network of DCFC stations that meet 2030 EV infrastructure needs.
The study also referenced transportation data from various travel surveys and studies (NREL Transportation Secure Data Center) and applied NREL’s Future Automotive Systems Technology Simulation to estimate the effect of improving light, medium and heavy-duty vehicle efficiency, performance, cost, and battery life.

US-based Infinity Turbine LLC has developed a heat pump turbine for residential and commerical applications.
“This system is viable in both residential and commercial sectors, since all use some form of cooling, available waste heat for use, or use of hydraulic power. The Cavgenx heat pump turbine is designed to be used with our saltwater redox flow battery (SRFB) Salgenx,” CEO Gregory Giese told pv magazine, adding that the system could be used in combination with PV power generation. “We are planning a pilot installation to evaluate this integration in a real-world setting.”
The heat pump turbine utilizes PV power or alternative electricity sources for simultaneous cooling and hydraulic power, suitable for running industrial machinery with hydraulic motors, and boasting a coefficient of performance (COP) exceeding three.
The proposed system configuration involves PV or alternative power sources initiating an electric motor that drives a shaft compressor. A cavitating disc pressurizes liquid working fluid to vapor, which is then heated for increased pressure and expanded through a common shaft turbine. The rotation of the shaft turbine powers the forward cavitating compressor, a hydraulic pump, and a feed pump. The vapor is subsequently condensed for cooling purposes.
The turbine uses a common shaft to instantly power the cavitation compressor from fluid to pressurized gas and also drives the hydraulic power take-off. Initiated by an electric motor, the assembly becomes self-powering, resembling a conventional turbine cycle, with the need for heat to sustain the cycle.
“One of the biggest benefits of using this heat pump turbine is simultaneous production of cooling,” Giese said. “We can take heat from AI processor data centers, use that heat to power the turbine, and then return cooling as part of that cycle.”
The turbine, connected by a common shaft, links to the compressor and power take-off accessories. With variable heat from PV panels or solar thermal, the system stores heat in a sand battery or hot water tank, addressing solar power intermittency and offering levelized thermal storage.
Zeolite pellets may also be used as a heat storage medium. “Zeolite pellets have some interesting qualities, including releasing huge amounts of stored heat when water is applied, which make it perfect for this application, ” Giese said. “Solar PV can be used to store heat in the Zeolite pellets, then heat can be released when needed.”
The heat pump turbine can also be combined with battery storage. “Incorporating batteries is a viable solution,” he said. “They can store excess energy generated during peak sunlight and supply power during low sunlight periods, ensuring continuous operation of the heat pump turbine.”
The manufacturer said the heat pump turbines are highly efficient in converting energy, leading to lower energy consumption.
“This efficiency translates to lower operational costs over time, especially in heating and cooling applications,” Giese said. “Grid-based arbitrage can be realized by using off-peak power from the grid to generate cold water via a Calmac system or ice, which can be used during on-peak power when electrical rates are much higher, realizing significant cost savings.”
The company is currently developing and testing the system in Madison, in the US state of Wisconsin. It wants to sell it in any market sector where heat pumps and hydraulic motors are used, which includes industry and large industrial equipment such as construction equipment.
“The system could be used to retrofit existing CO2 heat pump systems which are used for air conditioning, hot water, and process heat. Such systems realize the user 20-80 percent energy and cost savings,” Giese stated.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/27/solar-module-prices-may-reach-0-10-w-by-end-2024/,"COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 27, 2023",Solar module prices may reach $0.10/W by end 2024,"From pv magazine Global
Solar module prices may approach the threshold of $0.10/W by the end of 2024 or eventually in 2025, according to Tim Buckley, director of Australia-based think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF).
“This would be nicely ahead of Dr. Martin Green’s $0.10/W by 2030 forecast made three years back,” he told pv magazine, adding that he came to this conclusion after estimating that new annual PV additions may reach between 600 GW and 1 TW already by the end of this decade. “I am very bullish on the rate of global growth in solar installs over the next few years. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has reminded everyone of the need for supply chain and energy security, particularly in terms of imported energy reliance.”
Buckley also noted the likely new climate accord by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden, might see a formal call for a tripling of renewables capacity globally by 2030.
“At a time of massive capital investment cost blowouts, to be able to invest in deflationary solar is a massive global boon that will provide cost of living pressure relief as well as improved energy security,” he said.
Overcapacity issues
Buckley said price pressure will increase due to the staggering capacity increases announced by the PV industry at the global level, although he questioned a recent forecast by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its recent World Energy Outlook 2023, which claimed thaT the world’s cumulative installed solar capacity could reach 2 TW by 2025.
“I find the IEA assumption that the Chinese will run their brand new factories just 35% of the time as ludicrous,” he added. “As this new capacity is brought online for a full year, I would expect the IEA figures to be undercooked by over 50% in terms of global annual solar installs.”
Buckley estimates that solar module prices will end up dropping by 40% this year.
“This will give many investors in the US, India, EU and China good reasons to pause or rethink their financial assumptions that underpinned their announcements of massive capacity expansions,” he said. “Against this, both the US and India have 40% solar module import duties against Chinese products, so they are largely insulated from excessive price competition, and share the cost savings of the 70% decline in polysilicon price over the last year as well.”
Rapid deflation and excessive price pressures, on the other hand, may soon lead to the closure of old technology, sub-scale solar manufacturing facilities, both in China and globally.
“Old facilities simply can’t compete with the scale advantages nor the new technology investments of the world leading firms in this sector, almost all of which are Chinese,” said Buckley.
New cycle
Describing this new industry cycle for the solar PV technology, Buckley said it is different from previous ones, as solar is now the cheapest electricity, which is disrupting incumbent industry competitors.” This means finance will rapidly flee from investing in any new thermal power capacity in the electricity sector globally,” he said.
The analyst is convinced that finance won’t just flee for environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues or moralistic or climate reasons, but it will flee nonetheless because it will not provide new financing to inevitably stranded assets, particularly with the concurrent rapid scaling up of battery energy storage and EVs.
“This time is different because of the convergence of power-industry-transport markets,” Buckley said.
Tim Buckley is the main author of “Solar pivot: A massive global solar boom is disrupting energy markets and speeding the transition,” which was published by CEF in June. There, Buckley and his colleagues said they estimated solar electricity costs to drop 10% annually for the rest of this decade, halving by 2030. The report also provides detailed information on the operating and planned capacity of the global PV supply chain.

CEA started developing energy storage services in 2015, at a relatively early stage in the storage industry. The company foresaw the growth potential of stationary energy storage as a critical enabler of the renewable energy transition and a valuable asset for grid operators.
In the last eight years we have seen battery cells scaling from below 100 Ah to today’s 300-plus Ah; systems transforming from 12-meter, walk-in containers to today’s highly integrated, energy-dense modular cabinets; and the advent of liquid-cooled systems necessitated by big cells.
Battery suppliers have created specialized cell formats and chemistries for the stationary BESS sector, versus using electric vehicle cells in grid storage systems, as in the early days. We have also witnessed the transition of BESS’ from a nickel, cobalt, and manganese (NCM) battery cell chemistry – mainly supplied by South Korean and Japanese manufacturers – to lithium ferrous phosphate (LFP) devices, exclusively supplied by Chinese manufacturers. Other storage technologies, such as flow batteries, have yet to make a breakthrough and take a slice of the market from lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).
Overall, the industry is very different from a few years ago. This has brought significant challenges, exacerbated by a high growth rate. LIB chemistries have inherent limitations and violating them can lead to excessive degradation that almost invariably results in uncontrolled thermal runaway.
Manufacturing defects, as well as electrical, thermal, or mechanical abuses, can push battery cells into thermal runaway. In the best-case scenario, safety systems will prevent propagation of a fire, leading to the incapacitation of only part of a system. A worst-case scenario could see several containers burn, resulting in lengthy system downtime. Moreover, the complexity found in various subsystems creates additional points of failure that can lead to cell abuse and thermal runaway. A battery fire is the nightmare scenario that any BESS owner or operator wants to avoid at all costs, as it leads to significant reputational and financial damage and lengthy operational disruption.
CEA has been focusing on efficiently identifying the manufacturing risks associated with all levels of an energy storage system, through our quality assurance services. This work includes identifying risks across cell, module, rack, and containerized systems.
Since 2018, CEA’s team of engineers has been conducting quality assurance inspections across more than 26 GWh of lithium-ion energy storage projects deployed worldwide. Our quality assurance inspections are performed before production, at pre-production factory audits; during production, through in-line production monitoring; and after production via pre-shipment inspection and factory acceptance testing. More than 1,300 findings have been identified during CEA’s oversight at 52 factories globally. In this context, a finding is an issue identified during inspection that indicates deviation from standard best practice, process deviations, or product specifications.
Most industry newcomers overly focus on cell quality and don’t pay close enough attention to integration issues as cells are packaged into modules, racks, and containers. System level issues account for 47% of those identified, compared to 30% at the cell level and 23% at the module level. A battery cell’s complex manufacturing process, and high-performance sensitivity with respect to the robustness of the quality control system, make it the single-most risk-prone component within a BESS. But there are so many other components included in a containerized system that most risks come from the non-cell portions of the BESS. The large number of system-level findings is due to inadequate quality control of highly manual integration processes, the complex nature of energy storage systems, and system vulnerability to underlying problems originating from upstream components such as balance-of-plant (BOP) items and batteries. As the last step of the BESS manufacturing process, system integration can amplify underlying issues at sub-system levels and is vulnerable to additional quality and performance risks at the interfaces between sub-systems.
 
In integration factories, energy storage systems are built with many moving parts, a fact reflected by the large number of CEA findings on system enclosures – amounting to 45% of the total system-level findings (see chart to the left). However, the majority (84%) of the enclosure findings are minor and pose relatively low risk to system performance and safety. Enclosure inspection comprises visual inspection of appearance, strength and rigidity, wiring and cabling, grounding mechanism, and ingress performance.
The supporting components and system that form the BOP for a BESS consists of a fire detection and suppression system, a power distribution set-up and a thermal management system. A BESS is inherently vulnerable to defects originating from all upstream components and this is attested by the large number of direct findings in the BOP. The findings in sub-systems are typically caused by sub-component defects and bad practice during system integration. Representative findings include liquid coolant leakage due to deformed flange plates, malfunctioning gas sensors, ventilation failure due to incorrect installation, and live conductor exposure within AC/DC distribution.
Performance test findings contribute only 4% to the total number of system-level findings as capacity and round-trip efficiency (RTE) tests are procedurally straightforward and have explicit pass and fail criteria. In the worst cases, where a system fails both capacity and RTE tests, only two findings will be recorded. However, performance test findings indicate high risk as they are directly linked to system performance guarantees, and the root causes of any failed test usually point to a larger and deeper problem upstream.
Baseline performance tests are crucial to identifying system deficiencies, confirming contractually-promised metrics, and offering one last opportunity to rectify quality and performance issues. Between the two performance tests, a higher percentage of major and critical issues are found during the RTE test, which measures DC system cycling efficiency, excluding auxiliary loads. This is the most challenging test that shows how efficiently batteries have been assembled electrically. Capacity tests are at a more fundamental level and the risk of capacity shortfalls are usually hedged by an implicit rule in battery cell design – that is, to oversize capacity by around 5% at the cell level.
Underachieving system efficiency and capacity is often due to either batteries or BOP systems. The more common findings include underachieving capacity and RTE, resulting from abnormally large temperature and voltage variations among cells within a battery module; charging or discharging failure due to wiring issues in a battery rack’s high voltage boxes; and thermal runaway initiated in one of the battery modules by internal short circuiting.


Battery-related findings are identified at cell and module factories during the manufacturing and integration processes of the respective components.
The cell is where the electrochemical reactions take place at a nanoscale. Rigorous process control is required to avoid internal short circuiting caused by quality issues. The lengthy manufacturing process and high sensitivity to the storage, packaging, and shipping conditions of battery cells leads to a larger number of findings, compared with battery modules.
The overall cell manufacturing process can be divided into three stages: electrode manufacturing, cell assembly, and cell finishing. Cell assembly processes contain a larger number of findings with higher severity due to their close causal relationship with internal short circuiting. As battery cells evolve to 300 Ah, or even higher capacity levels, it is expected the associated risks will be aggravated due to higher requirements for burr size and foreign particle control during the cell assembly processes.
Similar to the system integration process, battery modules involve highly manual production processes including cell installation, interconnection welding, enclosing, and end of line testing. Cell installation and interconnection welding are responsible for 86% of all battery module-related findings.
Battery cell installation starts with polarity verification, with the cells then placed into brackets that have thermal insulation layers applied in between. Interconnection welding connects cells electrically into the designed configuration. The large number of findings in these two areas is mainly due to imprecision in material handling and welding quality control. Regarding the interconnection welding process, the majority of such findings are major and are caused by poorly defined welding procedures and sloppy operations.
The rapid pace of battery technology advancement means new risks are being introduced across the supply chain. Accordingly, a multi-stage quality control approach should start from risk assessment at the early stages of the procurement process.
The assessment should identify specific risks associated with project design and use cases, which should inform battery requirements. During production, quality assurance should be executed under close scrutiny to ensure all previously identified risks are covered.
One key takeaway from our 26-plus GWh quality assurance track record is that sometimes even perfect system test results cannot guarantee ongoing performance and reliability once systems are put into operation. Any given energy storage system is only as good as the pass criteria outlined in the supplier’s quality control checklist. We have seen performance test failures due to testing equipment limitations, round-trip efficiency targets that are set too low and do not conform to performance guarantees, temperature and voltage variations that are not monitored and analyzed, untested battery management system control functions, and more. Some of these problems can be addressed in the early procurement stage by conducting a gap analysis of a supplier’s quality assurance and testing protocols.
Ensuring the reliability and performance of BESS’ requires a continual process of reassessment. There should be frequent updates to quality-inspection best practice, risk tracking, and prioritization and development of mitigation approaches. The prize for buyers adhering to a multi-stage quality assurance approach is a safe battery system that performs as expected.

The price of wafers this week notched upward slightly as a result of the US dollar’s weakening relative to the Chinese yuan.
FOB China prices of Mono PERC M10 wafer increased by 0.68%, or $0.002 per piece (pc), to $0.295/pc this week, while Mono PERC G12 prices increased by 0.49%, or $0.002/pc, to $0.412/pc.
Currency fluctuations aside, the dynamics underlying China’s domestic market remained the same, leading to a continuation of the flat trend in the EXW wafer prices in the China domestic market for the second week running. The prices of Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafers remained stable at about CNY2.38 ($0.33)/pc and CNY3.32/pc, respectively.

Recently, low operating rates resulted in greater manufacturing costs for wafer producers, according to an integrated manufacturer. Now that wafer inventories have somewhat dropped, wafer makers are keen to increase their operating rates, the source continued.
There have been recent talks about wafer producers raising their operating rates and buying polysilicon at a faster rate due to the industry-wide sentiment that the price of polysilicon is about to bottom out. However, OPIS learnt from its market survey that the operating rates at wafer companies did not significantly grow, as production costs would decrease but losses would accumulate with unsold wafers.
According to a cell supplier, the consumption of inventories of good-quality wafers has slowed as some cell producers have been buying wafers of reduced quality. This may resonate with a few downstream users who have been worried about the impact that this cost war may have on module quality for 2024.
There are no profitable wafer companies currently, and some small-size wafer factories in China have closed, according to a market observer. Some wafer businesses are looking for chances to establish manufacturing facilities overseas in order to survive, the source continued.
Another source from upstream concurred, stating that wafer manufacturers would find it challenging to turn a profit in the near future. As a result, this source does not anticipate a notable increase in the operating rates of wafer companies, since more production entails higher losses.
Looking ahead, the industry expectation points to stable wafer prices, in equilibrium between weak demand and steady polysilicon and crucible cost.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/27/grid-interconnection-the-bottleneck-holding-back-renewables-developers/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 27, 2023",Grid interconnection: The bottleneck holding back renewables developers,"A clean energy future is coming. As the world is set to add a record-breaking amount of renewable energy to electricity systems within the next year, according to the IEA, solar and wind are leading the rapid expansion. However, there’s one major bottleneck holding back the clean energy transition, and more specifically renewable energy developers: getting renewable energy projects through the interconnection queue and online.
The reality is that without adequate electric grids and processes in place to connect this new wave of electricity supply with demand, it will be hard, if not impossible, to reach our clean energy goals. And given the fact that at least 3,000 GW of renewable energy projects are waiting in grid connection queues, the interconnection process clearly needs to be fixed and fast.
Developers facing interconnection delays
As the volume of renewable energy projects increased in the past few years, it quickly became clear that the existing processes and procedures in place were inadequate to handle the influx in requests. As such, developers have become accustomed to projects getting stuck in the interconnection queue and waiting nearly four years for approval to connect to the grid. Unfortunately, during this time the costs for materials can go up, purchase agreements can fall through, land options can expire and customers can pull out. As a result, developers are forced to walk away and cancel projects entirely. This not only upends the business model for developers but also threatens the billions in federal subsidies that are intended to translate into large emissions reductions to meet our clean energy goals.
Further clogging the queue
Another challenge for developers is that when one project is canceled, it often triggers the cancelation of other projects—further clogging the queue. For example, when one project goes away, grid operators tend to have to redo studies for other pending projects and ultimately shift costs to those other developers. Those developers then find themselves facing additional costs, say for network upgrades, and are more likely to be forced to walk away from a project.
On top of that, some developers submit multiple project proposals without any intent to actually build those projects, with the idea that one of those projects will come after another developer has already taken on additional costs. In short, the lack of suitable interconnection infrastructure and industry collaboration is resulting in a nonefficient, chaotic interconnection process.
Interconnection reform can and must be done right
So, how can the interconnection process be fixed? For starters, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reform is a giant step in the right direction. Enabling a more streamlined interconnection process, FERC’s ruling implements the notion of “first ready, first serve,” allowing projects to proceed through the queue in a more predicable fashion and preventing projects from being stuck behind others that may not be ready, nor will they ever be. The ruling also puts a firm obligation on the transmission owners to meet schedules and milestones or they will incur penalties. These incentives will ultimately shorten timelines and reduce delays.
While many questions remain, such as the treatment of existing queue projects versus new projects, this reform will benefit not only developers, but society as a whole. The bottom line is that if developers can’t get through the interconnection process and get steel in the ground quick enough, we won’t hit our clean energy goals.

A group of researchers led by Northwestern University in the United States announced it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.1% for a perovskite solar cell with an inverted configuration.
The US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has certified the result.
Inverted perovskite cells have a device structure known as “p-i-n”, in which hole-selective contact p is at the bottom of intrinsic perovskite layer i with electron transport layer n at the top. Conventional halide perovskite cells have the same structure but reversed – a “n-i-p” layout. In n-i-p architecture, the solar cell is illuminated through the electron-transport layer (ETL) side; in the p-i-n structure, it is illuminated through the hole‐transport layer (HTL) surface.
“Inverted perovskite solar cells are known for their impressive stability but have been held back by lower efficiency in turning sunlight into electricity,” the research’s lead author, Cheng Liu, told pv magazine. “This issue mainly arises at the point where the perovskite layer meets the electron transport layer, causing energy loss instead of being converted into useful power. The energy loss is primarily caused by carrier recombination, especially at the interface between perovskite and the electron transport layer.”
The research group utilized a pair of special molecules to interface to address the complex carrier recombination issue. “Firstly, we used sulfur-modified methylthio molecules to passivate surface defects and suppress recombination through strong coordination and hydrogen bonding,” Liu explained. “Secondly, we used diammonium molecules to repel minority carriers and reduce contact-induced interface recombination achieved through field-effect passivation.”
The scientists built the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) and phosphonic acid called methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz), a perovskite absorber, the passivation layer, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer (ETL), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
According to the researchers, their passivation approach led to a five-fold increase in carrier lifetime and a three-fold reduction in photoluminescence quantum yield losses. As a result, the inverted perovskite solar cells maintained stable operation at 65 C for over 2,000 h.
“This marks the first time inverted perovskite solar cells have crossed the 25% efficiency barrier following rigorous asymptotic maximum power scan protocol,” Liu said, noting that the previous record was 24.1%.
With the cell, the research team also fabricated all-perovskite tandem solar cells with an efficiency of up to 28.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.14 V, a short-circuit current density of 15.6 mA cm2 and a fill factor of 84.0%.
“We consider the multimolecule passivation approach, along with diverse functionalities, as a promising direction for exploring next-generation passivation strategies to achieve improved performance and stability in perovskite optoelectronics,” Liu explained.
The research team presented the new solar cell technology in the paper “Bimolecularly passivated interface enables efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science.

Climate change impacts, the need to feed a growing global population, rising energy costs, international conflicts, and shifting government policies and subsidies, are necessitating farmers and other stakeholders to look to innovative new technologies to adapt, and prosper, in this rapidly changing market.
Agriculture was one of the earliest industries to adopt solar photovoltaic (PV) energy. Rooftop installations on barns, sheds and other farm structures are used to generate free power for driving irrigation pumps and other critical systems or for selling to the local utility. However, agrivoltaics or agri-PV, where both a PV installation and agricultural activities coexist on the same piece of land, is increasingly seen as a viable solution for sustainable land use, without being detrimental to crop yields or solar production.
Twice the harvest
With about 14 GW of global capacity installed as of 2021, agri-PV offers the means to drastically reduce electricity bills with clean, renewable energy while increasing crop yields and balancing competing land interests. Dual-use farming occurs when elevated PV systems are installed on farmland where crops are cultivated, or where livestock grazes underneath. This method, also referred to as co-locating, can yield impressive results when done correctly and using the right technology. With dual-use farming, solar modules produce electricity, while providing optimal sunshine and shade for the crops underneath, reducing heat stress and water loss. This shade is also beneficial to livestock in the heat, and can help to protect them from harsh weather in winter too.
According to a study conducted by the University of Arizona, evaporation in tomatoes, peppers, cilantro and onions was cut by 50% due to the cooler temperatures below the panels. In turn, this meant irrigation could be cut by half, and temperature conditions for workers, or livestock if present, improved, with skin temperatures recorded as 20°F cooler under the panels. Similarly, a further Arizona study found that adding solar panels helped to moderate severe climate variability, helping to protect crops from weather related damage.
Research has also found that dual use aids the energy production of photovoltaic systems.  NREL found that traditional ground-mounted PV panels were substantially warmer during the day than those with the plant-based understory. The agrivoltaic panels were found to be 48°F cooler, which allowed for better performance. This allows farmers to enjoy the cost benefits of increased energy production, as well as the higher yields of their crops, or better livelihood of their grazing stock.
The right technologies for the job
One of the major challenges to successful agri-PV lies in the effective planning of solar and agricultural projects. For the two ecosystems to work in tandem, smart, responsive PV technologies must be leveraged in order to maximize both solar energy harvesting and crop yields. That is why equipment selection is critical. As crops have individual light compensation points, and are extremely susceptible to weather, agri-PV installations should include specialized systems to support cultivation.
Elevated solar modules can reduce the impact of hail, wind, and heavy rain while producing shade to protect crops from overexposure to the sun and keeping the soil moist. In this case, it is critical to use the correct type of solar module so as not to overexpose or underexpose the crops growing underneath. However, changing the structures of the modules, or using modules which allow more light to shine through, may diminish energy production.
For optimal results, maximizing both the crop harvest and the solar energy yield is best achieved by installing a module level power electronics (MLPE) based PV system. This is because MLPE technology, such as power optimizers, enables each module to produce at its maximum energy level independently, regardless of module orientation or shade / dirt exposure.
An MLPE system with power optimizers paired with solar trackers can further help maximize both the harvest and energy yield. Power optimizers ensure that each module delivers the maximum amount of solar power possible.  At the same time, the trackers use artificial intelligence (AI) to understand solar and agricultural seasonal patterns to tilt the modules as the sun moves in various directions throughout the day to boost power production.
Together, these key technologies allow for the optimization of both solar energy and crop growth, reducing levelized cost of electricity and maximizing the return on investment for the PV system owner while facilitating optimal conditions for agricultural cultivation.
In other cases, vertically mounted bifacial modules that can produce solar PV from both sides can be used to allow for more arable land. Here too, using MLPE technology with power optimizers, more power can be harvested from the installation. Power optimizers can also help mitigate power losses caused by module mismatch, which is not uncommon in bifacial modules, due to reduced surface albedo (the ability of the surface to reflect sunlight) and irradiance differences on the rear side of the module caused by increased levels of dirt and shading due to the ground proximity.
Livestock as a sustainable maintenance solution
Agri-PV also provides farmers with another major benefit: additional land for grazing livestock. Ground-mounted PV systems often require mowing contracts to keep the weeds and grass from overgrowing and reducing energy production. To keep vegetation under control, livestock can be used to graze.
When correctly managed, this model provides another win-win for both parties involved, as the herds benefit from access to feed, extra shade from the modules, and additional safety from predators due to secure fencing. In turn, the PV system owners and EPC contractors benefit from grazed pastures, reduced operation and maintenance costs from mowing, additional monitoring from on-site farmers, and strengthened relationships with local communities.
Protecting the land for pollinators
The most significant threat to pollinators is climate change and habitat loss, due to human conversion of grasslands for other land use.  Some studies show that solar farms can have many benefits for bee and butterfly farmers, when designed with pollinator-supporting plants such as prairie-clover or other wildflowers.
About 25% of native bee populations in the U.S. are at risk of extinction, while monarch butterfly populations have declined about 68% over the past two decades. This is leading some ground-mount PV installation owners to introduce pollinator-supporting plants, critical to our ecosystem. Planning these in conjunction with local beekeepers and conservation specialists allows them to develop habitats that research and support bee or butterfly species over long periods of time.
Maximizing harvests
Through the advent of Agri-PV, the solar and agricultural industries can work together to make significant progress toward transforming food supplies and accelerating the transition to clean energy. When planned carefully, and in cooperation with local farmers, agri-PV offers smart solution to many of the challenges we face today, and can ultimately help to create a brighter future for our planet.
