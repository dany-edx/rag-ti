The successful installer’s scope of work includes design, engineering, procurement and supply, construction and erection, testing, commissioning, associated transmission system, and five years of comprehensive operations and maintenance of the solar plant.
The produced energy will be utilized for captive consumption of the different consumer points located in Jharkhand State. The total 25MW may be connected to DVC-owned 132/33 KV substation at Patherdih, Chasnalla, Jharkhand, which is around 15 km from the proposed project site. 
CNUL will be responsible for the award of the work to the selected EPC contractor
The total contract period is 2,190 days.

Additional chief secretary, mines, petroleum and energy, Subodh Agarwal said an 800MW solar park will be developed in Jaisalmer and 1,000MW capacity in Bikaner in the first phase.
Rajasthan is also credited with developing the world’s largest solar park with a 2.245GW capacity at Bhadla in the Jodhpur district. Similarly, a 925MW solar park is being developed by the Renewable Energy Corporation at Nokh in Jaisalmer district. 
Agarwal said the ministry of new and renewable energy of the central government has issued approval to develop the 800MW solar park in Jaisalmer through Rajasthan Power Generation Corporation and 1,000MW solar park in Bikaner through Rajasthan Solar Park Development Company, a subsidiary of Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. He said both these parks would be developed under mode 8 of the central government’s scheme. 
Agarwal informed that 10,560MW of solar power capacity had been developed in the state.

Bangladesh started deploying its first solar panels in the early 2000s and now some of these modules are close to the end of their lifecycles, which means they will have to be recycled.
However, the country does not have any policies in place for solar PV waste management. Its recently enacted e-waste management rules do not consider solar module waste as electronic waste.
“PV waste management will be a big challenge if we do not take steps just now,” Mostafizur Rahman, a researcher at Bangladesh Jahangirnagar University, told pv magazine.
Rahman and a group of scientists investigated the country’s potential for PV module recycling in “Current challenges and future perspectives of solar-PV cell waste in Bangladesh,” which was recently published in Heliyon. They concluded that the management of end-of-life solar modules could be turned into a huge business opportunity if decisive steps are taken as soon as possible.
“We need a national guideline on solar panel waste management and turn them into resources,” he added.
The research group said that between 2025 and 2060, PV waste in Bangladesh could reach a total of 5.496 million tons, including 874,134 tons of glass, 77,206 tons of plastic, 121,407 tons of aluminum, 39,487 tons of silicon, and 6,719 tons of copper.
“In Bangladesh, a dedicated PV cell recycling system is currently unavailable,” the report said. “Therefore, a huge scope of resource recovery from wasted PV cells might be lost along with escalating environmental threats.”
The paper also notes that there are no PV waste recycling centers in Bangladesh at present. However, recycling centers could be established by enacting guidelines that could help to turn the country into a regional hub for solar module recycling. Several neighboring countries, such as Myanmar, currently have zero capacity for end-of-life PV module management.
“In northeastern India, the seven sister states of India are the contiguous states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Manipur. It is not practically feasible to connect with the e-waste recycling centers of India for these states. In that case more practical and cheaper option to transport PV wastes from these states may be to Bangladesh,” the researchers said, noting that new provisions could help the country to take advantage of this strategic potential.
Razinara Begum, an official in Bangladesh’s Department of Environment, said e-waste management rules have been prepared, but PV waste management has once again not been included.
“Various guidelines will be prepared under the rules where solar waste management can be added,” Begum told pv magazine.
Dipal C Barua, the president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, said most PV waste will start coming in 2025.
“We need to find out a mechanism for PV waste recycling. Already the battery wastes got resale value thus properly managed,” he told pv magazine. “The Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) can take a research project to check the ways for reuse of the PV waste.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/03/solar-module-anti-soiling-coating-for-retrofit-application/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 3, 2022",Solar module anti-soiling coating for retrofit application,"From pv magazine Global
Netherlands-based Rads Global Business BV has developed an anti-soiling and anti-reflective nanocoating for solar glass intended for application in existing PV systems.
Called HP+, the coating is claimed to increase power yield by between 4 and 7% compared to non-coated modules, over a period of up to five years. “Its cost is estimated at around €1.60 per module and application costs [are] approximately €0.10,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “But application costs may vary depending on local labor market conditions.”
The coating is currently being produced at different facilities in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The coating process involves four nanomaterials. Three compounds called NanoClean, Vetra clean, and Vtranova are used for preparing the glass surface for the deposition of a fourth material, which is called HydroPlus and creates a 120nm thick coating layer on the glass surface. This final element plays a key role in giving the panel anti-soiling, anti-abrasion, self-cleaning, and anti-reflection properties.
The coating can be applied to the modules via a spray process by a specialized installer or a robot, onto PV systems that are at least two years old. The coating kits can be used by Rads’ partner companies and the robot can be supplied by Rads in the future. “We developed a prototype robot for coating in collaboration with the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and the design is under [an] iterative process for testing and deployment,” the spokesperson added.
According to the manufacturer, the cost of the coating has a payback time of 2.5 to four years, depending on the dust level of the site. “More dust and pollution at the site will lead to a shorter payback period,” the spokesperson specified. “The main cost is for nanomaterials and we already produce material in quantities which are good enough to have shorter payback times.”
The coating has already shown extremely good results in real field conditions, according to the company. It was already tested across 10 unspecified sites in Europe, Africa, India and the USA.
