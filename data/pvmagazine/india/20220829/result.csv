(RIL), said this week that the company’s 10 GW solar cell and module factory in Jamnagar, Gujarat, will start production by 2024. The group will scale its annual output capacity to 20 GW by 2026 in a phased manner.
Reliance Industries said it will use REC Solar‘s technology for solar manufacturing at the Jamnagar factory. 
“This will be a first-of-its-kind of ‘quartz-to-module’ facility globally,” said Ambani, addressing RIL’s annual general meeting (AGM) this week.
He said the company would also invest in glass and POE film manufacturing. It claims to have a defined technology improvement roadmap to stay ahead in PV manufacturing.
“We target to increase the HJT module efficiency to 26% by 2026 from the current 23%, and further improve it to 28% through innovations like perovskite-tandem cell technology,” said Ambani. 
Reliance Industries also aims to extend the lifetime of PV modules from 25 to 50 years, to set a high benchmark for quality and reliability. In June 2021, the company announced plans to manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the renewable energy ecosystem. The plan included gigafactories for PV panels, energy storage, electrolyzers for green hydrogen, and fuel cells.
A spree of mergers and acquisitions has since marked Reliance Industries’ foray into those segments. For solar PV manufacturing, it acquired a 100% stake in REC Solar and its heterojunction solar panels. Ambani said Reliance Industries aims to make India a world leader in new energy manufacturing, as well as a credible alternative to China.
“We are well on our way to creating a manufacturing ecosystem [in the new energy segment], which will be fully integrated with secure and self-sufficient supply chains,” he said. “It will be backed by world-class talent and capabilities, built on the pillars of technological innovation through strategic partnerships. It will deliver modular, world-scale, affordable, and most modern green energy manufacturing business based in India, for India and the world.”
Ambani also announced a new gigafactory for power electronics – one of the key components linking the entire value chain of green energy.
“We are building significant capabilities in design and manufacturing of power electronics and software systems, integrating with our capabilities of telecommunications, cloud computing and IoT,” said Ambani. “[Reliance Industries] aims to start production of battery packs by 2023 and scale up to a fully integrated 5 GWh annual cell-to-pack manufacturing facility by 2024, and further scale up to 50 GWh annual capacity by 2027.” 
For green hydrogen, Reliance Industries has partnered with Stiesdal to accelerate cost reduction and commercialization of their pressurized alkaline electrolyzer technology.
“We are also in advanced discussions to partner with other leading electrolyzer technology players globally to set up a giga-scale electrolyzer manufacturing facility at Jamnagar,” said Ambani.

It said the upgrade will help it meet strong demand growth for its smart power solutions and energy management technologies.
The smart facility harnesses advanced collaborative robotics technology for better human-machine interface, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced digitalization technologies. It manufactures, tests, and supplies ABB Smart Power’s complete range of low-voltage power equipment and energy management technologies to meet industry demand for increased reliability and energy savings. It caters to commercial and residential buildings, infrastructure operators, utilities, and solar and wind power systems.
The ABB Smart Power factory spans more than 8,400 square meters, and links equipment such as “cobots,” motors, and drives to the Internet of Things (IoT). The connected factory software highlights process optimization opportunities and schedules predictive maintenance to maximize productivity and efficiency. This resulted in enhanced productivity of 40% in the same space, with an energy efficiency of 15%, and a 50% improvement in the test automation ratio.
“The upgrades and expansion at the Bangalore factory make it one of our most advanced production facilities in the world. The adoption of exciting new Industry 5.0 technologies makes this an ideal home for the production, testing, and supply of ABB Smart Power’s technologies,” said Giampiero Frisio, president of the smart power division at ABB Group.
This facility also uses different types of robots with combined autonomous test cells for different product variants. 
“Through our own digital transformation at this facility, we will be able to demonstrate the benefits of adopting smart solutions directly to our customers. We believe that this will encourage the shift towards digital and sustainable manufacturing in India,” said Kiran Dutt, president of electrification for ABB India. “Smart factories would be the cornerstone for the Indian manufacturing sector to leapfrog and manufacture quality electrification products and solutions to support the country’s next level growth across sectors sustainably.”

Belgium-based PV module manufacturer Belinus has launched an ultra-black double-glass bifacial heterojunction solar module for residential applications.
“All solar cells and solar panels produced by Belinus are manufactured in Bloomberg Tier-1 factories with a combined annual capacity of 2,2 GW in Vietnam and Turkey,” a company’s spokesperson told pv magazine.
The M8 nLite Ultra Black Double Glass Module panel is based on 166 mm x 83 mm monocrystalline solar cells sourced in Thailand and 1.6mm thin double glass. “All our products rely on our proprietary heat-strengthened glass processing technology called nLite technology,” the spokesperson explained. “The use of thinner glass reduces the workloads of the installation compared to standard dual-glass products, while withstanding high wind and snow loads.”
The module features a nominal power of 400 W and a power conversion efficiency of 22.0%. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 44.7 V and the short-circuit current is 10.7 A.
The new product measures 1,755 mm x 1,038 mm x 30 mm and weighs 19.2 kg. It has a temperature coefficient of -0.25% per C, an operating temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C, and an IP 68 enclosure. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
“The guarantee for our glass-glass solar modules is 35 years reinsured by Lloyds group,” the spokesperson stated. “The module should be available in the fourth quarter via distribution partners across Europe.”
Belinus is based in Genk and currently operates in more than ten countries.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/29/trina-solar-achieves-24-24-efficiency-for-210-mm-n-type-topcon-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 29, 2022",Trina Solar achieves 24.24% efficiency for 210 mm n-type TOPCon solar cell,"From pv magazine Global
China’s Trina Solar has revealed that it has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.24% for an n-type TOPCon solar cell based on 210 mm wafers. The results have been confirmed by TÜV Nord in Germany.
“In March, Trina Solar brought the maximum efficiency of 25.5% for large-area 210 × 210mm i-TOPCon cells, setting a new world record for industrial large-area n-type i-TOPCon cell, the company said in a statement. “Trina Solar’s researchers in State Key Laboratory of PV Science and Technology developed multi-busbar and novel encapsulation technologies, together with non-destructive laser cutting technology to improve module efficiency. By using large-area 210mm n-type i-TOPCon cells, they brought the maximum aperture efficiency of 24.24% for large-area 600 W+ modules with an area of 2.807 m2.”
The manufacturer said this is the first time that a module aperture efficiency of more than 24% has been achieved with industrial large-area n-type i-TOPCon cells.
In mid-July, Trina achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% for a p-type PERC solar cell based on 210 mm wafers. These results, confirmed by the State Key Laboratory of PV Science and Technology in China, represented a world record for this cell type, it claimed. In August 2021, the cell still had an efficiency of 23.5%, which means that it had gained 1 percentage point in less than 12 months.
In a recent interview with pv magazine, Helena Li, president of the company’s global cell and module business, presented plans to release new TOPCon solar modules. However, she said the whole n-type transition is now being postponed. The company now plans to raise its capacity for new n-type products from 500 MW to 20 GW by the end of 2023.
“We are also looking at interdigitated back-contact (IBC) and heterojunction, but first we want to expand our TOPCon business,” said Li.
