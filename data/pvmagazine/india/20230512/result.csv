The guidelines emphasize using clean energy in port operation and developing port capabilities for storage, handling, and bunkering of greener fuels such as green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol.
“Indian Ports will play an important role in contributing towards de-carbonization efforts of the country. Ports are, therefore, required to undertake green initiatives in line with the broad vision of the country and contribute to the efforts being made by the country in moving towards achieving India’s long-term goal of reaching net-zero emission by 2070,” states the document.
These guidelines shall apply to all major ports of India and seek the participation of all stakeholders, including terminal operators, logistics service providers, partner government agencies, shipping lines, etc., to ensure a sustainable and green port ecosystem.
The guidelines state renewable energy’s share at ports should exceed 60% by 2030 and 90% by 2047. Ports will make efforts to retrofit port crafts (including tugs, pilot boats, mooring boats, survey boats, etc) with available technology for propulsion on cleaner and greener fuel, viz, green ammonia, green hydrogen (through fuel cell), and green methanol in a phased manner.
Further, ports will make an action plan and implement the projects to achieve the targets set for the ports/port crafts in the National Green Hydrogen Mission, including the creation of infrastructure at select ports for storage, bunkering, and refueling of green hydrogen and its derivative, within the targeted timelines. And green ammonia bunkers and refueling facilities should be established at all major ports by 2035.

TP Saurya Ltd will develop the PV project in Bikaner, connected to the central transmission utility (CTU) bus.
The plant is set for commissioning by March 2024. When operational, it is expected to supply 485 million units of energy annually.
With this win, TPREL’s total renewables capacity has swelled to 6,788 MW with an installed capacity of 3,917 MW (2,989 MW solar and 928 MW wind) and 2,871 MW under various stages of implementation.

Co. Ltd announced this week that its division Godrej Electricals & Electronics has secured orders worth over INR 2,000 crore ($244 million) from power transmission, railways, and solar sectors. The projects include engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) for extra-high-voltage (EHV) substations of 400 kV and 765 kV across India, a gas-insulated substation (GIS) with 220 kV underground cable in Mumbai, and a 132 kV substation project in Nepal. 
In the solar segment, the company has secured an order for a 20 MW ground-mounted solar plant in West Bengal. The order supports the business’ aim to grow its solar EPC portfolio by 30% annually over the next three years.
Godrej Electricals & Electronics has marked its entry into railway electrification with a project of over INR 900 crore from Indian Railways to construct traction substations and associated works. The project is a part of ‘Mission Raftar’ for upgrading speed to 160 kmph/200 kmph on the existing New Delhi-Howrah Route and between Mathura-Palwal on the existing New Delhi-Mumbai Routes.
Raghavendra Mirji, senior vice president & business head of Godrej Electricals & Electronics, said, “These orders align well with our diversification strategy to strengthen the power transmission sector and enter the Railways and International Segments. With the substation orders in Power Transmission, we have now diversified our customer base to include non-utility clients, in addition to the current power utilities. With these orders, G&B has expanded its portfolio in EHV Cable, EHV Substation, Traction Substation & Solar projects across India as well as in Nepal.”

A solar panel manufacturing facility run by major provider JinkoSolar is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, according to local news outlets. 
Agents from Homeland Security, the FBI, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol entered the Jacksonville, Fla. Facility after executing a search warrant. Employees were sent home, and agents from the three agencies were seen on-scene at the facility. 
“That’s part of an ongoing federal investigation,” said Homeland Security spokesman Mike Meares. 
The 400 MW, 283,652 square-foot production facility reached operations in 2018, employing 270 people. The site expected to nearly double its capacity following a recently announced $52 million private investment and a $2.3 million economic development grant from the city of Jacksonville.
JinkoSolar offered this statement to pv magazine:
“JinkoSolar is committed to operating in accordance with the highest ethical standards and adhering to the laws and regulations of the countries where it operates, including the United States. Jinko, through external counsel, is engaging constructively with relevant agencies to understand the nature of the inquiry, and the company’s business operations are running normally, including in Jacksonville.”
As a solar component supplier based in China, JinkoSolar and its competitors have faced pressure from U.S. enforcement of trade law. Goods shipped from the Xinjiang province in China are subject to enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which requires documentation to show the components have no connection to forced labor. Other major suppliers, including Longi, Trina Solar, and Canadian solar have had components detained under UFLPA. 
Suppliers are also dealing with navigating the antidumping and countervailing (AD/CVD) investigation, which was launched as solar suppliers from China were alleged of dodging tariffs by circumventing them through Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia. JinkoSolar’s operations in Malaysia were found to not be in violation of AD/CVD laws. 
Goods found in violation of antidumping laws can be retroactively assessed with 50% to 250% tariffs. This looming threat of tariffs has been damaging to the U.S. solar component supply chain over the last year, slowing project installations. 
As a result, President Joe Biden placed a two-year pause on tariffs related to the AD/CVD case, and now the move is facing pressure. The U.S. Senate voted to lift the moratorium, reinstating tariffs, though President Biden has expressed he will veto the resolution. If the Senate can achieve a two-thirds majority, it can override Biden’s veto. 
A recent report by Solarbe ranked JinkoSolar as the largest solar panel supplier in the world. The company delivered 13 GW of panels in Q1 2023, 50% of which were the N-type Tiger Neo panel. The quarter represented a growth of 72.7% over the previous year’s Q1.

Meyer Burger and German PV product distributor Magog have announced a distribution agreement for Meyer Burger Slate, a new version of the Meyer Burger Tiles that the Switzerland-based heterojunction solar module manufacturer unveiled last year.
Starting in August, the companies will offer slate-gray photovoltaic roof coverings in Europe. They feature housing made of powder-coated aluminum, special glass, and Meyer Burger’s heterojunction solar cells with its SmartWire technology. The final assembly is done by a European partner. This product variant allows for the integration of PV systems into sloping slate roofs.
“The new ‘Meyer Burger Slate – Magog Schiefer Edition’ is characterized by a high energy yield and is easy to deploy and maintain for installers,” said Georg Guntermann, managing partner for Magog. “The new Meyer Burger product in slate gray harmonizes with the slate roof and can be unobtrusively integrated into the building by using glare-free, structured solar glass.”
Magog and Meyer Burger are currently using the product in pilot projects.
“In the spirit of a comprehensive energy transition, this small-format and aesthetic solar roof tile with a uniform gray look fits harmoniously into slate roofs and thus also makes the energy transition possible for listed buildings,” said Frank Hötzsch, a division manager at Meyer Burger.
