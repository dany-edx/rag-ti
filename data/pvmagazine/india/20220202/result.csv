Spread over 49 acres, the solar power plant is set to generate 25.52 million units of electricity per annum, which shall be utilized to power Dalmia Cement’s Kapilas Cement Manufacturing Works (KCMW) in Odisha.
Furthering Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Limited’s sustainability goal of becoming carbon negative by 2040, this initiative will enhance the plant’s energy efficiencies. The 17.1 MW plant will allow the KCMW Cuttack plant to reduce its day-time power dependency on fossil fuels by over 40% and replace it with a clean, emissions-free, and renewable energy source.
“As one of India’s leading cement companies, we remain committed to responsible environmental stewardship by providing green building solutions and embedding sustainable mechanisms within our organizational value chain,” said Ganesh Jirkuntwar, National Manufacturing Head of Dalmia Cement Bharat Limited.
“We see the solar power plant expansion at our KCMW plant in Cuttack as providing the right impetus for our endeavors to continually adopt the cleanest and most economical fuel. We are confident that this move will help bolster DCBL’s sustainability target of RE100 by 2030 as we march towards taking our overall installed cement capacity to 110 -130 million tonnes by 2031.”
The project was executed in a record time of two and a half months and will reduce conventional power consumption by 27%. Power consumption from the solar plant will ensure seamless production at the KCW, Cuttack plant, especially during emergencies such as preventive maintenance or breakdowns.
Bhavesh Wala, Plant Head at Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Limited, KCMW (Cuttack), said, “By shifting to solar power and other renewable energy sources at our facility, we are progressively reducing our overall carbon footprint while meeting our sustainability commitments and heading towards RE100 by 2030. This will also enable us to meet our capacity expansion plans over the years for which we see a balanced energy mix as a key advantage.”

The projects are to be set up in sizes of 2-10 MW (2×5 MW).
MSEDCL shall sign a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the selected developers. The ceiling tariff is fixed at INR 3.10/kWh.
The solar power generator shall be responsible for the design, finance, procurement of land, engineering, procurement, construction, operation and maintenance of the projects. 
“Projects under construction, projects which are not yet commissioned and projects already commissioned but do not have any long-term PPA with any agency, and selling power on short-term or merchant plant basis shall be eligible,” as per the tender document.
MSEDCL has created a land portal where farmers have applied to rent out their lands for solar projects under the MSKVY scheme. The bidder shall identify the land required for the project.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/02/bloombergnef-says-global-solar-will-cross-200-gw-mark-for-first-time-this-year-expects-lower-panel-prices/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"FEBRUARY 2, 2022","BloombergNEF says global solar will cross 200 GW mark for first time this year, expects lower panel prices","From pv magazine Global
In 2021, photovoltaic systems with a combined capacity of 183 GW were installed worldwide — almost 40 GW more than in 2020, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF) reports.
As a result of this strong growth, the analyst has revised upwards its outlook for 2022, expecting new systems may total between 204 and 252 GW. Considering any possible scenario, the mark of 200 GW should be broken through for the first time this year.
China will drive demand and rooftop PV will be the fastest-growing segment. Record growth of 20 GW will be achieved by residential installations. Commercial and industrial systems will also see their share increase, as these are becoming more and more profitable against the background of rising electricity prices and electricity shortages in the country. Overall, the BloombergNEF analysts are expecting an increase in new capacity of between 81 and 92 GW this year in China.
The analyst also expects current high module prices will drop soon. In 2021, polysilicon shortage drove the prices for 166 mm monocrystalline solar modules up to $0.278 per watt. For this year, polysilicon production will increase by 39% as new manufacturing facilities are coming online in China. The price of polysilicon has been falling again since October – from $37 to $32 per kg by the end of the year. This trend will continue and prices of between $20 and $25 per kg can be expected in the second half of the year. Increasing efficiency in the production of large wafers with a size of 210 mm will further contribute to further reducing module prices. For the second half of the year, BNEF predicts that the module price will be between 11 and 15% lower, reaching $23/24 per Watt.
Overall, BNEF assumes that production capacities will increase along the entire photovoltaic value chain. New cell factories with an annual capacity of more than 10 GW for TOPCon and heterojunction products are currently being built. Furthermore, the analyst revealed that annual production capacity for PERC solar cells was more than 400 GW at the end of the year.
New production capacities for solar cells and solar modules are also increasing outside of China. This is particularly evident in India, the US and Europe. However, the new production lines are emerging rather slowly and the BNEF analysts do not assume that there will be a sharp increase in the amount of products manufactured outside of China this year. Manufacturers in India, the US and Europe must be aware that they are expanding into an oversupply market where there is guaranteed demand for their photovoltaic products at premium prices, the analysts said.
Growing storage market
BloombergNEF also expects the number of solar-plus-storage power plants to double this year. According to the BNEF database, a total of 278 of these power plants with a combined storage capacity of 7.7 GW is currently operational, with China and the US leading the way.
The demand for rooftop solar arrays combined with residential storage systems is increasingly on the political agenda in many countries and is becoming increasingly important as a sector, the analyst continues. In the US state of Hawaii, for example, almost every new residential PV system is combined with a battery. In Germany, the rate is around 50% and in Switzerland around 5%. BNEF expects at least two more countries to surpass the 50% mark in new installations by the end of the year.
In Europe, Bloomberg analysts expect a significant increase in the number of power purchase agreements (PPAs) concluded for photovoltaic systems. They name Poland, Denmark and Germany as countries in which such agreements will increasingly be sealed this year. This is also to be expected in Spain once the political uncertainties have been resolved.
