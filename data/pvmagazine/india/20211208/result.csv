This massive reduction in investors’ risk perception is due to the significantly improved financial viability of India’s renewable energy projects over the last decade on account of favorable policy support from the central government. As recently as 2015, less than 50% of the projects in the sector enjoyed such favorable ratings from credit rating agencies on their debt issuances, according to the report.
The CEEW-CEF study, supported by Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, also highlighted that out of the 90 renewable energy projects evaluated by three credit rating agencies in 2020 and considered in the report, only six wind energy projects had below-investment-grade ratings. Of the 44 solar projects evaluated, 26 enjoyed an ‘A’ rating and nine were rated as ‘AA’- indicating an extremely low probability of default. Further, five solar projects received BBB ratings on their debt issuances. Similarly, of the 46 wind energy projects evaluated, 30 projects received an ‘A’ rating, while another ten projects were given ‘BBB’ rating by the credit rating firms.
The study found that the government’s decision to introduce Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) as an intermediary to buy power from solar projects in 2017, has had a very positive impact. Tariffs declined by 24%, over the next eighteen months solely on account of this policy decision. More importantly, tariffs reduced despite a slight increase in interest rates on loans during the period. SECI’s introduction led banks to favorably assess RE projects, and investors to accept lower returns on their investments.
Gagan Sidhu, Director, CEEW Centre for Energy Finance, said, “Consistent policy support has played a key role in the evolution of India as the fourth largest renewable energy market, with a total installed capacity of more than 100 GW. Policy measures such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for encouraging local manufacturing of solar PV modules can further reduce the cost of solar projects in the coming decades. Such long-term policy impact would be critical to achieving the target of installing 500 GW of RE by 2030. India will need investments worth over USD 20 billion per year to achieve its 2030 targets for generation alone. Access to foreign capital is critical to our long and short-term targets.”
The CEEW-CEF study ‘How have India’s RE Policies Impacted its Wind and Solar Projects?’ evaluated the credit ratings of 143 solar energy and 101 wind energy projects between 2010 and 2020, with a cumulative debt of INR 38,000 and INR 43,000 crore, respectively.
Vaibhav Pratap Singh, Programme Lead, CEEW-CEF, said, “Solar and wind energy combined with battery storage technology will be the drivers for decarbonizing electricity generation, the contributor of over 40% GHG emissions in the country. India’s policy stewardship has helped solar become an investment magnet, with record investments pouring in from domestic and international investors in the recent past. However, to achieve continued growth in line with the upcoming target of 500 GWs of renewable by 2030 and later for net-zero by 2070, the policies would need to fix leaking buckets like discoms and go beyond the arrangements like SECI. Sustained policy support, especially on the distribution side of the business, will be vital.”
The CEEW-CEF study highlighted that short-term RE capacity enhancement targets, announced in 2015, coupled with other policy measures such as bypassing distribution company’s risk using Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI), have helped reduce the risk perception of these projects among investors. Reduction in yields on benchmark government bonds and improvement in technology also helped reduce the cost of financing for these RE projects.

The DFC financing will support First Solar’s 3.3 GW/annum vertically integrated solar module manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu, India.
The foundation stone for the First Solar fab was recently laid out at Pillaipakkam.
First Solar is the only U.S. company among the world’s ten largest solar manufacturers. It announced its intent to build the India facility in July 2021, shortly after it unveiled plans for a new $680 million factory in Ohio that will add 3.3 GW of new domestic manufacturing capacity in the United States by 2023, while creating over 700 new manufacturing jobs. The company expects to reach 16 GW of global manufacturing capacity in 2024.
“DFC is thrilled to be in a position to support First Solar’s new venture in India, which will boost solar panel manufacturing capacity for a key ally and help mobilize the industry to take up better standards that align with U.S. values,” said Dev Jagadesan, DFC’s Acting Chief Executive Officer. “This transaction represents another milestone in the United States effort to drive alternative supply chains – and to articulate a vision for climate finance that drives our development mission.”
“Like the United States, India has recognized that it must shape its own sustainable energy future, and has sought to supercharge the expansion of its domestic solar manufacturing capacity,” said Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer, First Solar. “DFC’s intent to support this facility has the potential to create a high-visibility, repeatable blueprint for enabling the clean energy ambitions of likeminded nations through American innovation, ingenuity, and competitiveness.”
This investment will promote DFC’s commitment to diversifying supply chains. First Solar produces “thin film” solar panel modules, which do not use polysilicon. First Solar, which was the first of the world’s ten largest solar manufacturers to join the Responsible Business Alliance, will replicate its industry-leading transparency and traceability protocols in India, amplifying efforts to boost supply chain transparency throughout the renewable energy sector, read the DFC statement.
Optimized for the country’s unique operating environment, most of the new facility’s module production is expected to sell into the quickly growing solar market in India.

With this, the developer has surpassed the operational capacity of 1 GW with the total management and developmental portfolio of 2.94 GW.
“With 1.09 GW of operating capacity, we are providing access to clean energy to millions of households in India. Ayana is constantly working towards contributing to our India’s Energy Transition,” the company stated.
Ayana was founded in January 2018 by U.K. government-owned development finance institution CDC Group to develop renewable energy projects in India. 
The platform develops utility-scale renewable power solar and wind generation projects across India to build cost-effective capacity. It is looking at organic and inorganic growth models to ensure a balanced risk portfolio.
