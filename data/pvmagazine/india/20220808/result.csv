It said that its analysts expect India to install about 20 GW of solar this year, including 16.5 GW of utility-scale capacity and 3.5 GW of rooftop PV.
Rajasthan accounted for 54% of all PV installations in the January-June period by adding 4.5 GW of capacity. It was followed by Gujarat with 1.5 GW and Tamil Nadu with 860 MW.
India had cumulatively installed 114 GW of renewables  capacity by the end of June, according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). Solar energy accounts for 51% of all renewables installations, followed by wind energy at 36%, bio-power at 9%, and small hydro at 4%.
“The country’s capacity addition in the utility-scale domain has been commendable, and it is on track to achieve nearly 97% of its 60 GW target,” said JMK Research. “On the other hand, in rooftop solar, just over one-quarter of the 40 GW target is likely to be achieved. By December 2022, this segment is expected to fall short of its target by 25 GW.”

The renewables developer signed the PPA with Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Ltd. (RUMSL), a joint venture between Solar Energy Corp. of India and Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. RUMSL has been selected as a solar power park developer for the state of Madhya Pradesh by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
RUMSL is planning a 600 MW floating solar park at the Omkareshwar Reservoir. Upon completion, it will be India’s largest floating PV plant and one of the world’s biggest floating solar installations. The project will be developed in two 300 MW phases at pre-identified locations on the Omkareshwar Reservoir.
Amp Energy will develop the project under the BOOT model. The project is expected to generate about 198 million units of electricity per year, helping to mitigate about 85,654 metric tons of CO2 per annum. The company said it now has a portfolio of more than 2 GW of renewable energy capacity across 15 states in India.
