1,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/15/after-sale-support-key-to-boosting-off-grid-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MICROGRID,MINIGRID,OFF-GRID SOLAR,WORLD",MATTHEW LYNAS,2024-03-15,After-sale support key to boosting off-grid solar,"Off-grid solar energy customers are currently facing several challenges, according to the Why Off Grid Energy Matters report released by US-based impact measurement company 60 Decibels.
The report analyzes issues such as product affordability, gender inequality, customer support, further investment in minigrids, and over-indebtedness, and proposes a series of recommendations to overcome them. The indebtedness recommendation, in particular, stems from reports from 5% of customers surveyed who said they find payments for their energy product or service to be a significant financial burden.
On customer support, Kat Harrison, director at 60 Decibels, told pv magazine there is room for improvement in the way some off-grid energy companies approach after-sale support. Issues ranging from technical faults, to a lack of customer education covering how to effectively use products, risk reputational damage for businesses and the off-grid technologies they sell.
“Some of these challenges prevent end users from unlocking the full benefits of energy access,” she stated. “So many of these markets rely on word of mouth. If your neighbor or friend is sharing their experience of their new solar product – and it doesn’t work or customer service is bad – then people won’t uptake these technologies.”
Despite these challenges, Harrison was positive about the role PV and other off-grid technologies can play in improving energy access globally. “Off-grid energy offers a real opportunity to get us closer to universal energy access, with benefits at a household level, and also a community and national level. We see real productivity, community, and economic impacts,” she added.
Solar lanterns
The report was compiled using survey data from more than 79,000 respondents in 31 countries. Field workers in each country contacted customers directly based on data supplied by 164 companies.
At a product level, the solar lantern offered the greatest return on investment in terms of quality of life improvement, according to the report. Of those surveyed, 64% of respondents with a solar lantern said it had “very much improved” their quality of life, while 62% of those with a residential PV installation said the same.
Around 88% of survey respondents live in Africa and East Africa was the largest region by number of customers surveyed, accounting for 68% of the total. A further 10% of respondents live in Asia and 1% were in Latin America.
Economic impact
The economic impact of off-grid energy was investigated as part of the survey fieldwork. It revealed that although 26% of off-grid energy customers had increased spending on energy, this was often accompanied by a higher level of service, such as longer-lasting or more reliable electricity access. And while 82% used off-grid energy products at home, 11% said they used off-grid energy in their business or farm, with 7% using energy products in both locations.
Economic gains were reported by those who did use off-grid energy products for business, with 58% stating they had experienced an increase in income due to the energy access.
Financing plays a significant role in off-grid solar deployment, according to the report. Of those surveyed, 74% said they bought energy products using some form of payment plan or loan. That figure rises to 92% when those who installed a PV system at home are considered in isolation.
Economic inclusivity was also examined and minigrids were revealed as the off-grid energy solution with the highest proportion of customers living in poverty. While 41% of all survey respondents were living below global poverty thresholds, 51% of minigrid customers were living in poverty. The survey also found users living in poverty tended to report higher impacts from gaining access to off-grid energy across a range of outcomes.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/15/how-green-credits-and-green-loyalty-programs-are-shaping-a-sustainable-future/,"CLIMATE CHANGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,SUSTAINABILITY,INDIA,WORLD",,2024-03-15,How green credits and green loyalty programs are shaping a sustainable future,"In an era where the clarion call for environmental conservation rings louder than ever, businesses across the globe are stepping up, innovating not just in products and services but in fostering a culture of sustainability among consumers.
The emergence of green credits and green loyalty programs is a testament to this shift, showcasing how the corporate world can play a pivotal role in promoting eco-friendly behaviors. These initiatives are not just about making green choices more appealing; they’re about integrating them into the very fabric of our daily lives, ensuring that each action we take is a step toward a more sustainable future.
What are green loyalty programs? Ingeniously designed to reward customers for making environment friendly choices. For instance, a retail chain might offer points for every reusable bag used, a distribution-led company might include more than 50% rewards made of sustainable products, or an online marketplace might provide discounts on future purchases for customers who opt for carbon-neutral shipping.
These incentives, though seemingly small, add up to create significant environmental impacts. As per the Channel Loyalty Report 2024, a study revealed that such programs could reduce single-use plastic consumption by up to 30% annually in participating communities, illustrating the power of collective action in environmental preservation.
Moreover, green credits take this concept a step further by quantifying the environmental benefits of sustainable actions tangibly. By participating in activities such as cycling to work, recycling, or using renewable energy, individuals and companies earn credits that can be redeemed for various benefits. This system not only recognizes and rewards every effort but also provides a clear measure of the positive impact these actions have on the planet. Imagine a city implementing a green credit system for public transportation usage can see a 15% increase in ridership within the first year, significantly reducing carbon emissions.
The beauty of these programs lies in their versatility and adaptability across different industries. From airlines offering miles for carbon offsets, to coffee shops giving discounts for bringing a reusable cup, the possibilities are endless. These initiatives demonstrate how businesses can lead by example, encouraging sustainable consumer behavior while still driving economic growth.
Take the case of a European country which launched a national green loyalty program, where every citizen earns points for sustainable living practices. These points can be used for tax deductions, public service benefits, or discounts at local businesses. Within two years of implementation, the country reported a 20% reduction in household carbon footprints, setting a benchmark on how national policies can drive sustainable change through incentivization (Ref: Nu Spaarpas scheme launched in Rotterdam, the Netherlands)
As we forge ahead, the integration of technology and data analytics into green loyalty programs will further enhance their effectiveness. Personalized rewards, real-time tracking of environmental impact, and gamification can make these programs more engaging and rewarding for consumers, encouraging wider participation.
To Summarize, green credits and green loyalty programs represent a burgeoning movement towards sustainability that transcends traditional environmental activism. They embody a partnership between businesses and consumers, where every green choice is celebrated and rewarded. By prioritizing sustainability in our consumption patterns, we not only contribute to the health of our planet but also pave the way for future generations to thrive in a cleaner, greener world. As we continue to innovate and expand these programs, let us remember that every step taken toward sustainability, no matter how small, is a leap toward a sustainable future for all.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/15/electric-mobility-promotion-scheme-to-keep-the-electrification-pace-intact-icra/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,ASIA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,2024-03-15,Electric mobility promotion scheme to keep the electrification pace intact: ICRA,"The announcement of the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme 2024 is a timely move by the Government of India to support electric vehicle adoption in the country as the FAME-II subsidy scheme is about to end on March 31, 2024, according to rating agency ICRA.
The new scheme offers reduced subsidy benefits on a per vehicle basis than the existing FAME-II guidelines. As per ICRA’s calculations, the initial purchase cost of an e-2W would increase by close to 10% compared to that with the FAME-II subsidy. Moreover, this would make an e-2W over 70% costlier (in terms of initial purchase price) than a petrol scooter.
ICRA sees the reduction in subsidy benefits as a short-term impediment for e2W manufacturers that could exert pressure on cost structures. “If price hikes are not completely passed on, the pick-up in volumes is expected to partially mitigate the impact. Nevertheless, their ability to ensure timely fund raise to support the capital structure or competitiveness of manufacturers would be the key,” stated ICRA.
On March 13, 2024, the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India, announced the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme 2024 with a total outlay of INR 500 crore to support the adoption of e-2Ws and e-3Ws (including e-rickshaws, e-carts, and L5 category vehicles) for a period of four months from April 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024. Around two-thirds of the outlay is proposed to be earmarked for e-2Ws.
As per the scheme, the subsidy for e-2Ws has been reduced to INR 5,000/kWh of battery capacity from INR 10,000/kWh earlier with a cap of INR 10,000 per vehicle for e-2W (from 15% of ex-showroom price earlier), INR 25,000 for e-rickshaw/e-cart and INR 50,000 for L5 category e-3Ws, respectively.
Shamsher Dewan, senior vice president and group head – corporate ratings, ICRA, said, “The Government’s announcement to offer incentives under a new scheme for e-2Ws and e-3Ws will continue to provide a disruption-free environment for e-2W OEMs just before the FAME-II scheme was about to end. Although the reduction in the subsidy benefit is a short-term impediment and may impact demand to some extent, OEMs will continue to strive to offer competitive products by leveraging their cost structure through localization of key components and value engineering capabilities. In addition, softening in battery cell prices (which accounts for almost 40% of the vehicle cost) will also help them offset the impact of lower subsidies to some extent.”
ICRA estimates the payback period could get elongated to 5.5 years vis-à-vis five years under the FAME-II framework, in a scenario wherein the e-2W manufacturers completely pass on the subsidy reduction amount to the consumers in the form of price hikes.
However, the long-term potential for e-2W segment remains favourable aided by the improving cost of ownership vis-à-vis ICE vehicles and enhanced customer confidence with regard to range anxiety, financing avenues, and other vehicle attributes such as safety.
In addition, the Government’s focus on promoting electric vehicles through various initiatives (including PLI) will continue to drive electric vehicle adoption over the medium term.
ICRA expects penetration of e-2Ws to inch to 6-8% in the overall industry by FY2025 as compared to approximately 5% at present.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/15/thyssenkrupp-fraunhofer-ikts-to-set-up-1-gw-of-electrolyzer-production-by-2030/,"ELECTROLYZER,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",UMA GUPTA,2024-03-15,"Thyssenkrupp, Fraunhofer IKTS to set up 1 GW of electrolyzer production by 2030","From pv magazine Global
Thyssenkrupp nucera and Fraunhofer IKTS have launched a strategic partnership to develop and scale up the production of SOEC technology.
Thyssenkrupp nucera expects to reach 1 GW of manufacturing capacity by 2030. The German company and Fraunhofer IKTS are now setting up a pilot plant in Germany that is scheduled to start operations in around one year.
They will produce high-temperature electrolysis stacks with solid oxide electrolyzer cells, which are the core elements of the SOEC stacks. They will initially do it in small quantities to gain a better understanding of the production process and optimize it for large-scale production.
“The project timeline depends on the outcome and the learning during the pilot phase. We are jointly building it, and it should be ready for operation by mid-next year,” thyssenkrupp nucera CEO Werner Ponikwar told pv magazine. “We need to learn how that can be scaled up. We believe that towards the end of the decade, we should be in the position to have a 1 GW manufacturing facility up and running.”
The pilot plant will help the company and the research institute to adjust the manufacturing process to the requirements of large-scale production while developing SOEC stack technology. Fraunhofer IKTS bases the tech on a gas-tight oxygen-ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte with screen-printed electrodes and pressed interconnectors made of a chromium-based alloy (CFY).
“We are using different materials with respect to other companies working on SOEC,” said Alexander Michaelis, director of Fraunhofer IKTS. “But we have less components, the automatization of this process is very promising, so we will have advantages when it comes down to mass producibility.”
Michaelis said that in their initial pilot line, they aim to produce several thousand stacks per year. He noted that SOEC electrolyzers use commonly available materials, mitigating risks of price fluctuations.
“In the first pilot line we are setting up together, we will be able to manufacture several thousands of stacks a year,” said Michaelis. “The challenge is to optimize the stack and reduce the costs. We will be then ready for gigawatt-scale production.”
He said that high-temperature electrolysis offers the advantage of co-electrolysis, allowing simultaneous operation of carbon dioxide/monoxide (CO2/CO) electrolysis.
“The two processes, together, are a way to convert water and emissions into multicarbon products. So from water, you can produce hydrogen, and then green syngas,” Michaelis added. “This is particularly very important for petrochemical applications.”
He said that Germany has the longest tradition in SOEC technology. The joint project will solidify local expertise to meet European demand for green chemical components, including aviation fuels, as they will be crucial for achieving a net-zero environment.
Ponikwar said SOEC technology is very cost-competitive, similar to alkaline electrolysis, and more efficient than polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis.
“We see a strong potential for reducing costs for the stack technology, which is a major cost component,” he added.
The German company, which already produces alkaline water electrolyzers, says there is an “obvious logic” to offering both technologies, as they have specific applications. SOEC technology, for instance, is the most likely choice in proximity to industrial facilities, whose byproducts are heat and water.
Michaelis said that using water steam rather than water is also an advantage.
“There is some latent energy in the water steam, which goes into the energy balance,” he said. “This translates into 30% less power to make the same amount of hydrogen.”
Despite the potential cost advantage, mass production requires significant upfront investment. The two parties have emphasized the importance of political collaboration and financial support. 
“To implement new technologies, there are huge investment costs and steep learning curve; funding is typically required,” said Ponikwar, adding that the novelty itself and the current geopolitical and economic environment incentivize different institutions to collaborate.
The German company opened an office in Mumbai in 2023 with more than 30 engineers.
“Our interest in Germany does not mean we are not considering other regions. We need to be cost-effective,” said Ponikwar. “That would also mean that we could need to build manufacturing hubs outside of Europe, in the United States or elsewhere. India will be a quite interesting market.”
The company’s aim is to operate in different markets so it is ready to take opportunities arising from local market conditions and policies.
“In the future, when we will upscale production, we must make huge investments. There is no doubt that subsidies will be needed. We see a lot of political willingness at the state and federal levels,” said Michaelis. “We live in a global world. We are fighting for a strong foothold in Europe.”
SOEC technology can also serve the sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) market in Europe, and possibly in Asia and North America as well.
