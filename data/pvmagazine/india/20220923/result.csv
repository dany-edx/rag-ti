Under the agreement, Sterling and Wilson Solar Solutions will develop solar projects aggregating to 961 MWp along with a total battery storage capacity of 455 MWh. These projects will come up at five different locations in Nigeria.
Sterling and Wilson Solar Solutions’ work scope includes development, design, construction, and commissioning of solar PV power plants and battery energy storage systems. 
These projects will ultimately be owned and operated by Nigerian Government-owned Niger Delta Power Holding Co. Financing is under negotiations between US EXIM, ING, and the Government of Nigeria.
“Africa has shown great progress in developing its solar energy markets over the last few years. SWRE, having contributed the maximum solar capacity in Africa with a portfolio of over 1 GWp, stands tall as a renewable player in this region,” said Amit Jain, global CEO of Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy Group.
“Solar combined with energy storage is going to be the future of power generation in Africa, and we, along with our partner Sun Africa, are proud to be associated with this landmark project that will lay the foundation of Nigeria’s transition to clean energy”.
Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy, part of the Sterling and Wilson Group, entered the African market in 2015 with its first international project of 90 MWp in De Aar, South Africa. Today, the company is one of the largest solar EPC players in the region, with a portfolio of over 1 GWp spread across seven countries.

The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, modeled the transition of the Indian power sector across states on an hourly timescale up to 2050. 
According to the study, the levelized cost of electricity declines 46% from around 71 €/MWh in 2020 (including CO2 emissions costs) to about 38 €/MWh by 2050 as the power sector transitions from the current 70% coal-dominated system to 100% renewable energy-based electricity generation.
On a national level, in 2050, solar contributes 73% to total power production, wind 19%, with hydropower (3%) and nuclear power (0.4%) complementing variable renewable energy. The total installed capacity of solar PV reaches 3,000 GW by 2050.
During the transition, cost-optimal investments are made in batteries and gas storage on a large scale rather than pumped-hydro energy storage. Large-scale storage requirements start in 2030. In this research, storage capacities are initiated when the capacity share of renewables is more than 60%. The installed electricity storage capacity increases from about 22 TWh in 2030 to around 95 TWh by 2050.
The study estimates a deflationary cost for renewable energy. Solar and wind power costs decline significantly compared to coal and are expected to fall further by another 50-60% by 2050. Whereas, per-megawatt cost of electricity from coal is expected to increase 70%, and the cost for nuclear power is expected to increase by more than 13%. 
“Moving to solar is the obvious choice for India. Not just the cost of solar, the cost of battery storage is expected to drop further, making it even easier for grid balancing and managing peak demand. Our study shows that any new investments in fossil fuel-based thermal power capacity today is economically unviable and could be a burden for a future flexible power system”, said Manish Ram, one of the authors of the study.
According to the study, some key Indian states could have 100% sustainable energy by 2035. Coal-dependent states such as Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Jharkhand can phase out coal as early as 2040. 
The installed capacities of coal are at risk of becoming stranded assets. These plants have very low-capacity factors during the transition years as the share of renewables increases, leading to reduced revenues and profitability of operating these power plants. Storage technologies are crucial to provide vital stability to the power system and interstate

Caelux, founded in 2014, is engaged in the research and development of perovskite-on-glass technology that improves the relative performance of new crystalline silicon modules. The company claims its technology can enable high-efficiency solar modules that can produce 20% more energy over the 25-year lifetime of a solar project at significantly lower installed cost.
Reliance investment will accelerate Caelux product and technology development, construction of its pilot line in the United States, and expedite commercialization. 
RNEL and Caelux have also agreed to technical collaboration and commercialization of Caelux’ technology. Caelux’ commercialization roadmap consists of developing production sites across the US, Asia, and Latin America.
Reliance is setting up a global-scale integrated photovoltaic Giga factory at Jamnagar, Gujarat. Through this investment and collaboration, Reliance will be able to produce more powerful and lower-cost solar modules leveraging Caelux’ products.
“The investment in Caelux aligns with our strategy to create the most advanced green energy manufacturing ecosystem, backed by world-class talent, and built on the pillars of technological innovation achieved through strategic partnerships,” said Mukesh D. Ambani, chairman and managing director, Reliance Industries Ltd. 
“We believe Caelux’ proprietary perovskite-based solar technology provides us with access to the next leg of innovation in crystalline solar modules. We will work with the team at Caelux to accelerate its product development and commercialization of its technology.”
The transaction will not require any regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by the end of September 2022.
