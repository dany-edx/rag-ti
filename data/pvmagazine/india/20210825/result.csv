Tariffs in utility-scale solar and wind project auctions remained below INR 3.0/kWh (US$ 0.040/kWh) despite the upcoming customs duty on imported cells and modules from April 2022. 
Commenting further, Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president & co-group head, ICRA Ratings, said, “The investment prospects in the RE sector thus are expected to remain strong, given the policy impetus with a target to reach 450 GW by FY2030 and competitive tariffs. The capacity addition in the power sector over the medium term will be driven by the RE segment, led by a strong project pipeline of close to 40 GW as on date.”
“The key challenges constraining the growth remain on execution front, mainly associated with land and transmission infrastructure as well as the slow but improving progress in signing of power purchase agreements and power sale agreements by intermediate procurers with state distribution utilities (discoms). An improving financing environment along with the softening in the interest rate for the RE projects over the last 12-18 months period has been a positive for the sector.”
Apart from execution-related challenges, RE developers face delays in payments from the state distribution utilities and grid curtailments in some states, especially for the relatively higher tariff projects. 
Vikram V, vice president and sector head-corporate ratings, ICRA, feels a recent order by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) favoring developers in Tamil Nadu will act as a deterrent against grid curtailment by discoms and grid operators.
In its order, APTEL stated that the actions of the state utility of Tamil Nadu were ‘mala fide’ in issuing backdown instructions for commercial reasons and ordered compensation to the solar power producers at 75% of the PPA tariff. Further, the APTEL directed all state discoms, state electricity regulators, and grid operators that any curtailment of RE plants (for reasons other than grid security) be compensated at PPA tariff.
Further, “while the operating projects continue to face delays in payments from the state discoms in some of the key states, the presence of strong intermediate procurers like SECI and NTPC is supporting the addition of new capacities led by the presence of strong payment security mechanism in the form of a letter of credit, payment security fund and tri-partite agreement with Central government, state government and RBI.”
The demand outlook for the domestic solar manufacturers remains favorable, with the strong policy support through BCD imposition on imported cells and modules, the notification of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, and a strong project pipeline from various schemes requiring the use of domestic modules. Also, the non-inclusion of the overseas suppliers in the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) so far is likely to support the demand for domestic module manufacturers in the near term. 
The policy push is expected to improve the cost competitiveness of domestic manufacturers. It has led to new capacity announcements of more than 15 GW by various OEMs and the entry of new players. The timely commissioning of these new capacities remains important to meet the growing demand from the developers, given the current capacity constraints. Moreover, the ability of the OEMs to achieve backward integration and build economies of scale would be important to remain competitive against the overseas suppliers on a sustained basis, according to ICRA.

The $3.5 billion raised by state-owned energy company China Three Gorges Renewables and the $2.4 billion generated by Chinese solar manufacturer Longi helped the global clean energy sector raise a half-year record of $28.2 billion during the first six months of the year.
The Renewable Energy Investment Tracker report produced by U.S.-based analyst BloombergNEF this month has tracked a first-half record of $174 billion of investment in clean power, with bumper equity investments more than compensating for a reduction of finance for wind projects, following a bumper period for that technology in 2020.
The $28 billion raised by renewables companies cashing in on the share price peaks reached at the start of the year, by issuing new stock, marked a 509% rise on the equity investment drummed up in January-to-June last year, according to BloombergNEF. The analyst noted this year has also posted a six-month record of $5.7 billion worth of venture capital and private equity backing in the first half.
While the $85 billion invested in wind power projects during the first six months of last year fell back to $58 billion this time around, the BloombergNEF report stated solar parks banked a record $78.9 billion in the first half.
That finance included $4.9 billion in the second quarter alone in China, following a $2.8 billion investment in January to March. In the U.S., the report stated, investment of $5.3 billion into solar projects in the first quarter rose to $6.4 billion in April to June.
BloombergNEF head of analysis Albert Cheung sounded a cautionary note in a statement issued by the company to publicize the report, however, writing: “A 1.8% year-on-year increase is nothing to write home about. An immediate acceleration in funding is needed if we are to get on track for global net zero.”

This is one of the lowest increases in developing Asia as pandemic restrictions continued, according to a half-yearly report by London-based research organization Ember.
The nation met almost three-quarters (72%) of the increase in electricity demand with growth in solar (+47%) and wind (+9%). However, coal generation also increased by 4% to fill the remaining gap in demand and to fill reduced hydroelectricity generation, almost returning to its 2018 peak.
The figures paint a better picture for India than other Asian nations where coal/fossil fuel growth accounted for a much bigger share in meeting the rise in electricity demand.
For instance, China’s electricity demand rose by 14% from H1-2019 to H1-2021. And it met only 29% of that rise in demand by wind and solar; over two-thirds (68%) was met by coal power. That pushed up China’s power sector CO2 emissions by 14% from H1-2019 to H1-2021.
Bangladesh met electricity demand growth almost entirely from fossil fuels. Pakistan was the only country besides Bangladesh that saw no increase in wind and solar generation, simultaneous to a rise in electricity demand.
The 4% rise in coal generation, and thus increase in CO2 emissions, puts India among grey recovery countries, i.e., countries where high electricity demand growth was met in part with wind and solar and in part with extra coal generation, leading to higher power sector CO2 emissions. 
The Ember report finds mostly Asian countries (Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and India) saw a ‘grey recovery.’

Researchers at the University of Akron in the United States have developed a water-soluble positive electrolyte – a, so-called catholyte – that is claimed to increase the energy density of aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs).
The scientists shaped the catholyte by using two ligands: 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic (Dcbpy) acid, and cyanide. Cyanide was previously used in other research and was found to be able to improve the voltage and solubility of redox batteries compared to the commonly used ferrocyanide ligands.
The academics built the battery through what they called a symmetry-breaking strategy, which consists of changing the symmetry of the redox-active organic molecules, instead of using the common approach of attaching a hydrophilic functional group. Hydrophilic functional groups are membranes used to achieve fast ion transport combined with high molecular selectivity, and to provide aqueous organic flow batteries with energy efficiency and capacity retention.
The research group said its approach results in a considerable improvement of the molecules’ solubility. The battery is claimed to have retained more than 90% of capacity over 6,000 cycles, which the scientists said projects “more than 16 years of uninterrupted service [at] a pace of one cycle per day.” The capacity fading rate was 0.00158% per cycle, or 0.217% per day.
The scientists are currently planning to design new materials for this battery technology and have already submitted a patent application to the relevant U.S. authorities. “To significantly improve the performance of aqueous organic RFBs, the urgency of developing new catholyte[s] is crucial,” said researcher Yu Zhu.
The device was described in the paper Symmetry-breaking design of an organic iron complex catholyte for a long cyclability aqueous organic redox flow battery, published in nature energy.
