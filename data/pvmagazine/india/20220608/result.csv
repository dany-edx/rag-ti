The project is located in Rajasthan. The installation using over 800,000 PV modules was completed within a record time of seven months. 
The project will produce over 800 GWh of clean energy annually and help avoid up to 600,000 tons of annual CO2 emissions.
“With the usage of 535 Wp and 540 Wp bifacial modules on a large scale, for smooth execution of the project, tractors and back loaders were used to support the frames, handle modules, and higher capacity equipment,” stated Tata Power. 
With the commissioning of this project, Tata Power Solar’s total utility-scale PV project portfolio has swelled to 9.7 GWp.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/08/telecom-industry-body-hails-green-energy-open-access-reforms/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 8, 2022",Telecom industry body hails green energy open-access reforms,"The Electricity (Promoting Renewable Energy through Green Open Access) Rules 2022 issued by the power ministry enable small consumers also to purchase renewable power through open access. 
The regulations have lowered the limit of the open-access transaction from 1 MW to 100 kW for green energy. So, any consumer who has contracted demand or sanctioned load of 100 kW or more will be eligible for open access to green energy. Captive consumers will not be subject to any load limitations.
The reforms will boost renewable energy open-access among telecom service providers (TSPs) who have been unable to make effective use of renewable sources for mobile towers due to the 1 MW connected load threshold. The Cellular Operators Association of India, which has been quite vocal about this regulatory bottleneck, has welcomed the reforms.
“Each telecom tower has an independent electricity connection and consumes about 3 to 5 kW, much less than 1 MW. As a result, COAI member TSPs are unable to make use of renewable sources effectively. Although tower sites put together consume much higher on an aggregate level,” said COAI Director General SP Kochhar. “From a practical standpoint, considering the distribution and spread of mobile towers and limited open area available at the tower site, an on-site solar net metering solution has practical limitations in deployment. Hence to deploy renewables at a bigger scale, our member TSPs need renewable energy solutions that can only be provided through open access.”
Kochhar said the telecom industry has, however, been requesting to the Ministry of Power and various State Electricity Regulatory Commissions and Central Electricity Regulatory Commission to allow telecom infrastructure open access for solar/renewable energy without any policy restrictions on minimum usage or allow telecom operators to aggregate their electricity demands across several towers. 
The rules provide certainty on green energy open-access charges for consumers. These charges include transmission charges, wheeling charges, cross-subsidy surcharge, and standby charges. “Cap on increasing of cross-subsidy surcharge as well as the removal of additional surcharge will not only incentivize the consumers to go green but also address the issues that have hindered the growth of open access in India,” stated power ministry.
Open access approval will be granted within 15 days of applying.
The tariff for green energy shall be determined separately by an appropriate Commission. It shall comprise the average pooled power purchase cost of the renewable energy, cross-subsidy charges if any, and service charges covering the prudent cost of the distribution licensee for providing the green energy to the consumers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/08/arctech-3-gw-solar-tracker-factory-in-india-enters-trial-operation/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,RACKING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 8, 2022",Arctech 3 GW solar tracker factory in India enters trial operation,"China-based solar tracking and mounting solutions provider Arctech has announced its first joint venture manufacturing base in India, Jash Energy, has entered into trial operation. The 3 GW solar tracker factory is located over 16 acres in Mundra, Gujarat.
The factory is equipped with fully automatic production lines to produce all major components of the company’s solar tracker products, including posts, torque tubes, purlins, and fasteners. 
“By applying the fully automatic production lines, we can stay agile and make fast adjustments to the current supply strategy, increase productivity, stay competitive, and prepare for the future—including for unprecedented events, such as a pandemic. It also helps accelerate the adoption of India’s Industry 4.0 solutions,” said Gail Chen, general manager, East Asia, and India at Arctech, and board director and CEO of Jash Energy. 

Arctech said its India factory would serve as part of the company’s effort to ease the pressure of the global supply chain disruption intensified in the first half of 2022 with Covid-19 in mainland China, logistics, and raw material challenges, among others. 
Strategically located in Mundra, the largest private port in India, Jash Energy will have easy access to the Western, Middle East, and African markets. Mundra also provides an ideal base for traders due to its relatively short logistics connectivity to the north-western hinterland. It is easily accessible from all major industrial destinations in Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh for the export of cargo, stated the company.
Arctech has added more than 200 jobs to the local community by setting up this factory. It also plans technical training for local employees. 
As for raw materials availability, the company is planning to go deeper in vertically integrated production, including using steel for trackers that were made in India. It plans to work with local steel manufacturing partners to develop solar trackers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/08/kredence-partners-germanys-rena-for-additive-supply-to-indian-solar-manufacturing-sector/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 8, 2022",Kredence partners Germany’s RENA for additive supply to Indian solar manufacturing sector,"Gujarat-based PV chemical solutions provider Kredence Performance Materials has partnered with Germany’s RENA Technologies GmbH to supply additives for alkaline solar cell texturing in India. The duo will work together to offer the latest version of RENA monoTEX moderating and wetting agent for alkaline texturing of mono Si-wafers to the fast-growing photovoltaics market in India.
Under the cooperation, Kredence will provide its production facilities in India for RENA’s monoTEX products. This, in turn, will allow a fast and stable supply chain for PV customers.
“Delivery from Kredence India production site to Indian customers ensures a swift transport to customers. It is avoiding hold-ups presently occurring in supply chain and transportation of all sorts of materials worldwide,” said Bharat Bhatnagar, managing director of Kredence Performance Materials (India). “We are also preparing for the expected fast growth of the PV industry in India with its focus on monocrystalline silicon.”
Kredence performs routine sample analysis to meet the grade specification requirements, which ensures the performance of PV chemicals during the cell manufacturing process. To keep up with the pace of the expanding photovoltaic Industry, it provides “just in time“ inventory that brings a paradigm shift in supply chain management. This enhances the confidence at each level of the value chain, and with this capability, Kredence is looking to serve 15 to 17 GW requirements of wet chemistry in the next three-four years.
“The experienced team at Kredence and its large network in India enable us to help the Indian PV manufacturing base grow in the upcoming months and years,” said Ulrich Jaeger, vice president-Sales of RENA Technologies.
With a non-fossil fuel energy target of ‘500 GW by 2030,’ India is currently one of the largest growing markets for PV technology, including manufacturing equipment and materials for solar cells and modules.
