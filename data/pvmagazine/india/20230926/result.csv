“The Fraunhofer team is world-renowned for the fabrication of ultra-high efficiency solar cells based on silicon and III-V semiconductors such as GaInP or GaAs,” the Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “The AMOLF team has built up many years of experience in optimizing the management of light in solar cells. In this project, we brought this knowledge together, with this unique result. The solar cells have traveled between Freiburg and Amsterdam for the different processing steps, in this way building up the full solar cell.”
The cell is based on a TOPCon technology developed by the Fraunhofer ISE and a specially designed metal/polymer nanocoating provided by AMOLF. The latter is placed at the silicon sub-cell bottom and is reportedly responsible for optimizing the distribution of light scattering beyond the total internal reflection critical angle in the cell.
“Specifically, we optimize the geometry of a hexagonal array of silver (Ag) nano-disks that are integrated with the Ag back contact, and show how pitch, radius, and height of the individual scatterers control the distribution of power over different diffraction orders, while at the same time minimizing plasmonic dissipation losses in the wavelength range of interest,” the scientists explained.
They also used substrate conformal imprint lithography (SCIL), an innovative full-wafer scale nanoimprint technology, to fabricate the nanopatterned metagrating back-reflectors.
They then connected the top and bottom cells by direct wafer bonding at room temperature. The resulting solar cell has a size of 2 cm x 2 cm and includes front contacts, an anti-reflection coating (ARC), and a 1 μm thick Ag layer on the back side acting as an electrical contact and planar mirror. “After nanoimprint and etching the cells were shipped again to Fraunhofer ISE for a final HF dip followed by metallization,” they explained.
Through several numerical and experimental assessments, the Dutch-German group found that the multijunction device’s external quantum efficiency (EQE) over a planar back-reflector improved by over 1.52 mA/cm 2.
“Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of nanophotonic light trapping for enhancing the efficiency of silicon-based multi-junction solar cells, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable solar energy technologies,” it stated.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/26/honeywell-invests-in-us-iron-flow-battery-specialist-ess/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2023",Honeywell invests in US iron flow battery specialist ESS,"From pv magazine USA
Honeywell and ESS are collaborating on advancing development of iron flow battery (IFB) energy storage systems based on ESS’ patented IFB design with Honeywell’s advanced materials and energy systems expertise.
The Honeywell Company dates back to 1885 with an invention that was a precursor to today’s thermostat. Fast forward many decades, acquisitions and spinoffs later, and one of the company’s many areas of expertise is in utility-scale battery energy storage systems. In 2021 the company developed flow battery technology intended for pairing with wind and solar resources and partnered with Duke Energy to field test the long-duration energy storage (LDES) product.
ESS, founded in 2011, manufactures iron flow batteries using widely available, Earth-abundant materials. Designed for applications that require up to twelve hours of flexible energy capacity, the batteries are used in utility-scale renewable energy installations, remote solar-plus-storage microgrids, solar load-shifting and peak shaving, as well as other ancillary grid services.
At a recent ceremony at RE+ 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce awarded ESS an Export Achievement Certificate for expanding global deployment of its American-made, innovative long-duration energy storage technology. In response to domestic and global demand, the company announced that it will boost its manufacturing capacity at its Wilsonville, Oregon facility up to 2 GWh annually. 
“The demand for long-duration energy storage represents a compelling market opportunity within the energy transition and the combination of Honeywell and ESS technology can accelerate decarbonization for the commercial, industrial and utility sectors,” said Bryan Glover, chief growth officer, Honeywell Performance Materials and Technology (PMT) group. “Our strategic collaboration with ESS will accelerate Honeywell’s ability to bring comprehensive solutions to our customers while working to  advance long-duration energy storage across all industries requiring expansive energy storage.”
The collaboration between Honeywell and ESS enables Honeywell to integrate ESS technology into its global offering, and ESS gains license to Honeywell’s flow battery intellectual property. Additionally, the two plan to work together on continual technology advancement, cost reduction and packaging of IFB systems.
ESS battery systems have a prescribed design life of 25 years, the battery modules, electrolyte, plumbing, and other components may well last for decades longer with proper maintenance. The battery, for example, is expected to experience zero degradation over 20,000 cycles.
Honeywell has invested $27.5 million into ESS common stock; purchasing 16.5 million shares at $1.67 per share. Honeywell also received a warrant to purchase an additional 10.6 million shares for $20 million at $1.89 per share. Honeywell also announced its intention to purchase up to $300 million of ESS products, with $15 million prepaid.
In addition to the investment, ESS receives exclusive license of Honeywell IP related to flow batteries
“Today, we are creating superior technology in the critical long-duration energy storage industry,” said  Eric Dresselhuys, CEO of ESS. “Combining ESS’ innovative technology and deployment experience with  Honeywell’s storage and control system expertise will enable us to drive the clean energy transition and  deliver value to our customers, shareholders and communities.”
Honeywell and ESS are teaming up at a time of huge growth in long-duration energy storage. According to the Department of Energy’s ‘Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Long Duration Energy Storage’ report, the U.S. grid needs 225 to 460 GW of LDES capacity for power market application for a net zero economy by 2060.  The global LDES market is estimated to be $50 billion per year and forecast to grow significantly with a cumulative investment of up to $3 trillion by 2040, according to the LDES Council and McKinsey & Co.

As the shift to renewable energy accelerates, challenges associated with the intermittency of renewables are becoming more apparent. The solution is to embrace safe and sustainable long-duration energy storage technologies, which can address the intermittency of renewables by ensuring stored energy is available to balance fluctuations in electricity demand and supply.
“Long-duration energy storage is critical to meet local, regional and global net-zero decarbonization goals,” Julia Souder, chief executive officer of the Long Duration Energy Storage Council, told pv magazine USA. “LDES complements rapid renewable growth by offering flexibility, reliability, affordability and security. This partnership allows us to work together to accelerate the various markets and contracts even faster to deploy diverse LDES technologies.”
ESS held a webcast conference call on Monday, September 25, 2023 to discuss the partnership with Honeywell and it will be available on ESS’ Investor  Relations website.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/26/india-needs-15-trillion-to-achieve-net-zero-by-2070-says-ficci-deloitte-report/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EVS,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,RESIDENTIAL PV,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2023","India needs $15 trillion to achieve net zero by 2070, says FICCI-Deloitte report","India needs an investment of $15 trillion between 2022 and 2070 to achieve net zero by 2070. This translates into an annual spend of $300 billion with significantly higher outlay in the initial years, according to a report released by FICCI and Deloitte.
The report estimates India’s total energy demand will double to 1,200 Mtoe [million tonnes of oil equivalent] by 2070 from the 2020 level, considering aggressive energy efficiency and adoption of new technologies. 
It adds the nation’s energy transition will hinge on grid decarbonization, industrial decarbonization, and transport transition. The power sector (with a 46% share) is the largest carbon emitter in India, followed by industries (30%) and transport sector (12–13%). 
The report states grid decarbonization will require a significant increase in grid-scale RE (solar and wind) penetration in the current mix. To achieve net-zero and decarbonize grid operations, India would need 2,000 GW of grid-scale RE (wind + solar) and another 1,000 GW of RE for green hydrogen production.
That means India would need to add an average of 40-50 GW of [grid-scale] RE capacity every year for the next few decades, compared to a historical average of 15–20 GW annually. It is assumed that coal-based power will be phased out by 2060.
The report adds India may need to exploit the full technically feasible hydro potential (140 GW) and increase nuclear capacity, given the huge power demand. It may also need to import hydropower from Nepal and Bhutan to achieve net zero.
While short-duration energy storage (two- and four-hour battery storage systems, and pump storage projects) would be predominant in the initial years to balance out intermittency and variability imposed by renewables, subsequent years would require a significant amount of long-duration energy storage systems such as six-to-eight hours of battery storage, pump storage projects, and H2 storage (to be fired in gas turbines and used for seasonal storage solutions). Existing gas stations may be retrofitted with a hydrogen turbine that will act as long-duration seasonal hydrogen storage.
Within the industrial sector, steel, cement, aluminum, and fertilizer contribute 70% to the total emissions. The report states companies should exercise a broad portfolio of options to reduce carbon footprint depending on technical feasibility, economics, and scalability. It expects green hydrogen (GH2) to find applications in fertilizer, refineries, steel production, and transport.
Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) will play a critical role in decarbonizing industrial sectors that are hard to electrify, due to their high energy and process-related emissions. In a net-zero scenario, India may require 400–500 million tons of annual CCUS capacity by 2070.
The transport sector will be required to transition completely to low-emission technology, such as battery electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, hydrogen combustion engines, and biofuels to achieve transport transition.
