The 1 MW grid-connected solar project has been implemented by NVVN under the RESCO model, with a power purchase agreement duration of 25 years. 
Under the RESCO model, a renewable energy service company (which provides energy to consumers from renewable energy sources) designs, builds, funds, and operates the entire solar power plant (roof or ground-mounted). The consumer pays the developer against assured monthly unit generation per kW and DISCOM adjusts generated units in the consumer’s electricity bill.
The project is set up on the roofs of 14 buildings inside the IIT campus. 
The rooftop project is expected to generate around 14.9 lakh units per annum and will meet 15% of the electricity requirement of IIT Jodhpur. The project will help offset carbon dioxide emissions of 1,060 tonnes per year.

China-based module manufacturer Canadian Solar is presenting its 700 W bifacial TOPCon solar modules this week at Intersolar Europe in Munich, Germany.
The TOPBiHiKu7 panels feature 210 mm cells and are available in six versions, with nominal power ranging from 675 W to 700 W, and a power conversion efficiency of 21.7% to 22.5%. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 46.9 V to 47.9 V and the short-circuit current is 18.24 A to 18.49 A. They have an efficiency range of 26.1% to 27.0%, with a bifacial gain of 20%.
“Canadian Solar’s TOPCon modules will increase the energy yield of PV systems and deliver one of the most competitive balance of system (BOS) cost savings and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar power plants, compared to PERC modules,” said the company.
The double-glass panels measure 2,384 x 1,303 x 33 mm and weigh 37.8 kg. They feature 2.0 mm heat-strengthened glass, with anti-reflective coating and another 2.0 mm glass layer at the back. The modules have IP68 junction boxes and anodized aluminum alloy frames. They can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and in temperatures ranging between -40 C and 85 C.
The temperature coefficient is -0.29% per degree Celsius. Canadian Solar claims that this ensures “better performance under hot environments compared to the mainstream products in the market.”
The PV panels come with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. Annual linear degradation over 30 years is 0.4%, while degradation over the first year is capped at 1.0%.
In December 2022, Canadian Solar said that it would begin mass production of TOPCon solar modules by the first quarter of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/16/germi-develops-biodegradable-paper-supercapacitor-from-seaweed/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV BATTERIES,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 16, 2023",GERMI develops biodegradable paper supercapacitor from seaweed  ,"Researchers at Gujarat Energy Research and Management Institute (GERMI) have developed a seaweed-based anode material to make a paper supercapacitor with excellent super capacitive behavior. This paper supercapacitor is fully biodegradable and is claimed to be the thinnest and fastest charging (can be fully charged within 10 seconds).  
The paper supercapacitor uses rGO‑ZnO nanowire-deposited seaweed cellulose as the anode material and has a greater energy density of 5.21 Wh/kg and a series resistance of 2.16 Ω. It finds application in various energy storage domains including electric vehicles. 
A supercapacitor is an electrochemical charge storage device with a fast charging/ discharging cycle, high power density, and a long lifecycle. It is an electrochemical double-layer capacitor that can fill up the gap between the capacitors and batteries for high energy density, though it has low energy density and appears difficult to replace the battery.  
Lead researchers Priyank Bhutiya and Syed Zaheer Hassan extracted cellulose nanofibers from seaweed and grew rGO-ZnO nanowires over seaweed cellulose nanofibers by using a single-step hydrothermal method. Green seaweed Cheatomorpha antennia was collected from the Porbandar area of Gujarat.

The developed electrode is used in an asymmetrical supercapacitor by sandwiching NaCl electrolyte-soaked paper separator between the rGO-ZnO seaweed cellulose nanocomposite and activated charcoal powder slurry coated nickel foil.  
“Dr. Brijesh Tripathi from Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) tested this device till 6,000 cycles for performance and observed the same performance in all cycles without any degradation. The device was tested using various analytical techniques,” said the researchers.  
The research team also included Abdul Rasheed, P.L.S. Rao, and Rahul Kapadiya from GERMI. 
The research work is published in BioNanoscience journal (a Springer publication) and patented.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/16/rapid-shift-to-solar-energy-is-key-to-enhancing-msme-productivity-and-exports/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",,"JUNE 16, 2023",Rapid shift to solar energy is key to enhancing MSME productivity and exports,"India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth numbers for Q4FY23 have brought much cheer and optimism in the economy and industry as it paints a rosy picture of the growth prospects in the current fiscal year (FY24) as well. The stellar show in Q4 has also lifted the overall growth in FY23 above 7%. 
In all likelihood, the current fiscal year’s growth numbers would also come close to 7%, which makes India again the fastest-growing economy in the world.
Amid all these positive vibes and exuberance, a matter of grave concern is the slow growth in the manufacturing sector. It is only 1.3% for the full year (FY23) and, notably, much lower than agriculture that has registered a 4% growth during the year. Despite the enormous thrust on domestic manufacturing through the ‘Make in India’ initiative and PLI schemes in the recent past, manufacturing remains the slowest growing sector in the economy.
The issues plaguing the manufacturing sector are complex and diverse. The slow pace of technology adoption in the MSME sector is one among them. 
A significant part of the country’s manufacturing output comes from the MSMEs, which contribute more than 30% to India’s GDP and around 48% to the country’s exports. The MSMEs consume about 25% of the total power utilized in the industrial sector. But the sector’s productivity enhancement is moving at a snail’s pace and it acts as a major drag on the overall manufacturing revival.
Surging energy cost is another component that bleeds the MSME sector. A majority of MSMEs are power-intensive and they shell out a substantial part of their income for energy expenses. 
A sustainable solution to this is to tap renewable energy sources like rooftop solar installations. Most MSMEs spend either between 5% and 10% or between 10% and 20% of their operating income on electricity, says a Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India- CIF study in 2019.
Hence, the rejuvenation of the manufacturing sector can’t be achieved without re-energizing the MSMEs. Transitioning to clean energy practices is the best option at this juncture. According to the latest Mercom India Research’s Rooftop Solar Market Report Q1 2023, India has installed 485 MW of rooftop solar capacity in the first three months of this calendar year. In this, rooftop solar solutions comprise 26% of total solar installations, a 6.4% growth year-on-year. The industry anticipates an accelerated growth trajectory in the coming quarters on strong fundamentals.
According to the study, residential rooftop solar installations are on a stable growth track but industrial and commercial (I&C) installations are not showing a significant rise. In Q1, residential consumers contributed nearly 58% of the added capacity while industrial and commercial consumers accounted for 28% and 14%, respectively.
Though the rooftop solar projects are now commercially viable, they have not been adopted widely due to a host of issues, including a lack of dedicated financial instruments. 
Notably, India has missed its 2022 green energy target of achieving 175 GW. Only 121 GW of renewable energy capacity has been installed by the end of last year, which is about 69% of the target, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy said early this year. The committee noted that “against the overall target of 40 GW to be achieved by the end of this year (2022), 5.87 GW of rooftop solar projects have been installed, which is an achievement of less than 15% of the target.”
India is committed to increasing its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and achieving the Net Zero target by 2070. With this pace in the implementation, achieving the 2030 target appears as an arduous task as the sector is not out of the woods completely. 
The Parliamentary panel report adds: “It has been observed that the rooftop systems are not proving to be attractive for the consumers due to non-availability of information at the grassroots level, lack of awareness about the schemes among the masses, time-consuming and complicated procedures for setting it up, and delays in disbursement of subsidy.”
Further, lack of clarity on regulations, net metering issues, high import duties on solar cells and modules, lopsided power purchase pacts, open access charges, state-specific variations in transmission and distribution policies, and financing issues, to name a few, are still plaguing the sector.
The power demand is increasing, and it is becoming pricey, too. The magnificent growth in the electric vehicles (EV) segment is a major demand driver and it prompts individuals to look for less-costly energy sources like renewables. To facilitate a clean energy transition, the country needs stable and uniform power policies across the states. Pro-market and structural reforms in the field of power distribution and transmission are vital to achieving the green goals.
The biggest incentive in pushing the rooftop solar projects in the MSME clusters is that it will bring a sizable part of India’s manufacturing under the green protocols. Additionally, it offers the micro-enterprises, which are jointly situated in the industrial clusters, an opportunity to unlock value by making use of their rooftops and vacant spaces for harnessing clean energy.
Widening the area under the rooftop solar panels in the MSME clusters will fetch additional benefits for small entrepreneurs as the clean energy initiatives always create enormous goodwill for them in the export markets. The US and European markets are ready to pay a premium for sustainably manufactured products.
Until and unless the MSME sector accelerates its transition into a green energy ecosystem and reduces its carbon footprint substantially in a time-bound manner, the country’s manufacturing output will remain more or less stagnant or see only marginal growth. A sustainable solution is the rapid adoption of cleaner technologies in the areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste management, carbon emission, and clean transportation.

Singapore-based Maxeon Solar Technologies has revealed that it has filed a patent infringement case against China-based Tongwei Solar and its German subsidiary, Tongwei Solar GmbH.
Maxeon said it filed the lawsuit with the Dusseldorf district court in Germany. It claims that Tongwei infringed on its European Patent No. EP3522045 B1 for shingled solar cell panel technology. Maxeon uses the tec in its Performance Line solar modules.
“The intellectual property behind our shingled solar cell technology is the outcome of investments and technical advancements, the resultant Performance Line outperforms conventional panels in efficiency, power, and reliability,” said Maxeon CEO Bill Mulligan. “In September 2020, Maxeon filed a lawsuit against Canadian Solar in Japan, which was subsequently settled in April 2022. With this latest filing against Tongwei Solar, Maxeon is continuing to vigorously enforce its valuable intellectual property rights to prohibit unauthorized use.”
The Performance Line PV panel architecture and manufacturing processes were pioneered by Cogenra Solar, a Silicon Valley startup that SunPower acquired in 2015. In the subsequent 2020 spinoff from SunPower, Maxeon retained the intellectual property associated with the solar cell and module technologies, as well as the SunPower brand in the more than 100 markets it serves, according to a company statement.
“We have instructed our local German attorneys to handle the Maxeon matters,” a spokesperson from Tongwei told pv magazine. “As committed, Tongwei fully supports our customers and has an open mind to collaborate with industry partners in developing clean energy for the whole world.”
The Chinese module maker claimed it is currently spending a lot of resources to develop the shingled module technology and production capabilities. “Since Tongwei started R&D on the shingled module technology, we have paid close attention to related patents – making sure we do not infringe other’s patent rights, as well as developing our own IP portfolio,” it explained. “Before we launched new products, systematic FTOs have been repeatedly carried out internally and by external IP firms. We firmly believe that we have differentiated our technology and products from our competitors.”

Longi’s R&D team has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 33.5% for a perovskite-silicon solar cell. The China-based module manufacturer made the announcement during Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany.
“Improving cell conversion efficiency and reducing the cost of electricity remain the perpetual theme driving the development of the photovoltaic industry,” said Longi President Li Zhenguo during the announcement speech.
The European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) has certified the results, which represent a 1.7% increase on the previous 31.8% efficiency rating, which was announced during the SNEC conference in late May in Shanghai, China.
The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has ranked Longi’s latest efficiency results as the second-highest on record, following King Abdullah University of Science and Technology’s (KAUST) achievement of 33.7% efficiency in June. Earlier in April, KAUST reported an efficiency of 33.2% for a perovskite/silicon tandem PV cell.
Longi has broken the world record for solar cell efficiency 14 times since April 2021. It claimed the world’s highest efficiency for silicon cells in November 2022, with a 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified heterojunction solar cell.

US-based CubicPV has secured new firm equity commitments in excess of $100 million dollars to support its US factory plans and tandem solar product roadmap.
The first $33 million will be released immediately. The second tranche investment is tied to specific project milestones. The capital was committed by shareholders, led by SCG Cleanergy (a wholly owned subsidiary of SCG) with contributions from Hunt Energy Enterprises and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a set of investment funds founded by Bill Gates.
“With its deep experience in silicon wafer production and ownership of highly innovative proprietary technologies, Cubic is ideally positioned to play a key role in the world’s embrace of solar powered electricity generation,” said Tim McCaffery, global investment director of SCG. “We continued to be impressed with the strength of the team, their progress against plan and their commitment to manufacturing and innovation excellence.”
Late last year, CubicPV announced plans to establish 10 GW of conventional mono wafer capacity in the United States. Driven by incentives in the US Inflation Reduction Act, the wafers produced by the new facility could fill a void in the domestic supply chain as well as create 1,500 new direct jobs.
CubicPV said it continues to make progress in its plan to build U.S. wafer manufacturing capacity, having completed its conceptual design and scoping for the project. The company narrowed its site selection decision to two final possible locations, and engaged with an industry-leading project management company. It also indicated that financing is on track, having received term sheets that indicate that it will exceed the required total equity for the new factory.
“Today’s announcement underscores the considerable progress we’ve made, the depth of our engineering competence and the strength of our technologies to deliver a more powerful solar future,” said Frank van Mierlo, chief executive officer of CubicPV. “We thank SCG Cleanergy for their confidence in our manufacturing goals and product roadmap.
