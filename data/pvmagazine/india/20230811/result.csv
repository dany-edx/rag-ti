https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/11/batteries-overtake-pumped-hydro-in-australias-national-electricity-market/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 11, 2023",Batteries overtake pumped hydro in Australia’s National Electricity Market,"From pv magazine Australia
Data from Rystad Energy Senior Analyst David Dixon shows the operational charging capacity from utility batteries in the National Electricity Market (NEM) now stands at 1,451 MW, outstripping the 1,340 MW attributed to pumped hydro.
The ascension of grid-scale batteries comes after the energisation of Genex Power’s 50 MW/100 MWh Bouldercombe Big Battery project near Rockhampton in Queensland and French developer Neoen’s 100 MW/200 MWh Capital Battery in the Australian Capital Territory. Both projects are now working through the commissioning stages.
The batteries are the latest in a slew of big battery projects to connect to the NEM in recent months. These include French renewables giant Engie’s 150 MW/150 MWh Hazelwood battery in Victoria, and the 250 MW/250 MWh Torrens Island and 41 MW/412 MWh Tailem Bend batteries in South Australia. Edify Energy’s Riverina Energy Storage System, a project combining three separate battery facilities totalling 150 MW/300 MWh in New South Wales, has also been energized.
Dixon said he expects the gap between battery storage capacity and pumped hydro to increase further over the next few years with “several more utility battery projects expected to enter the market.”
“By 2026 the operational capacity of utility batteries in the NEM will be greater than 6 GW,” he said.
Among those projects set to enter the market are Akaysha Energy’s 850 MW/1,680 MWh Waratah Super Battery project, and the 460 MW/920 WMh first stage of Origin Energy’s planned 700 MW/2,800 MWh Eraring Battery, both in New South Wales.
Neoen is also continuing to grow its energy storage portfolio, having commenced construction of the 200 MW/400 MWh Blyth Battery storage system in South Australia and the 200 MW/400 MWh Western Downs Battery in Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/11/brazil-imported-7-8-gw-of-solar-modules-in-h1/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",LÍVIA NEVES,"AUGUST 11, 2023",Brazil imported 7.8 GW of solar modules in H1,"From pv magazine Brazil
During the first half of this year, a survey conducted by consultancy Greener shows that Brazil imported 7.8 GW of PV modules, marking a 21% decline from the corresponding period in 2022, when the import volume was 9.9 GW.
Greener said that the demand for large-scale utility PV projects counterbalanced the sluggishness in the distributed generation market from January to June, offsetting the reduction in imports. In the distributed generation sector, constituting two-thirds of the Brazilian PV market, system sales volume experienced a notable drop of 60% to 70% in the first quarter, according to Greener.
Lower sales have prompted equipment distributors to accumulate larger inventories, which, coupled with the decrease in polysilicon and module prices, could trigger cost reductions and potentially revive demand in the rooftop segment.
In July 2023, the price of polysilicon plummeted to levels below $9.00/kg, representing a staggering decline of over 70% from the peak of $30.80/kg in February, as indicated in the report. This significant price shift could have a substantial impact on lowering the costs of photovoltaic systems in the medium term, considering that silicon constitutes roughly 60% of photovoltaic module expenses, which in turn account for 38% to 50% of the final system price.

The PV plant is part of the $8.7 billion green hydrogen project being developed by NEOM Green Hydrogen Co. (NGHC)—a joint venture between ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM. Larsen & Toubro is executing the project’s power and transmission elements on an EPC basis.
“NGHC [green hydrogen project] will use renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power to produce up to 600 tonnes per day of carbon-free hydrogen by the end of 2026,” stated Sungrow.
The inverter order follows Sungrow’s contract with L&T to supply 400 MWh energy storage systems comprising a DC capacity of 536 MW/600 MWh to the NEOM green hydrogen project. 
In the latest deal, Sungrow will provide its 1+X modular inverter solution for the project. 
“The solution combines the advantages of both central and string inverters, featuring a 1.1 MW single unit as the minimum, and the maximum capacity can be expanded to 8.8 MW by combing eight units together, bringing a more flexible design for different blocks sizes and making the on-site operation and maintenance easier. Each module is designed with an independent MPPT, further improving the power generation capacity of the power plant,” Sungrow stated. “As a result of the optimal IP65 high protection capability, the solution is resilient to sandy, dry, and windy conditions. Due to the smart forced air-cooling technology, the inverter solution can work stably in extremely high temperatures.”
