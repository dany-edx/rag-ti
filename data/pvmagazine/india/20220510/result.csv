https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/10/borosil-renewables-posts-28-net-sales-increase-for-fy-2021-22/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOLAR GLASS,EUROPE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 10, 2022",Borosil Renewables posts 28% net sales increase for FY 2021-22,"Indian solar glass maker Borosil Renewables has reported net sales of around INR 644 crore ($83 million) in fiscal 2021-22, a 28% increase year on year. Profit after tax stood at around INR 166 crore, 85% up from fiscal 2020-21.
The company’s sales surged due to growing demand for solar glass in domestic and global markets. Export sales accounted for 27% of its total turnover. Direct exports constituted 20% of overall turnover.
The company, which currently has a solar glass production capacity of 450 tons per day (TPD), produced almost at full capacity during fiscal 2022 and sold out of everything it produced.
“The average gross pull of glass from our furnaces was 443 TPD on a capacity of 450 TPD,” said the company.
Net sales were also boosted by higher average ex-factory prices of tempered solar glass during the year. Average prices during the year were about INR 133 per millimeter per square meter, from INR 119 per millimeter per square meter in fiscal 2021, up 12%, said the company.
Borosil Renewables expects demand for solar glass to remain high in the domestic market, but also in export markets like Europe. It is enhancing its solar glass capacity to meet growing demand for current products and larger glass sizes. It expects to add another 550 TPD to its India factory by September, bringing its total solar glass production to 1,000 TPD. It is also focusing on additional capacity expansion in India. 
In addition, Borosil Renewables has signed a deal to acquire Interfloat Group, Europe’s largest solar glass manufacturer, to capture rising demand in the European market.
“We expect a significant jump in demand for solar glass in Europe in view of the enhanced focus by the governments to reduce dependence on Russian gas and Chinese solar components. Many new module manufacturing plants are expected to be commissioned besides capacity expansions by the existing manufacturers,” said Borosil Renewables. 
With the acquisition of Interfloat, Borosil Renewables aims to target solar glass customers in Europe. It plans to increase the capacity at the Interfloat plant in Europe from 300 TPD to 500 TPD within the next 18 months. 
With the 500 TPD of enhanced capacity from its European operations and proposed expansion in India, the company expects to have a total capacity of 2,050 tons by the end of 2022-23. It also plans to increase its capacity to 2,600 TPD in calendar year 2025 by expanding its domestic capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/10/handheld-tool-to-clean-rooftop-solar-panels/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,ROBOTIC CLEANERS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,SOLAR PANEL CLEANING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 10, 2022",Handheld tool to clean rooftop solar panels,"Mumbai-based Cleo Tech has developed a new handheld solution for scratch-free, dry cleaning of rooftop solar installations.
With conventional dry-cleaning tools, direct contact between the moving parts and the panel surface can cause microcracks in the cells. The Cleo-Tech solution addresses this problem by ensuring that only the soft nylon bristles of the brush come in contact with the cells during the cleaning process. Its cleaning brush measures 1 meter and clings end-to-end on the panel’s aluminium frame to do the cleaning, thus avoiding direct contact of the moving parts with the cells. 
“The cleaning tool weighs 5 kg. It uses a heavy-duty brushless DC motor that can last up to four years without maintenance. The roller brush is made of very thin and soft nylon bristles that perform dry cleaning without damaging the anti-reflective coating of the PV panel. The operator can easily replace the brush on-site,” Rohan Kaundal, founder and partner at Cleo Tech, told pv magazine. 
Kaundal said a single person can clean anywhere from 60 to 100 panels per hour, depending on their familiarity with the tool. It is powered by a 24V, 10,000 mAh lithium-ion battery. It weighs 2 kg and can easily be carried like a backpack by the operator.
Cleo Tech can customize the tool according to specific site installation and design parameters.

The repayment period of the loan is 18 years, including a five-year grace period. Bangladesh will have to pay a 0.25% fee and a 0.25% commitment fee per annum for the portion of the total that is not withdrawn. The interest rate is 0.60% plus the variable borrowing cost margin of the AIIB.
Infrastructure Development Co. Ltd. (IDCOL), a Bangladeshi state-owned investor, will lend the funds to support renewable energy, energy efficiency, and social infrastructure projects. By borrowing loans from the Bangladeshi government and international sources, the IDCOL provides low-cost loans to renewable energy sector.
In addition to larger plants, IDCOL is now promoting rooftop solar power installations, especially on top of apparel factories. Thus far, it has approved loans for 41 factories, with a total generation capacity of 50 MW. It has set a target to provide enough funds to support the deployment of 300 MWp of rooftop solar capacity by the end of this year.
About 19.5 MW of rooftop solar plants have already been installed and switched on. One of the biggest ones is a 3.1 MWp array, while the smallest one is of a 324 KWp installation.
IDCOL provides 80% of a project’s funds at low cost. The rest is being handled by the customers. About $700,000 is needed to set up a 1 MW rooftop solar power system. The cost of each unit of electricity generated from a rooftop solar power system is lower than the electricity the factory owners get from the power grid. IDCOL also provide funds to set up solar minigrids, solar home systems, solar-run irrigation pumps, and solar street lights.
Bangladesh currently has the capacity to generate 787 MW of renewable energy, of which 553 MW comes from solar. The country is aiming to generate 40% of its total electricity from renewable sources by 2041.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/10/stackable-home-battery-with-9-6-kwh-to-38-4-kwh-of-capacity/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 10, 2022",Stackable home battery with 9.6 kWh to 38.4 kWh of capacity,"From pv magazine Global
Lithion said this week that its lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) residential battery is now UL-certified when paired with Sol-Ark 12K hybrid inverters. The company achieved UL 9540 certification after going through rigorous testing for reliability and safety.
The Stack’d Series LFP batteries are a modular platform that can be scaled in 4.8 kWh increments, from 9.6 kWh to 38.4 kWh. The company is vertically integrated, using its own Tier 1 prismatic cells in the composition of the battery.
While many battery providers claim whole home backup capability, central A/C and other large appliances may not be able to start up after an outage, Lithion said. The company’s battery is capable of up to 16.8 kW surge and 14.4 kW continuous power, providing true whole-home backup.
LFP batteries are known for their reduced fire risk due to the elimination of cobalt, which is known to be connected to mining practices that have human rights and environmental concerns. The company said its batteries are designed to be readily recyclable at the end of their lifecycle.
The battery is paired with a low-voltage 48 V system, IP55 water and dust resistance, and a proprietary battery management system, all elements of the safety and stability of the battery. A 10-year, 4,000-cycle full-refund warranty is included.
Sol-Ark said the battery makes a good match for its inverters, boosting ease of install. “With our upcoming Sol-Ark 15K, the Stack’d Series battery will be the only battery on the market to maximize its capability,” said Bhawna Oberoi, COO of Sol-Ark.
Lithion’s modular designs make a “drop-in” solution for replacing lead acid batteries, designing them to be easy to implement without retooling efforts. This leads to cuts in purchasing, inventory, and servicing costs, said Lithion. The company is headquartered in Henderson, Nevada.
Sol-Ark is a Texas-based company started in 2013 by local US veterans with experience in semiconductors and power electronics. It has multiple production lines for its inverter lines, including the Sol-Ark 12K hybrid, which makes for a full home backup and off-grid solution when paired with the Stack’d Series batteries.
