The report added another 83 GW of RE was under implementation as of February 2023. 
India has committed to 50% of cumulative installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel-based sources by 2030 under its Nationally Determined Contributions. 
The CEEW-CEF’s Market Handbook for 2022-23 identifies and analyses trends critical to India’s energy transition.
The report stated India added a net power generation capacity of 16.6 GW in FY 2022-23. This included 15.3 GW (92.2%) renewable energy, 1.2 GW (7%) coal/lignite, and 0.1 GW (0.8%) hydro.
The report highlighted that solar (grid-scale and rooftop) continued to take the lead, accounting for 84% (12.8 GW) of the RE capacity addition. Wind capacity addition doubled year-on-year to 2.3 GW. 
The share of small hydro and bio-power stood at 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively
Gagan Sidhu, director at CEEW-CEF, said, “There are several positive indicators of India’s renewable energy capacity maturing and evolving beyond the solar-focussed market of recent years. FY23 saw wind capacity addition pick up again and, in fact, the newly notified renewable purchase obligation (RPO) trajectory has a dedicated wind RPO to be met with projects commissioned after March 31, 2022. Further, procurement under innovative formats such as hybrids and RE plus storage accounted for 31% of the capacity auctioned during the year. Finally, over 4 GWh of standalone energy storage tenders were concluded.”
In March 2023, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy directed renewable energy implementing agencies to conduct bids for 50 GW of RE capacity annually until FY 2028. The report authors found that 10 GW of RE capacity was auctioned in FY 2022-23 and another 41 GW was under the tendering process. FY 2022-23 was also a significant year for energy storage with 4.02 GWh of standalone energy storage tenders concluded.
Ruchita Shah, programme associate at CEEW-CEF, said, “FY23 has been a pivotal year for renewable energy. First, the reverse auction mechanism for wind projects was scrapped and the MNRE announced a five-year RE bidding trajectory that directs the REIAs to conduct 50 GW bids annually till FY28. A long-term bidding trajectory will provide a clear vision to RE developers, enabling them to plan financing and manage their supply chain for a longer duration. In addition, it will support the domestic RE manufacturing industry in estimating the demand for solar modules, wind turbine generators and other components.”

The renewables mix comprises 53.9 GW of large hydro, 18.9 GW pumped storage, 292.6 GW solar PV, 99.9 GW wind, 14.5 GW biomass, and 5.3 GW from small hydro plants.
The balance of the overall 777 GW includes 251.6 GW of coal- and lignite-based capacity, 24.8 GW gas-based capacity, and 15.48 GW of nuclear-based capacity.
The study took into account the projected regional peak electricity demand and electrical energy requirement in the year 2029-30 to find out the optimal generation capacity mix for the year 2029-30.
The study was carried out using a state-of-the-art computer Generation Expansion planning model. The model determined the least cost optimal expansion path to arrive at the optimal generation capacity mix for the year 2029-30, taking into account all the technical/financial parameters associated with various power generation and storage technologies for the study period and challenges, if any.
“The likely share of thermal installed capacity reduces to 35.5% of the total installed capacity in 2029-30 as compared to 57% as of March 2023, while the RE based Installed capacity in 2029-30 (including large hydro) increases to 62.4% of the total installed capacity as compared to 41.4 % as of March 2023,” according to the study.
The overall non-fossil capacity (including nuclear) can be about 64% (500.6 GW) of the total 777 GW installed capacity in 2029-30.
As of March 2023, India’s installed capacity was 415.4 GW, which comprises 236.68 GW from thermal (211.8 GW coal + lignite and 24.8 GW gas), 6.78 GW nuclear, 171.8 GW RES (42.1 GW hydro, 66.8 GW solar, 42.6 GW wind, 4.7 GW small hydro, 4.8 GW pumped storage, 10.8 GW bio-power).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/10/the-pv-scientific-communitys-rush-to-the-latest-efficiency-record/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"MAY 10, 2023",The PV scientific community’s rush to the latest efficiency record,"From pv magazine Global
2022! What an amazing year! It was the year the PV industry reached one terawatt (TW) of global cumulative PV installations, and that the first tandem solar cell reached over 30% conversion efficiency combining silicon and perovskite materials.
Many called this 30% the psychological barrier of the technology: sort of an initiation for perovskite as an emerging technology.
Perovskite is a new material structure that quickly conquered the PV world – a world that is often very reluctant to be “impressed” by breakthrough innovations. However, perovskite solar cells, due to their processing simplicity and unique properties, have been massively studied in academic and commercial labs. Not just a few, but thousands of researchers worldwide started to improve knowledge and achieve new efficiency records with this new material. Only ten years since its introduction in PV, a lab record of 25% was achieved with a single material (single junction) device. Surpassing the efficiency limit of any single material device (name it: silicon, perovskite, CIGS, etc.) while maintaining the low-cost potential is the main gap that the PV community wants to fill. This is, so far, only possible if, instead of one single material, two materials are used for the conversion of light into electricity. Silicon and perovskite are the main candidates. Silicon is the current TW-scale material for the energy transition and perovskite because of its tunable material properties and its potential for low-cost. The combination offers the potential to reach over 30% efficiency in a low-cost, large-deployment scenario. With these two materials available, the community witnessed a rush to smash the 30% efficiency limit: “the 30% rush”!
In 2022, not once but multiple times, the 30% barrier was smashed by combining these materials. First, by Swiss researchers at CSEM/EPFL, then by TNO, TU-Eindhoven, imec and TU-Delft partners in Solliance, and finally by Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, which demonstrated over 32% conversion efficiency with their tandem cell. Just last April the limit has been pushed forward to 33.2% by the researchers at KAUST.
The PV community was not new to passing 30% of course, look for example at III-V semiconductors, mainly developed for space applications, but it is the first time that this efficiency has been achieved with materials with low-cost potential like the combination of silicon with perovskite.
Previous PV rushes
Was this the first “rush” in the PV community? Absolutely not. Looking at the world champion efficiency chart by NREL, it is clear that there were also similar patterns around 20% and 25% efficiency milestones. How do you recognize these periods? Notice the increase in cell record efficiencies just before the milestone is reached.
In recent years, we are seeing the “ultimate” rush. This is the goal to reach the highest efficiency for a single material silicon solar cell, capped at the theoretical limit of about 29%. The aim here would be to obtain the ultimate and highest record. The latest efficiency record is held by Longi at 26.8% and many companies have intentions to beat this soon.
Life after the “rush”
Historically, after a major record is reached, there is a period where development seems to slow. After the 20% rush, there was a 10-year period where no new record was achieved. Similarly, there was a 20-year gap after the 25% threshold was achieved.
So, what happens in the PV community in between each major record? To understand it, one needs to look not only at the lab record efficiency chart, but at manufacturing and installation trends. Most of these records are achieved on small areas, in research settings. The next step involves scaling to large areas through innovations to simplify processing and manufacturability, and ultimately to bring it to mass production. This requires the efforts of academia, research institutes and companies. Just to offer an example, about 12-15 years ago, researchers were focusing on developing a new n-type silicon-based cell concept. Then, the rule of thumb was that a new cell architecture was not even considered until its efficiency was above 20% on a 6-inch wafer area (at that time, the lab record was at 25%). This rule was to demonstrate the importance of large-area rather than “just” lab efficiency. After a period of rush, research focuses on narrowing the gap between the lab record and mass-produced cell efficiencies.
If history repeats itself, starting already this year, major resources will be focused on the industrialization of perovskite/silicon tandem cells and modules. There are four major challenges to realizing commercial tandems. First, based on the record technology, the highest-performing material stack needs to be scaled up to industry-relevant sizes (over 100s cm2). Second, the reliability of such a large-area device must be proven in relevant outdoor conditions. Third, all potential technologies need a detailed techno-economic analysis of the cost/benefit and manufacturing feasibility and (hopefully) a full lifecycle analysis. This includes material availability and new tools for the deposition of perovskite and transport layers. Lastly, large-scale manufacturing – with high-throughput tools and abundant materials – of a reliable, cost-effective, fully integrated tandem cell and module needs to be demonstrated for the technology to be bankable. Only then would the 30% rush have completed the cycle.
Of course, for the scientific community, after a new major record there’s always another threshold. And for tandem devices, we are experiencing a much faster turnover of efficiency records typical of the early stage of development of a new technology holding an incredible potential. How long do you think it will take for the PV community to reach 35%?
Gianluca Coletti is Adjunct Professor at University of New South Wales Sydney and Program Manager Tandem Photovoltaic Technology and Applications at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), which is currently seeking to bring to the market a two-terminal (2T) perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell technology in the frame of a four-year research project called FIT4Market.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/10/scientists-warn-of-heat-induced-failure-risks-in-hjt-glass-backsheet-pv-modules/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 10, 2023",Scientists warn of heat-induced failure risks in HJT glass-backsheet PV modules,"From pv magazine Global
A research team from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) has investigated failure modes in heterojunction (HJT) solar modules with glass-backsheet configurations.
“We have identified four failure modes in the silicon heterojunction glass-backsheet module which has the potential to result in a power loss of up to 50% following damp heat testing,” researcher Chandany Sen told pv magazine. “We sought to understand the possible underlying causes of each failure mode and how to quickly detect them at the cell level.”
The scientists conducted their experiment on bifacial half-cut n-type silicon HJT solar cells sourced from industrial production lines of unidentified manufacturers. The products were divided into three groups: modules with encapsulated cells; modules with encapsulated cell precursors; and non-encapsulated cells. For the first two groups, the researchers used ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant.
“All samples featured an n-type wafer, intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) passivation layers on both sides, and phosphorus-doped (n-a-Si:H) and boron-doped (p-a-Si:H) hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers on the front and rear sides, respectively, followed by indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) layer deposited on both sides,” they said.
All devices underwent a damp heat test at 85°C and 85% relative humidity (RH) for durations between 500 hours and 4000 hours.
Through this testing, the academics identified four failure modes for the encapsulated cells, resulting in power losses ranging from 5% to 50%. The first failure type consisted of cell darkening in localized points, and the second was represented by darkening around the interconnection of busbars and ribbon wires. The third failure mode involved intense darkening between the interconnected regions of busbars and ribbon wires, while the fourth showed darkening on the interconnected region of busbars and ribbon wires.
According to the group’s analysis, the first failure type was attributable to surface contamination, which may have occurred during handling or characterization before module encapsulation. As for the second and third groups, the scientists attributed the failures to the involvement of soldering flux.
“The direct impact of flux and lead (Pb) solder in causing contact degradation after DH testing was also observed in other work,” they said. “It is essential to highlight that, in some cases, the usage of a different Ag paste also resulted in a Type-3 failure.”
For the fourth group, the researchers indicated that the failures likely originated from the byproduct of EVA used for encapsulation.
“Although the experimental design in this work cannot determine exactly how each failure mode occurred after DH testing, it demonstrates plausible situations that could happen in the industry environment and lead to the actual failure modes observed,” they concluded.
Sen said that comprehending and mitigating these failure modes, preferably at the solar cell level, will be crucial to realizing the low-levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) potential of HJT. She said that while glass-glass modules are frequently employed for HJT solar cells due to their reduced susceptibility to moisture ingress, similar failure modes are likely to occur in these modules over more extended periods.
The research team presented its findings in the study “Four failure modes in silicon heterojunction glass-backsheet modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
