This is the largest-ever equity round raised by any green energy company in Asia.
Avaada will use the funding to bolster its green hydrogen, green methanol, green ammonia, solar manufacturing, and renewable power generation ventures. 
Avaada Group had previously won a production-linked incentive of $116.78 million for 3 GW of wafer-to-module manufacturing capacity. In the last three months, the Group has won almost 1.8 GW of projects from corporate customers and utilities. 
The funding included $1 billion from Brookfield Renewables and $301 million from Avaada’s existing investor Global Power Synergy Public Co (GPSC).
Brookfield Renewables invested in Avaada through its Brookfield Global Transition Fund. GPSC, Avaada Energy’s existing shareholder with a 42.93% equity, has pledged to invest an additional $233 million in Avaada Energy following its $68 million announced in April. This brings GPSC’s total investment in Avaada to around $779 million.
Worawat Pitayasiri, president and CEO of GPSC, said, “Our decision to invest further in AEPL is based on our confidence in their strategic approach to the renewable energy sector, aiming to achieve at least 11 GW in 2026. AEPL’s commitment to renewable power generation aligns well with our focus on sustainable growth and innovation.”
Avaada Group currently operates a renewable energy portfolio of 4 GW with around 7 GW in different stages of implementation. It has diversified into manufacturing green hydrogen, green methanol, and green ammonia, and expanded its footprint into the solar PV supply chain with the manufacturing of solar cells and modules.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/28/delhis-aggressive-ev-timelines-may-hit-gig-workers-livelihood-iamai/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,EV CHARGERS,EVS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,DELHI",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 28, 2023",Delhi’s aggressive EV timelines may hit gig workers’ livelihood: IAMAI,"The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) has expressed concern over the recently released Delhi Motor Vehicle Aggregator and Delivery Service Provider Scheme 2023. It stated the implementation of the scheme could adversely impact the livelihoods of countless gig workers across Delhi.
The Scheme envisages that aggregators and delivery service providers in Delhi will switch to an all-electric fleet by April 1, 2030. The existing conventional vehicles (petrol, CNG, and diesel propelled) on-boarded by them will be liable for penalty. 
IAMAI said the EV conversion targets prescribed in the scheme appear to be based on assumptions of ecosystem maturity rather than evidence-based research. The paucity of charging stations and battery-swapping infrastructure in the capital make the scheme’s ambitious targets virtually impossible to meet.
IAMAI added that aggressive EV transition mandates for aggregators and delivery service providers could lead to significant disruptions to business activity and livelihoods of gig workers in the capital. The EV conversion targets prescribed in the scheme pose a significant risk to gig workers who have heavily invested their capital, often through loans, in internal combustion engine (ICE) powered vehicles. Moreover, the extremely high costs associated with owning an EV make it a commercially unfeasible option for most gig workers in the capital. 
The target of 100% electrification of bike taxis operating in Delhi right from the outset also raises serious concerns as the lack of a moratorium for bike taxis could render numerous gig workers without work overnight.
Established in 2004, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) is a not-for-profit industry body and the country’s only organization representing the digital services industry with over 500 Indian and multinational corporations as its members.

Columbia Law School of New York has released its third annual round up of anti-renewable energy legislation filed across the U.S. The report, Opposition to Renewable Energy in the United States – May 2023 Edition, aims to document local and state restrictions on, and opposition to, the siting of renewable energy projects from 1995 to May 2023.
The authors contend that “local opposition to renewable energy facilities is widespread and growing, and represents a potentially significant impediment to achievement of climate goals.”
The report highlights several particularly challenging situations including:
In the most recent version of the report, the researchers at Columbia identified no fewer than 228 local restrictions across 35 states. They also highlighted nine state-level restrictions that are so stringent they could block a renewable energy project, the authors say. Moreover, the team listed 293 renewable projects that have faced substantial opposition in 45 states.
The only states without significant restrictions or controversies, according to the authors’ criteria, were Alaska, Arizona, and Mississippi. For example, Yuma, Arizona, considered one of the sunniest cities in the U.S., has a long history of its power companies stifling the development of solar projects.
Most of the state-level restrictions targeted wind power, with only a few directly affecting solar. Two of these restrictions involved state bodies in Connecticut and Maryland needing to approve relatively small solar projects. In New York, the state government controls the approval of larger solar projects.
Before March 2022, the group had identified 169 unique local renewable energy restrictions. Since then, an additional 59 restrictions have been enacted, marking a 35% increase. Furthermore, throughout the year, 82 projects encountered contentious paths during their respective zoning processes.
This period saw a 39% surge in the number of projects facing ‘serious organized opposition’.
Concurrent with the strong rise of laws limiting renewables, is the fact that solar deployed a record 6.1 GW of capacity in Q1 2023 is set to deploy a record 30 GW of capacity in 2023. And while it is true that tens of projects have been rejected, thousands have been turned on.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/28/new-nanocoating-to-improve-solar-module-output/,"GROUND MOUNTED,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ROOFTOP SOLAR,SOILING,SOLAR PANEL CLEANING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 28, 2023",New nanocoating to improve solar module output ,"India’s TriNANO Technologies has developed nanocoatings for solar modules that can increase their power output by up to 4% and lower the temperature by up to 3 degrees Celsius compared to non-coated panels. 
“This means a 10 MW solar power plant with nanocoated panels would generate additional power of 720 MWh and thus an additional revenue of about INR 17 lakh ($20,737) per year assuming PPA tariff of INR 2.36/kWh,” Harsh Sethi, founder and CEO of TriNANO Technologies, told pv magazine. 
The nanocoating is environment-friendly and thermally and chemically stable. It is designed to improve solar panels’ light trapping, anti-reflection, and self-cleaning properties. “Besides increasing the panel’s energy output, these help in anti-soiling and reducing potential-induced degradation (PID). The coating can last for more than five years and reduces panel maintenance and cleaning (especially water-based) costs. Thus, the ROI on our coating can be obtained within about two years,” said Sethi. 
Sethi said the nanocoatings were put to extensive testing in several research universities and labs in India and Thailand. The improvements in panel output and temperature were confirmed by the National Center for Photovoltaic Research and Education (NCPRE), IIT Bombay. [NCPRE has a technology and R&D tie-up with USA’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Germany’s Fraunhofer, and Australia’s University of New South Wales]. 
Similar findings were also recorded at the National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) in Gurugram, and in pilots done at Toyota’s rooftop solar project in Mumbai, a residential rooftop solar plant in Navi Mumbai, and a Tata Power pilot project in Bengaluru. 
Sethi said they have applied for the patent on their technology in India and other member countries of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and expect it to be granted by 2023. 
The coating is done using a portable coating machine and 6 kg frames and can also be applied on existing panels without removing them from service. It is a solid-phase deposition with no liquid involved. On the other hand, the commercially available coatings are made of organic material, are liquid, and applied by paint, brush, or spray method, and therefore they decompose and wither away within two years. 
The coating can be applied to monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film solar panels in ground-mount as well as rooftop applications. 
Potential customers are solar panel manufacturers, solar plant owners, and EPC and operation and maintenance contractors.

The international research group led by Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales in Australia has published Version 62 of the “solar cell efficiency tables” in Progress in Photovoltaics. The scientists said they have added 21 new results to the new tables since December.
“The highlights are a large increase in small-area kesterite (CZTSSe) cell efficiency by the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) from 13.0% to 14.9%, with less dramatic increases in small-area organic PV cell efficiency to 19.2% by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and in small-area perovskite cell efficiency to 26.0% by the Institute of Semiconductors, CAS,” Green told pv magazine.
“Notable perovskite progress is also reported in the 2-terminal tandem cell area, with all-perovskite tandem cell efficiency increasing to 29.1% for a 0.05 cm2 device and 28.2% for a larger 1 cm2 device, with both devices fabricated by Nanjing University in collaboration with Renshine Solar,” he added.
Greener also stressed that new results are reported for perovskite/silicon tandem cells with 33.7%, for a 1-cm2 device fabricated by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and 28.6% efficiency for a much larger, full-sized 258-cm2 cell fabricated by Oxford PV.
“Good progress is also reported in the encapsulated module area, with a large increase for an organic PV module efficiency from 8.7% to 13.1% for a 57-cell module fabricated by Ways Technical Corporation in conjunction with Nanobit,” he explained. “Efficiency gain to 19.2% is also reported for a 39-cell perovskite module fabricated by UtmoLight and to 24.7% for a much larger 112-cell, 1.8m2 silicon module fabricated by Maxeon. Additionally, the first small CIGS module from Avancis with efficiency over 20% is reported. ”
In Version 61 of the tables, released in November the researchers added five new results. The group has seen major improvements in all cell categories since 1993, when the tables were first published.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the US Department of Energy, and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Lhyfe says that its Sealhyfe offshore hydrogen production pilot has been successfully towed 20 kilometers into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Le Croisic, France. The French company said the platform started producing offshore hydrogen on June 20. The project will undergo real-world testing on a re-engineered floating platform connected to Central Nantes’ SEM-REV offshore testing hub, which is already linked to a floating wind turbine. The compact Sealhyfe platform, measuring less than 200 square meters, has the capacity to produce up to 400 kilograms of hydrogen per day.
The Hydrogen Offshore Production for Europe (HOPE) project consortium has secured a €20 million ($21.9 million) grant from the European Commission. The consortium, including partner Lhyfe, aims to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale offshore renewable hydrogen production and pipeline transport. The project involves constructing a 10 MW production unit off the coast of Belgium in the North Sea by 2026.
RINA and AFRY have conducted an initial study on the feasibility of a direct pipeline linking the Gulf region and Europe for low-carbon hydrogen transportation. The two sides said that the results reveal the Gulf’s potential as a cost-effective source of low-carbon hydrogen for Europe. The analysis demonstrates that existing infrastructure can transport approximately 2.5 million tons of hydrogen per year, but expanding the pipeline network would further enhance transport capacity.
Australia has granted approval for a AUD 51 million ($34 million) renewable hydrogen plant in Victoria. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said that the 10MW electrolyzer will be eight times larger than the country’s current largest electrolyzer. The project, located in Albury-Wodonga, will use renewable energy from a Victorian wind farm to showcase the compatibility of renewable hydrogen with existing gas infrastructure. The renewable hydrogen will be distributed through natural gas pipelines, blended at up to 10 percent. Construction is set to begin in 2023, with the site expected to be operational by late 2025.
Toyota, Toyota Tsusho, and Mitsubishi Kakoki have agreed to introduce biogas-derived hydrogen production equipment in Thailand. “The hydrogen production equipment to be introduced will be manufactured by Mitsubishi Kakoki and installed in Thailand in November 2023 to produce hydrogen from biogas derived from local chicken manure and food waste,” said Toyota. The companies will collaborate on systems for the compression, storage, and transportation of biogas and hydrogen.
Hydrogène de France (HDF) has signed two deals to accelerate the development of its hydrogen power plants in the Philippines. The initial agreements were formed with the Mindanao Development Authority and the Philippine Department of Energy, while the subsequent one was entered into with National Power Corp., the country’s main utility company, said the French company. 
Air Liquide has become an “official supporter” of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, under a partnership to contribute to reducing the event’s carbon emissions. The group will supply renewable hydrogen to power some of the official fleet. 
Enapter has secured an order from UK-based Intelligent Energy Ltd. (IEL) to deliver a 1 MW AEM-Multicore electrolyzer. IEL makes lightweight hydrogen fuel cell products and will use the AEM Multicore to generate hydrogen to test its zero-emission fuel cell products. Delivery is planned for 2024.
