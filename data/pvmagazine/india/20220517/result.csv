Under the agreement, Sembcorp will supply 33 MW of renewable power to Saint-Gobain’s manufacturing facilities in Sriperumbudur, Perundurai, and Tiruvallur for 25 years.
GIWEL will develop the renewable power plant through a special purpose vehicle (SPV). It will hold a 74% stake in the SPV, with the remainder owned by Saint-Gobain India.
Saint-Gobain targets carbon neutrality by 2050. “Aimed at fulfilling the ambitious target of 100% green power by 2027-28, the agreement with Sembcorp is another step in our continued efforts to add more green capacity through collaboration with green power generators and to meet our sustainability targets,’’ said Venkat Subramanian, managing director of Saint-Gobain Gyproc Business.
To date, Saint-Gobain India has installed multiple solar plants in India. By December end, these captive solar plants will replace close to 22 million units of electricity required. And by 2023, Saint-Gobain India will have 44% of its electricity consumption coming from renewables.

(HMIL) to install its EZ Charge fast DC chargers (60 kW) at HMIL’s 34 electric vehicle (EV) dealer locations across 29 cities. It will also supply, install, and commission home charging solutions for Hyundai EV customers. 
All 34 HMIL dealer locations are currently equipped with AC 7.2 kW chargers. The company aims to expand the fast-charging infrastructure network across its pan-India dealership network. The charging stations at HMIL dealerships will be open for all electric vehicle customers. 
“HMIL dealerships will facilitate space and necessary administrative approvals. Tata Power will invest, own and operate the charging stations. Easy accessibility of charging stations through HMIL and Tata Power EZ Charge Mobile App will provide a smooth vehicle charging experience to customers across the country,” said Tata Power.
Tata Power has installed more than 1,500 public and semi-public EV chargers in India and has more than 550 chargers in various stages of installation. The company also has a network of more than 13,000 home chargers and over 200 bus charging points installed across the nation.

The 9,000-acre site, in the Bikaner district of Rajasthan, will be equipped to host up to 3 GWp of solar projects. 
The solar park will provide plug-and-play infrastructure for multiple solar projects. This will save time and money for developers, as land, transmission lines, and other infrastructure will be pre-arranged.
“The park is under development. All approvals are granted, and site development is going on. We are commissioning park infrastructure like transmission line and pooling station and facilitating individual solar project developers to commission their plants by connecting to the commissioned infrastructure. They can take the analogy with the Bhadla solar park [in Rajasthan] where several such projects are connected,” Rahul Gupta, Rays Experts’ managing director and chief executive officer, told pv magazine, noting that 70% of the land is already arranged. “The rest is in process.”
The park is purportedly India’s first and only 100% privately owned ultra-mega solar park to be connected to the central transmission system. All of India’s other major solar parks are partly or wholly owned by the government.
“Our solar park is a major factor in risk reduction for solar developers. They will not have to face the surprises after winning the project as infrastructure facilities such as land and transmission line will already be in control at the time of bidding,” said Gupta. 
Rays Expert has established 2 GW of solar parks in the states of Rajasthan, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh over the last decade. They include Corneight Solar Park, Kolayat Solar Park, Gajner Solar Park, Siwani Solar Park, and Mandsaur Solar Park. 
Soltown Solar Park will soon join the list of the world’s largest solar parks.

The company will handle sales, supplies and installation. It will also provide 25 years of operation and maintenance services for its robotic PV panel cleaning solutions.
Hero Future Energies currently uses Airtouch’s robotic solutions to dry clean the solar modules at its Bhadla plant in Rajasthan.
“The latest transaction [with Hero] will yield Airtouch revenues of approximately $0.94 million, to be paid at several milestones in the process of the delivery and installation of the systems, and afterward over a period of 25 years while providing operation and maintenance services,” the companies said in a joint statement.
Airtouch’s agreement with Hero Future Energies follows its $440,000 transaction with an unnamed solar developer in India in late April. Under the terms of the deal, Airtouch will deploy its AT 3.0 robotic water-free robotic cleaning systems. It expects to finish installing its robots by December.

The 300 MW project, worth INR 1,731 crore ($223 million), will be developed in Rajasthan under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) scheme. Under the CPSU scheme, state-run power producers are provided financial support to set up solar plants for self-use or for use by other government entities, either directly or through electricity distribution companies. The scheme mandates the use of domestic solar cells and modules. It provides viability gap funding (VGF) to cover the cost difference between domestic and imported solar cells and modules.
The project is scheduled for commissioning within 18 months from the award of the contract. Once operational, it is expected to generate approximately 750 million units of electricity per year. With this win, Tata Power’s pending order book has reached INR 13,500 crore, and its total utility-scale solar project portfolio has hit 9.7 GWp.

A new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that new renewable energy capacity additions will exceed 300 GW globally this year for the first time, with mounting concerns about climate change and energy security driving an 8% increase, after new installations reached almost 295 GW in 2021.
The IEA said that despite persistent pandemic-induced supply chain challenges, construction delays, and record-level raw material and commodity prices, renewable capacity additions increased by a record 6% globally in 2021.

Researchers from Amrita University in India have studied how small-scale floating PV could be combined with pumped-hydro storage in subsidized environments.
“Our system configuration has been initially applied to the subsidized Indian market, but it can also be utilized and operated more profitably without subsidies,” researcher B. Shyam told pv magazine.
The scientists simulated a system based a water reservoir at the Meenar-I dam in the Indian state of Kerala. They considered a subsidized time-of-day (ToD) tariff for renewable energy projects in the region. The facility was modeled using MATLAB 2021b and two different algorithms were used for optimal scheduling and design.
“The upper and lower reservoirs are 800 meters apart, and the available head is about 90 meters,” the scientists said.
In the proposed system configuration, the pumped-hydro facility stores grid electricity during off-peak hours by pumping water to the upper reservoir. During peak hours, the system feeds the load and doesn’t get power from the grid.
Its mode of operation is determined by electricity prices, load demand, solar PV availability, and reservoir status. The PV system is located in the upper reservoir and has a capacity of 250 kW. The 850 solar modules have a power conversion efficiency of 16% and a temperature coefficient of 0.47% per degree Celsius. Water evaporation loss is assumed to be minimum due to the presence of a floating cover.
For daily scheduling, the scientists considered six operating modes:
The last configuration had the lowest daily operational cost and was chosen as the base case for further investigation.
“For Case-VI, the round-trip efficiency of the system is about 57.13%,” the scientists said. “When the model is simulated with Case-VI conditions for a typical day, daily operating cost is reduced by about 40% … Once the storage is saturated, the excess energy from PV modules cannot be stored.”
Through their analysis, the academics found that the PV system can achieve savings at a levelized cost of INR 0.8518 ($0.011)/kWh and a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of INR 4.2713/kWh.
“The size of the PV system is critical to the system configuration. Utilizing the given reservoir area to its maximum capacity will result in the lowest unit and operational costs. However, only a portion of the reservoir may be utilized for PV module installation due to practical constraints. Existing large-scale cascaded power plants integrated with a floating PV system can produce better LCOS,” said Shyam.
The researchers described the proposed approach in “Feasibility of floating solar PV integrated pumped storage system for a grid-connected microgrid under static time of day tariff environment: A case study from India,” published in Renewable Energy.
