The capacity expansion is driven by strong growth in backlog over the past few months and a robust demand outlook, said the company.
The announcement comes after four months of the opening of its Renewable Hybrids manufacturing site in Vallam, near Chennai, Tamil Nadu, where it manufactures these systems.
The Vallam site manufactures GE’s power conversion solution FlexInverter (formerly known as LV5+) and the FlexReservoir utility-scale energy storage solution. It also helps integrate these solutions with GE’s FlexIQ digital platform to solve customers’ needs for dispatchable, green MWhs in solar, storage, and hybrid applications.
The FlexReservoir is scalable from a rated power of 3 MW to 500+ MW to serve multiple market applications.
The FlexInverter power station delivers a reliable, cost-effective, plug-and-play, factory-integrated power conversion platform for utility-scale solar and storage applications. It combines a solar inverter, medium voltage power transformer, and an optional MV Ring Main Unit, all integrated in a standard 20-feet high cube container.
“Solar and battery energy storage will continue to be a key driver in delivering hybrid systems that enable the energy transition. GE is committed to providing cutting-edge technologies around power conversion solutions and software-enabled controls to meet growing customer needs in the Hybrids space. Our new factory has ramped up to meet increasing industry and customer demand,” said Prakash Chandra, Renewable Hybrids CEO, GE.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/10/solar-arm-for-agrivoltaic-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 10, 2022",Solar arm for agrivoltaic applications,"From pv magazine Global
Slovakian startup Sun powered systems, s.r.o. has developed an automated photovoltaic system that can be used for various applications in soil preparation and crop growing. “The photovoltaic arm provides the off-grid power supply for the owner, useful for further vegetable processing, preparing of ready to use vegetable products or packaging,” the company’s CEO and founder, Robert Demko, told pv magazine.
The system is connected to movable equipment, located underneath the solar panels, which is able to perform linear movements, in combination with simultaneous circular movement of the arm itself, in a spiral pattern with a width of either 60 cm or 30 cm. “The rotating arm is driven by a motor that is powered by the photovoltaic panels fastened to the arm itself,” Demko explained. “The system does not require a connection to the power grid or any other external source of electricity. It is ideal for locations with no proximity to a power network or sites that cannot be reached easily by electricity sources for any reason.”
The system uses an AC asynchronous motor with a rotational speed of 1500 revolutions per minute, and a power of 750 W for motion. It can be equipped with commercially available solar modules of small size, as well as LiFePo batteries and frequency regulators.

The company is offering the system in different variants. The smallest configuration consists of a six meter-long arm with a power output of 1 kW, which is reportedly able to cover a cultivated area of 104 m². The largest system is an 18-meter-long arm with a capacity of 2.4 kW and is able to cover a cultivated area of 994 m².
The system is able to remove weeds between defined lines in one cycle, which is the number of rotations the arm has to perform to move along the whole arm around the axis of rotation, from one end of the driving unit to another end. According to Demko, agricultural entrepreneurs will be able to install the system using only soil screws, which enable the machine to be replaced easily if needed.
“The way of soil cultivation implemented through our system is non-invasive and the soil does not carry the burden of heavy mechanisms which make it extremely dense,” he further explained.
The system is currently being assembled in Slovakia and the manufacturer plans to sell it in European countries where subsidies for agrivoltaics are being provided such as France, Italy, or Spain. “Our system is for all people, small communities and companies that want fresh and healthy vegetables,” Demko stated.
The 18-meter system is currently being sold at around €24,000.

The battery has a size of 1,142 mm x 341 mm x 432 mm and a weight of 142 kg. It can be installed in outdoor environments and with operating temperatures ranging from -20 C to 45 C. It is equipped with a hybrid power conditioner, a DC-to-DC converter, and a vehicle power supply adapter with a maximum output of 1.1 kWh.
Toyota explained that the system supports supplying power from hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) at 100 V. The technology utilizes “many years of electrified vehicle development as well as on-board parts,” the company emphasized. “It provides electricity to homes both for normal usage and emergencies, supporting a stress-free lifestyle.
The company did not disclose any more technical details about the battery.
*The article was amended to reflect that the storage system has a rated output of 5 kW.
