BJMC said in a recent statement that it will buy electricity from 90 MW of rooftop PV capacity that will be deployed at 13 jute mills throughout Bangladesh.
“We will buy power from these facilities under 20-year contracts,” BJMC Chairman Anis Mahmud told pv magazine.
The project developers were selected through a competitive tender that included six foreign bidders and their local joint venture partners, he noted.
 “We have sent their proposals to the power division for evaluation and award the contact,” Mahmud added, without providing additional details.
Chint Solar Bangladesh (China), Solarion CNI Creative Centre (Indonesia), Copenhagen Urban Solar Parks BD Consortium (Denmark), Top Points Trading (Oman), Lesso Consortium (Singapore), and BAY Trina Consortium (China) are the bidders.
In June, the government of Bangladesh implemented measures to increase the share of domestic independent power producers (IPPs) in the renewable energy market. It agreed to allow them to hold 100% stakes in companies that own renewable energy projects, removing the old 80% foreign investment limit.
Previously, domestic IPPs were also permitted to participate in projects through international consortia with 51% shares, while foreign developers were limited to maximum shares of 20%.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/12/cleantech-solar-commissions-virtual-ppa-driven-solar-plant-in-india/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",Cleantech Solar commissions virtual PPA-driven solar plant in India ,"Cleantech Solar announced today that its maiden virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) solar plant in India has started commercial operation. The project is amongst the first operational VPPA plants in India. 
“Power from this operating solar power plant, after being dispossessed of its renewable attributes, is being sold to the energy exchange. The project has been registered under the International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-REC) mechanism, and the renewable attributes (in this case I-RECs) from this project are being purchased by a leading FMCG company under a virtual PPA,” stated Cleantech Solar.
The project is estimated to generate around 187 GWh of green power over its lifecycle, helping to offset over 171 kilotonnes of carbon emissions. 
This virtual PPA agreement enables the client to support renewable energy development while reducing carbon emissions without directly integrating the solar project into their physical energy infrastructure. Functioning under the principle of ‘additionality’, virtual PPAs ensure the claimed environmental benefits or the green attributes by the procurer are credible as this energy would not have been generated without the said agreement. They work as a simple bilateral agreement between the IPP and the off-taker. 
Aside from helping companies reduce their carbon footprints and meet sustainability targets, VPPAs provide a hedge against volatile electricity prices. A virtual power purchase agreement is a contract for differences (CFD), in which the parties agree on a fixed VPPA price. If the wholesale energy price is higher, the offtaker receives the difference. If the wholesale energy price is lower than the VPPA tariff agreed, the offtaker pays the solar project owner the difference. The VPPA does not involve the physical delivery of solar electricity to the offtaker’s facility and instead operates as a hedge against varying electricity prices.
Singapore-based Cleantech Solar is a pan-Asia supplier of renewable energy to corporates. It has numerous solar and wind projects across India and Southeast Asia, covering approximately 1 GWp of assets in operations, construction, and development stages. This includes installations in India, Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The company is backed by long-term strategic shareholders including Keppel Corp., Keppel Asia Infrastructure Fund, and Shell Singapore.

It now seeks a consultant to prepare a detailed project report for the development of this PV park.
The prospective consultant’s scope of work includes site survey, preparation of feasibility reports, solar resource assessment, energy yield estimation, plot sizing optimization, layout, infrastructure, and detailed project report.
The solar park will be developed under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s (MNRE) scheme for developing solar/renewable energy ultra-mega parks. Under the scheme, MNRE supports the States and union territories in setting up solar parks at various locations in the country to create the required infrastructure for solar power projects.
The solar parks provide developers with suitably developed land with all clearances, transmission systems, water access, road connectivity, communication network, etc.
The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has finalized the location in Malegaon village of the Aurad taluk for establishing a 765/400/220kV Bidar pooling station for the proposed Bidar park. Accordingly, REC Power Development and Consultancy Ltd has issued a tender to select the transmission service provider for the construction of the 765 kV line and pooling station for the solar energy zone in Bidar.

The farm will be built on a 90-hectare fish pond, reported the Philippine News Agency.
The news outlet did not list the project’s cost or its construction and commissioning target dates. However, it mentioned that the array has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 1,250 tons per year.
“Signing of the agreement comes at a perfect time, considering that the outlook for new renewable energy generation projects in Negros Occidental is quite encouraging,” said Zonal Renewables President Jabez Alvarez. “That is due to the soon-to-be completed additional transmission capabilities by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines.”
In August, Acen – a subsidiary of Ayala Group – announced plans to develop 1 GW of floating solar on Laguna Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines. The company has submitted contracts to the Department of Energy for eight blocks of 100 hectares each in the southern and eastern sections of the lake.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/12/longi-betting-on-back-contact-solar-cell-tech/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",VINCENT SHAW,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",Longi betting on back-contact solar cell tech,"From pv magazine global
Chinese solar module manufacturer Longi plans to implement its back-contact solar cell technology in most of its panel production, as announced by the company’s chairman, Zhong Baoshen, during an investor meeting last week.
“Longi has a very clear view that in the next five to six years, back-contact cells will be the mainstream of crystalline silicon cells,” he said. “The high conversion efficiency of BC cells is the crown jewel of crystalline silicon technology, and the whole industry is ready now to pick this jewel.”
Longi plans to achieve a total solar cell production capacity of 110 GW by the end of 2023, with 30 GW dedicated to TOPCon technology and 80 GW for BC technology.
Baoshen stated a preference for BC cells over TOPCon devices, on claims that TOPCon cell technology is transitional and offers minimal efficiency improvements compared to past PERC technology advancements.
Additionally, BC technology can be combined with p-type wafers, for which Longi has substantial production capacities, giving it an advantage over the more common interdigitated back-contact (IBC) technology.
“The back-contact (BC) cell technology improves photoelectric conversion efficiency by shifting all the electrode grids on the front side to the back side of the cell, thus reducing the shading of the grids from sunlight.” Shen Wenzhong, secretary general of the Shanghai Solar Energy Association and Director of the Solar Energy Research Institute at Shanghai Jiaotong University, told pv magazine. “As a cell structure, BC technology can be combined with a variety of cell technologies to form back-contact based solar cells.”
In March, Longi launched its own hybrid passivated back contact (HPBC) tech. The company has yet to explain exactly what HPBC is, but it is believed to be an extension of p-type (positively doped silicon) IBC technology that combines the structural advantages of PERC, TOPCon, and IBC solar.
Longi will develop “P-IBC” cells using its extensive production capacity of p-type wafers, along with a silicon dioxide tunneling layer, polysilicon film, and upgraded laser equipment, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, and coating-cleaning equipment—all derived from PERC-process lines.
