It will deploy these mobile charging solutions in cities and highways of the country, mitigating the range anxiety among EV owners.
Mobile electric vehicle chargers are basically battery-based containerized package coupled with charging guns. These can be easily transported to most sites within the city for on-a-call, on-the-spot charging service or pre-installed as service points.
The mobile charging stations are Internet of Things (IoT) enabled, allowing for remote condition monitoring and operations management. 
EzUrja comes in various sizes with a dedicated power supply. The fully charged EzUrja Mobile guarantees a seamless energy supply for the entire range of slow or fast chargers supporting two-wheelers to commercial vehicles to premium EVs. 
At the core of the Ez4EV solution is a lithium-ion manganese phosphate battery. Ez4EV is also introducing an innovative battery technology from USA-based C4V that offers the advantages of lighter weight, green chemistry, and longer cycles.

BusinessToday reported that the Indian group would be ready to pay $1 billion to $1.2 billion to acquire REC Solar. The news outlet claimed that Reliance Industries is already in talks with several unspecified lenders to secure $500 million to $600 million of funds to support the transaction.
“We are in general not commenting on market rumors,” a spokesperson from REC Solar told pv magazine.
Reliance Industries said in a statement to the National Stock Exchange of India that it would not comment on the BusinessToday report, which was published on Tuesday.
“We are unable to comment on media speculation and rumors and it would be inappropriate on our part to do so,” it said. “The company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis.”
Reliance Industries focuses on the energy, petrochemical, natural gas, retail, telecoms, mass media, and textiles industries. In late June, it announced plans to invest $8.1 billion over the next three years to build gigafactories for solar, energy storage, electrolyzers, and fuel cells. The planned facilities include an integrated PV module factory, an advanced energy storage battery factory, an electrolyzer factory for the production of green hydrogen, and a fuel cell factory to convert hydrogen into power. 
REC Solar has currently a production capacity of around 1.8 GW and plans to build a 4 GW heterojunction PV module factory in France.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/02/photovoltaic-sunshade-based-on-perovskite-solar-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2021",Photovoltaic sunshade based on perovskite solar cells,"From pv magazine International
Poland-based perovskite solar cell manufacturer Saules Technology has installed a photovoltaic sunshade equipped with perovskite solar cells on the factory facade of Polish aluminum system provider Aliplast in Lublin.
The company said the project is the world’s first building-applied photovoltaics (BAPV) system relying on a perovskite solar technology.
The photovoltaic blinds are managed by an automation system known as Animeo, provided by French specialist Somfy, which makes the perovskite modules cooperate with a weather station installed on the roof. “Using live weather data and sun-tracking, they automatically change their alignment with the movement of the sun,” the manufacturer stated. “This solution ensures the facility’s energy efficiency and guarantees thermal comfort and protection against too harsh light for the building users — regardless of the season.”

Saules also explained that perovskite cells are ideal for this kind of application as they can generate power when the sun’s rays fall at an angle other than 90 degrees. “Thanks to these advantages and their low weight, they can be mounted even on vertical facade elements and in colors matching the facade of the buildings,” it highlighted.
According to the manufacturer, the perovskite solar modules integrated with the sunshades can be inkjet-printed on thin, flexible substrates in different colors.
Saules is part of the European Perovskite Initiative (EPKI), which unites the major European institutions involved in solar energy research, including the Benelux-based Solliance – which has the Netherlands’ TNO and Belgium’s Imec among its members; Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL); France’s Institut National de l’Energie Solaire; Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE; Italy’s Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche; specialist Oxford PV; and the University of Oxford.

A coalition of government and international development agencies and private impact investors has closed $68 million of a hoped-for more-than $80 million of low-interest credit to help off-grid energy companies in Africa and Asia squeezed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
With Covid disruption exacerbated by rising renewable energy equipment costs, the partners in the newly-convened Energy Access Relief Fund (EARF) want to mobilize the cash to be lent to “more than 90” suppliers of the likes of solar lanterns, clean cooking stoves, solar home systems, and mini-grids.
Quoted in a press release issued to publicize the initiative yesterday, Shell Foundation director Sam Parker said the hope was that similar investors would follow suit as “much more capital will be needed in the coming months to continue progress toward universal energy access.”
The short-term credit will be provided by a group convened by U.S.-based philanthropic investor Acumen and managed by New York City-based venture capital peer Social Investment Managers and Advisors.
The other members of the EARF grouping are U.S. government funded Power Africa, the United States Agency for International Development, and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation; U.K. government-financed UK Aid and CDC Group; Netherlands government-controlled development bank FMO; government-backed peers the Swedish International Development Co-operation Agency and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; multilateral public bodies the Green Climate Fund, which is part of the UN, and the World Bank and its International Finance Corp private sector arm; and private entities the Ikea Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation and the Shell Foundation.
