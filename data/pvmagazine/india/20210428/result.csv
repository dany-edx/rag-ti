The developer shall use this capital to grow its renewable solutions platform across India and South Asia as it targets 3 GW of solar capacity across all its verticals by 2025. It will fund approximately 217 MW of greenfield renewable power generation in India to displace primarily thermal power generation, avoiding 258,000 tonnes of annual CO2 emissions. 
Currently, Fourth Partner Energy manages a portfolio of 550 MW across its distributed and open access solar portfolios. The developer has commenced operations across Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam. In Indonesia, it has tied up with integrated energy major Indika Energy to offer solar solutions to corporates. 
Announcing the investment, Srini Nagarajan, managing director and head of Asia at CDC, said, “CDC is committed to making long-term investments alongside our investment partners, with a clear purpose to bolster efforts toward achieving a net-zero carbon future in India and across the region. We have been building scale in the renewable power sector, and this investment into Fourth Partner Energy, on the distributed solar side of the sector, is a strategic investment that further enhances India’s renewable power capacity.” 
Vivek Subramanian, Co-founder and Executive Director at Fourth Partner Energy, highlighted the company would significantly scale up its current solar portfolio to 3 GW across all its verticals by 2025 while growing its battery storage, energy trading and EV charging capabilities. 
“India’s C&I solar segment is growing exponentially, driven by strong sustainability mandates from all corporates. A long-term and patient capital provider like CDC fits perfectly into Fourth Partner Energy’s financing ecosystem. CDC’s funding, guidance and sustainability expertise will pave the way for the company to leverage and grow our dominant position in this market,” he added. 
In 2020, Fourth Partner Energy secured an INR 110-crore ($15 million) round of funding from Swiss climate action fund ResponsAbility and an INR 126-crore ($16 million) investment from a consortium of European lenders, led by Symbiotics. 
Fourth Partner Energy has also tied up with Lithium Urban Technologies to form a 50:50 joint venture (JV), Shuchi Anant Virya, to offer EV charging infrastructure solutions. The JV has commissioned EV charging hubs across Gurugram, Pune, Kolkata and has partnered with HPCL to set up chargers across its retail fuel outlets.

To fast-track the process, it intends to enlist EPC contractors for these projects based on the lowest (L1) cost discovered in the bidding.
The validity of the EPC contractors at L1 rates discovered shall be one year.
The successful bidders shall be exclusively responsible for feasibility assessment, designing, engineering, procurement, testing and commissioning, and operation and maintenance of the rooftop PV plant for ten years.
NTPC shall carry out the bidding roof-type (GI sheet/RCC) wise, capacity-wise, and region-wise (North, East, South, West, and Special Category Region). Capacity ranges include 20-100 kW, 100-500 kW, 500-1000 kW, 1000-3000 kW, and 3000-10,000 kW.
Bidders shall have to mandatorily bid for the capacity ranges of 20-100 kW, 100-500 kW, and 500-1000 kW for both types of roof (GI or elevated structures, where elevated structures have already been built, and RCC roof) for a particular region. Bidding is allowed for a maximum of all categories for all types of roofs and all regions.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/28/longi-unveils-two-pv-modules-for-distributed-generation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 28, 2021",Longi unveils two PV modules for distributed generation,"From pv magazine International
Chinese solar module manufacturer Longi has added two new products to its Hi-MO4m panel series designed for distributed-generation applications.
The two modules have a 60-cell and a 72-cell design and add to the 66-cell panel previously launched by the company. Referring to its 60-cell, 66-cell and 72-cell modules, Longi stated: “The three products cover power ranges of 370-385 W, 410-420 W and 450-460 W, respectively, with a maximum efficiency of up to 21%, providing global DG clients with wider flexibility and choice.”
The 60-cell module, called Hi-MO4m LR4-60HPH, is available in seven versions, with wattages ranging from 350 W to 380 W and efficiencies of between 19.2% and 20.9%.
The panel is manufactured with 120 monocrystalline half-cut cells, measures 1,755×1,038x35mm, and weighs 19.5kg. The open-circuit voltage is between 40.1 V and 41.3 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 11.15 A to 11.69 A.
The 72-cell panel, called Hi-MO4m LR4-72HPH, is available in five versions with power ratings ranging from 430 W to 460 W and efficiency of between 19.8% and 21.2%. The open-circuit voltage is between 48.5 V and 49.7 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 11.31 A to 11.73 A. This product measures 2,094×1,038x35mm and weighs in at 23.3kg.
The maximum system voltage for both products is 1,500 V. They can be used with operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius and their operating temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius. Both modules also feature an IP68 enclosure rating, 3.2mm coat tempered glass, and an anodized aluminum alloy frame.
They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee, a 12-year product guarantee, and are said to be able to operate at 84.8% of their original performance after 25 years.
