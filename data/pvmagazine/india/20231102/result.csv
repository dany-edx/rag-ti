Singh said that net zero will remain only a goal unless the world gets together to solve the problems of lack of diversification of solar manufacturing capacity and associated supply chains.
Singh was addressing the inaugural session of the one-day High-level Conference on New Technologies for Clean Energy Transition, being organized in New Delhi, on the sidelines of the Sixth Session of the International Solar Alliance Assembly. The conference was organized jointly by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, the Government of India; the Asian Development Bank, and the International Solar Energy Society.
The ISA President also said that storage remains critical for greater utilization and round-the-clock provision of renewable energy.
“Storage is a problem ..though the developed world kept talking about the need for energy transition, they did not do anything about it, they did not add storage and did not make progress on existing technologies. Most important, manufacturing capacity was not added. Today, about 90% of the manufacturing capacity is in one country, mostly dependent on one chemistry, i.e., lithium-ion. This thus raises supply chain challenges, which came to the fore during the Covid-19 pandemic.”
Singh stressed that round-the-clock renewable energy is not possible without storage. He added that while India has emerged as a country with one of the fastest rates of energy transition, the country has been facing challenges due to shortfalls in manufacturing capacity.
The minister said that these issues raise the need for investment and research in alternative chemistries and in building manufacturing capacities. “We need to put our money in researching alternative chemistries, in setting up manufacturing capacities around the world. We in India have decided to do both. We came up with Production Linked Incentive Scheme for setting up manufacturing for polysilicon. By about 2030, we will have about 100 GW of manufacturing capacity for solar modules, out of which about 50 GW will be fully integrated with polysilicon and wafers.”
The ISA President underlined the need to work on improving efficiencies of solar technologies, so that the cost of electricity comes down, which would be especially required for developing countries. “When we began our journey, we used to need 5 acres of land for 1 MW solar, today we require 3.5 acres only. The cost of energy has come down but it will differ from country to country. If efficiency goes up, the cost of electricity will come down, which will be good for developing countries where many cannot pay for electricity,” he added.
The President of the ISA Assembly said that making finances available to developing countries through different instruments is key to ensuring energy transition.  “Large parts of our world just do not have the finance to provide energy access to their people, let alone make energy transition. Until and unless we assist these countries with finance, access and transition are not going to happen.”
The ISA President highlighted the need for developed countries to keep their commitment towards financing green energy projects.

The developer secured around $90 million in green loans and said it would use the debt facility to finance the development of its 150 MW (AC) PV project in Maharashtra. The project will supply power to a global data center player with operations in the state of Maharashtra. 
Radiance Renewables, through its subsidiary, has entered into a 25-year energy supply agreement with the offtaker (data center). 
The project will be delivered in two phases, with the first phase of 50 MW (AC) already nearing completion. Financial closure, through definitive agreements, has already been achieved for both phases of the project.
Radiance Renewables has an operating capacity of nearly 500 MWp and targets to scale it to 2 GWp in the next three years.
The green loan project finance facility of $90 million was jointly arranged by Axis Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. 
“Standard Chartered Bank acted as the sole green loan coordinator, aligning the transaction with the Loan Market Association’s Green Loan Principles and ensuring compliance with IFC Performance Standards and Equator Principles. Axis Bank Ltd acted as the Escrow Bank in the transaction. Catalyst Trusteeship Services Ltd acted as the Facility Agent and Security Trustee for the transaction,” stated Radiance Renewables.
Khaitan & Co. acted as the lender’s legal counsel, while Luthra and Luthra served as the borrower’s counsel. Tractebel Engineering played the role of the lender’s technical advisor and India Insure Risk Management and Insurance Broking Services served as the lender’s insurance agent.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/02/new-us-solar-manufacturers-likely-to-choose-topcon/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023",New US solar manufacturers likely to choose TOPCon,"From pv magazine USA
With a huge volume of tax credits available to clean technology manufacturers under the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the United States is beginning to see an influx of solar module makers setting up shop. While the clock is ticking on the opportunity to take advantage of the tax credits, establishing a vertically integrated facility quickly is no small task.
At the recent RoundtablesUS 23, Jonathan Gifford, editor-in-chief of pv magazine, moderated a panel session that discussed what technologies are best suited to both the rapid rollout and also long-term competitiveness.
The panelists included Exawatt PV Head Alex Barrows, PVEL VP of Sales Tristan Erion-Lorico, DNV Senior Engineer MinWah Leung, and Estuary Power Vice President Kim Primerano.
In the panel on how the IRA is changing the landscape of solar manufacturing in the United States, four experts discussed how realistic it is to reduce our dependence on Chinese imports, what the challenges are for manufacturers in setting up shop in the United States, and how we fill in anticipated gaps in the US supply chain.
Barrows kicked off the next panel session by noting that while a lot of module manufacturing announcements have come out, not all will get built. But he estimates that if every company does what they say they intend to do, we could have 90 GW of module capacity by 2026, 20 GW of cells and potentially 20 GW of wafer.
Clearly the mismatch in capacity leaves US manufacturers beholden to importing cells and wafers, which presents a myriad of challenges, not the least of which is for developers to claim the domestic content adder. Erion-Lorico pointed out that there’s a lot to be done, but that there are challenges remain, ranging from the current transformer shortage to the challenge of hiring skilled workers. Erion-Lorico sees the workforce issue as a huge challenge. He estimates that we’ll need 4,000 to 5,000 people to run 100 GW of plants.
With most announced manufacturing facilities set to produce solar modules, the question is which module technology will be manufactured. DNV’s Leung said that they see TOPCon as the big player. She thinks that heterojunction (HJT) will play a role in the future, but that TOPCon will be “the main technology, at least in the next few years.”
Leung said there are two pieces that DNV looks for in assessing module quality and risk. One is the design of the module –and what the technology risk is in terms of the design of the module. The second piece is the risk in terms of production quality on the manufacturing side. As DNV specializes in assessing risk, she said that it comes down to extended duration testing, which speaks to the design of the module. To assess manufacturing quality DNV also looks at factory audits, production quality, reports, monitoring, and pre inspection reports.
Primerano of Estuary Power said that she is risk averse and doesn’t “usually like to be the first one off the production line.” While Estuary Power is closely monitoring the buildout of U.S. solar manufacturing, the company is not currently modeling domestic content. She noted that if the numbers that Barrows was projecting come true, it’ll result in the prices coming down while driving capacity up. At that point, she said, Estuary Power would start to look at domestically manufactured modules.
In terms of technology choice, however, Primerano said Estuary Power is definitely looking at TOPCon and planning to use it in an upcoming project. Erion-Lorico spoke of what PVEL is finding in its testing. He said both HJT and TOPCon introduce new risks and there’s a range of results, but over time the modules have industry leading low degradation rates. Developing TOPCon is a sensitive process, and the production window is tighter, he said. But they are seeing great results from factories overseas in PID for TOPCon and they’re seeing great results in thermal cycling in HJT. However, he noted that it’s “a wider range that’s going to take time to tighten.”
Another thing we’re starting to see is US-made encapsulants and backsheets, according to Erion-Lorico, which is a result of the push to onshore the whole solar supply chain. He pointed out that this brings risk as well because manufacturers like Trina have long relationships with materials suppliers, they know how the materials will perform. And yet, to get to that 40% domestic content, some manufacturers will be looking to source materials from new US manufacturing lines.

Still, solar accounted for only 11.5% of the overall energy investment in 2022 ($2.6 trillion), according to the Solar Investment Report released by the International Solar Alliance (ISA) at its sixth assembly in New Delhi.
The report stated that solar investments are overwhelmingly concentrated in a few developed countries in the Asia Pacific Region, followed by Europe and North America. In 2022, Asia Pacific and Europe and North America accounted for 55% and 33% of global solar project development investment, respectively. Within these regions, investments have been dominated by economies that have a mature solar PV market, such as China, the United States of America (USA), Japan, Spain, Australia, the Netherlands, South Korea, Brazil, Vietnam, Germany, and India. 
China and USA have been consistently attracting the most annual solar investments, with their combined share of about 50% of all solar investments since 2015. Only a small fraction of global investments in the solar sector is being made in emerging and developing economies such as the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Thus, these regions are lagging behind in the race of solar energy deployment.
The report states that to accelerate global investments in solar energy, it is vital to prioritize these developing and underdeveloped regions across the world that have a huge unrealized solar potential.
Solar project development accounted for nearly 90% of the total investments made across the solar value chain in 2022. Segment wise, utility-scale solar segment accounted for the highest investments in solar project deployment with a share of 43% followed by residential solar segment at 39% and commercial & industrial (C&I) solar segment at 18% in 2022.
Private finance was a major contributor to solar energy projects, accounting for more than 80% of total investments between 2015 and 2022. The public sector contributed to the remaining investments during the same period. 
The report states that for ensuring just energy transition and inclusion, more finance needs to be mobilized from public players as most of the private financing is directed towards advanced economies.

Solar PV capacity, in particular, needs to hit at least 5,400 GW by 2030 – a 4,345 GW increase from 2022, IRENA said in the report.
The Paris Agreement, dubbed by the United Nations as a “legally binding international treaty on climate change”, was adopted by 196 countries and enforced in 2016. The goal is to hold the global average temperature increase to below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.
IRENA said in the report that as it currently stands the deployment of energy transition technologies is “insufficient” to achieving Paris Agreement goals. An acceleration of renewable energy deliverables over the next decade is crucial to determining whether global warming can be limited to 1.5 C, the document said.
“Global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from the record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022,” the report said. The pathway to achieving this is the “urgent” increase in variable renewable energy (VRE) in electricity generation from 10% in 2021 to 46% by 2030.
The acceleration would need to cover energy supply, end-use sectors and technology. It would also involve the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions, the report said.
Wind installation figures need to reach 3,500 GW – comprising 3,040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore – to limit warming to 1.5 C. This is 2,141 GW more than what was recorded in 2022. Hydropower also needs to grow by almost 17% from 2022 levels, reaching 1,465 GW, the report said.
IRENA acknowledges different countries and regions will deploy renewable energy generation at varying speeds, with barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential and market maturity affecting the pace of development. The global PV market will also be dominated by G20 countries in the next decade, the report said, and they will need to reach 4,530 GW installed capacity. Non-G20 countries must surpass 900 GW by 2030.
The report, titled “Tripling Renewable Power and Doubling Energy Efficiency by 2030: Crucial Steps Towards 1.5 C,” was published online this week.
