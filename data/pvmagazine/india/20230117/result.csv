This collaboration marks Asia’s first planned hydrogen-powered mining truck.
The demonstration project will be led by AEL, a company focused on both mining operations and developing green hydrogen projects for sourcing, transporting, and building out hydrogen refueling infrastructure.
Ballard, a PEM fuel cell engine manufacturer, will supply the FCmove fuel cell engine for the hydrogen truck. Ashok Leyland will provide the vehicle platform and technical support. The FCET is scheduled to be launched in India this year.
The Adani Group plans to invest more than $50 billion over the next ten years in green hydrogen and associated ecosystems corresponding to a capacity of up to 3 million tons of green hydrogen annually.
Vinay Prakash, director of Adani Enterprises Limited, and CEO of Adani Natural Resources, said, “This pioneering and ambitious green hydrogen project holds a strong promise for India’s future energy self-reliance… This experience of handling hydrogen as a fuel for commercial fleet not only prepones the advent of hydrogen technology for the mining and logistics sector in the country but will also enable other businesses to opt for long-term sustainable solutions transitioning fleets in ports, airports, and in their industrial operations.”
The hydrogen-powered mining truck will weigh 55 tons. It will be powered by Ballard’s 120 kW PEM fuel cell technology, have three hydrogen tanks, and support a 200km working range.

The project will supply 23.5 million units of clean energy annually to some of UP’s largest corporations at an attractive price, enabling savings of over 30% on power expenses. It will help to offset 20,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, said the company.
The solar plant injects power at the 132/33 kV Uttar Pradesh Power Transmission Corp. Ltd (UPPTCL) substation in Kabrai through a 33kV connection.  The plant is built with 470 Wp modules and string inverters and is spread across 54 acres of land.

Tripura has only 16.67 MW of installed solar power capacity as on December 31, 2022, which includes 5 MW ground-mount, 4.78 MW rooftop, and 6.89 MW off-grid installations.
This MoU sets the stage for the development of large-sized renewable energy projects in the state of Tripura and shall help the state government in meeting its clean energy commitments and obligations.

“Multiple units of the 200 kWh battery system can be connected to build MWh-scale energy storage system for use in on-grid and off-grid applications in the commercial and industrial utility space,” founder Vishal Mittal told pv magazine. 
“The battery system is based on vanadium redox chemistry and is built for outdoor use with integrated power electronics and controls solution.”
Mittal said the first set of units is getting ready for dispatch to the US and Australia. In addition to a standalone DC flow battery system, the RFB200 series also comes as a completely integrated AC system with inverter and switchgear and as a hybrid battery system (combining flow and Lithium or other power batteries).

The off-taker will procure power from this solar park on a captive basis, powering their manufacturing facility in the state. 
The project is expected to generate over 1.3 TWh of clean energy during its lifetime, which amounts to a reduction of around 1,221 kilotonnes of CO2 emissions. 
Cleantech Solar installed the plant on a turnkey basis, with the fully operational solar project being designed, financed, built, as well as operated and maintained by the developer throughout the term of the agreement. 
Cleantech Solar is headquartered in Singapore and has deployed solar power plants across India and Southeast Asia, totaling over 750 MW across the various stages of operations and construction with many more under development. The portfolio includes installations in India, Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Swiss startup Sun-Ways is currently developing PV systems that can be placed between railroad tracks. It is working on a project that is scheduled to go online in May 2023. It consists of a mechanically detachable PV plant that will occupy a track section owned by Swiss railway operator Transports Publics Neuchâtelois SA.
The company developed the mechanical concept in cooperation with the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Swiss innovation agency Innosuisse. It said the PV system can be pre-assembled in a factory and then loaded onto a special train. The solar modules are then rolled out like a carpet between the tracks. The PV system can also be removed at any time to enable maintenance work.
If the solution works, the potential in Switzerland alone is enormous, the company said, noting that the country has a railway network spanning almost 7,000 kilometers. Up to 1 TWh of solar power could be generated in this way, it claimed.
