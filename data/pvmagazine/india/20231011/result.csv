The acquisition expands Birla Carbon’s presence in the energy systems market by providing it expertise in materials critical to Lithium-ion battery performance along with other conductive applications.
Nanocyl, founded in 2002 in Belgium, is a leader in the development, manufacturing, and sales of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and MWCNT-based formulated products. Its products are used for electrical conductivity or dissipative behavior in electronic, transportation, energy storage, and industrial applications.
Nanocyl’s carbon nanotubes provide unique performance characteristics for a wide range of applications, most notably energy systems such as lithium-ion batteries.
Laurent Kosbach, chief executive officer of Nanocyl, stated that Birla Carbon’s R&D expertise, portfolio of products, and market experience will enable Nanocyl and its products to reach their full growth potential”.
Along with the Conductex family of conductive carbon black additives and active anode materials, the inclusion of Nanocyl’s advanced MWCNTs provides Birla Carbon with a remarkable range of solutions for conductive applications.
In November last year, Birla Carbon announced  its collaborative project to develop biocrude-derived graphite for lithium-ion batteries. The company collaborated with NC State University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Ensyn, The Battery Innovation Center (BIC), and Yale University to develop and scale up the production of biocrude-derived graphite.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/11/how-women-are-driving-the-sustainable-energy-transition/,"EMPLOYMENT,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"OCTOBER 11, 2023",How women are driving the sustainable energy transition,"The global pursuit of a sustainable energy transition, aimed at the pivotal shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, is a movement that has garnered considerable attention in recent years. While numerous influential figures have spearheaded this transformation, there exists a cohort of unsung heroes whose remarkable contributions often remain obscured from the limelight: women. Their multifaceted endeavors, though often understated, stand as cornerstones in propelling the sustainable energy transition into the future.
Traditionally, the energy sector has been predominantly characterized by male domination, with women consistently finding themselves underrepresented and grappling with myriad barriers. According to the latest research report published by the World Economic Forum in 2022, a striking statistic emerges, revealing that merely one in five leadership positions within the energy industry is currently held by women. Alas, the energy sector persists as one of the least gender-diverse domains, underscoring the urgency of rectifying this stark imbalance. It is imperative to recognize that women now assume pivotal roles as catalysts of inclusivity and innovation, propelling the sustainable energy transition.
Herein lies a compendium of how women stand at the forefront of steering the energy sector towards a sustainable future:
Many women, particularly in developing nations, have initiated grassroots movements fervently advocating for the adoption of clean energy solutions. Their keen comprehension of the immediate ramifications of climate change and energy poverty, especially upon women and children, galvanized them to seek sustainable remedies.
Some leading women in the given context are Heidi Binko (supporting the green energy movement by working with coal communities, both in the U.S. and internationally), Angie Fyfe (Executive Director of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA, Fyfe is dedicated to helping U.S. local governments address climate change and build healthy, equitable and resilient communities), and more.
Women are progressively ascending to leadership roles within renewable energy enterprises, research institutions, and policy-making bodies. Their unique perspectives and innovative approaches invariably inject fresh solutions into the discourse.
The renewable energy sector has several exemplary examples of women leaders, including Vibha Dhawan (Director General at The Energy and Resources Institute TERI), Gauri Singh (Deputy Director General at the International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA), and Mahua Acharya (former CEO at EESL Convergence).
Women activists and leaders like Mani Khurana (World Bank) and Rashi Gupta (Founder of Vision Mechatronics) have emerged as instrumental architects in shaping energy policies, with a fervent emphasis on inclusivity, equity, and sustainability. Their unwavering voices are pivotal in ensuring that policies are meticulously tailored to meet the needs of all individuals, with special consideration for marginalized groups.
At the vanguard of cutting-edge renewable energy technologies, numerous women scientists and engineers are pushing the boundaries of what is feasible, particularly in the realms of solar, wind, and other renewable sectors.
Women educators, journalists, and influencers assume an indispensable role in heightening public awareness about the critical significance of sustainable energy. Their tireless efforts ensure that communities are well-informed and empowered to make decisions that conduce to environmental well-being.
Across diverse global landscapes, countless women entrepreneurs have taken the reins in establishing sustainable energy enterprises. These initiatives provide clean energy solutions and serve as pivotal sources of job opportunities within their respective communities.
By active and sustained participation in the energy sector, women are effectively challenging and transcending traditional gender roles, thereby narrowing the longstanding gender divide. Their involvement fosters a diverse and inclusive landscape in the realm of energy transition.
Women frequently adopt a holistic perspective, discerning the intricate interconnectedness of myriad issues. They perceive sustainable energy not merely as an environmental imperative but also as a conduit for improving broader societal facets, including health, education, and economic outcomes.
The sustainable energy transition transcends the ambit of technological change; it is, fundamentally, a societal transformation. Women, constituting half of the global population, assume an unequivocally vital role in this paradigm shift. Acknowledging and actively supporting their indomitable contributions is not merely a matter of equity but an irrefutable prerequisite for the triumph of the worldwide sustainable energy movement. As the world journeys inexorably toward a greener future, it remains paramount to illuminate and extol these oft-overlooked, yet resolute, emerging heroes.

Airtouch Solar India is the India arm of Airtouch Solar Group, an Israel-based developer of cleaning equipment for utility-scale solar PV plants. It recently launched Airtouch AT 4.0, its latest autonomous, water-free surface cleaning solution to prevent dust and soiling from affecting PV power generation.
Airtouch is already winning contracts for the solution, such as a $2.5 million deal with Adani Green Energy and a $8.5 million agreement with ReNew.
Like earlier solutions, the new Airtouch model is a robotic solution, operating autonomously. It is typically installed in arid and dusty locations. It uses airflow and microfiber wipers to remove soil from the PV module surfaces rather than water.
The latest version is designed to provide greater cleaning efficiency and better maneuverability, according to Airtouch Solar. It is a 4-meter cleaning unit that weighs less than 40 kg.
Airtouch operates two production centers – in Israel and India. The company operates, manufactures, and sells its products and services in Israel and India and is exploring new markets, mainly the US.
