The off-takers include Cadila Healthcare (1.7 MW), Ginni Filaments (1.2 MW), Palsana Enviro Protection Limited (3 MW), Pratibha Fabrics (1 MW), Sachin Paper Mills (0.60 MW), Yes Fashions (1.25 MW), United Phosphorous Limited (1.2 MW), United Phosphorous Limited (1.40 MW) and Super Deluxe Paper Mills (1.80 MW). 
KPI added 25.762 MW as an independent power producer in the year 2019-20, up 172% from the previous year—taking the cumulative capacity to 40.762 MW. The developer’s cumulative ‘captive mode’ portfolio stood at 6.2 MW.
In August last year, it announced the sanctioning of an INR 107.50-crore debt funding by Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC) for an aggregate 35 MW solar capacity.
Of the approved funding, KPI intended to use INR 31.50 crore to refinance its existing 15 MW plant earlier financed by State Bank of India and INR 76 crore towards setting up a new 20 MW power project at Bharuch in Gujarat.

As the energy demand swells, the nation’s combined import bill for fossil fuels would triple over this period, with oil making up by far the largest component of the total, according to a new report released today by the International Energy Agency.
The report, titled The India Energy Outlook 2021, looks at how best India can meet that swelling energy demand without adding to costly energy imports, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. 
The report says India has the tremendous opportunity to successfully meet its citizens’ aspirations without following the high-carbon pathway that other economies have pursued in the past.
It proposes a model for low-carbon, inclusive growth under Sustainable Development Scenario that leads India towards net-zero emissions in the mid‐2060s while ensuring energy security for the nation. 
Sustainable path
The report notes that India is already a global leader in solar power – and solar combined with batteries will play a massive part in India’s energy future. But, it says, India will need a whole host of technologies and policies to chart a sustainable path for energy security as within 20 years, the majority of India’s emissions, under stated policy settings, would come from power plants, industrial facilities, buildings and vehicles that do not exist today. 
Based on India’s current policy settings, it projects nearly 60% of the nation’s CO2 emissions in the late 2030s from infrastructure and machines that do not exist today. 
While the nation’s policy is already geared towards promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, the report highlights that, under the more sustainable course, the nation would need to address the critical challenge of the industrial sector through efforts like more widespread electrification of processes, greater material, and energy efficiency, the use of technologies like carbon capture, and a switch to progressively lower-carbon fuels. 
Electrification, efficiency, and fuel switching are also the main tools for the transport sector, alongside a determined move to build more sustainable infrastructure and shift more freight onto India’s soon-to-be-electrified railways. These transformations – on a scale no country has achieved in history – require huge advances in innovation, strong partnerships and vast amounts of capital, the report adds.
Cost to benefits 
The report estimates that under the sustainable development scenario, India would need $1.4 trillion of additional funding for clean energy technologies over the next 20 years (2019-40)—an amount 70% higher than in a scenario based on its current policy settings.
It states the nation would need “a huge reallocation of capital in the sustainable development scenario in favour of low‐carbon fuels and technologies, with solar and wind alone attracting an average of $35 billion investment spending per year in the period 2030‐40, an almost threefold increase on today’s levels. Renewable integration challenges also call for far more spending on electricity networks.”
“The additional investment needed is, however, offset by reduced spending on oil due to transportation electrification and tighter efficiency standards: this translates into a 15% fall in India’s oil imports and a consequent saving between 2019 and 2040 of $1.4 trillion compared with that in the stated policy settings,” it adds.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/09/energetica-unveils-solar-modules-with-gapless-tech/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"FEBRUARY 9, 2021",Energetica unveils solar modules with gapless tech,"From pv magazine International
Austrian PV module manufacturer Energetica has revealed that it will soon begin producing solar modules based on gapless technology, which raises the density of panels by eliminating the empty spaces between the cells. It claims that it can achieve higher module efficiencies when the cell gaps in the strings are eliminated.
The 132-half-cell “e.Gapless M HC” modules will be available with power outputs of 400 W and 425 W. The format barely differs from standard modules with 60 full cells, despite the higher performance, the manufacturer said. The new panels will be built on its own patented 12-busbar technology and will be available from the fourth quarter of this year.
“The gapless technology is another important innovation in photovoltaic module construction and Energetica is part of this technical avant-garde of selected manufacturers,” said Energetica CEO Rene Battistutti.
Energetica claims it will be the first European module maker to commercially offer modules with this technology. “With the new gapless technology, which we have been testing for more than two years, we are setting another milestone in the efficiency of our photovoltaic modules,” it said.
It plans to build a gigawatt-scale production facility in Liebenfels, Austria. Its innovations include its Smartflower products. It plans to manufacture components for the Smartflower line in Liebenfels.
