This will include INR 5.5-6 trillion into setting up 115-125 GW of renewable energy capacity (considering plant load factor in the range of 23-25%) to power hydrogen production. The remaining INR 3-3.5 trillion is required to build 35-40 GW of electrolyzer requirement (with plant efficiency in the range of 75-80%), according to a new analysis by ICRA.
Successful implementation of the Mission will result in a 3-8% decline in imports of petroleum and coal products. Further, 50 MMT per annum of CO2 emissions is expected to be averted due to the adoption of the Green Hydrogen Mission.
The National Green Hydrogen Mission targets the development of a green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT per annum by 2030 with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country. The initial outlay for the mission is INR 197 billion.

The manufacturing line has an initial cell production capacity of 50 MWh and will produce LTO and LFP chemistry cells. 
The company said it has indigenously developed 2.3V, 50 Ah TiB LTO cells with an energy density of 100 Wh/kg, a 33% boost over what’s commercially available today, and a 3.2V, 55 Ah TiB LFP cell with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg, a 14% boost in energy density.
Log9 said its cell line will adhere to the advanced formation protocol that will allow it to decrease the processing time by 40%, decrease the equipment dependency by 35%, and cut down the cost per kWh by 6%. 
The company’s facility will roll out large-form cylindrical cells ranging from 22 series to 66 series to suit different vehicles. 
Log9 Materials CEO, Akshay Singhal said their cells are designed from the ground up in India, for India, to suit the unique operating conditions, climate, and customer needs of the nation. The company plans further expansion of the capacity.

Chinese battery giant CATL has unveiled a new ultra-high energy battery technology initially slated for aviation, and with an automotive cell under development.
The so-called “condensed matter” battery, a type of semi-solid state product with condensed electrolyte and new anode and separator materials, will have an energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg.
At the launch ceremony at the Shanghai auto show, Wu Kai, CATL’s chief scientist, said the company was working with unspecified partners to ensure the battery is qualified for aviation use in terms of safety and quality. CATL will also be able to start mass production of the condensed matter battery for electric vehicle uses later this year, Wu added.
The new battery leverages highly conductive biomimetic condensed state electrolytes to improve the conductive performance of the cells and in turn the efficiency of lithium-ion transport, while also boosting the stability of the microstructure.
The condensed matter battery is said to integrate “a range of innovative technologies, including the ultra-high energy density cathode materials, innovative anode materials, separators, and manufacturing processes, offering excellent charge and discharge performance as well as good safety performance,” CATL said.
However, no information has been revealed about the cost of the new cells, or the materials required to make them. A few other specifications, such as charging efficiency, charge/discharge rate, safety ranges, and life cycles, were also missing.
The Chinese battery manufacturer, which produced 37% of the world’s electric-vehicle batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries in 2022 for a grand total of 289 GWh, has made groundbreaking product announcements in recent years.
In 2021, CATL rolled out its first generation sodium-ion battery with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation. Earlier this week, it confirmed that Chinese Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
In 2022, CATL unveiled Qilin battery, the third generation of its cell-to-pack technology, claiming the highest integration level to date. With a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg, Qilin is capable of delivering a range of over 1,000 km and equating to a five-minute hot start and ten minutes of charging to get from 10-80% state of charge.
The series production of Qilin started in March this year. These batteries have already been used in multiple electric vehicles from ZEEKR, AITO, Li Auto, and Geely.
On Tuesday, CATL also announced its targets to achieve carbon neutrality with all its battery manufacturing plants by 2025, and across its battery value chain by 2035.
To achieve this, the company will focus on reducing CO2 emissions in five key areas: mining, raw materials, battery materials, battery manufacturing and battery systems. “For CATL, achieving carbon neutrality is our responsibility, demonstrates our capability, and opens up more opportunities,” said CATL Board Secretary Jiang Li.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/24/plug-and-play-pv-system-for-garden-fences/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"APRIL 24, 2023",Plug-and-play PV system for garden fences,"From pv magazine Global
Green Akku, a German supplier of solar modules for balconies, is now offering ZaunPV (fencePV), a plug-in PV system that can be easily mounted on garden fences.
The company supplies a complete set with selected solar modules, inverters, and special brackets, at a retail price of €416.81 ($456.3), plus shipping costs. The zero tax rate for residential PV is applied to end customers, while distributors have to pay the usual 19% value-added tax rate, according to Green Akku.
The PV system can be attached vertically to fences. It generates a higher amount of solar power, even when the sun is low and in winter. With manual skills, the plug-and-play system can also be installed on other types of fences. The inverters can then be connected directly to home networks via a safety plug.
Green Akku says the “ZaunPV” systems are designed for installation on garden fences, without the need for permits. In addition, it offers all materials needed to mount the systems on fences.
Green Akku recommends attaching the modules to fences that are positioned in south or east-west directions. Solar power is mainly produced in the morning and evening, when it can also be used directly in homes. With a southern orientation, the PV systems produce large amounts of solar power, especially during the middle of the day.
