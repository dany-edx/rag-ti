This narrative explores India’s burgeoning solar industry as a beacon of self-sufficiency and environmental stewardship, capturing a remarkable journey. The dawn of Independence Day shines a light on a drive for energy sovereignty, with the solar sector at the forefront. It represents a commitment to forging a resilient future, symbolizing progress, economic growth, energy independence, and a greener world.
India’s march towards an economy poised to hit a $1 trillion manufacturing value by 2025 is a testament to its progress. Flourishing sectors including energy, steel, fertilizer, cement, and refineries have thrived, fuelled by recent reforms and policies. Amidst this momentum, one sector has emerged as crucial for transformative change—one that marries economic growth with environmental consciousness. The promise of a clean energy transition offered by the solar industry has placed it at the heart of India’s sustainable journey.
India’s leadership in the green revolution has been a significant factor in its sustainable development. The country has made substantial strides in sustainable agriculture, improving food security, and reducing poverty. The green revolution has also paved the way for India’s solar manufacturing industry, providing a foundation for sustainable energy production.
In recent years, India’s solar industry has seen remarkable growth, with its installed solar capacity skyrocketing from a mere 10 MW in 2010 to an impressive 70.01 GW by June 2023. This achievement not only includes surpassing its Nationally Determined Contributions target ahead of schedule, but also securing a prominent fourth global ranking in solar power generation. This growth can be attributed to several key factors that drive India’s renewable energy journey.
The leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been instrumental in shaping a future-ready India. Policies crafted to align with industry needs and foreign investment inflows have laid the foundation for solar industry growth.
The imposition of Basic Customs Duty (BCD) and the enhanced Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme have invigorated the industry’s potential. A total integrated capacity of 8,737 MW was allocated under Tranche-I of the Scheme in November-December 2022. When considering both tranches, the domestic solar PV module manufacturing capacity allocated under the PLI Scheme totals 48,337 MW, with cumulative support of ₹18,500 crore by the Government.
Innovative strides in solar technology are reshaping the energy landscape. Floating PV panels are harnessing solar energy while optimizing space, finding homes on water reservoirs like the expansive 48-acre installation in Tamil Nadu. This approach not only boosts electricity production through cooler panels but also curtails maintenance expenses.
Another breakthrough, half-cell technology, slices solar cells into halves, enhancing electron flow efficiency. With reduced resistance, these modules boast greater durability, especially under high heat conditions, ensuring sustained performance and resistance to panel malfunction.
India’s trajectory toward a sustainable energy landscape is marked by an astonishing rise in solar power. As of December 2022, the cumulative Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India’s renewable sector was $12.47 billion (INR 1 trillion). The total FDI inflows received in FY 2023, which includes equity inflows, reinvested earnings, and other capital sources, amounted to $70.97 billion – a decrease from the $84.83 billion recorded during FY 2022.
The real testament lies in the colossal leap from a mere 10 MW of installed solar capacity in 2010 to an impressive 70.01 GW AC as of June 2023. Solar power generation in India ranked fourth globally in 2021.
In conclusion, it’s evident that the Indian government is actively steering the nation towards a sustainable and environmentally-conscious energy future. However, this juncture calls for a strategic alignment of protective measures to ensure their intended outcomes, notably reducing India’s reliance on energy imports and positioning the nation as a global hub for solar manufacturing.
Accelerating the growth of a domestic solar equipment-manufacturing ecosystem emerges as the pivotal pathway to materialize the vision of a self-reliant India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/15/prices-of-chinas-pv-upstream-segments-rise-module-prices-hold-steady-amid-bearish-sentiments/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 15, 2023","Prices of China’s PV upstream segments rise, module prices hold steady amid bearish sentiments","China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon price in the country, increased for a fifth week running, edging up 0.95% to CNY69.29 ($9.58)/kg. China’s polysilicon notches up toward the psychologically significant figure of CNY70/kg in a week that saw higher price quotes and lower-than-expected polysilicon output.

The main reason for lower output is the expected maintenance of polysilicon factories during the summer, explained one source. The unexpected reason affecting output is the reduced pace at which overall production capacity is increasing, the source added. Current polysilicon prices mean companies have “no incentive to burn money and speed up” the rate at which they increase production capacity, he further explained.
Wafer prices increased this week as polysilicon prices upstream keep rising and wafer demand from cell manufacturers downstream remains high. Mono M10 wafer prices climbed slightly by 1.11% week to week to $0.364 per piece (pc).
The demand for wafers is being ensured by downstream cell producers’ strong operating rates, according to sources. Additionally, there has been an upward trend in the price of cells, which in turn supports the rise in wafer prices.
The price of Mono M10 cells increased as well this week, rising 0.32% week to week to $0.0942 per W. The low inventory of cells and the high demand for cells from module producers are what keep the price of cells strong. Given that high cell prices haven’t yet stopped module manufacturers from placing orders for cells or resulted in lower operating rates for module factories, a source even predicts additional price increases for cells.
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for Mono PERC modules from China, held steady for a second week running at $0.163 per W in a market where participants continue to weigh the difficulty of raising module prices against growing upstream costs. The price of TOPCon modules likewise stayed at $0.170/W for a second consecutive week.
Concerns about the intense competition in the module market recurred during OPIS’ weekly survey. The production capacity of modules continues to expand, with “the fight over price being very serious” as many new entrants try to quickly expand their market share and existing companies seek to increase their performance growth requirements, according to one source.
Demand fluctuates in different ways depending on the export market in question but generally speaking, China exported too many modules in the first half of the year, according to a market veteran who added that module inventories are building and will keep doing so as China continues exporting a large amount of modules in the third quarter. This accumulated inventory will only decrease at the beginning of the fourth quarter, he also said.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
