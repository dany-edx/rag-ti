U.S.-based wafer maker 1366 Technologies and U.S.-based solar technology company Hunt Perovskite Technologies (HPT) have merged their respective business into a new company called CubicPV.
The two companies said in a joint statement that the move is aimed at combining the best of their technologies, to achieve multi-junction solar cells with efficiencies of around 30%. “In a tandem structure, the bottom layer produces one-third of the device’s energy but still carries 100% of the production cost,” they stated. “It is here where the direct wafer cost advantage is essential.”
1366 Technologies has developed a kerfless wafer production technique that does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers and forms wafers directly, using molten silicon. HPT has so far been granted 18 patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and 30 additional patents by various foreign patent offices. These patents relate to a manufacturing process to produce printed metal halide perovskite photovoltaic (PV) devices.
The new entity will receive $25 million in funding from Texas-based investor Hunt Energy Enterprises LLC (HEE), U.S. thin-film manufacturer First Solar Inc. and Bill Gates-owned Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), among others. “Our singular direct wafer process is the crucial advantage in making tandem modules a reality and with the HPT merger we have the blueprint for achieving economically-viable tandem solutions for terawatt-scale,” said 1366 Technologies CEO, Frank van Mierlo.
More details on how the two technologies will be integrated were not provided.

The PV plant will come up in the Purwa village of Jharkua Gram Panchayat (village council). The work of allotment, demarcation, and possession of the land for the plant has been completed. Drones were used to take the site map.
The State government is planning to start the project at the earliest. The tender inviting developers will be issued by November, and the developer selection process will be completed by January 2022. The solar power plant installation is planned for completion by March 2023.
Deepak Saxena, Deputy Secretary, New and Renewable Energy Department of the state, and other officials conducted the site inspection for setting up the solar power plant recently. Before the site inspection, he discussed the initial preparations for the solar power plant and the land allotment.    
The plant will employ about 8,000 people during its construction phase. Around 1,500-2,000 will get employment on a regular basis after the plant becomes operational.

The LOC Agreement to this effect was signed by the representatives of the two countries recently.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Togo had just 3 MW of solar generation capacity at the end of 2020. However, under the National Development Plan (NDP), its government is aiming for universal access to electricity this decade and for half of its power to come from clean energy sources.
With the US$40 million finance, EXIM Bank, to date, has extended five Lines of Credit to the Government of Togo, on behalf of the Government of India, taking the total value of LOCs extended to US$ 150.10 million. 
The LOCs extended to Togo cover projects in rural electrification, farming, transmission lines, and solar energy. 
Exim Bank now has 274 Lines of Credit, covering 62 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the CIS, with credit commitments of around US$ 26.98 billion, available for financing exports from India. Besides promoting India’s exports, Exim Bank’s LOCs demonstrate Indian expertise and project execution capabilities in emerging markets.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/29/new-renewables-cheaper-than-legacy-coal-or-gas-for-almost-half-the-worlds-population/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RACKING,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JUNE 29, 2021",New renewables cheaper than legacy coal or gas for almost half the world’s population,"From pv magazine International
The latest report into electricity generation costs compiled by analyst BloombergNEF has claimed 46% of the world’s population – including power users in China, India, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece – can have lower bills from newly installed solar and wind farms than from already-running coal and gas-fired facilities.
That was just one of the headline-grabbing insights in a 1H 2021 LCOE Update which posited the carbon price in China will rise to around $50 per ton in mid century; stated solar became cheaper than coal in Vietnam and Thailand in the first half of the year; that receding solar panel glass costs are mitigating a rising polysilicon price; and cited rapid solar wafer manufacturing build-out as the main cause of the rampant poly price, rather than more high-profile events such as factory explosions.
The advent of bigger solar projects – up to an average 50 MW this year – and bigger, more powerful and more costly modules is helping prevent rising solar manufacturer material costs from having a big effect on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from solar during 2021, according to the analyst.
BNEF has calculated a 5.2% rise in the average solar module cost this year, to $0.23/W – thanks to more hefty price tags for bigger panels and a rise in the cost of aluminum frames – will translate into a global, average solar LCOE of $48/MWh for fixed-axis panels and $38/MWh for sites featuring single-axis trackers. Those two figures would represent rises of 1% and 4% on last year’s numbers, respectively, according to the analyst, which also stated the fixed-axis cost can be as low as $26/MWh in India this year and $35 in China, and as high as $125 in Japan. In the U.S. market, the analyst reported, single-axis tracker PV now undercuts combined-cycle gas turbines, with an LCOE of $39.80/MWh.
The report noted, however, panel price rises of around 7% in China since the second half of last year, and of 10% in India.
With BNEF expecting the monocrystalline solar panels which accounted for 85% of last year’s global market to offer an average 20.5% conversion efficiency this year – against 17.6% for cheaper, multicrystalline products – the analyst has forecast the average PV project this year will feature 400-550 W-rated panels offering an average conversion efficiency of 20.1%.
The lowest LCOE figures recorded this year are in the $22-29/MWh range in Chile, India, the UAE, China, Brazil and Spain, said BloombergNEF in a report subtitled: Rising commodity prices start biting to perhaps also reflect inflationary effects on other clean energy technologies, such as the knock-on effect of steel costs on wind turbine makers.
Despite such input pressures on solar manufacturers, BNEF noted the capital cost of PV projects in Chile and Brazil has fallen 5% this year, to $680,000 and $760,000/MW, with the former figure now on a par with the set-up costs in mature European solar markets.
As far as solar auctions are concerned, BNEF recorded 42 GW of capacity had solar electricity tariffs set by such procurement rounds last year with solar and wind projects set to come online next year and in 2023 commissioned on the back of bids ranging from $17-70/MWh.
The expected LCOE for solar compares favorably with the analyst’s estimates for new, carbon capture and storage (CCS)-equipped coal power plants ($133-449/MWh) and gas projects ($156-336/MWh), although the study notes unabated coal-fired power still rules on price in Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines this year.
Green hydrogen-fueled gas plants would carry a hefty LCOE of $293-535/MWh, according to the report, although that figure could come in to $82-134 in Europe, India and Japan by mid century if renewables-powered hydrogen can be produced for less than $1/kg.
The document, published on Wednesday, reported a polysilicon price up 198% since May last year, to $21.70/kg but added, each $4/kg rise in the cost of the solar panel feedstock typically only raises module prices one cent per Watt.
Examining the role carbon prices will have on the levelized cost of energy, BNEF has estimated an unambitious charge of $3 per ton of carbon emitted in China, in 2030, will rise to $40/ton in 2040 and $50 in mid century, if a carbon market concerned with 14% of global CO2 emissions is to help achieve carbon neutrality in the nation by 2060.
The analyst expects the carbon price in Europe to rise from around $50 this year to $111 by the end of the decade.
