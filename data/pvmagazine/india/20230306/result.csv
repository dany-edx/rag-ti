The stainless-steel manufacturer has identified roofs of various shop floors at both the units for these plants. It will make an overall investment of more than INR 120 crore into installing the rooftop solar capacity.
Both projects are scheduled to be completed by March 2024.
The company expects the two rooftop solar plants to generate about 795 million units of electricity, with a carbon abatement potential of 5,64,450 tonnes in a life span of 25 years. “In addition to the environmental benefits, these rooftop solar plants will also save 108 acres of land that would have been used if the plant was located on the ground,” it said.
Jindal Stainless’ Hisar unit has already commissioned rooftop solar projects of 4.1 MWp, capable of generating 110.7 million units of electricity and reducing 78,597 tonnes of CO2 emission.
The company targets net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It is India’s first stainless steel company to install a green hydrogen plant at Hisar. The company reduced its carbon emissions by 1.4 lakh tonnes in FY22. Recently, it also signed a contract with ReNew Power to develop a utility-scale captive renewable energy project for its plant in Jajpur. This project will generate 700 million units per year using solar and wind power generation technologies.

The inter-state transmission project is built with an investment of Rs 2,024 crore. It connects the 765/400 kV substation at Lakadia to Vadodara through a 335km long 765 kV double-circuit transmission line. 
“With 812 towers spanning seven districts in Gujarat, this power transmission corridor is also one of the largest transmission corridors built in India to date. Additionally, it forms a critical part of the world’s largest 30 GW hybrid renewable energy park coming up in Kutch,” stated Sterlite Power.
Sterlite Power has a portfolio of 30 completed, sold, and under-construction projects covering approximately 14,602 circuit km of transmission lines across India and Brazil. The company has a portfolio of high-performance power conductors, extra-high voltage (EHV) cables, and optical ground wires.
