Ketan Chitnis: From the series of latest announcements from the power ministry, it’s evident that the Government has realized the significance of energy storage for the growth of the nation. The production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme takes care of the global competitiveness till we attain consumptions that can be competitive for manufacturing.
The Minister of Power has announced the requirement of 4 GWh grid-scale storage across India. This is followed by the requirement estimation of 23 GWh in Leh and Ladakh, and 18 GWh in Rajasthan for renewable integration.
We can see the echoes of the same from various agencies like Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), NTPC, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) on immediate Expression of Interest (EOI) and RFQs. So we are bullish on these initiatives.
The decision to invest in manufacturing is not guided by any particular segment but the overall demand side. There are a lot of other segments apart from grid-scale storage like telecom, microgrids, UPS, DG offset, and small energy storage systems that are showing a significant demand. So, there would be viability for setting up a big manufacturing capacity in the near future.
The government has launched the Production-linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for advanced chemistry cell gigafabs. Between stationary energy storage and electric vehicle batteries, which application is more appealing for investment?
The recent announcement by the center on the much-awaited PLI scheme for the manufacturing of advanced chemistry cells (ACC) is a welcome move that will provide the necessary impetus to players in the sector.
With a budgetary outlay of INR 18,100 crore, the PLI scheme will help in setting up giga-scale factories, promoting exports, achieving economies of scale, and producing cutting-edge high-quality globally competitive products. Most importantly, it will help to create the next wave of job growth in the energy sector.
Additionally, as per the surveys this year, the market for stationary energy storage is higher than electric vehicles. Today, India is at a crucial stage in its transformative journey towards creating an e-mobility ecosystem, a stationary energy storage market, and a better renewable integration system.
Establishing domestic manufacturing capabilities is essential for the cost reduction of the product. Better manufacturing capabilities will be an essential enabler towards accelerating the adoption of electric mobility in the country.
Being associated with a market leader in the sector and with the capability we possess to design, manufacture, operate, and maintain large-scale energy storage system projects, PLI tender is definitely something we’re interested in.
We have our sights set on participating in as many opportunities as possible to maintain our market leadership position. However, when it comes to decisions about which tenders to participate in, it is always a strategic decision-making process and it depends on that particular tender, its economics, and the risk analysis involved.
Is the domestic ecosystem ripe enough to support the manufacturing of battery storage?
As we understand it, the ecosystem will develop in conjunction with consumption, and we are confident that the Indian manufacturing industry can become a part of the larger global battery energy storage market.
There is not much of a challenge as far as manufacturing is concerned although it’s going to require a sizeable effort from all stakeholders. It is just a matter of time until consumption sees an even greater uptick and the industry starts producing the components and materials that are essential for energy storage. We believe that it’s going to be a consumption-driven ecosystem.
Another bigger part of the puzzle is the supply chain competitiveness; with the introduction of the government’s PLI scheme, we are witnessing a sense of seriousness among stakeholders in enrolling for this. In a couple of years, India will have a significant cell manufacturing capacity to cater to a part of its demand.
There are a few components that would require an outrightly new ecosystem and we will have a dependency on the outside world at least for some time.
There are concerns about raw material availability for battery storage manufacturing. Given that, how can the production costs be lowered to compete with cheaper products?
In India, we already have an ecosystem that can adapt itself to the requirements of energy storage. The electronic sector’s manufacturing abilities are a good example of a successful manufacturing story.
As far as the components are concerned, industries are operating at very good standards in terms of maintaining the quality that is required for the level of precision at fully automated plants such as ours. So the ecosystem already exists and will start working for battery manufacturers.
As we start manufacturing cells in India, the scale is going to be very important. It is good that the government is supporting the introduction of PLI. Till the time our domestic industry scales, the PLI scheme is a major incentive that the government is offering to the industry in terms of matching the cost-effectiveness to tackle China.
Secondly, we also have the manpower available to us at a better cost than in China. And even in terms of other infrastructure, we are developing fast and will be able to match up to China’s economy of scale within the next few years.
Which battery storage technology makes the most sense for Indian utility-scale battery storage projects? The case for manufacturing these batteries in India?
The battery storage industry has been very dynamic over the last few years. However, there is hardly any technology apart from Li-ion which is ready for mass production. This is largely because the development of battery technologies leading to commercial production at scale takes fairly longer development cycles unlike any other electrical device or software that you can build, test, and then launch. It takes a reasonably long period for any chemical composition/chemical cells such as lithium-ion batteries to be tested and commercialized.
As for what technology makes the most sense for India, there are various applications, all with different technical requirements, and it cannot be any one particular technology that is going to serve the purpose.
However, currently, the only commercialized option which is ready to go and already moving into mass production is lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, for the time being, the energy storage ecosystem is going to be driven by lithium-ion batteries, until another technology can prove itself to be useful and viable for a specific application.
How do you see the Indian market evolve in the next three years, both in manufacturing and demand? 
Investments in manufacturing are linked to the demand and the market sentiment. If you have a good demand prediction that is bolstered by real demand coming in and if the sentiments about growth prospects are high, then the manufacturing sector will automatically develop without any policy intervention or any active incentives.
Demand is thus the most crucial element. I think the government has taken care of this and intervened positively to help India excel at manufacturing.
On the demand side, various sectors are actively trying to adopt energy storage for the first time; grid-scale storage is the most important segment here because energy security is paramount to fulfilling the economic objectives of this country. Also, when it comes to renewable integration, there is a huge scope for demand. India is very near to completing its target of 175 Gigawatt of renewable deployment, but we hardly have any storage deployed here. This is one area that could benefit immensely from energy storage because renewable energy production is intermittent and dependent on forces of nature.
Also, there are a lot of other segments where energy storage is already used like residential energy storage, telecom applications, etc. All these applications are going to experience a technology shift because of the better economy, and the performance and reliability of technologies in energy storage. The energy storage market thus has a bright future ahead that will be fuelled by demand from a variety of sectors.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/22/bloom-energy-to-power-indias-first-green-hydrogen-microgrid/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS,MICROGRID,INDIA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 22, 2021",Bloom Energy to power India’s first green hydrogen microgrid,"California-headquartered Bloom Energy has announced that NTPC Limited, India’s largest energy conglomerate under the Ministry of Power, has selected its electrolyzer and hydrogen-powered fuel cell technologies for the nation’s first green hydrogen-based energy storage deployment.
The project will serve as a test case to explore the potential of large-scale, off-grid hydrogen energy storage and microgrid projects at strategic locations throughout the country.
Bloom Energy shall provide its solid-oxide, high-temperature electrolyzer to generate green hydrogen from renewable electricity produced by a nearby floating solar farm. The hydrogen will then be converted into carbon-neutral electricity without combustion through Bloom Energy’s hydrogen fuel cells to power NTPC’s Guest House, a local accommodation intended for use by NTPC employees and guests.
The project is expected to commence in 2022 in Simhadri, Visakhapatnam, India.
The solar farm, coupled with Bloom Energy’s electrolyzer and hydrogen fuel cells, is intended to operate around the clock. At scale, the combination could enable long-duration clean energy storage and resilient power for businesses, residential neighbourhoods, dense urban areas, and remote and island communities.
Bloom Energy (India), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bloom Energy, was selected for its holistic, comprehensive and efficient technology ecosystem spanning green hydrogen production and carbon-free power. The initial collaboration between NTPC and Bloom Energy India is expected to serve as a foundation for expanded future cooperation.

“Reducing carbon emissions is the number one priority in the fight against climate change, and green hydrogen will be critical to India’s decarbonization objectives,” said Venkat Venkataraman, executive vice president and chief technology officer, Bloom Energy.
“Bloom’s technology is well-positioned to help India transition to a net-zero, hydrogen-powered economy, and we are excited to collaborate with NTPC to bring the country’s first green hydrogen microgrid to life. The powerful combination of Bloom’s high-efficiency electrolyzers and fuel cells enables the highest possible round trip efficiency with green hydrogen for energy storage.”
Bloom Energy’s high-temperature electrolyzer produces hydrogen more efficiently than low-temperature PEM and alkaline electrolyzers. Because it operates at high temperatures, the Bloom Electrolyzer requires less energy to break up water molecules and produce hydrogen. Electricity accounts for nearly 80% of the cost of hydrogen from electrolysis. By using less electricity, hydrogen production becomes more economical and will accelerate adoption.
Bloom Energy Servers – solid oxide fuel cells that combine ambient air with a fuel source, such as natural gas, biogas, hydrogen, or a blend of fuels – produce electricity through a non-combustion electrochemical reaction, resulting in reduced carbon emissions, harmful air pollutants, and water use compared to grid alternatives. When hydrogen is used as a fuel source, Bloom Energy Servers emit zero carbon.
Bloom Energy is engaged with industry leaders to accelerate the global hydrogen economy, including projects related to producing low-cost, green hydrogen and utilizing nuclear energy to create clean hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/22/china-and-india-to-drive-record-world-coal-demand-next-year/,"COVID-19,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,WORLD",MAX HALL,"DECEMBER 22, 2021",China and India to drive record world coal demand next year,"From pv magazine International
Although the march of solar and wind power in what the International Energy Agency (IEA) terms “advanced economies” in its latest report has been noted, the Paris-based body has issued typically depressing findings in its latest survey of the global coal market – unless you are an investor in the fossil fuel.
The Coal 2021 report, which includes data from 2019 and 2020; an estimate for this year; and forecasts out to 2024, stated the IEA overestimated the extent to which demand for coal slumped as Covid-19 savaged the global economy, and also destroyed the idea global coal demand may have peaked in 2018.
While noting the rebound in coal demand in the U.S. and Europe as economies bounced back from the pandemic will not be sustained – and pointing out the shift to solar and other low-carbon power in countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines and Bangladesh – the IEA said the voracious appetite for the fuel in China and India will drive record demand highs next year.
The world’s two most populous nations between them make up two-thirds of global coal demand, said the IEA, and provisions for coal in China’s latest five-year plan, plus the Indian “government’s goal of raising domestic coal production,” will ensure the world stays well short of the progress required to reach a net zero economy by mid century. That shortfall is likely to persist until at least 2024, wrote the report’s authors, with China set to experience 1% annual rises in coal demand, and India set for 4% annual market growth in each of the next three years.
With both nations expected to have experienced record coal demand this year, in part because renewable energy projects have been unable to keep up with electricity demand during the post-Covid economic recovery, the global market for the fossil fuel is expected to hit a record 8.03 billion tons next year, before maintaining that level for the next two years, according to the IEA study.
The Chinese and Indian governments are not the only villains of the piece, though, according to the report, with “Russia developing more coal fields … and expanding export facilities” as part of its 2020 energy strategy; Indonesia and Mongolia also expanding export capacity; and with Australia remaining the world’s biggest exporter of the metallurgical coal used to fire processes such as steelmaking.
