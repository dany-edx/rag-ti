Jindal India Solar Energy, owned by Jindal Polyfilms, made the most competitive bid by seeking the lowest production-linked incentive (PLI) support for 4 GW of fully integrated module manufacturing capacity. Data from trade body the National Solar Federation of India, seen by pv magazine, indicated Jindal has applied for INR1390 crore of support.
Transformer manufacturer and installer Shirdi Sai Electricals (with a bid for INR1875 crore of incentives), the Reliance New Energy Solar business of conglomerate Reliance Industries (INR1917 crore), and the infrastructure unit of fellow multinational Adani (INR3600 crore) were the other successful bidders. The auction took into account the level of assistance sought, planned solar manufacturing capacity and whether manufacturers planned to produce polysilicon and solar ingots, wafers and cells, as well as assembling modules.
All four successful bidders sought incentives for the maximum eligible annual manufacturing capacity of 4 GW and pledged the full extent of integrated manufacturing, from poly to panels.
Under the manufacturing-linked tender rules, however, bidders will only receive support for half of the production capacity they are planning, capped at 2 GW. That would imply the four successful bidders will each receive half of the financial support they have applied for, for a total public spend of INR4391 crore.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/25/lg-launches-hybrid-inverter-for-residential-battery-range/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 25, 2021",LG launches hybrid inverter for residential battery range,"From pv magazine International
South Korean battery manufacturer LG Energy Solution has launched a new inverter in the Australian market, adding a 5 kW hybrid inverter to its residential energy storage unit (RESU) home battery energy storage range.
LG Energy Solution said the new LGES-5048 hybrid inverter would be available in Australia from November. It described it as a highly efficient AC-coupled or DC-coupled unit that when coupled with a battery can deliver back-up power and keep essential appliances running during grid interruptions or power outages.
LG said the hybrid inverter is designed for either new solar and storage installations, or to add storage to an existing solar system. The company said the RESU Home battery and LGES-5048 inverter pairing allows up to 7.5 kW of solar PV capacity for new systems and up to 7.5 kW expansion of existing solar PV systems, including those installed on three-phase power.
The company said the inverter, which measures 516 mm x 440 mm x 184 mm and weighs in at 30kg and has 97% efficiency, and max voltage of 580 W DC. It has an operating temperature range of -25 C to 60 C, fan-less design, low noise emissions, and comes with a 10-year warranty. Customers also have the option to add automated remote control, such as with virtual power plant (VPP) participation.
The LGES-5048 is designed to fit with LG’s RESU Home range of lithium-ion residential battery energy storage solutions which includes the RESU6.5 (6.5 kWh), RESU10 (9.8kWh), RESU12 (11.7 kWh) and RESU13 (12.4 kWh) versions with each inverter able to connect up to two battery units.
LG Energy Solution Residential General Manager Philip Crotty said the range of battery and inverter-pairing capacities allows system designs to be tailored to each household’s unique requirements, catering for a “clear trend” towards larger solar PV systems backed by battery storage as solar feed-in tariffs are reduced or eliminated.
“Exporting excess solar power is increasingly disallowed in some regions with high solar penetration and excess solar power is simply of higher value to the consumer than it is to the utilities,” he said. “These changes reduce the value proposition for solar PV-only and increase the value proposition of solar PV plus battery storage.”
Crotty said there is a growing demand for home batteries with more than half of existing home battery users looking to scale up their energy capacity for increased energy resiliency.
He said the Covid-19 pandemic had contributed to the rise in residential demand, having triggered a worldwide stay home and work from home culture, with indoor activities like video conferencing, streaming, chatting and gaming increasing in popularity.
“There is a trend towards larger capacity batteries and customers who want to leave open the possibility of expanding their batteries in the future,” he said. “This is particularly notable for those who have already experienced the benefits of having batteries and want even more flexibility in their power system.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/25/solar-farms-prove-to-bee-hives-of-economic-activity/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 25, 2021",Solar farms prove to bee hives of economic activity,"From pv magazine International
Bees are extremely important, not just because my name starts with one, but also because they’re responsible for approximately 70% of the fruits, vegetables and nuts we humans consume daily. However, since the mid-2000s a species threatening “Colony Collapse Disorder” has seen commercial bee populations decimated.
For this reason, scientific researchers have been investigating novel land management practices and some of the most promising involve the symbiotic relationship between agriculture and PV. One such study, published in the journal Biological Conservation, examined the economic benefits of beehive integration with solar farms. 
The symbiotic benefits of agrivoltaics are increasingly well documented, and many have suggested incorporating honeybee hives on solar parks as a symbiotic twofold solution to the problems of bee populations and expanded renewable energy capacity.
In the United Kingdom (UK) a team of researchers from the universities of Lancaster and Reading have published a study finding that the value of UK agriculture could be boosted by millions of pounds annually if honeybee hives were incorporated on solar parks throughout the country. 
However, the scientists behind the study made it clear that wild pollinators should be prioritized over honeybees where appropriate when it comes to the management of solar farms. Solar farms are essential to the energy transition and environmental sustainability, but they do occupy large tracts of land and should, therefore, bring added environmental and commercial benefits where possible. 
Of course, many solar farms are located in agricultural regions where wild pollinator habitats have been long-degraded or eradicated. For these, honeybee hives would be welcome additions, providing pollinators that would increase crop production. 
“Managing solar parks for honeybees can have positive impacts on crop yields and thus financial returns,” said Alona Armstrong, senior lecturer at Lancaster University, “But, it is important to consider the suitability on a site by site basis given the potential implications for wild pollinators and the benefits of managing sites for biodiversity more broadly.”
Solar P-Bee
Of course, there are solar farms that already have bees hard at work. For instance, Iberdrola has built an apiary at its Andévalo photovoltaic plant near Huelva, in Spain’s Andalucia region, hosting 165 beehives and more than 8 million bees, and another one at its Núñez de Balboa project in Usagre, near Badajoz in the country’s Extremadura region, hosting 105 beehives and five million bees. 

However, the economic benefits of this symbiotic relationship hadn’t been quantified until this UK study. Mindful of the cost of installing and managing the beehives, the research team utilized detailed land cover maps to compare solar park locations with crop distributions, as well as existing honeybee hive data, pollination requirements and crop values to determine that honeybee deployment on solar parks could have raised crop yields by £5.9 million in 2017 alone. 
Among UK nations, England was the country that would most benefit from honeybee hive integration, mainly because oilseed is so widely cropped. However, the researchers also looked at crops of field beans, linseed, pears, apples, strawberries, blackcurrants and raspberries, and found that the soft fruits like berries would benefit the most on a per capita basis. 
The field crop yields were found to benefit by £2.6 million, while top fruits such as those used to make cider would see a boost of £1.3 million and soft fruits £1.9 million. 
Ultimately, and it is, of course, a hypothetical (albeit an instructive one), the report found that if all UK crops were grown within a 1.5km radius of a honeybee hive housed solar park, the value of those crop yields could increase by £80 million each year. 
“Our study demonstrates how multi-disciplinary research can find novel land management practices,” said one of the study’s co-authors, Simon Potts of the University of Reading, “which can simultaneously benefit energy producers, farmers, beekeepers and consumers.”
