It has received a ‘Silver’ Badge from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for its achievement in managing carbon emissions.
Navitas Solar manufactures mono and polycrystalline solar modules ranging from 5 W to 600 W per panel. Currently, it has a total installed manufacturing capacity of 500 MW per year and plans to expand to 3 GW in the coming years.
“Navitas Solar had appointed a third-party consultant with the task of carrying out the assessment of GHG emissions, defining a methodology and calculation approach to be adopted, and implementing monitoring procedures. It validated that the calculations met the specifications of the ISO 14064-1:2018 standard and the GHG protocol based on the assessment,” stated the company.
“In line with this, the consultant also declared that Navitas Solar has bought carbon credits to offset the same amount of emissions and has achieved carbon neutrality for the calendar year 2021,” it added.
Navitas Solar pledges to become fully carbon-neutral by 2023 and to achieve net-zero status by 2030.

The project is located at Kalpi tehsil of the Jalaun district near Kanpur, and is being commissioned by SJVN through its arm SJVN Green Energy.
When operational, the project shall generate 168.34 million units (MUs) of electricity in the first year. The project’s cumulative energy generation over a period of 25 years would be about 3,919 MUs.
The project will supply power under a 25-year power purchase agreement with Uttar Pradesh Power Corp. Ltd.
Currently, SJVN’s renewable portfolio stands at 4,007.5 MW, out of which 179.5 MW is operational, 1,370 MW is under construction and 2,458 MW is under different stages of implementation. With the commissioning of this 75 MW solar project, its cumulative operational capacity will increase from 2,016.5 MW to 2,091.5 MW

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/26/pv-infolink-forecasts-polysilicon-prices-to-be-halved-by-end-of-2023/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 26, 2022",PV InfoLink forecasts polysilicon prices to be halved by end of 2023,"From pv magazine Global
PV Infolink forecasts polysilicon prices to decrease from around CNY 300 ($36.64, excluding VAT)/kg currently to below CNY 150/kg by the end of 2023, it revealed in a joint webinar with analysts Exawatt and Roth Capital Partners.
Prices are expected to decline gradually in the first half of 2023 and then see a steep decline in the second half of the year. The consulting firm expects polysilicon production capacity to increase from 293 GW earlier this year to around 500 GW by the end of 2022, spiking to 975 GW by the end of 2023. However, “there will likely be a meaningful lag between nameplate and effective capacity,” a company statement reads.
China is likely to remain the world’s largest polysilicon producer for the foreseeable future, with both PV Infolink and Exawatt predicting non-China polysilicon to represent up to 10% of total global capacity. Following the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) in the US, the country is expected to increase polysilicon production. Other countries are also ramping up or starting production, including Norway, Turkey, and Germany. Both firms expect prices for polysilicon from outside of China to be higher by between 5% and 10%.
PV Infolink predicts that it will take between two to three years of operation for new entrants to be competitive with established players like Chinese manufacturers in terms of capacity, yield rate, and purity.
Cell, wafer, and module prices are also predicted to decrease. PV Infolink expects cell pricing to be roughly $0.16/W through 2022 and fall slowly next year to around $0.10/W by year-end. It puts current pricing for a 210 mm mono wafer at around $0.21/W, which could fall to around $0.13/W by end 2023. Module pricing may fall slightly to between $0.22 to $0.23/W at the end of 2023 from the current $0.25 to $0.27.
