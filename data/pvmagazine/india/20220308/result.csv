https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/08/green-hydrogen-to-cost-us5-kg-for-co-located-projects/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 8, 2022",Green hydrogen for $5/kg at co-located projects,"US-owned ratings agency ICRA has estimated green hydrogen can be produced for $5 per kilogram at Indian sites where renewables generation capacity and electrolyzers are co-located.
A study, by Gurgaon-based ICRA, calculated the cost per kilogram would rise between 50 US cents and a dollar if electrolyzers are powered by off-site renewables wheeling electricity via intra-state grids, with the cost of such clean electricity estimated at INR3.50/kWh, including wheeling and transmission charges.
To minimize the cost of green hydrogen, Berkshire Hathaway-owned ICRA said, battery energy storage and energy banking – a system which offers electricity generators the chance to feed excess electricity into the grid and draw it down at a later point – would need to be available.
ICRA estimated battery-backed round-the-clock clean energy would cost INR4-6/kWh, depending on the extent of storage capacity required.
The report said the green hydrogen policy recently notified by the Ministry of Power would drive big demand for renewables capacity in India, with around 60GW extra needed if the nation is to source just 30% of its hydrogen demand this decade from the green form of the energy storage medium.
Most of the 6 million-ton demand for hydrogen in India in fiscal year 2019-20  came from industry, for use in refining, fertilizers and chemicals and ICRA expects the market to grow 3.5-4% annually to the end of 2029-30. Current demand is almost entirely met by fossil-fuel-powered “grey” hydrogen.
Girishkumar Kadam, senior VP and co-group head for corporate ratings at ICRA, said: “The policy by the Ministry of Power [of the] government of India (GOI) for green hydrogen has various supportive measures and thus, remains a positive step. Even in a scenario of 30% of hydrogen demand to be met through green hydrogen by 2030, [the] incremental renewable (RE) capacity requirement is estimated to remain significant, at about 60GW. This is over and above the RE addition [needed] to meet all India[‘s] energy requirements.
“From the industrial off-taker’s perspective, green hydrogen is currently estimated to remain costlier by about $3.50-4/kg against grey hydrogen. The cost competitiveness of green hydrogen would remain contingent upon the reduction in capital cost, and an improvement in the energy efficiency level of, electrolyzer[s], besides the cost of RE procurement.”
Kadam’s fellow VP and co-group head for corporate ratings, Prashant Vasisht, said, of India’s current hydrogen demand: “With green hydrogen being, currently, costlier, as against grey hydrogen, [a] switch to the use of green hydrogen by the fertilizer sector will require a commensurate increase in the subsidy support from the GOI to mitigate the higher cost of production. In the case of phosphatic fertilizers, manufacturers may focus on procurement of green ammonia instead of green hydrogen, as [an] ammonia-manufacturing facility may require significant investments, thus providing an opportunity to standalone green ammonia manufacturers too.”

Our Next Energy (ONE) has secured $65 million in a funding round led by BMW i Ventures to scale up its electric vehicle business. The funds add to a $25 million Series A funding round in October that was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures.
ONE has signed contracts with four automakers and has a five-year, 25GWh energy storage pipeline. This equates to 300,000 electric vehicles, it said. It noted that the latest round of funding will help it begin the site selection process for its first US-based battery factory. It said it will also accelerate R&D in Michigan and San Francisco.
In January, ONE created a proof-of-concept device with 732 miles of range. In another pilot, the company paired a Tesla Model S with an experimental battery with 203.7kWh and an energy density of 416Wh/L. The battery was able to power the Model S at 55 miles per hours for 882 miles on a single charge, as validated by third-party testing.
“ONE’s core principles of doubling the range, decreasing the cost of the batteries and creating a local supply chain, resonated strongly with us at BMW i Ventures,” said Baris Guzel, partner at BMW i Ventures. “ONE’s battery factory in the US is an important step for the larger electric vehicle value chain, and ONE has the potential to truly transform the ecosystem.”
The company builds lithium-ferro-phosphate batteries, which don’t need earth-rare cobalt, said ONE. It currently has two proof-of-concept battery models: the Aries and the larger Gemini, which was used in the Tesla demonstration. ONE said it will begin Aries production in late 2022, and will demonstrate a production-level prototype of Gemini in 2023.

Business data company IHS Markit has predicted lithium-ion battery prices will not fall until 2024, thanks to rising metal prices, soaring demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and China’s near monopoly on the industry.
The analyst, which has produced a list of cleantech trends for 2022, also said current green hydrogen project timescales will have the world on schedule for a supply crunch of the energy storage medium in 2025.
Amid fierce EV demand for lithium-ion phosphate batteries, London-based, S&P Global-owned IHS has predicted a battery module price increase of 5% this year will drive up the overall cost of stationary battery projects around 3%.
With the analyst having recorded lithium-ion battery price rises of 10-20% in the “later months of 2021,” it predicted price tags will not return to a downward trajectory for another two years and even that development will depend on manufacturers expanding production capacity and seeing off demand from EV makers.
The green hydrogen bottleneck anticipated mid decade is in part a result of project announcements which included plans laid last year for almost 250GW of electrolyzer capacity – up from 70GW worth of announcements in 2020, and less than 15GW in 2019. IHS, however, predicted further electrolyzer production plans this year and next will help ease any supply squeeze and reiterated an estimate Europe’s green hydrogen demand alone is expected to require up to 250GW of solar generation capacity this decade.
Noting moves by the US and India to onshore solar manufacturing, IHS said it expects the logistics and input cost headaches which drove up the price of solar panels last year will continue to inflate costs this year, particularly for the next four months. The market data firm did state, however, new manufacturing capacity of solar panel raw material polysilicon is coming online faster than expected, solar wafers are becoming more efficient, and new wafer producers are entering the market.
While solar and wind prices may continue to rise this year, IHS said, clean energy remains competitive, in part thanks to cheaper financing costs as banks become accustomed to backing such projects and the world experiences a continued enthusiasm for green finance.
Solar projects with generation capacities no larger than 5MW will account for 45% of new arrays this year, according to IHS Markit, with China and Germany driving more than 60% of demand in the segment.
Brazil will continue to see demand for sub-5MW projects, with net-metered arrays installed through next year not subject to grid charges, and established smaller-scale solar markets in the US and France will be joined by new entrants, with a graphic produced by IHS Markit suggesting they could include Japan, India and Italy.
Home and business rooftop arrays continue to be competitive despite rising panel prices, IHS said, because they are competing against retail energy prices rather than the wholesale levels which utility scale projects have to contend with.
