In 2021, 10 GW of solar energy was added to the country’s solar energy capacity, the highest annual addition ever. The cumulative installed capacity of solar energy totaled around 50 GW in February 2022, which is half the capacity installation targeted by the end of 2022. The 50 GW PV installation includes 42 GW of utility-scale solar, 6.5 GW of rooftop solar, and 1.5 GW of off-grid solar installations.
The Indian government stands committed to achieving about 50% of cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. To meet the said target, utility-scale solar PV will have to be harnessed to its maximum potential.
The growth of utility-scale solar PV in India is marred by several challenges such as availability of land, limited local manufacturing capacity, high transmission and distribution losses, grid integration, and other inefficiencies.
Land is a scarce resource in India, with the per capita availability being lower than that in most countries worldwide. It is difficult to acquire large stretches of open land required by utility-scale solar in remote and isolated locations. Furthermore, companies face regulatory hurdles as multiple approvals are needed from state and central government agencies as well as environmental authorities to acquire land. This is a time-consuming and laborious process. Additionally, protests and hindrances from local communities could delay projects.
Companies, especially small and medium enterprises, face another major challenge in the form of sourcing funds for solar projects. Most of them have limited or no awareness about the right funding model and institution to approach. Eventually, they are unable to source the required funds for their project at a low interest rate for a long duration. Although a few government schemes such as the National Clean Energy and Environment Fund and Green Masala Bonds provide some support, a comprehensive resolution is awaited.
Limited manufacturing capacity for solar raw material and equipment is one of the other challenges to utility-scale solar installation in India. According to Mercom India, currently, India has a manufacturing capacity of 4.5 GW for solar cells and 24 GW for solar modules, which is much lower than the annual requirement.
This is coupled with lack of backward integration for raw material such as solar wafers and polysilicon. This has increased the country’s dependency on imports for raw material, solar cells, modules, and panels. The import value of solar cells and modules totaled around $ 97.5 billion in 2021–22, with China being the main source of imports.
India’s power transmission and distribution (T&D) networks are dated and obsolete. Most of the distribution in the country takes place through overhead wires, resulting in frequent breakdowns and gross inefficiency. T&D losses in India are high vis-à-vis other countries, accounting for over 18% of the power loss compared with merely 6% in the US and China. The resulting electricity loss increases the overall cost of solar PV electricity.
Solar farms are generally located in remote areas. Connection with the main grid is a big challenge as it is expensive and difficult due to the distance. Furthermore, a major percentage of electricity is lost during long-distance transmission.
The other challenges faced by utility-scale solar PV include low tariff for electricity, limited push for R&D related to the power sector, restricted cooperation between government and corporates, complex subsidy structure, and lack of skilled or trained workforce and proper regulations related to solar waste management.
The central and state governments need to plan and coordinate properly and create a streamlined clearance process for approvals related to solar power such as land, infrastructure support, and environmental clearance. The T&D networks across the country need to be updated and modernized to reduce electricity losses. Moreover, investments are required to advance R&D activities related to the country’s solar and overall power sector.
Furthermore, the government should push for a decentralized energy distribution system to resolve the challenges in grid connection and reduce electricity losses during transmission to the grid.
The implementation of these resolutions will help India achieve the full potential of solar energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/11/copper-is-the-new-silver-lining/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"OCTOBER 11, 2022",Copper is the new silver lining,"From pv magazine ISSUE 10 – 2022 
Copper plating can more effectively reduce demand for silver. Plated copper is polycrystalline and consequently its conductivity is much greater than either of the cured silver or copper pastes.
It can be argued that, as a material’s reserves are consumed, the mining industry will increase exploration to maintain a constant reserve/production ratio. However, commonly the ore grade in newly discovered reserves declines as the higher quality reserves have already been discovered and mined. The lower quality ore results in increased refining costs and a higher emissions intensity as more energy is required to refine the lower quality ore. Both of these factors will increase the cost of the raw material to the PV manufacturer.
High silver usage is a particular problem for silicon heterojunction (HJT) technology, as HJT bifacial cells currently require around 205 mg per M10 cell, which adds up to roughly 25 tons/GW of silver for 24.5% efficient cells. This silver usage is more than a factor of two greater than used for current passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells and can ultimately limit uptake of HJT technology in manufacturing, despite it being among the most efficient cell technologies available.
One of the main reasons for the high silver usage is that the cells require low temperature silver pastes so as not to damage their surface passivation. These pastes are less conductive; hence a greater mass of silver is required. Low temperature pastes also require long curing times which are undesirable for production. One alternative which is being trialed for HJT cells to reduce metallisation cost is copper pastes. However, to-date the copper particles in these pastes require a thick silver coating to reduce the risk of oxidation, and this coating can comprise up to 50% of the particle by weight. The pastes also offer minimal cost benefits at present due to their limited market experience.
Copper plating can more effectively reduce the demand for silver. Plated copper is polycrystalline and consequently its conductivity is much greater than either of the cured silver or copper pastes. However, unlike pastes which can be screen printed, it is necessary to first form a mask over the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer of the SHJ cell before the copper can be plated to the surface of the cell. This masking step adds complexity and cost to the process.
Additionally, many copper plating approaches require that a seed metal layer is first applied by physical vapour deposition to the TCO for increased adhesion of the plated copper and to provide an electrode “clip” contact point during electroplating. This seed layer must be removed after plating, which increases cost and process complexity. Furthermore, the clipping of cells during plating is not compatible with thinner wafers, which are expected to become more common in the near future.
Australian startup Sundrive Solar is addressing these challenges with its low-cost masking and direct copper plating processes. The company’s high resolution patterning enables fingers as narrow as 10 microns to be plated directly to the TCO surface of bifacial HJT cells. This process has enabled it to achieve cell efficiencies as high as 26.41% in partnership with Chinese HJT technology equipment provider Suzhou Maxwell Technologies Co, Ltd.
Sundrive’s direct plating process also allows copper plating to low-indium TCOs, which are expected to be required in high volume production to minimize sustainability concerns with regard to limited indium global reserves. Maxwell and Sundrive have achieved an efficiency of 25.94% for a copper-plated cell with a low indium TCO. This demonstrates that it is possible to reduce both silver and indium use in HJT cells without significantly impacting efficiency.
In addition to reducing manufacturing cost, Sundrive’s replacement of 25 tons of silver with 13 tons of copper per GW can reduce the embodied emissions of HJT modules by around 6 kilotons of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) per GW. This reduction is due firstly to the lower mass of copper required per cell; but also the lower emissions intensity of producing copper compared to silver.
Our estimate of reduced embodied emissions by using copper in place of silver for the metallisation of HJT cells is a conservative value because it assumes that all the copper is obtained from primary production. Given that a large fraction of the copper can be resourced from recycling, due to the larger volume of copper in industrial use, the actual embodied emissions of copper plated HJT modules is likely to be even less than our estimated value of 42 t CO2e / GW of HJT cell production. The reduced embodied emissions of copper plated PV modules will ultimately be reflected in a lower module cost.
