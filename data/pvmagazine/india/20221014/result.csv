The estimated cost of the solar project is INR 8,000 crore.
CIL will set up the project in RVUNL’s 2 GW solar power park at Bikaner, in a phased manner.
“This is CIL’s biggest ever solar power project planned till date, constituting almost 40% of its ambitious plan of establishing 3 GW of solar projects by FY 2023-24 under its net-zero initiative,” stated CIL.
The solar park is approved under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s scheme of Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks.
The Rajasthan government would ensure handing over the possession of encumbrance and encroachment free land to CIL for the solar project. The project is scheduled for completion in 24 months.
The final implementation and investment plans would be worked out as the project progresses in phased manner. RUVNL will facilitate the grid connectivity.
CIL has awarded 265 MW of solar power projects so far with 35 MW more to be concluded by the month end which would make a total of 300 MW. The company targets adding 1.2 GW more in the ensuing financial year 2023-24.

Under the contract, it will install and commission NTPC’s proposed 500 MW AC (625 MW DC) solar PV project at Bhadla in Rajasthan.
Pennar Industries won the project by placing the lowest bid in a competitive auction against the tender invited by NTPC REL. The project scope includes design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing, commissioning, and three-year operation and maintenance support.
The project completion period is 12.5 months.
Pennar industries provides renewable energy solutions across the value chain including solar EPC and manufacturing of solar modules and module mounting structures. It has executed solar EPC for more than 1 GW of projects for customers including Azure Power and Sprng Energy.
Pennar industries has supplied its module mounting structures to more than 10 GW of solar projects over the past 12 years. It established PV module manufacturing facility in the year 2019 with an annual production capacity of 250 MW per annum, and has supplied PV modules to more than 100 MW of solar projects as on date.

The company is already in talks with developers in India to supply its electrolyzers. It will also provide training and commissioning supervision to EPC partners for hydrogen projects.
“Longi considers hydrogen as a new pillar of our business. We have invested a lot in the green hydrogen business. And India is a promising market. The nation has high decarbonization and non-fossil fuel-based electricity generation target. It will continue to offer opportunities for global and local players in the long run,” Lan Cheng, general manager-international, Longi Hydrogen, told pv magazine.
Longi continues to invest heavily in R&D and innovation and launched its alkaline water electrolyzer, which marks a significant milestone and a key step toward becoming a world-leading hydrogen technology company. Longi electrolyzers can provide a hydrogen output of 1,000 Nm3/h and it has already provided a 4,000Nm3/h hydrogen production system for the world’s largest green hydrogen project. The service life of the equipment exceeds 200,000 hours. The distributed I/O control system realizes automatic and unattended operation.
Longi will reach 1.5 GW of electrolyzer manufacturing capacity by the end of 2022 and the company is expected to expand to 5-10 GW by 2025 to meet the market demand.
On the solar module front, Longi plans to introduce a new product by the end of the year. “We believe any new product which is introduced to the market must sustain for a long period. So, we are working on a new product, which is going to beat almost all prevailing technologies in efficiency, degradation, and bifaciality factor,” said Pradeep Kumar, managing director of Longi Solar India.
Longi introduced Hi-MO 5 bifacial and mono-facial modules to the Indian market inn 2021, and  shipped 3.8 GW of modules last year, out of which 85% was bifacial. It has shipped 1.6 GW of modules from January to March in the current calendar year—the three months before the imposition of basic customs duty. More than 95% of these sales were bifacial

The record surpasses Jinko’s previous achievement of 25.7%, announced in April. A hydrogenation process developed by Jinko in collaboration with research and development partners was key to the achievement here, alongside ultrafine metallization, an advanced diffusion process, and various material upgrades.
“We are proud to achieve a major breakthrough in the conversion efficiency of N-type TOPCon cells in less than half a year, breaking the record we have previously set for N-type monocrystalline silicon solar cells,” said JinkoSolar CTO, Jin Hao. “The R&D department has developed interface defect passivation, highly transparent polysilicon film and ultra-thin metallization technologies based on a laser-doped selective emitter.”
In October 2021, the efficiency of the cell stood at 25.4%.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/14/sodium-ion-battery-anode-made-from-toxic-hogweed/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,SODIUM-ION BATERIES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",Sodium-ion battery anode made from toxic hogweed,"From pv magazine Global
Hard carbons appear to be one of the most suitable candidates for anode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of their electrochemical performance and relative ease of production. This class of materials can be obtained from a variety of precursors, and the most ecologically sustainable route is the synthesis from biomass.
Researchers from Moscow State University (MSU) and Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) have developed a high-quality anode material from an unlikely source – Heracleum sosnowskyi, a highly invasive plant, which is dangerous for humans and can cause skin burns but produces a large amount of green biomass in a short time.
“We thought, wouldn’t it be fun to take something as nasty and objectionable as hogweed and make something useful out of it,” said co-author Zoya Bobyleva of Lomonosov Moscow State University. “The thing about hard carbon materials, used in sodium-ion battery anodes, is you can make them from biomass of virtually any origin. No one has considered hogweed before. But it turned out pretty well.”
The hard carbon produced by the MSU-Skoltech team exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which is on par with the best reported results for hard carbons synthesized from other raw materials. As for the energy storage capacity, at about 260 mAh/g, the material falls short of the best results reported elsewhere — around 300 mAh/g. In addition, it  demonstrated capacity retention of 95% after 100 charge-discharge cycles in sodium half-cells.
In “Sosnowskyi Hogweed-Based Hard Carbons for Sodium-Ion Batteries,” which was recently published in Batteries, the researchers proposed a simple synthesis method that includes the pretreatment stage and further carbonization at 1,300 C. The new anode was demonstrated in full sodium-ion cells with NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode material.
