It has a network of solar-based electric vehicle charging stations set up by state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) under the FAME-1 [Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) & Electric Vehicles in India] scheme of the Ministry of Heavy Industries.
The solar-based electric vehicle charging stations, set up at 20 sites along the highway, are equipped with individual grid-connected rooftop solar plants to supply green and clean energy to the charging stations.
One of these state-of-the-art charging stations, located at Karnal Lake Resort, was recently inaugurated by Mahendra Nath Pandey, Union Minister of Heavy Industries.
The EV charging station at Karnal lake resort is strategically located at the midpoint of the Delhi-Chandigarh highway. It is equipped It is equipped with AC001 (3×3.3kW), DC001 (15kW), and 72kW (50kW DC+22kW AC) chargers to charge all types of electric cars plying currently in the country.
BHEL is also working on upgrading the other charging stations on this highway, within this year.
The establishment of similar EV chargers at regular intervals of 25-30 km on the highway will allay range anxiety among EV users and bolster their confidence for inter-city travel, BHEL stated.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/20/renewable-energy-investment-in-just-four-months-exceeds-fy2021-figures/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 20, 2021",Renewable energy investment in just four months exceeds FY2021 figures,"The Indian renewable energy sector is seeing a rise in investment again following a 24% year-on-year decline in FY2020-21 due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, finds a new briefing note by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
In just the first four months of this financial year (FY), from April to July 2021, investment in the Indian renewable energy sector reached US$6.6 billion, surpassing the US$6.4 billion level for FY2020-21 and on track to quickly overtake the US$8.4 billion total achieved in 2019-20 before the pandemic.
“Rebounding energy demand and a surge of commitments from banks and financial institutions to exit fossil fuel financing are helping to drive investment into Indian renewable energy infrastructure,” said author Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist, Lead India at IEEFA.
The new IEEFA note explores renewable energy investment trends during FY2020-21 and for the first four months of FY2021-22 and also highlights the key deals made during both periods. 
The majority of the money flowed through acquisitions, which helps to recycle the capital into new projects.
The largest of around 30 deals during FY2020-21 and April to July FY2021-22 was SoftBank’s exit from the Indian renewable energy sector in May 2021 with a US$3.5 billion sale of assets to Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL). With this acquisition, AGEL became a major investor as well as the world’s largest solar developer.
Other major deals included Engie’s acquisition by Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus for US$550 million, Acme’s acquisition by Scatec Solar for US$400 million, and Fortum’s acquisition by Actis for US$333 million.
The majority of the other big deals were packaged as debt, equity investment, green bonds, and mezzanine funding.
Indian renewable energy developers are attracting huge investments from green bonds, said co-author Saurabh Trivedi, Research Analyst at IEEFA.
“In April 2021, ReNew Power raised money from green bonds with a tenor of 7.25 years at a fixed interest rate of 4.5% per annum, and this was soon trumped in August 2021 by the US$414 million 2026 green bond issue by Azure Power Global at a record low 3.575% per year.”
In the latest development, a mega US$8 billion special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction between ReNew Power and RMG Acquisition Corporation II has approval from a majority of shareholders, paving the way for a Nasdaq listing with expected trading from 24 August 2021.
“This is a landmark transaction as it represents the biggest overseas listing of an Indian company via the SPAC route,” said Trivedi.
IEEFA analysts note the government is redoubling efforts to boost energy security and self-reliance by expanding clean energy technologies as demonstrated by Prime Minister Modi’s Independence Day speech, and Indian corporates like Reliance and JSW Energy are making big clean energy commitments.
In addition, the lending portfolios of Indian financial institutions like State Bank of India (SBI) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC) now include more renewable energy assets than fossil fuels, a trend that picked up significantly in the last one to two years.
In a February 2021 report, IEEFA highlighted that India would require a further US$500 billion in investment in new wind and solar infrastructure, energy storage and grid expansion and modernization to reach 450 GW of capacity by 2030.
“The decarbonization of the energy sector will demand massive amounts of investment, and the flow of capital into this space will need to accelerate rapidly to meet India’s clean energy targets and enable a green recovery towards a sustainable economy,” said Garg.
India is currently investing around US$18-20 billion in energy generation capacity and a further US$20 billion in the grid on an annual basis. To achieve the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) in the International Energy Agency’s India Energy Outlook 2021, the country would need to triple its current rate of annual investment to US$110 billion.
“This is daunting in one respect,” said Garg. “But the financial trends in Indian renewable energy and grid infrastructure over the last two to three years strongly suggest domestic and global capital can support this ambition.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/20/australian-researchers-develop-bifacial-solar-cell-with-96-3-bifacial-factor/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 20, 2021",Australian researchers develop bifacial solar cell with 96.3% bifacial factor,"From pv magazine International
Scientists at The Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra have produced a dual-sided silicon solar cell with a front conversion efficiency of 24.3% and a rear conversion efficiency of 23.4%, representing a bifacial factor of 96.3%. They claimed that the performance represents an effective power output of approximately 29%.
Chief researcher Dr. Marco Ernst claimed that the numbers outstrip the performance of the best single-sided silicon solar cell. “This is a world record for selectively laser-doped solar cells and among the highest-efficiency bifacial solar cells,” Ernst said.
The results, which the research team claims have been independently verified by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), were achieved by using specific laser-doping technology to fabricate the cells.
“Laser-doping uses lasers to locally increase electrical conductivity,” Ernst said. “It is a low-cost, industry-compatible process for boosting solar cell efficiency.”
Principal researcher Dr. Kean Chern Fong claimed that the bifacial solar cells easily beat the performance of single-sided silicon solar cells and provide efficiency benefits for solar PV projects.
Bifacial solar cells, which are commanding a growing share of the PV market, absorb light from both the front and rear surfaces of the device, capturing albedo light reflected off the ground and roof surfaces that would otherwise be lost.
“We have developed what I would call a true bifacial solar cell, as it has nearly symmetrical power generation capacity on both surfaces of the device,” Fong said. “When deployed on a conventional solar farm, a bifacial cell absorbs direct incoming light, while also taking advantage of ground reflection, which can contribute up to additional 30% power generation. Bifacial solar cells are becoming increasingly important in the roll out of solar farms and are expected to have a market share of over 50% in the next five years. Our work demonstrates the incredible capabilities of this technology.”
The results are the latest milestone for scientists at ANU, which received AUD 3.6 million ($2.6 million) in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in January as part of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics Infrastructure project.
Earlier this month, scientists working on the PV potential of ultra-thin 2D materials discovered that the ability of the materials to generate solar energy can be controlled by “twisting” the angle between two layers of the material.
