Paris-based Feedgy has unveiled new HS-B96 agrivoltaic PV panels specifically designed for market gardening, arboriculture and floriculture. It co-developed the modules with China’s Huasun, which will manufacture them.
“Around 85% of our customers are farmers to whom we already offer repowering solutions or the installation of new solar power plants on their sheds,” Coline Magne, Feedgy’s marketing project manager, told pv magazine France. “It was therefore logical for us to continue innovating to offer them a new source of income by solarizing their greenhouses, too.”
Due to Feedgy’s simulation tools, the panels can be adapted to the dimensions of greenhouse glazing.
“The semi-transparent panels are a good alternative between conventional photovoltaic greenhouses, which lack efficiency due to poor light management, and dynamic shading on photovoltaic trackers, which require constant monitoring and involve expensive maintenance,” said the company.
Feedgy said the global agrivoltaics market was valued at €3.3 billion ($3.6 billion) in 2021 and is expected to reach €8.6 billion by 2031, with an annual growth rate of 10.1%.
The HS-B96 modules are TÜV Rheinland-certified. They feature 96 HJT cells and are available in five power ratings, from 300 Wp to 320 Wp, with efficiencies ranging from 13.9% to 14.8%.
The new modules have a transparency of 39% and a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmission rate of 33%.
“To achieve the same PAR transmission, the competition has to increase the module’s transparency to at least 49%, so they have a lower PV yield per unit area,” Magne said. “In other words, our module has the lowest optical loss on the market.”
The modules have a temperature coefficient of -0.26% per degree Celsius for greater performance stability in hot climates, and a bifaciality rate of 90%.
The HS-B96 panels, developed in-house over a 10-year period and patented by Feedgy, debuted at the Energaïa trade show in Montpellier in December 2023. The company said it will exclusively market them in France.

Solar manufacturer CubicPV has revealed that it will scrap its plan to develop a 10 GW silicon wafer factory in the United States. The company will instead focus on producing tandem solar modules.
CubicPV’s board of directors cited changing market dynamics, including “a dramatic collapse in wafer prices and a surge in construction costs,” as the reason for aborting the plan.
As part of restructuring plans, the company reduced its workforce and eliminated positions tied to the US factory effort. The company said it would support the affected workers by providing severance packages and extended health benefits.
Following a 16-year tenure as CubicPV’s chief executive officer, Frank van Mierlo, has decided to step down. Tim McCaffery, global investment director of SCG, will assume chief executive officer responsibilities, guiding the company through the transition.
“Together with our board, we’ve concluded that the one thing that could truly make a difference in humanity’s fight against climate change and the US ability to realize a solar manufacturing renaissance is to invent a better panel,” said van Mierlo.
CubicPV will now focus on tandem module development. The company seeks to address stability, reproducibility and efficiency of silicon-perovskite tandems and promises to solve the durability challenge that has slowed the commercialization of perovskite material use in solar panels.
“Cubic’s engineering acumen and robust IP portfolio create a solid foundation for growth. SCG strongly believes that the company’s tandem technology could be a solar breakthrough, transforming the energy landscape,” said McCaffery. 
In the summer of 2023, the company secured $103 million in equity financing to support the now-scrapped wafer factory. 
In December 2023, CubicPV and South Korean silicon producer OCI announced an eight-year supply agreement in which Cubic becomes OCIM’s first US customer for its low-carbon, US-compliant silicon.
The contract was valued at approximately $1 billion, establishes a commitment for an annual supply volume by OCI, providing Cubic with the polysilicon it needs in order to begin manufacturing at its US plant. Under the terms of the agreement, OCI would begin to provide silicon in 2025 from its manufacturing facility.
In related news, Norway-based REC Silicon has announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, REC Advanced Silicon Materials LLC, is shutting down polysilicon production capacity at its facility in Butte, Montana. The plant employed about 300 people and was one of the top private employers in the region.
The manufacturer said the shutdown of the business in Butte is “primarily necessary due to the regional structural imbalance in supply and demand for electricity.” It is also said to be part of its strategy to ensure long-term profitable operations.

8,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/12/the-effect-of-extreme-dust-conditions-on-pv-system-performance/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,2024-02-12,The effect of extreme dust conditions on PV system performance,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from Romania’s Transilvania University of Brașov have investigated the impact of particularly thick layers of dust on the performance of different PV technologies.
“If the effects of climate change escalate, resulting in less rainfall and more frequent sandstorm events originating from the Saharan region, then extreme scenarios are very likely to occur in Europe,” the research’s corresponding author, Abubaker Younis told pv magazine.”Logically, the majority of dust is expected to settle in Southern European countries, with occasional dust storm events reaching Central Europe.”
The scientists conducted their tests on amorphous silicon (a-Si), monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels, on which they simulated relatively extreme dust conditions. They used a mini a-Si module with dimensions of 30 mm × 30 mm, a monocrystalline panel measuring 41.6 mm × 33.9 mm, and a polycrystalline device with a size of 33 mm × 40.4 mm. On them, they deposited natural dust collected from the surroundings of the Eastern Romanian city of Brașov. The non-homogeneous layers were deposited using a sieve.
The academics tested the modules under varying conditions, in the lab, in the field, and under different irradiations. Furthermore, they compared their performance with that of reference modules without dust.
For the field test, they placed the modules on the rooftop of one of Transilvania University of Brașov’s campuses and took measurements once irradiation reached 800 W/m2, 900 W/m2, and 1,000 W/m2. The same irradiation levels were simulated in the lab experiment using a solar simulator.
Under all of those conditions, the modules were tested for I-V characteristics as well as front and back temperatures.
“The dust layer thickness averaged 25.8 μm (or 0.01936 μm mm-2) when formed on the mono-Si mini cell surface and 32.25 μm (or 0.02287 μm mm-2) when deposited on the poly-Si small cell surface,” they highlighted. “However, the same measurement technique, which relies on the emission of ultrasonic waves, was not applicable to the a-Si mini-module. This is because a metallic substrate is required for the gauge to function, and such a substrate is typically not part of the module composition in the case of a-Si PV technology.”
The research group found that the maximum drop in short circuit current and maximum power point between a clean and a dusty module happened in the scenario of the poly-Si mini-cell at 800 W/m2, outside and inside. In the field test, the short-circuit current decrease was 38.14% and 45.35% in maximum power point, while in the lab, it was 33.38% and 32.02%, respectively.
As for the temperature of the front surface, in the outdoor case, the polysilicon panel under 1,000 W/m2 irradiation displayed the most significant increase – of 3.7 C. In the indoor case, the largest temperature jump was 1.3 C, on the polysilicon module under 800 W/m2 and the a-Si module with 900 W/m2.
When calculating the rise in temperature of the back surface, the largest increase in the field was 2.3 C in the a-Si under 1,000 W/m2 case, and in the lab, it was the monocrystalline panel under the same irradiation, with 0.9 C higher temperatures compared to the clean module.
“It was observed that the outdoor setup yielded better results than the indoor setup due to the randomness and inconsistency in the latter’s results,” they emphasized. “This abnormality was attributed to the lack of a standard method for conducting laboratory-based experiments on dust deposition, which would reduce the impact of uncontrollable errors.”
Their results were presented in “Dust impact on electrical and thermal photovoltaic performance: Insights from field and laboratory experiments,” published on Energy Reports.
