The project extends an existing partnership between the two companies. Together, they installed 10 EV charging stations in remote parts of northeastern India back in 2019.
Tirex Transmission will supply its 60 kW DC fast chargers for the new Power Grid project. In addition to the high-capacity chargers, it will provide two combined charging system (CCS) output connectors. This will allow drivers to simultaneously charge their vehicles by using shared power, reducing long queues at the EV charging stations.
The chargers will be work with most electric vehicles in India. The compatible models include Tata’s Nexon and Tigor, Hyundai’s Kona, Morris Garages’ ZS, Mercedes-Benz’s EQC, Jaguar’s I-PACE, and BYD’s E6.
Tirex Transmission has had a presence in India since 2017, with more than 200 EV charging stations installed across the nation. It has supplied EV chargers to organisations such as NTPC and Ashok Leyland. It has also worked with Finland’s Fortum.

Sharp has released the NU-375KH solar panel on the Japanese market. The new monocrystalline modules are purportedly suitable for gable roofs with large installation surfaces and different roofing materials.
“The module has a 14% higher output than our conventional panels,” the Japanese electronics manufacturer said, attributing the improvements to its multi-wire technology and larger solar cells. “The number of busbars is also increased compared to our conventional products to reduce electrical resistance. By shortening the length of the finger electrodes that connect the busbars to each other, the electrical resistance of the finger electrodes is reduced and power loss is suppressed.”
The modules have a nominal power of 375 W and a power conversion efficiency of 20.4%. The open-circuit voltage is 41.08 V and the short-circuit current is 10.83 A. The panels measure 1,755 mm x 1,038 mm x 40 mm and weigh 21.5 kg.
The company said the new panels can be deployed on roofing materials such as slate, metal horizontal rooftops, and metal tile bar roofing. It recommends the use of the Smart Rack mounting system developed by Japanese specialist Takashima Co. Ltd., which it said is ideal for gable roofs.

Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) in Germany have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 46.7% for a III-V concentrating photovoltaic cell (CPV) with a four-junction architecture.
French CPV specialist Soitec, which originally developed the cell structure, achieved a 46% efficiency for one of its most powerful devices back in 2014.
“The upper tandem solar cell is made of gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) and aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs), which was bonded by Soitec onto a lower tandem solar cell made of gallium indium arsenide phosphide (GaInAsP) and gallium indium arsenide (GaInAs),” Fraunhofer ISE said. “Now an improved contact layer and a 4-layer antireflection coating were applied to the tandem cell structure in Fraunhofer ISE’s Center for High Efficiency Solar Cells.”
The cell’s previous efficiency level was 46.1%. The scientists improved it by reducing resistance losses and the reflection on the cell front side. It also implemented improvements for the metal contacts.
“Possible applications of such highly efficient tandem solar cells include concentrator photovoltaic systems, which contribute to efficient power generation in sun-rich countries,” said Stefan Glunz, division director of Photovoltaics Research at Fraunhofer ISE. “With tandem photovoltaics, it is possible to leave the limitations of single-junction solar cells behind and ultimately achieve a reduction in solar power costs.”
Fraunhofer ISE has worked on several kinds of III-V solar cells in the past. They include a 68.9%-efficient III-V solar cell for laser energy transmission systems, a 35.9%-efficient III-V triple-junction solar cell based on silicon, and a III-V tandem solar cell with an efficiency of 25.9%, among others.
