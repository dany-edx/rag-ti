The analysts estimate the current green hydrogen cost in India at INR 320-330/kg without the implementation of the recently announced National Hydrogen Policy. Policy implementation will result in a green hydrogen cost reduction by 20-30% to INR 230-240/kg, considering that banking issues are also addressed.
At this cost level, “the gap between green hydrogen and fossil-fuel-based grey hydrogen may close significantly to 25-30%, supported by policy measures as well as rising input natural gas costs (US$ 10-13/MMBTU or even higher depending on the source) driving grey hydrogen costs upwards in the immediate term.”

KPMG estimated the current grey hydrogen costs of INR 160-200/kg considering a natural gas input cost of US$ 10-13/MMBtu, possibly rising further due to the price movements seen in the immediate term. (Gas costs considered include a weighted average of Asian LNG and domestic gas costs with 50:50 split as per current consumption data for India).
The analysts said various policy and technical measures can further reduce current green hydrogen production costs [to INR 160-170/kg by 2030]. 
Launched in February, the Green Hydrogen Policy aims at boosting the domestic production of green hydrogen to 5 MTPA by 2030, half of the EU’s target of 10 MTPA, and making India an export hub for the energy source. 
The policy is focused mainly around the electricity transmission ecosystem. It provides for free and easy open access to the inter-state transmission system (ISTS), for 25 years for capacity installed by June 2025 for green hydrogen/green ammonia (GH/ GA) production. 
Renewable energy banking shall be permitted for a period of 30 days at limited charges set by state commissions. Distribution licensees shall only charge procurement charges, wheeling charges, and a small margin as determined by the state commission on electricity supplied to green hydrogen/green ammonia plants.
Among demand-side measures, renewable energy used in green hydrogen/green ammonia production shall be counted towards the renewable purchase obligation of the consuming entity. RE consumed beyond the producer’s obligation shall be counted towards the RPO of the obligated entity.
The policy includes measures for ease of setting up projects too.
The analysts highlight five critical areas of focus for policymakers that could further reduce current green hydrogen production costs.
The first is the development of a local supply chain to ensure indigenous capabilities: India may require at least 30-40 GW of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030 to address the green hydrogen opportunities. To enable self-sufficiency, it is critical that the Phase 2 of the policy brings in clarity on indigenous production of electrolyzer manufacturing and incentivizes this through production-linked incentives. Focus on innovation through promotion of domestic R&D and creation of a startup ecosystem would be extremely critical to increase efficiencies and bring down cost across the value chain.
Second, a strong alignment needs to be created between the center and states. The state regulations would need to facilitate some of the policy’s provisions, such as banking, and provide further incentives such as intrastate transmission waivers, cross-subsidy waivers, etc.
Other areas of focus are demand-side impetus; a well-built procurement policy framework to enable demand aggregation, cost reduction, and better risk management; access to finance at low cost to facilitate the development of the supply chain.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/25/aerocompact-unveils-quick-mounting-hook-for-pv-arrays-on-pitched-roofs/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 25, 2022",Aerocompact unveils quick-mounting hook for PV arrays on pitched roofs,"From pv magazine Global
Austrian mounting system provider Aerocompact has launched a quick-mounting hook for PV systems on pitched roofs.
The new device is called the CompactPITCH XT35-VLOW and is claimed to be an ideal solution for Mediterranean roof architecture, which is usually built with red roof tiles.
According to the manufacturer, the device base plate has a thickness of only 20mm, which helps the aluminum hook be optimally used with flat battens, for example with monk and nun or Portuguese tiles.
“Installers save a lot of time because the new hook, unlike standard roof hooks for pitched roofs, has two positions in the vertical plane, instead of the usual plates with serrations and screws,” the company said in a statement. “All installers have to do is push the hook from the side into the guides of the base plate – and that’s it.”

The new product is offered with both fastening screws, for simultaneous positioning and mounting, and positioning screws, for decentralized base plates or concrete anchors. “The base plate is fastened with wood screws,” it further explained. “Then the hook is fine-adjusted by moving it horizontally in one of the two guide levels. Only one wood screw is required for the final fastening.”
According to the company, the base plate can also be installed de-centrally, with a cantilevered base plate being attached to the substructure with wood screws. “The roof hook is fastened de-centrally using a hexagon socket and a threaded pin, which is clamped in the base plate by tightening it. The base plate can also easily be anchored in concrete,” said Aerocompact chief technology officer, Christian Ganahl.
If used in combination with Aerocompact’s X40-X50 mounting rail, the hook can also enable the deployment of the panels in landscape mode.
The new product comes with a 25-year warranty.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/25/solar-sectors-response-to-covid/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COVID-19,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"MARCH 25, 2022",Solar sector’s response to Covid,"The COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2019–20 when solar project deployment in India was at its height. The solar sector in general, and particularly in India, was not immune to the pandemic’s effects, and many companies were concerned about its uncertain future. 
India has set a lofty goal of attaining 100 GW of solar energy capacity by the end of 2022. It was commendable to observe how the government and solar industry reacted to the coronavirus outbreak and established a strategy to achieve its objectives. At that time, the government’s involvement was important in addressing these challenges and deciding the rate of solar energy adoption in the following years. 
However, India’s rooftop solar industry has started to gradually recover from the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the country returning to normalcy with the removal of lockdown restrictions and the relaxation of standards and regulations by the government. 
Challenges encountered by the solar industry owing to the pandemic include diminished growth possibilities due to uncertainties regarding future electricity consumption; higher offtake risk including delayed payments, PPA renegotiation and curtailment; sluggish growth in the distributed solar market due to a lack of capacity and/or a halt in assistance initiatives; the risk of rising trade barriers and conflicts; and lack of competitive financing solutions.
The Indian government declared this pandemic as a force majeure condition for project developers, citing deadlines and penalties as justification. The pandemic was expected to have an effect on solar project installations in the first part of this fiscal year, with recovery commencing only in the second half. 
Typically, the industry completes the bulk of projects before the monsoon season. However, the majority of these projects were launched six months later. The solar industry’s working capital cycle was likely disrupted, and payments were postponed. Smaller solar sector players struggled to manage their cash flow and were badly harmed, but bigger firms were able to weather the storm and recover sooner. The rooftop solar sector has been affected since these firms were small and had the financial resources to endure losses.
The ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) stated that all developers experiencing difficulties and expecting time extensions should submit formal applications to implementing agencies with documentary evidence in support of their claims, and that these applications would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The industry had been asked to produce all the necessary written evidence to support its case. As a consequence, developers had to file notices with authorities as soon as possible in order to avoid issues in the future by justifying their delays.
The RBI’s decision to grant a three-month moratorium on installment payments for all term loans and working capital loans was a major step forward. Solar developers were required to request this benefit from their lender; however, some faced a greater burden of financing costs because interest continued to accrue and was most likely payable immediately following the end of this period.
India’s power usage had plummeted since commercial and industrial activity had decreased dramatically. A number of thermal power plants were forced to retire, and with the loss of predictable electricity, there were worries about the system’s impact from a growing amount of unpredictable renewable energy generation. To avoid possible curtailment, MNRE stressed the need to have renewable energy projects operational and reiterated that all distribution businesses must make timely payments.
Despite this assertion, states such as Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have reported that they had been unable to obtain relief and subsidies. States like Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh had said that they were unable to pay generators because they were unable to collect consumer dues. As a result of delayed payments from distribution corporations, solar project developers faced cash flow issues. This eventually had an effect on solar project developer ratings in the future, resulting in higher financing costs and decreased investor trust. 
Following the current situation, there was also concern that power purchase agreements (PPAs) would be violated, which could deter the solar industry as a whole in the long run. It was crucial for the solar industry to get timely payments, which could then be reinvested in new projects, in order to keep the sector alive. 
Conclusion
The COVID-19 outbreak had a huge impact on the solar industry, with issues such as cash flow difficulties, payment collection from distribution businesses, working capital needs, workforce availability, and, most critically, supply chain disruptions. The government’s reaction to this situation was mainly positive, with the purpose of reducing the negative implications for the sector.
In the current context, India’s solar business is gradually recovering from the damaging effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, with the nation’s solar industry returning to normality after the government’s easing of norms and regulations. 
 
Solar Labs was founded by an IIT alumni in 2017 to accelerate solar adoption in the world.
