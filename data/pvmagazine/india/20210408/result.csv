The PV farm, situated in the Jaisalmer District, benefits from a power purchase agreement with the Solar Energy Corporation of India at a INR 2.49/kWh (US $0.034/kWh) tariff and will supply electricity to the state of Rajasthan. 
The plant uses monocrystalline and bifacial solar modules and state-of-the-art robotic cleaning techniques to ensure greater energy efficiency.
The 110 MW project is part of an eventual 2,300 MW of solar capacity being developed by ReNew Power in Rajasthan. The electricity generated from the balance 2190 MW capacity will be fed into the national grid.    
Speaking about the project, Sumant Sinha, founder, chairman and CEO of ReNew Power, said, “The commissioning of our solar project in Rajasthan is another step in ReNew’s ambitious solar energy program. In Rajasthan alone, we aim to commission 2,300 MW of solar power capacity by 2023. As with the Gujarat wind generation project commissioning announced in March, this milestone is an important one for both the Company and India, as we continue to build out renewable power infrastructure and move the country closer to achieving its renewable energy target.”
Founded in 2011, ReNew is India’s leading renewable energy independent power producer (IPP), and among the top 15 largest renewable IPPs globally by capacity, with a portfolio of more than 100 operational utility-scale wind and solar energy projects spread across nine Indian states. The company also owns and operates distributed solar energy projects for more than 150 commercial and industrial customers across India.
ReNew is presently the only company in the Indian renewable energy sector with over 5 GW of operational capacity. The company currently has an aggregate wind and solar capacity of close to 10 GW (including capacity won in competitive bids).

Researchers at South Korea’s Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) have achieved a new record conversion efficiency of 25.6% in a single junction perovskite solar cell.
The result edges out the previous record of 25.2% achieved in February by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and UNIST’s earlier result of 25.17% achieved in November 2020.
The cell is based on a type of metal halide perovskite called formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), which is known for its thermal stability and narrow bandgap. The scientists improved the efficiency of the cell by adding formate to the precursor materials, which served to limit the number of defects in the perovskite structure and thus boost its efficiency.
“Here we introduce an anion engineering concept that uses the pseudo-halide anion formate (HCOO−) to suppress anion-vacancy defects that are present at grain boundaries and at the surface of the perovskite films and to augment the crystallinity of the films,” the Korean-Swiss group explained, noting that the new material is able to interact with the surrounding elements.
Anion-vacancy is a material defect that occurs when a negative ion is ‘missing’ from the lattice structure of the material, leaving behind a ‘hole’, which is then occupied by an electron to maintain electric balance. When this defect occurs, electrons can remain trapped. “We broke the stereotype that only iodine or bromine ions can be used for negative ions,” researcher Kim Jin-young stated.
“The resulting solar cell devices attain a power conversion efficiency of 25.6% (certified 25.2%), have long-term operational stability (450 hours) and show intense electroluminescence with external quantum efficiencies of more than 10%,” the scientists stated, adding that the 25.2% efficiency was certified by the Newport PV Lab in Montana in the U.S.
The solar cell was described in the paper Pseudo-halide anion engineering for α-FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells, published in nature.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/08/tata-power-solar-expands-cell-and-module-capacity/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MONO PERC,KARNATAKA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 8, 2021",Tata Power Solar expands cell and module capacity,"Tata Power Solar has expanded its cell and module manufacturing capacity in Bengaluru with the addition of new lines capable of producing high-efficiency monocrystalline PERC (passivated emitter rear contact) modules. 
The manufacturer has added 230 MW of mono PERC capacity to its existing 300 MW cell lines. At the module end, it has added 180 MW of half-cut mono PERC line to existing 400 MW setup. With this, Tata Power Solar has reached aggregate capacity of 530 MW for cells and 580 MW modules. 
The manufacturer said the new lines could produce modules with bigger wafers (166-210 mm) and higher power output ranging from 440 watts to 530 watts with an option for bifacial modules. 
The manufacturer’s existing 300 MW cell manufacturing lines process both monocrystalline and polycrystalline wafers of 125mm and 156mm sizes.
The Indian solar manufacturing sector, traditionally dominated by polycrystalline technology, is gradually shifting towards high-efficiency monocrystalline modules in line with the global trend and increased domestic demand for these panels. 
JMK’s quarterly solar reports show 2020 was the first year when shipments of high-efficiency monocrystalline PERC modules in India overtook multi-crystalline modules. 
Indian manufacturers are gearing to cater to this demand with the expansion of their manufacturing lines. Earlier this year, Premier Solar announced its plans to set up a factory in Telangana with an annual cell and module production capacity of 750 MW. The factory will produce polycrystalline and mono PERC cells on wafer sizes up to 210mm.  
Rival Websol Energy Systems also plans to embrace PERC technology this fiscal year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/08/cabinet-approves-inr-4500-crore-pli-scheme-for-solar-manufacturing/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 8, 2021",Cabinet extends manufacturing incentive program to solar modules,"The cabinet has approved an extension of the national production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to include solar module manufacturing.
With an outlay of INR4500 crore, the policy is intended to incentivize manufacturers, including foreign firms, to build gigawatt scale, vertically integrated production facilities in India.
A cabinet statement about application of the program to solar module production, released yesterday, said manufacturers would be selected for incentives via competitive bidding, with cash to be disbursed in relation to high-efficiency panel sales for five years after the commissioning of manufacturing plants. The statement also said manufacturers would earn higher rewards for more efficient modules and local content but, if companies are required to bid to accept the lowest incentive payment levels, it was unclear how those two factors could be rewarded.
The government wants to incentivize the development of enough vertically-integrated factory capacity to produce 10 GW of solar panels per year, to generate investment–presumably private–of around INR17,200 crore in solar manufacturing.
The federal government said the scheme is likely to create demand for INR17,500-crore worth of ‘balance of materials’ components for solar systems. 
Photovoltaic project installation in India is highly dependent upon imported cells and modules as domestic manufacturers have limited operational capacity.
Solar manufacturers lauded the cabinet decision to approve extension of the PLI scheme.
Hitesh Doshi, chairman and MD of module company Waaree Group, said the PLI program would give impetus to Indian solar manufacturers to increase production capacity which, in turn, would stimulate sectoral and economic growth.
“[The] solar sector is highly dependent on imports, which poses risks in supply-chain resilience,” said Doshi. “The PLI scheme will help India become self-sufficient and self-reliant. And, while it puts the spotlight on domestic manufacturers, it will also make the country a key global supplier. By diverting demand to India, the domestic manufacturers will get the much-needed confidence to invest in expanding capacity. It will make the sector more operational and accessible to foreign players and enable solar manufacturers to help government achieve its clean energy targets.”
The Waaree chief added, however, additional investment would be required to create an ‘ecosystem’ encompassing the complete demand and supply value chain. 
Gyanesh Chaudhary, MD of rival module maker Vikram Solar, said approval of the PLI scheme reiterated the government’s intent to use policy to support an ‘atmanirbhar Bharat’ [self-reliant India]. Chaudhary said the PLI policy would boost domestic manufacturing and job creation, attract investment and reduce solar imports, leaving the nation poised to become a renewable energy manufacturing hub.
Vineet Mittal, chairman of solar developer Avaada Group, described the policy as a huge boost for domestic module manufacturers. “The budget outlay will certainly provide a fresh burst to R&D, that will ultimately help in adding solar capacity more cost-effectively,” he said. “This step has the potential to reduce dependence on imported PV and make the solar energy sector truly atmanirbhar.”
