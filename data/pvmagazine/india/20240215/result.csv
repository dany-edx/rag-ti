The investment is required in building capacities in solar, hydro, wind, and waste-to-energy sectors, green hydrogen (including electrolyzers), batteries, and transmission.
Das was addressing an international webinar organized by The World Bank, on the occasion of the release of the latest South Asia Development Update “Toward Faster, Cleaner Growth.”
Das said, PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, the residential rooftop solar scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is poised to elevate the rooftop solar sector to unprecedented heights in the country. The scheme will not only provide substantial benefits but also foster awareness about renewable energy among the people-at-large, contributing to India’s ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070 and energy independence by 2047.
PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, with an investment of over INR 75,000 crores, aims to light up 10 million households by providing up to 300 units of free electricity every month.
Das said, India’s rise has been a role model for renewable energy development worldwide, with several initiatives of the government such as Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO), PM-KUSUM scheme, ‘must-run’ status for RE assets, PLI scheme for solar PV manufacturing, and the allowance of up to 100% FDI under the automatic route for renewable energy.
“As India aims to become the third-largest economy in next three years and a developed country by 2047, there will be a significant energy demand to achieve energy security and energy-independence. Approximately 90% of this demand is expected to be met through renewable sources. Until sufficient energy storage for renewable energy is achieved, thermal energy will also be developed alongside,” he added.

Corporations globally announced 46 GW of solar and wind PPAs in 2023, according to the latest report from BloombergNEF.
The figure represents a record high in a calendar year and a 12% year-on-year increase from 2022. The global PPA market has now grown by about one-third on average since 2015.
BloombergNEF said improving economics in key regions such as Europe, alongside imminent company clean energy goals, were the main drivers.
“It has never been easier to buy clean energy as a corporation,” said Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability for BloombergNEF. “For the first time, a variety of contracting structures are now widely available around the world to help companies decarbonize their energy consumption. These contracts are now the centerpiece in many companies’ sustainability strategies, rather than a nice-to-have.”
Between 2022 and 2023, Europe saw its corporate PPA volumes grow 74% to 15.4 GW – by far the largest growth of any region. BloombergNEF said that as “supply chain woes eased and gas balances normalised following the region’s energy crisis in 2022, corporate PPA prices in the region dropped, often faster than power prices.”
The United States remained the largest market for PPAs, with 17.3 GW of deals announced, but was 16% down year on year on the record 20.6 GW achieved in 2022.
BloombergNEF said that economics for signing PPAs were weaker in the United States than in Europe in 2023.
“Power prices didn’t rise at the same rates, resulting in buyers holding off on signing deals until the market recalibrates,” said BloombergNEF.
Amazon was the world’s largest corporate clean energy buyer for the fourth consecutive year. It announced 8.8 GW of PPAs across 16 countries, including 5.6 GW of solar PPAs. Amazon was followed by Meta, which announced 3.1 GW of PPAs, all in solar.
BloombergNEF said companies with 100% clean energy targets under the RE100 initiative will need an additional 105 GW of solar and wind by 2030.
“With the rise of artificial intelligence, electrification of transport and increased need for manufacturing, we expect power demand from the private sector to surge in the coming years,” said Harrison. “Clean energy, especially through PPAs, will likely be many companies’ first, best option.”
Companies signed deals with more than 150 developer counterparts in 2023. French utility Engie led the way, selling 2.4 GW of deals. It was the first time Engie topped the leaderboard since 2019.
Earlier this year, a report by Mercom Capital Group found that solar companies raised $34.3 billion in corporate funding in 2023 – the largest amount in a decade.

6,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/15/malaysian-researchers-claim-reflectors-for-pv-modules-are-feasible/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-15,Malaysian researchers claim reflectors for PV modules are feasible,"Researchers by the Multimedia University in Malaysia have conducted an economic feasibility assessment of using mirror reflectors to increase power yield in photovoltaic systems.
Mirror reflectors have been widely used in the past to increase the power generation of solar modules, and they have proven to raise output by between 20% and 30% depending on the season, site of installation and type of reflector. Their application in real projects, however, is still limited due to their costs and the lack of a dedicated industry.
The research group said its work was not only intended to conduct a review of the existing PV reflectors technologies, but also to provide a system design for PV arrays using reflectors.
Prototype
The scientists deployed a system prototype at a sewage treatment site in Malaysia. The system relied on four solar modules with each a power output of 525 W, an efficiency of 20.3%, and a temperature coefficient of -0.35%/C. The reflector had a size of 2.2 m x 1 m.
They conducted a series of tests on the array between February and April 2022. Its performance was compared with that of a reference system without reflectors, with the analysis considering ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind velocity, output energy, and efficiency.
The team said the tests showed that the PV system with the reflector was able to outperform its counterpart without the reflector thanks to an increase in PV power output of 14.57%. Furthermore, it ascertained that the system equipped with the reflector was able to achieve a maximum efficiency of 25.5%, while the reference system reached only a 22.7% efficiency.
“Despite the higher wind velocity in February, which can lower PV temperature and enhance performance, the PV without a reflector installed in February exhibits inferior performance compared to the PV with a reflector installed in April,” they explained.
Economic feasibility
Their economic assessment was based on the cost-effectiveness factor (FCE), which is a parameter that must be considered when designing an enhancer such as a reflector or a cooling technology in PV systems.  It establishes if the proposed device adds sufficient power to the PV system as compared to its cost or if getting additional PV is better.
The academics estimated that reflectors for PV applications have an FCE value of 0.955. “It shows that if the cost of the reflector is converted to PV power, and then this power is added to the output of the PV system, it will be lesser than the output power from the PV with a reflector,” they explained.
They concluded that the proposed system is economically feasible under Malaysian climatic conditions. “Hence, extensive research should be conducted to improve the performance of PV reflectors,” they added.
Their findings are available in the study “An economic feasibility assessment of implementing photovoltaic module reflectors under Malaysian meteorological conditions,” published in scientific reports, the research group
