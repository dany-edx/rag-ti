The last date for bid submission is now December 28. Technical bid shall open on December 29.
The rooftop solar plants, to be set up under CAPEX mode, shall come up in various sizes. Bidders must quote minimum capacities for various categories as per the table below:

For common facilities in group housing societies/residential welfare associations (GHS/RWA), the allowed RTS capacity shall be limited up to 500 kWp (@ 10 kWp per house), with the upper limit being inclusive of individual rooftop plants already installed by individual residents in that GHS/RWA at the time of installation.
The scope of work for the empanelled vendor includes design, supply, erection, testing and commissioning including warranty, comprehensive operation & maintenance for a period of five years of grid-connected rooftop solar plants.
“The consumers under this scheme shall be free to install their projects from any empanelled vendors subject to the condition that project shall have to be installed/commissioned as per the MNRE Phase-II Guidelines and subsequent amendments,” reads the tender document.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/13/nsefi-writes-to-law-minister-on-solar-tariff-renegotiation-in-punjab/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,PUNJAB",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 13, 2021",NSEFI writes to law minister on solar tariff renegotiation in Punjab,"Industry body National Solar Energy Federation of India has approached law and justice minister Kiren Rijiju seeking his intervention to re-examine the Punjab government’s proposed bill that allows termination and renegotiation of tariffs of current operational solar projects. 
The Punjab Renewable Energy Security, Reform, Termination and Re-Determination of Power Tariff Bill, 2021 seeks to redetermine tariffs under concluded power purchase agreements (PPAs) for a total of 983.5 MW of renewable energy capacity (886 MW solar and 97.5 MW biomass). The Bill was introduced and passed in the Punjab State Assembly on November 11. After sending it to the Governor, the bill has been further referred to the President of India for his final assent.
Punjab has around 900 MW of operating solar power projects at an investment of close to INR 7,000 crore. The return for this investment is in the form of long-term power purchase agreements with a fixed tariff approved by the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission.
As per the provisions of the bill, “…all the clauses impacting tariff directly or indirectly in the Agreements shall stand terminated. Further, the agreements between power generators and Punjab Corporation, including the implementation agreements with the Punjab Energy Development Authority, shall be referred to the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission for redetermination of tariff and all A move to re-negotiate tariffs for the already operating projects will affect the viability of the projects and power producers will find it difficult to repay their loans, vendors, and staff, thereby leading to a default in their matters that impact tariff directly or indirectly in the Agreements, after considering all relevant cost parameters involved in the generation of renewable power.
To ensure continuity in the electricity supply and energy security of the State, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission shall also determine a temporary tariff rate that will be applicable until the tariff is finally re-determined by the regulatory commission.”
According to NSEFI, the promulgation of the Bill into law will be determinantal to the interests of all solar power developers operating in the state of Punjab. It will render the already operating projects unviable and power producers will find it difficult to repay their loans, vendors, and staff, thereby leading to a default in their contractual obligations. It will shadow the sector with negative investment outlook while impacting the livelihood of hundreds of people associated with these projects.”
In his letter to the minister, NSEFI chairman Pranav R. Mehta wrote the Bill is in contravention with the Electricity Act, 2003, the National Electricity Policy, 2005, and the National Tariff Policy, 2016. Further, it covers only certain specific projects from amongst the operating renewable energy projects; the Bill doesn’t provide any basis or justification for such classification.
Given RE forms a relatively small share in Punjab’s energy mix, the impact of RE power purchase on the overall power cost to the state is negligible. 
“The landed purchase cost of solar is INR 6.5/kWh against the overall total power purchase cost of INR 4.3/kWh. Considering the capacity contribution of solar in the state, the overall energy generation from solar is only over 4% against the total power consumption, the purchase cost impact being approx. INR 0.06 per kWh, which is minuscule against the negative impact that breaching of the sanctity of contracts would have on the overall sentiment of the investors across the state,” wrote Mehta.

Reaching consensus on what building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is and what makes it different from conventional rooftop PV is one of the challenges that the emerging BIPV industry has to deal with if it wants to move from niche to mainstream.
With this in mind, a group of experts from the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) put together a report that seeks to bring together piecemeal developments from different regions into a clear set of standards, and clearly defined functions for different products, in terms of their roles as both construction materials and energy generators.
The report is titled Categorization of BIPV applications; and is available on the IEA PVPS website. “By taking into account the main technical subsystems of the multifunctional building skin, the main features in terms of function, performance, morphological, structural and energy-related aspects are organized into five levels from application categories to materials,” state the report’s authors.
The five categories defined in the report stem from those outlined in the IEC standard 63092-1, Photovoltaics in buildings – Part 2: Requirements for building-integrated photovoltaic systems. The IEC’s categories define different types of BIPV system, based on area of integration and accessibility from the inside of the building. IEA PVPS further breaks these down into ‘system’ – representing the entire construction unit, ‘module’ for the active elements in energy and construction, ‘component’ for the parts making up these elements, and ‘material’ for the basic material.
At system level, the report notes three main types of BIPV system, classified as roof, facade and external integrated devices. They further break each of these down into subsections – ‘roof’ for example is split into discontinuous roofing, continuous roofing and atrium/skylight. The report’s module level category is then divided into three, based on the transparency of the element.
By clearly defining the different system elements in this way, the report hopes to bring together the interests of both PV system designers and architects – one of the key challenges to the development of BIPV. “We aspire that this paper will be able to provide a first milestone to encourage an integrated perspective and an interdisciplinary effort at the core of the BIPV field and that it will overcome some current obstacles that are still obstructing effective exchange of innovation and cooperation among all the stakeholders,” stated the authors.
