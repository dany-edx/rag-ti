https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/12/india-may-miss-2022-solar-target-of-100gw-by-27/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MICROGRID,MINIGRID,OFF-GRID SOLAR,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 12, 2022",India may miss 2022 solar target of 100GW by 27%,"India will fall well short of its installed solar capacity target of 100GW by 2022, mainly due to the slow uptake of rooftop solar, according to a new report by JMK Research and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
The report highlights rooftop solar as the pain point in India’s journey to 100GW. It projects that by December 2022, there will be a 25GW shortfall in meeting the 40GW rooftop solar target, compared to just 1.8GW in the utility-scale solar target.
As of December 2021, India had installed a cumulative solar capacity of 55GW, with grid-connected utility-scale projects contributing 77% (42.3GW) and the balance coming from grid-connected rooftop solar (20%) and mini or micro off-grid projects (3%).
The nation is expected to add another 19GW of solar capacity in 2022 – 15.8GW from utility-scale and 3.5GW from rooftop solar. This will take the cumulative utility-scale PV capacity to 58.2GW and cumulative rooftop solar capacity to 15GW by December end.
“Even with this capacity addition, about 27% of India’s 100GW solar target would be unmet,” said report co-author Jyoti Gulia, founder, JMK Research.
On the current trajectory, the report finds India’s solar target of 300GW by 2030 will be off the mark by about 86GW.
“Utility-scale solar capacity addition is on track. India is set to achieve nearly 97% of its 60GW target,” said Gulia. “This makes it imperative to have a more concerted effort towards expanding rooftop solar.”
The report states headwinds ranging from pandemic-induced supply chain disruption to deeply rooted policy restrictions have impeded the growth of India’s rooftop solar (onsite solar power) and open-access solar (offsite solar) installations.
“The anticipated 27GW shortfall from the 2022 solar target can be attributed to a string of challenges which are slowing overall progress on renewable energy targets,” said co-author Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist and Lead India, IEEFA.
These challenges include regulatory roadblocks, net metering limits, the twin burdens of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported cells and modules and issues with the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), unsigned power supply agreements (PSAs), banking restrictions, financing issues, delays in or rejection of open-access approval grants, and the unpredictability of future open-access charges.
“Central and state government policies and regulations must be aligned to support the solar sector overall, and especially the ailing rooftop and open access segments of the market,” said co-author Akhil Thayillam, senior research associate, JMK Research.
The report proposes short- and long-term measures to get India back on track to meet solar targets.
Short-term measures include uniform policies to be applied nationally for at least the next five years, consistent regulations for net metering and banking facilities, and revocation of restrictions on the banking of renewable energy at least until rooftop and open-access state targets are achieved.
Long-term measures include stricter enforcement of the renewable purchase obligation; improved financial health, and potentially privatization, of distribution companies (discoms); reduced cross-subsidy surcharge for commercial and industrial consumers; and a capital subsidy for battery energy storage systems.
“In rooftop solar, state-level efforts such as Gujarat’s Surya Scheme need to be replicated by other states in the short-term to help in boosting capacity,” said Gulia.
“It is also likely that the government, in the short-term, will push aggressively for expediting solar capacity addition to achieve the 100GW target by 2022 by re-allocating some of the unmet rooftop target to utility-scale generation.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/12/itp-group-opens-100mwh-lithium-battery-factory/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,HARYANA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 12, 2022",ITP Group opens 100MWh lithium battery factory,"Haryana-based electronics manufacturer Indian Technological Products (ITP) has announced the opening of a lithium battery factory in Gurgaon, which has the capacity to produce 100MWh of battery storage annually. The plant will produce lithium batteries for solar, energy storage, and electric vehicle applications.
Ajay Gupta, chief operating officer, ITP, told pv magazine, “The plant will be processing both nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistries to begin with. We will also explore other chemistries as we move ahead in our journey.”
The cells for the battery packs will be sourced from tier-1 listed companies in China and from Europe for critical applications, said Gupta.
ITP plans to increase the plant capacity to 200MWh/annum by December end of this year.
“This [100MWh] is just the first phase. We plan to bring many strong design-based solutions for off-grid and electric vehicles by the end of 2022, and it will also include a further doubling of the capacity,” said Gupta.
The plant has been operational since April 10. The battery packs, sold under the Wakai brand, will pass through rigorous tests and simulations to ensure the desired performance for the targeted applications.
Chairman B.M. Vaish said, “Once again, ITP has moved forward by manufacturing lithium batteries to meet the high expectations of their customers. The batteries will be made using the latest technology, a full understanding of the process by a committed and highly disciplined workforce. This will ensure high quality.”
Managing director Anil Batra added, “Energy generation and consumption systems are transforming rapidly, keeping in mind challenges posed by climate change. ITP Energy is an active participant in this process and focuses on providing safe, sustainable, and compact lithium-ion-based batteries for solar, e- mobility, and energy storage applications. ITP’s new advanced manufacturing facility, which will produce the WAKAI range, is an important step in this direction.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/12/pure-solid-state-batteries-from-switzerland/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,SOLAR PANEL CLEANING,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 12, 2022",Pure solid state batteries from Switzerland,"From pv magazine Global
Swiss startup Swiss Clean Battery (SCB) AG said this week that it will build a gigafactory to produce pure solid-state batteries at its headquarters in Teufen, Switzerland.
“With production scaling from 1.2 GWh to 7.6 GWH, SCB AG will serve both the Swiss domestic and international markets with sustainable battery storage from 2024,” the company said. “In the first production phase of 1.2 GWH, SCB AG is planning sales of CHF 318 million ($340 million). For this, CHF 246 million investment volume in the machinery is planned.  In this first stage, SCB AG employs 181 people. A production area of 20,000 m2 will be built in order to manufacture 7.2 million battery cells per year.”
COO Thomas Lützenrath said the batteries will have several competitive advantages compared to conventional lithium-ion storage.
“Conventional lithium-ion batteries age because a covering layer is formed on their anodes through charging and discharging. This grows over time and with each use, even faster the more intensively the battery is used. This growth of the top layer consumes capacity and increases the internal resistance, and the performance of the battery decreases,” he told pv magazine.
By contrast, a very thin top layer in the pure solid-state batteries is formed during the first charge, said Lützenrath.
“After that, it doesn’t grow anymore,” he explained. “By using our protected electrolyte made of a solid ion conductor, the internal resistance and capacity will remain virtually constant over the service life. No matter how much the battery is used.”
The battery technology does not require any critical raw materials such as cobalt or gold.
“As a result of this and the extreme service life, the environmental balance can be improved by more than half compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries,” Lützenrath explained. “The predecessor technology of the solid-state battery – still on a liquid basis – has already completed more than 50,000 charging cycles in practical use in the USA in a battery storage system for buffering the power grid. This liquid predecessor technology has already been produced on an industrial scale.”
The core of the storage technology is the solid ion conductor, which replaces conventional liquid electrolytes.
“A central, technical problem is to bring the fixed ion conductor in the battery cells into a stable connection with the electrodes. After more than 30 years of basic research, it has now been possible to solve this problem,” said Lützenrath.
He said many research projects are based on a modular design, which means that individual parts are combined outside the cell and inserted into the housing, with technical problems occurring during the transition of ions at the material boundaries, between the anode, the solid ion conductor and cathode.
“Our solid-state battery is different, as the fixed ion conductor is formed in the battery cell itself, similar to a multi-component adhesive, like two components glue,” said Lützenrath, without providing more technical details.
SCB said that its market value currently stands at CHF 13 billion and that it will launch an initial public offering on the Zurich stock exchange in October.
“In the final phase, SCB AG is to produce 7.6 GWH, with an investment sum of CHF 775 million and a turnover of over CHF 2 billion. Approximately 100,000 m2 of production area will be built for this purpose. At this stage of expansion, SCB AG will produce nearly 48 million battery cells per year with 1,061 employees.  The company will then be worth CHF 8.6 billion,” said the company.
Solid-state batteries could be the most promising of the many different routes pursued by researchers to improve on today’s battery energy storage technologies. And many in the industry are optimistic that the approach will eventually bring about a “step change” in battery technology, greatly improving the capacity, lifetime and safety of lithium-ion batteries.
Swapping out the current generation of liquid/gel electrolytes with a solid material could eliminate any fire risk from the battery, as well as improving energy-to-weight ratios and removing the additional “energy redundant” packaging materials required to hold a liquid, among several other advantages.
The key development though is that the solid electrolyte would allow for the use of a lithium-metal anode, with far higher energy density than the graphite that’s commonly used today. Though there is research into integrating lithium-metal with liquid or semisolid electrolytes, all-solid-state is viewed by many as the best approach.
