Japan (MHI) and its arm Mitsubishi Power India to demonstrate the feasibility for hydrogen co-firing blended with natural gas in MHI’s 701D gas turbines installed at NTPC Auraiya gas power plant in Uttar Pradesh.
The Auraiya Gas Power Plant has cumulative installed capacity of 663 MW with four gas turbines operating in combined-cycle mode.
“Hydrogen co-firing in gas turbines can play a key role in reducing CO2 emissions. NTPC is exploring various new hydrogen generation technologies along with hydrogen usage so as to ensure future readiness, develop the required capabilities, and technical expertise, and align with the national decarbonizing and hydrogen mission targets,” stated NTPC.
Under this MoU, NTPC and MHI will collaborate to carry out the study and identify key actions for introducing hydrogen co-firing at NTPC Auraiya gas-based combined cycle power plant. The study will identify key actions for co-firing for various percentages of hydrogen such as 5%, 15%, 30%, 50%, and 100%. NTPC will supply the hydrogen required for the project.

Ltd (APDCL) to develop 1 GW of floating solar project in Assam. The proposed project will be built with an estimated investment of INR 6,000 crore ($728.54 million) and come up on various wetlands in the state.
The MoU is part of the agreement between the two parties to develop renewable energy generation in the state.
“In days to come, the aim is reach 5 GW floating power project capacity as the actual agreement [with SJVN Green Energy] translates into reality,” said Himanta Biswa Sarma, chief minister of Assam.
SJVN Green Energy will develop the 1 GW floating PV project in a joint venture with APDCL. It will hold a 51% stake in the JV with APDCL owning the balance 49%.
“Recently, the Assam govt signed another MoU with NLC Ltd for producing 1 GW of solar power. It has also received funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to generate another 1 GW of solar power in-house without any partner. The project will be developed by APDCL with funding support from ADB,” said Sarma.

The company is currently identifying land parcels for these projects.
“These proposed plants in renewable energy and green hydrogen will involve an investment of more than INR 60,000 crore,” said Sudhir Mehta, chairman, Torrent Group, at the investors summit in Rajasthan, announcing the company’s strategy to enter into new energy areas of green hydrogen and battery energy storage systems as well as pumped hydro storage.
Torrent Power is one of the largest private-sector companies in the Indian power sector, with a presence across the entire power value chain of generation, transmission, and distribution.
As of June 30, 2022, Torrent Power had an installed power generation capacity of 2.73 GW from gas-based plants, 804.5 MW wind, 362 MW coal, and 263 MW solar.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/17/global-polysilicon-capacity-could-hit-536-gw-by-end-of-2023/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 17, 2022",Global polysilicon capacity could hit 536 GW by end of 2023,"From pv magazine Global
In its PV supplier report for the second quarter of 2022, solar and storage advisory Clean Energy Associates (CEA) said that polysilicon production capacity could reach 295 GW by the end of 2022, and 536 GW by the end of 2023.
CEA said it expects this production capacity to far exceed solar installations next year. While this may suggest that supply problems could begin to be alleviated, CEA said PV module capacity expansion is slowing. Many manufacturers are instead expanding cell production capacity, in support of the n-type TOPCon and HJT manufacturing trends.
Ingot capacity grew almost 30 GW in the second quarter, said CEA. It attributed this to two facilities that brought 23 GW online. Wafer capacity decreased slightly, said CEA, primarily because a major undisclosed supplier retired its multicrystalline wafer capacity. The 17 suppliers covered in the report boosted cell capacity by 22% in the second quarter of 2022, bringing 47 GW of capacity online, reaching a total of 262 GW.
PV module production reached 324 GW in the second quarter. CEA said it expects this could expand by 20% by this end of the year to reach 400 GW.
Only seven suppliers covered by the CEA report are fully vertically integrated from ingot to module production. Most of the others operate at the cell and module link in the supply chain.
“With growing merchant wafer options, there is little need for most suppliers to expand upstream,” said CEA.
It said suppliers are working to optimize wafer sizes after the industry standardized 210 mm (G12) and 182 mm (M10) module dimensions. The “182 mm Plus” (182P) has increased wafer heights to further reduce “white space” caused by intercell gaps to achieve up to 5 W of additional output, said CEA. The “210 mm Reduced” (210R) slashed wafer widths for niche rooftop applications at the expense of power output. CEA said it expects new module sizes for the residential solar market to be introduced.
Many analysts have predicted China will break 100 GW of installations this year. CEA expects slightly lower installations in China during 2022 due to high module prices impacting utility-scale projects. It said many investment decisions have been deferred, as projects could not meet their internal rate of return thresholds.
Most of the polysilicon supply chain originates in China. Outside of China, production capacities are 11 GW of ingots, 42 GW of cells, and 50 GW of modules. By the end of 2023, these capacities are expected to expand to 23 GW, 73 GW, and 74 GW, respectively.
“Policy uncertainties continue to defer expansion plans of suppliers as they remain cautious due to lingering policy uncertainty in the United States surrounding the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and anticircumvention investigation,” said CEA.

The record-breaking run in power prices, particularly in Europe, is creating a favorable investment case for solar and wind projects, making it increasingly compelling to develop renewable assets purely based on project economics.
According to Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy, current spot prices in Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom would all result in payback of 12 months or less. Considering the average monthly spot prices for August in these countries were all well over €400/MWh and the relatively low operating costs of renewables, investing in utility-scale projects appear to be a no-brainer.
For instance, for a generic 250 MW solar project, assuming a long-term electricity price of €50/MWh ($49/MWh), the expected post tax return is approximately 6% with a payback period of 11 years, Rystad calculates. A price of €350/MWh or above results in a payback period of only one year while a price of approximately €180 – the European Commission’s proposed price threshold results in the payback time of five to six years.

Investors are seeing the opportunity. According to Rystad, capital investments in renewables have increased significantly and are set to reach $494 billion in 2022, outstripping upstream oil and gas at $446 billion for the year.
“Capital investments in renewables are set to outstrip oil and gas for the first time this year as countries scramble to source secure and affordable energy,” says Michael Sarich, senior vice president, Rystad Energy. “Investments into renewables are likely to increase further moving forward as renewable project payback times shorten to less than a year in some cases.”
Rise of storage
High energy prices but also newly adopted climate legislation, including the US inflation Reduction Act and European Union’s REPowerEU plan, are expected to give a big boost to the global energy storage market.
In its latest forecast, BloombergNEF says that energy storage installations around the world are projected to reach a cumulative 411 GW/1,194 GWh by 2030. That is 15 times the 27 GW/56 GWh of storage that was online at the end of 2021.
Driven by recent policy developments, BNEF has revised its previous estimates up by 13% from the ones presented in its 2H 2022 Energy Storage Market Outlook. This is equal to an extra 46 GW/145 GWh. While an estimated 387 GW/1,143 GWh will be added from 2022 to 2030, supply chain constraints will cloud deployment expectations until 2024, says BNEF.

The United States and China are set to remain the two largest markets, representing more than half of global storage installations by the end of the decade. Europe, however, is catching up with a significant ramp-up in capacity, driven by the current energy crisis.
BNEF’s forecast suggests that the majority of energy storage build by 2030, equivalent to 61% of megawatts, will be to provide energy shifting – that is, advancing or delaying the time of electricity dispatch. Co-located renewables-plus-storage projects, in particular solar-plus-storage, are becoming commonplace throughout the world, notes BNEF.
