The company is going to set up a 500 MW per year TopCon module manufacturing facility in Atlanta, Georgia, and expects its US factory to start production by June next year.
Rayzon’s entry to the USA comes at a time when Indian PV module exports to global markets, especially USA, have seen a massive jump. And the solar sector is seeing a spectacular expansion in India and other nations.
Chirag Nakrani, director of Rayzon Solar, told pv magazine that their decision to enter the USA solar market was majorly driven by the immense PV installation potential in the USA: “Several major and small firms have thought about entering the solar market as a result of the sector’s spectacular expansion in India and other nations. The U.S. residential solar PV market size was valued at $14.21 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.3% from 2023 to 2030. The US solar energy market is expected to record a CAGR of 17.32% during the period 2022-27, reaching a solar installed capacity of 270 GW by 2027.”

“The potential is significant given the growing push by the federal and state governments to double the deployment of solar power over the next five years. The majority of other capital investments are fundamentally different for [from] solar energy. Lenders and insurers are aware of its minimal risk. The DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) has developed several financial scenarios to grow new PV manufacturing capacity in the United States. All of this prompted Rayzon Solar to develop an expansion strategy,” Nakrani added.
Rayzon Solar said advancements in PV cell manufacturing technology, high manufacturing efficiency, and superior semiconductor behavior would help them keep the manufacturing costs to a minimum.
Rayzon Solar was incorporated in 2017 by Chirag Nakrani along with Hardik Kothiya. Currently, it has a mono PERC capacity of 1.5 GW in India and exports to 17 countries. The company is going to increase its manufacturing capacity in India to 2.5 GW by December this year with the addition of a 1 GW line equipped to produce mono PERC and TopCon modules.

With this feat, it has emerged as the fastest-growing utility-scale renewable EPC company.
Jakson Green is developing a pipeline of renewable energy, green hydrogen, and green ammonia projects, both in India and abroad. Its India portfolio includes a recent deal with one of the world’s leading renewable energy asset managers to build India’s largest commercial & industrial (C&I) solar park in Bikaner, Rajasthan. Globally, it is also set to execute turnkey EPC for large-scale energy storage co-located with some of its RE projects bagged from leading renewable energy producers.
The company said it has an impressive order book within the green hydrogen and new energies EPC business, with projects catering to several applications ranging from the displacement of grey hydrogen with green hydrogen at process plants to the production of methanol from flue gas CO2 and hydrogen-for-mobility applications. 
Jakson Green is promoted and led by Bikesh Ogra, a renewable sector veteran with over 10 GW of experience across 26 countries. The company plans to deliver 5 GW of renewable energy assets by 2025 and 10 GW by 2030. It also plans to enter the electrolyzer manufacturing space, besides building and operating green hydrogen assets globally.

MU Ionic Solutions is a JV between Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. (MCC) and UBE Corp. and is a group company of The Mitsubishi Chemical Group, a Japanese conglomerate. The group is one of the global leaders in electrolytes used in lithium-ion batteries with a strong track record of 30 years and has five electrolyte manufacturing plants located in Japan, the USA, the UK, and China.
As per the terms of the agreement, Neogen will obtain the license to MUIS’ proprietary and confidential manufacturing technology, for making electrolyte solutions at its manufacturing facility in India. Neogen facility will have a planned installed capacity of up to 30,000 MT per annum. These electrolytes will be targeted by Neogen to meet the growing demand of lithium-ion cell manufacturers in India.
The agreement will allow Neogen to ensure that the manufacturing plant meets stringent global standards for quality, reliability, safety and efficiency for electrolyte production. It will also help Neogen greatly reduce approval times with lithium-ion battery makers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/11/rock-based-thermal-energy-storage-production-moves-into-gigawatt-scale/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 11, 2023",Rock-based thermal energy storage production moves into gigawatt scale,"From pv magazine Global
Thermal energy storage (TES) has shown great potential to contribute to the decarbonization of global heat and power. But while the technology has attracted funding and early commercialized installations, it has largely failed to scale well.
Israel-based Brenmiller is looking set to become one of the first companies in this field to establish a full gigawatt-scale production by the year’s end. “Our 4 GW to 5 GW automated production line in Diona will be switched on in one to two months from now,” Brenmiller’s CBO Doron Brenmiller tells pv magazine.
The equipment purchase was financed through a non-dilutive EUR 7.5 million ($8.2 million) credit facility with the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Brenmiller’s bGen system heat crushes rocks and then stores that thermal energy for minutes, hours, or days. The stored heat energy can be used to produce energy in the form of steam for electricity, water, or hot air for industrial applications. The bGen system is said to be low maintenance, with a lifespan of more than 30 years.
“Our levelized cost of heat (LCOH) depends on what is charging the system. Typically, this is cheap renewable energy, so our LCOH stands between 30-50 $/MWh, which makes it cheaper than gas today in most places in Europe,” Brenmiller says.
According to him, the company has managed to find immediate partners in the chemicals, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and tabacco industries which consume massive amounts of heat that typically represents 60-70% of their energy consumption. “Cement and steel industries are a bit more challenging for us, as we operate in the 150 – 500 degrees C range, and these industries need higher temperatures for their industrial processes,” he adds.
The company has also partnered with large energy companies and IPPs such as Enel. In November last year, the Italian energy group started testing a 24 MWh TES system in Tuscany both as power-to-heat equipment and a thermal storage. In this first-of-a-kind application, the TES is integrated with a combined cycle gas turbine power plant to increase its overall flexibility.
“In the last couple of years, we have seen a huge uptick in demand for our technology and we already have a gigawatt-scale pipeline of projects. But it took us a long time to get there, we have invested more than half a million of dollars over the last 10 years,” Brenmiller say.
Due to the high shipment costs for its technology, the company’s strategy is to produce locally – either close to raw materials or project locations. “We are already in discussions in different markets in Europe, specifically Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, but also in Brazil, to establish manufacturing facilities there,” he says.
“Today, it’s not all about lithium-based storage technologies. We see a lot of tenders starting go out for TES solutions and companies are proactively approaching us. There is a significant change in the market compared to two-three years ago,” Brenmiller says.
According to a report from the Long-Duration Energy Storage Council and McKinsey & Co. released in November last year, TES can expand the overall installed capacity potential of long-duration energy storage (LDES) to between 2 and 8 TW by 2040 (versus 1 to 3 TW without TES), which translates to a cumulative investment of $1.6 trillion to $2.5 trillion.
“TES enables this additional LDES opportunity by providing a cost-efficient alternative to decarbonizing heat and high-temperature heating applications. This is estimated to reduce system costs by up to $540 billion per year while creating broader system value by enabling an accelerated renewables build-out and optimization of grid utilization,” the report reads.
