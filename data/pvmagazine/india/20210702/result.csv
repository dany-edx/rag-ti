The scheme was earlier scheduled to run until April 2022.
The FAME II program was implemented from April 1, 2019 and provided an outlay of Rs 10,000 crore (US$ 1.3 billion) over a period of three years to drive electric mobility in India. It aims to drive 10 lakh electric two-wheelers, 5 lakh electric three-wheelers, 55,000 four-wheelers, and 7,000 buses as well as establishing 2,700 charging stations such that one is available every three square kilometers.
As of September 2020, the FAME II program had incentivized 5,595 electric buses at a cost of around Rs2,800 crore. Further, it authorized Rs500 crore to fund 2,636 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in 62 cities across 24 state and union territories.
Among some latest amendments issued to the Scheme, the government has announced that demand aggregation will be the key method for bringing the upfront cost of 3W EV at an affordable level and at par with ICE 3-wheelers. EESL will aggregate the demand for 3 lakh electric 3-wheelers for multiple user segments. For electric buses, 4-million-plus cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Surat, and Pune) will be targeted. EESL will aggregate demand in these nine cities for remaining e-buses under the Scheme on an OPEX basis. 
Further, the incentives limit for electric 2-wheelers has been increased to 40% of the vehicle cost.

An international research team has developed a novel concept of gravitational energy storage based on buoyancy, that can be used in locations with deep sea floors and applied to both the storage of offshore wind power and compressed hydrogen.
Called Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST), the proposed technology is defined as an alternative to pumped-hydro storage for coasts and islands without mountains that are close to deep waters. It consists of using stored renewable electricity to power a motor that lowers a compressed gas recipient and then generating electricity by releasing the compressed gas recipient to rise back to the surface through the water.
“The system is a low-cost, long-term solution for storing compressed green hydrogen produced with solar power or renewable electricity generated by large scale offshore wind facilities,” research co-author, Julian David Hunt, told pv magazine, noting that the use of BEST is interesting for offshore wind power plants, as these should operate in weekly energy circles and be able to store energy for four days and then generate electricity for another four days.
“Regarding the use of buoyancy energy storage for floating solar panels, even though there might be potential for this technology, as it is located close to the deep sea, it would be cheaper to store energy with batteries, as it only requires daily energy storage,” he further explained. “In other words, BEST systems are expensive for storing energy for 12 hours but are cheap to store energy for four days.”
The proposed system uses air or hydrogen as compression gases to fill the recipient, which can be shaped as a series of balloons or tanks. The buoyancy force is exerted by the gas as it has a smaller density than the water. The recipient is connected to the motor and the anchor, located on the ocean’s depths, through a cable and pulleys. “The cable is stored in a cylinder attached to the motor/generator when the buoyancy recipient is lowered,” the scientists explained. “The pulleys also contribute to increasing the speed of the cables and lowering the forces applied to the motor/generator.”
The cost of the cable is pointed out as a possible limiting factor for the technology at this, initial stage, due to its long length and the robustness it has to show. The anchor, on the other hand, must also be built with extreme robustness, as it must sustain the high buoyancy forces created by the gas recipient. “The anchor would be made of steel and screwed to the bottom of the ocean with a system similar to an oil rig,” the group explained. “The weight of the ground where the forces are applied should be larger than the buoyancy force of the recipient.”
The system is able to increase or decrease the speed of the buoyancy recipient depending on the storage needs, and a velocity of 0.01m/s is considered ideal to minimize losses due to friction. The recipient must be built with holes to allow water to penetrate it when it is lowered and the pressure increases. When the recipient is raised, the pressure difference increases and water is pushed out. “Given the rapid reduction in volume of the compressed gas in the first ten to 100m from the surface, the installation of the system requires the support of a ship on the surface to lower the system to the minimum operation depth and then introduce the pressurized compressed gas to the system,” the research team further explained.
The system can operate at a maximum depth of around 10,000m and pressure of 1,000 bars and a minimum depth of around 3,000m and pressure of 300 bars. “If the designed minimum pressure of the system is smaller, the volume of the gas will reduce substantially, reducing the energy storage potential of the system,” the academics emphasized. “If the designed minimum pressure increases, the altitude variation in which the system can operate reduces, reducing the energy storage potential.”
When combined with offshore wind, the proposed system can store electricity at an investment cost of between €50 and €100/kWh while, when utilized for compressing hydrogen, it is said to improve compression efficiency to up to 90%, according to the research group. To achieve a lower cost, the system can also be combined with battery storage, especially if the capital costs of the latter will further drop in the future. “Thus, the combination of both systems will offer an energy storage solution with low cost of stored energy ($/MWh) and low cost of power capacity ($/MW),” it further explained. “[The] BEST system operates slowly but [can] constantly charge and discharge in a weekly cycle while the battery will rapidly charge and discharge in a six to 24-hour cycle.”
The scientists recognized that this kind of storage has so far been studied on a theoretical level and that only small, lab-scale experiments were conducted. Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, the USA, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Cuba, Jamaica, Guatemala, Honduras, Brazil, Portugal, Oman, South Africa, Madagascar and Somalia, Ivory Coast and Ghana were pointed out as the most suitable locations for this storage technology.
It was presented in the paper Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology: An energy storage solution for islands, coastal regions, offshore wind power and hydrogen compression, published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The research team included scientists from Brazil’s Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul; the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), in Austria; and the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, in Germany.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/02/solar-photovoltaic-quality-control-and-waste-management-in-india/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,QUALITY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"JULY 2, 2021",Solar photovoltaic quality control and waste management in India ,"India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has announced a new target to generate 450 GW of electricity from renewable energy sources by the year 2030, with about 300 GW coming from solar photovoltaic (PV). Earlier, 100 GW solar PV installations were planned under the target of 175 GW of renewable energy sources by the year 2022. 
Considering further growth in the future, India needs quality infrastructure in place for the solar photovoltaic system and related solar PV waste management at the earliest. The solar module waste is estimated to grow to 1.8 million tonnes annually by the year 2050 in India.   
MNRE is the regulatory body for the policy framework related to new and renewable energy sources, including the solar photovoltaic. Gurugram-based National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE), an autonomous institution of MNRE, provides testing, certification and standardization, monitoring, and evaluation by NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) accredited solar photovoltaic module testing laboratory. New Delhi-based Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI) is another institution of MNRE under public-sector undertaking that primarily facilitates the implementation of the National Solar Mission of India to achieve the target set therein. 
As per new guidelines of MNRE, testing laboratories must be accredited by both NABL and BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards). This requirement is fulfilled by only a few laboratories like NISE, Gurugram; TUV Rheinland (India), Bengaluru; UL, Bengaluru; Electrical Research & Development Association (ERDA), Gujrat; HiPhysix, Pune; Electronics Test Laboratory (ERTL), Kolkata; and Electronics Test and Development Centre (ETDC), Bengaluru. 
PV module design and performance evaluation test should be as per the international standards (IEC 61215 /IEC 61646 and IEC 61730-1 & 2) or equivalent Indian standards (IS 14286/16077/61730). 
Testing capacities of all these centers may not be sufficient to fulfill the Indian market needs, given the expected growth of PV installations by 2030 and perhaps beyond. Usually, the requisite number of solar panel production batches should be tested to ensure quality. The situation calls for the strengthening of the capacity of accredited testing and calibration facilities in the country. 
Mentioning the traceability chain involved in the measurement should also be made mandatory on all test certificates. 
CSIR-NPL (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – National Physical Laboratory), being National Measurement Institute (NMI) of India, maintains all primary standards for SI units and establishes the primary criterion for solar cell calibration with financial support from MNRE.     
Usually, solar modules are provided with a 25-year linear performance guarantee for their output peak watt capacity, which should not be less than 80% at the end of 25 years. This means a degradation rate of < 0.8% per year. In some instances, the stability may reach close to 50 years with 90-95% of peak power, meaning a degradation rate of just < 0.4% per year.  
However, a study done by NISE in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay on PV module degradation observed an alarmingly high degradation rate of 2-5%. This means the life of these panels will be reduced by 40-50%, and the panels would last for 10-12 years only. 
As these installed panels may not complete their projected life of 20-25 years, there may be adverse financial implications with huge revenue loss. This may also create early-loss PV waste.  
The majority of these solar PV installations employed cost-effective imported panels, perhaps at the cost of quality. There is a need to adopt a proper way to dispose of these panels at the end of their life to avoid a harmful impact on the environment. 
The fundamental reason behind the fast degradation of PV modules may be a lack of quality check of the imported cells and modules in the country of their origin and perhaps an absence of the revalidation mechanism at Indian test centers. Usually, PV modules are tested as per the conditions suiting the western part of the globe. Non-traceability of testing and calibration parameters/equipment as per Indian environmental conditions is also a major hindrance in ensuring quality checks.    
Moreover, photovoltaic panels are not so green if not suitably handled in an environment-friendly manner after their end of life. Disposal of scrapped PV systems will become a major problem in coming years, given progressing huge installations in India.  
The situation calls for establishing an infrastructure for environment-friendly recovery of valuable materials from scrapped photovoltaic modules. Constant R&D efforts are required towards exploring efficient and cost-effective processes for the recovery of useful materials from used solar modules. India lacks a large-scale workable solution to this upcoming problem. Innovating efficient, cost-effective, and environment-friendly processes for recycling and reusing PV system materials is a key challenge before researchers and needs to be looked upon as a social responsibility by all stakeholders. 
Research institutes and companies in various countries are working on developing efficient recycling processes for PV modules. A French company called Velia is working on a mega project to develop a unique and efficient method for solar module recycling. 
Back home, SOFIES India and Poseidon Solar are working on solar waste projects in India. CSIR-NPL has also recently initiated the work on recycling silicon solar waste. Based on its ongoing efforts, it is looking to create a quality procedure report for solar system recycling.   
The European Union (EU) has included PV components under electronic devices in the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive in the year 2012 and set an international benchmark in waste management rule. Other countries are also coming out with some solar PV waste management rules.  
However, India doesn’t have any clear-cut policy on dealing with solar PV waste. Though there is a mention of solar waste recycling in the India Solar Mission Program, it lacks clear-cut policy and rules to be followed.
The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) is the authority for policy-making of waste management in India. It has notified the new Solid Waste Management Rules 2018, encompassing plastic waste, electronic waste, biomedical waste, and construction and demolition waste, but there is no mention of solar waste. This rule has an important clause like Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) registration and electronic waste collection targets for all the producers, which should also be applied to solar industries.  
As PV waste is set to rise rapidly in the coming decades, India needs to invest in efficient recycling technologies and devise a clear-cut policy for the safe disposal of PV waste. Guidelines for stringent quality checks and validation for both imported and locally produced solar panels are also needed to avoid early-loss solar waste. There is also a need to create awareness about the safe disposal of solar waste.
