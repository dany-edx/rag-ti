The company signed an agreement today with the Government of Gujarat for the proposed investment in the State. 
Reliance Industries will invest INR 5 lakh crore (US$67.6 billion) in the State over 10 to 15 years to set up 100 GW renewable energy power plant and green hydrogen eco-system. 
“RIL will develop an eco-system for assisting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and encourage entrepreneurs to embrace new technologies and innovations leading to captive use of renewable energy and green hydrogen,” read the company statement. 
Reliance Industries has already started scouting land for a 100 GW renewable energy power project in Kutch, Banaskantha, and Dholera. It has sought 4.5 lakh acres of land in Kutch.
RIL will invest another INR 60,000 crore (US$8.1 billion) in setting up manufacturing facilities for new and renewable energy equipment. This includes fully vertically integrated polysilicon-to-solar module fab and manufacturing of electrolyzers, energy-storage batteries, and fuel cells. 
Besides, INR 25,000 crore (US$ 3.38 billion) investments will be made by RIL in existing projects and new ventures over the next three to five years. The company statement didn’t mention the businesses covered under this investment.

Excluding large hydro, the nation’s total clean power capacity stood at 104.87GW on December 31, including 40GW of wind; 10.2GW of biomass; 4.8GW of small hydro projects, with generation capacities up to and including 25MW; and 400MW of waste-to-energy incinerators.
With India’s 46.5GW of large hydro plants included, the nation’s renewable energy capacity was 151.4GW, according to the Central Electricity Authority.
With the figures including only off-grid installations added since July, however, the real volume of India’s clean power facilities is even higher.
The nation has been assessed by the National Institute of Solar Energy as having around 750GWp of solar capacity potential, based on land availability and solar irradiation, and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is attempting to resolve land and grid connection and capacity obstacles as India targets 500GW of non fossil fuel generation capacity this decade.

The project entails the development, financing, construction, and operation of the 400kV Lessos–Loosuk and 220kV Kisumu–Musaga transmission lines under a public-private partnership (PPP) framework. When completed, the project will be the first independent power transmission (IPT) in Kenya.
The project will improve both the supply and reliability of power transmission in Western Kenya.
In this development partnership, PowerGrid will provide technical and operational know-how to the project, while Africa50 will bring its project development and finance expertise and will act as a bridge between the Kenyan government and private investors.
Signing on behalf of PowerGrid, chairman and managing director, K. Sreekant, said, ”Transmission plays an important role in bringing efficiency in the entire electricity supply chain. A robust transmission network not only imparts reliability and security to the electricity grid but also allows non-discriminatory access to buyers and sellers which spurs the competition that results in competitive electricity prices to the ultimate consumer.”
“PowerGrid hopes that the present transmission project in Kenya shall serve as a model for undertaking more such projects in Kenya as well as other African countries. PowerGrid, with its rich technical and managerial experience in undertaking transmission systems under PPP mode, shall be pleased to be associated in this journey.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/13/chinese-fish-pond-hosts-550-mw-solar-farm/,"FLOATING SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 13, 2022",Chinese fish pond hosts 550 MW solar farm,"From pv magazine International
Chinese power transmission and distribution equipment provider Chint Group has recently completed a 550 MW solar plant deployed on a fish pond in Wenzhou, a city with a subtropical maritime monsoon climate in China’s Zhejiang province.
According to the project developers, the area is characterized by high temperatures and rain in summer and frequent typhoon, high-salt and high-humidity climatic conditions at the seaside bring many challenges to the photovoltaic plant.
The facility covers an area of approximately 4,933,333.3 square meters on a beach in the Oufei Enclosed Area, South Zhejiang Industrial Cluster. It was built with around 1.4 million glass-glass monocrystalline solar modules with a power output of 450 W each provided by Chint’s Astronergy unit.
The project combines PV power and fish farming to make better use of the available space in the sea, according to Chint.

Inverter manufacturer Kstar announced it provided its GSM3125C-MV35 inverter turnkey solutions for the project.
“The 550MW solar fishing plant is the biggest in Asia,” a spokesperson from Kstar told pv magazine. “And it is connected to the network of State Grid Corporation of China.
“The GSM3125C-MV35 inverter solution was chosen to ensure the plant’s long-term operational stability, given the inverter’s strong anti-corrosion protection level and reliable performance,” the spokesperson went on to say, noting that the solution is equipped with IP54 protection level, C5 anti-corrosion, Anti-PID and PID recovery, and is especially suitable for offshore PV power generation with high temperature, high humidity, and high salt fog area. “It also includes an energy storage interface, which is convenient for potential future upgrading of the system.”
