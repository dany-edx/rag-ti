The Waaree modules use Borealis’ proprietary Quentys encapsulant film, which is said to provide superior resistance to ultraviolet rays, a low rate of water vapor transmission, and no acetic acid or potential induced degradation (PID). Borealis claims its Quentys encapsulant film considerably improves the reliability and durability of photovoltaic modules and thus offer an improved rate of return.
The rooftop solar plant would be located at Borealis operations in Monza, and meet the electricity requirements for production at the plant. The plant is expected to become operational by the third quarter of 2021. The amount of clean energy thus generated will save nearly 90 tons of CO2 emissions per year, the rough equivalent of having planted around 4,000 trees.
The Monza installation is the first of several solar projects planned for Borealis production operations, each of which will move the company closer to its goal of sourcing 50% of all electricity it consumes from renewable sources by the year 2030.
The PV modules used in the Borealis Monza installation have been certified according to the solar module standards of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), an association that publishes global standards for a variety of electrical technologies, including solar.
The modules used in Monza are also in conformance with the Italian Fire Class certification UNI 9177.

NDMC will buy the solar power at an INR 2.44/kWh (US$ 0.033/kWh) tariff for 25 years if SJVN develops the capacity under the CPSU scheme. 
SJVN plans to bid for 1 GW out of 5 GW grid-connected solar capacity tendered by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (IREDA) under the third tranche of CPSU scheme Phase II.
State-owned power generators are required to develop this capacity on a build-own-operate basis—either for self-consumption or use by other government entities—using India-made cells and modules. The solar electricity can be supplied to the beneficiary either directly or via power distribution companies on mutually agreed charges.
Under the Scheme, government producers are provided a viability gap funding (VGF) to cover the cost difference between domestic and imported solar cells and modules.
The selection of the producer would be made using the VGF amount as a bid parameter. The maximum permissible VGF is set as INR 55 lakh (US$ 75,451) per megawatt. 
In a pre-bid arrangement, SJVN has tied up with NDMC to sell power from its solar projects.
SJVN diversified into solar power generation with the commissioning of its first solar project in Charanka Solar Park, Gujarat, in 2017. The power producer has recently tied up with the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE), an R&D institution under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, to get the feasibility analysis done for its solar, wind, and hybrid projects.
As per a statement issued yesterday, NIWE would support SJVN to assess the feasibility and techno-commercial aspects of solar, wind, hybrid (wind and solar), and hybrid (wind, solar, and battery storage) energy projects and preparation of detailed project reports, estimates and bid documents covering all relevant aspects from concept to commissioning of these projects of SJVN.

The manufacturer’s existing facility has a solar panel capacity of 500 MW. The expansion of 2 GW has been planned in two stages. The 1 GW capacity planned in the first phase is slated to become operational by September end this year. The second phase of production will start by the end of March next year.
Goldi Solar’s new facility will also see a production line implementing a first-of-its-kind micro-gap module technology (MGMT). It will produce modules with a gap of less than 0.75 mm between the cells in the string instead of the standard 1.5 mm. This would ensure better coverage, resulting in improved productivity and higher outputs.
The line will produce mono-facial and bi-facial modules with peak power outputs exceeding 500 W and 600 W, respectively. It will implement M10 ((182mm x 182mm) wafer size, multi-busbars (MBB), and PERC solar cell technology.

French environmental services provider Veolia is leading a research project which is aimed at developing a highly efficient and special process for the recycling of solar modules.
Through the ReProSolar initiative, which the EU is funding with €4.8 million through the EIT Raw Materials pot, the company and its partners from the public and private sectors who operate along the value chain of recycling solar modules are seeking, for the first time, to recover all components of a solar panel at the end of its life cycle.
The consortium hopes to develop a process that allows recovery of pure silicon, silver and glass and makes them be made usable, again, for industrial sectors of different kinds.
Funding for the project began in February and runs until January 2025. The feasibility of the process on an industrial scale will be tested by the partner companies Flaxres, operating in Dresden, Germany; and Rosi Solar – headquartered in Grenoble, France – by the end of the year.
According to Veolia, around 5,000 tons of solar modules will be processed in a demonstration plant, annually, by 2023. “Our process is based on a new delamination technology that is able to efficiently separate the solar cells from the glass plate,” explained project manager Antoine Driancourt, of Veolia Umweltservice GmbH. “Innovative physical-chemical processes will then enable all materials to be recovered without the photovoltaic modules having to be shredded.”
According to the French company, no industrial process in the world is able, to date, to recover silver and silicon with very high purity from solar cells. “This would be a major breakthrough for the entire solar industry in terms of current recycling standards,” said Driancourt. With the project partners, Veolia will map the entire value chain, from processing and raw material cleaning to the waste stream supply chain and reintegration into various industries.
