EESL signed this MoU with Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle Joint Business Council (IMT-GT JBC) Malaysia at the ongoing India Energy Week.
As part of this strategic partnership, EESL will provide technical advisory, project management support, contracting and implementation support to execute select energy efficiency programmes from its portfolio with proven track records of successful implementation.
EESL will implement rooftop solar, LED street lights, electric mobility, UJALA, and building energy efficiency programmes in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.
EESL will also collaborate with IMT-GT JBC Malaysia to identify opportunities for saving energy and lowering carbon emissions. Additionally, the IMT-GT JBC Malaysia will identify other new interventions to achieve its targets under Green City Action Plans 2022-25 and assist EESL for various sector-led negotiations as well as provide support for the successful rollout of energy

The developers for this PV capacity tendered under Phase XIX will be selected through e-bidding followed by an e-reverse auction process. GUVNL may enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful developers.
The developers shall set up the solar project, including the electrical network up to the delivery point. The minimum project capacity is 25 MW.
The projects can be located anywhere in India. The developer can opt for connectivity at the State Transmission Utility (STU) or the Central Transmission Utility (CTU) sub-station in case the project is set up in the State of Gujarat. In case the project is set up outside Gujarat, the developer shall opt for connectivity with the CTU/ISTS grid.
“Projects under construction and not having any PPA with existing buyers shall also be eligible to participate in the tender. Solar projects can also be set up in an existing wind farm which is already connected to the grid, subject to the availability of spare capacity for RE integration at the corresponding GETCO/CTU substation,” reads the tender document.

Polysilicon prices have increased since the start of the year, after a relatively long period of decline in the latter months of 2022, according to the silicon branch of the CNMIA.
Monocrystalline silicon currently sells at an average price of CNY 217.5 ($32.30)/kg, with prices ranging from CNY 200/kg to CNY 232/kg. This is 31.02% higher that the levels registered in mid-January.
The CNMIA said that polycrystalline silicon is being priced at an average of CNY 215.2/kg, with prices ranging from CNY 198/kg to CNY 230/kg, up 31.22% from mid-January.
After China’s recent new year holiday, wafer manufacturers returned to high operation rates in order to handle downstream orders. As a result, they quickly consumed all polysilicon in stock, according to the CNMIA. This contributed to a tense supply situation and higher prices.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/07/reflective-membrane-to-increase-albedo-power-yield-in-bifacial-pv-projects/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023","Reflective membrane to increase albedo, power yield in bifacial PV projects","From pv magazine Global
Germany-based company Solmax Geosynthetics GmbH, which supplies “geosynthetic drainage geocomposites” has developed a material that reportedly increases the albedo of the surface below a PV power plant by around 70%, allowing more light to reach the rear side of bifacial modules. The material was initially designed for environmental protection by containing chemicals and hazardous waste.
“The increased albedo results in additional irradiance reaching the back of the module,” the company’s value engineer EMEA, Douglas Sutherland, told pv magazine. “The amount of irradiance will depend on the geometric characteristics of the plant.”
Called Geolux, the new product consists of a reflective geomembrane made of polyethylene resins and coated with a thin white polyethylene layer that reflects ultraviolet (UV) rays. According to the manufacturer, the material is inert and will not cause any chemical reaction with the ground.
“Geolux can improve the energy yield between 5 to 20% which means an equivalent levelized cost of energy (LCOE) reduction of around 2% to 5%,” Sutherland claims. “In the end, the main limiter for the extra energy benefit is the AC capacity. The question is now whether it is convenient or not to modify the AC capacity. This must be addressed by performing a trade-off between the extra energy generated and the costs associated with the AC capacity increase.”
According to Sutherland, developers could evaluate the impact of the new product at the early stages of project development using the albedo-app function in the PVradar software. “Design parameters such as the AC capacity can be optimized to ensure that the PV plant owners get the most out of the albedo enhancement,” the manufacturer said.
At least two persons are needed to install the membrane and a sharp blade such as a Stanley knife is needed to cut it. Gripple pins are used to ensure the material is held firmly in place.
In terms of total project costs, the new product would mean $0.024/W of additional Capex. “Using our experience on a 500 MW project in the Middle East, accounting for recent inflation, it would cost approximately $12 million for the entire project,” Sutherland said. “It was $8 million two years ago and hopefully prices will drop again in the future.”
Sutherland further notes that the material also prevents weed growth beneath the modules, offering significant O&M savings.
