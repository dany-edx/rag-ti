Rooftop solar too saw a 41% quarter-on-quarter growth with about 580 MW added during the period, according to a JMK Research report. 
With this, India has reached about 46.3 GW of installed solar capacity as of September 30.
JMK analysts expect a substantial surge in PV commissioning as the year draws to a close. About 3.5 GW of new utility-scale solar and 1 GW of hybrid capacity is likely to be added in the fourth quarter (October-November-December period). 
With this, India will have approximately 10 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity installed in 2021. Whereas, annual rooftop solar capacity addition is expected to be around 3 GW.
According to the JMK report, about 3.5 GW of central and string inverters and 3.1 GW of modules were shipped in India in the third quarter. Sineng was the leading supplier in the central inverter category and Huawei led string inverter shipments. Longi was the most preferred module supplier contributing about 33% share of the total shipments. High-efficiency mono PERC modules continued to be the most preferred type, accounting for more than 66% of the overall module shipments in the third quarter.
In terms of auction concluded in Q3 2021, NTPC won the maximum solar capacity of 2,225 MW followed by SJVN (1,200 MW) and NHPC (1,000 MW). Wind-solar hybrid capacities were awarded to NTPC (450 MW), Ayana Renewable (450 MW), Azure (350 MW), and Tata Power (300 MW).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/30/the-outlook-for-residential-rooftop-solar-in-india/,"COST AND PRICES,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 30, 2021",The outlook for residential rooftop solar in India,"Household rooftop solar in India is seeing a gradual improvement after almost stagnant annual growth of 100-200 MW until fiscal year 2020, according to a report from consultant Bridge To India.  
The document cites subsidies paid under a Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) scheme as the main enabler for residential PV uptake.
The MNRE’s grid-connected rooftop solar program is aiming for residential installation of 4 GW by December next year. Now in its second phase, the scheme offers a 40% subsidy for the first 3 kW of generation capacity in rooftop systems and then a 20% subsidy up to a 10 kW ceiling. The program is being delivered at state level by electricity distribution companies. 
The Bridge to India report says the market outlook is also becoming positive due to a steady improvement in consumer awareness, affordability, financial viability, and financing options, as well as the entry of large organized solar installers.
“Free net metering in most states also strengthens [the] investment case for residential rooftop solar,” stated the report. “The average marginal tariff for a household with monthly consumption of 300 kWh in 15 states – accounting for 90% of [typical] residential consumption – is INR7.18/kWh, effectively yielding an investment IRR [internal rate of return] of 8.3% for [a] 3 kW system.”
The study estimates the target market for domestic solar will hit around 52 million households by 2030 – 10% of urban independent households. Bridge to India forecasts residential PV generation capacity will reach 16.2 GW by 2030, under a medium scenario that assumes a 5% annual decline in system cost and a 3% annual fall in grid tariffs. That calculation took into account state-wise, bottom-up analysis of the market in view of prevailing grid tariffs, demographics, the number of independent houses, and the financial viability of residential solar.
The report estimates India had installed 1,292 MW of residential rooftop PV as of June. That accounted for only 17% of total rooftop solar capacity – which can also include commercial and industrial arrays – and just 2.9% of the nation’s total solar capacity.
Only around 0.4% of independent urban homes – 400,000 – have installed rooftop solar. The major deterrents have been consumer inhibition and low awareness about the technical, financial, and operational aspects of installations, according to Bridge to India. 
“Rooftop solar is not deemed as an essential purchase, because of improving … reliability of grid power,” stated the document. “A significant proportion of the urban, affluent population does not, also, have access to rooftop rights, or is unwilling to make a long-term cost commitment. Households attach a very high financial ([because of the potential] ability to expand the building vertically) and/or social value ([using the] space for leisure or games [and] utility needs) to rooftop [space], where available, restricting growth prospects.” 
A net capital cost – after the 40% upfront MNRE subsidy for sub-3 kW arrays – is currently estimated as NR 32,000/ kWp, assuming a module cost of INR18.7/Wp. That figure is within the affordability threshold of 67 million urban independent households, according to the consultant. However, added the report, cost increases, arising from more expensive panels; import duties including basic customs duty of 25% on cells and a 40% levy due from April; and a general sales tax set at 5-12%, could potentially dampen the rooftop market.
This copy was amended on 01/12/21 after Bridge to India changed its estimated net capital cost for MNRE-subsidized, sub-3 kW arrays from INR53,000/kWp to INR32,000/kWp.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/30/micro-inverters-vs-string-central-inverters/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,WORLD",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 30, 2021",Micro-inverters vs. string/central inverters,"From pv magazine International
A group of researchers from the University of Limoges has compared the performance ratio (PR) of PV systems equipped with micro-inverters to that of installations relying on central or string inverters at several locations across France. Surprisingly, the study finds that micro-inverters do not perform better.
The PR is a parameter that defines the relationship between the actual and expected power production of a PV system, and is largely unrelated to an installation’s location or orientation. This value is used to understand how efficiently the PV system is operating.
The researchers initially analyzed all advantages and disadvantages of an installation with micro-inverters or central/string inverters, and said that micro-inverters should offer an advantage on many points, including price. “We must also consider the lifespans of this equipment, which is a little less than 10 years for a central inverter and can reach 30 years for a micro-inverter,” they further explained. “Micro-inverters also appear to be better suited to reducing the impact of losses that can occur in solar panels whether due to shading or panel malfunction.”
These assumptions were evaluated by analyzing 200 PV installations located in France. The work considered their actual production of solar energy, as well as the orientation, the inclination, the peak power, the geographical area, and other factors. “In order to carry out a statistical study on the PR, 200 data sets were recovered: 100 for installations with Enphase M210, M215, M250 and IQ7 microinverters and 100 with installations using SMA SunnyBoy 3000, SunnyBoy 5000 inverters and Sunny Tripower STP 8000,” the academics explained. “Of the 100 systems, 50 are SunnyBoy 3000 (input power 3.2 kW), 25 are SunnyBoy 5000 (input power 5.2 kW) and 25 are Sunny Tripower STP 8000 (input power 8, 2 kW).”
The average capacity of the installations relying on micro-inverters was 3.8 kW and that of the second category was 5 kW.
The analysis showed that micro-inverters are more sensitive to environmental factors. Furthermore, the scientists found that the size of a PV system doesn’t have an influence on the performance of either micro-inverters or inverters.
“According to the production data, the performance ratio is ultimately almost identical for installations with inverters or micro-inverters,” the French group emphasized. “The PR is around 79% for both the average facility equipped with micro-inverters and the average for other facilities.” It also reported slight growth in the PR with lower irradiance for both micro-inverter and central/string devices, which could depend on the inclination and orientation of the panels or the geographical area.
“Finally, the results show a homogeneity of the performance ratio between the two technologies despite different operations,” the academics concluded. “However, even if the performance ratio is identical between inverters and micro-inverters, micro-inverters are still to be favored because of their lifespans and their prices.” They go on to explain that microinverters may not be replaced for an entire 25 year module lifetime, and that they allow stakeholders to better guarantee the safety of the installation even in the event of fire.
Their findings were presented in the paper Performance ratio of photovoltaic installations in France Comparison between inverters and micro-inverters, which was recently published in the Journal of King Saud University – Engineering Sciences.
