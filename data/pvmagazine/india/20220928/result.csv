The dual-glass, 210mm module is designed for utility-scale projects in India. It offers a maximum power output of 685 W with up to 22.1% conversion efficiency.  
Trina Solar also exhibited the upgraded Vertex 19R series, which features the latest 210R rectangular silicon wafer technology to boost single-module power by up to 30W. It comes in horizontal packing, is compatible with most inverter models on the market, and also achieves a higher DC/AC ratio at the system level, making it ideal for commercial and industrial rooftop projects.
 TrinaTracker, the tracker business unit of Trina Solar, displayed the Vanguard 1P, a 1-in-portrait tracker designed to be fully compatible with the ultra-high-power modules ranging from 400 W to 670 W typically installed in utility projects. The company said that the tracker could be deployed across a wide range of different terrains while offering high stability and ensuring high energy yield.

The Indian solar manufacturer and developer says it will expand its cumulative module capacity to 1 GW in five to six months, from 500 MW at present. It aims to have 2 GW of cumulative, operational cell and module capacity by the end of 2024. 
The company also has ambitious plans for green hydrogen, green ammonia, and electrolyzer production. It is now in talks with leading alkaline electrolyzer technology suppliers to start electrolyzer production under a joint venture. 
“Jakson has a very concerted focus on green hydrogen and green ammonia production, and fuel cells for mobility as well as energy needs,” Bikesh Ogra, managing director and chief executive officer of Jakson, told pv magazine at Renewable Energy India Expo 2022, a three-day event which kicked off today in Greater Noida. “We have plans for utility-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production down the road. And we are in discussions in multiple Indian states and geographies outside India, wherein we would like to get into utility-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production.”
Green hydrogen is challenging in terms of transportability and storage at the utility scale, which is why Jakson is also looking at distributed-generation green hydrogen and on-site ammonia. It believes this will be far more economical and practical. In this space, the company is exploring biomass gasification-based green hydrogen generation projects with an individual capacity of 2.5 tons to 5 tons per day.
