The company secured new orders of INR 5,971 crore, a 10% increase over the same period last year. Profit after tax stood at INR 463 crore (11% of revenue).
The first quarter of FY 2024 included significant gain of INR 103 crore due to positive effects of foreign exchange and commodities.
Sunil Mathur, managing director and chief executive officer, Siemens Limited, said, “While strong revenues came in from our digital industries, smart infrastructure and mobility businesses, our order income growth came from our energy business driven primarily by our transmission business. There was a decline in new orders in our digital industries automation business on account of destocking following normalization in demand. We expect this to normalize from Q3 onwards. Capex demand across segments, largely driven by Capex spending in public infrastructure, continues to be good. Private Capex is also beginning to pick up.”
Siemens Ltd focuses on industry, infrastructure, transport as well as transmission and generation of electrical power. It is the flagship listed company of Siemens AG in India. As of September 30, 2023, Siemens Ltd had revenue from continuing operations of INR 17,701 crore and 8,888 employees.

The list currently comprises only domestic solar OEMs and includes modules with an efficiency equal to or greater than 19%.
The ALMM requirement was mandated by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) through its order dated 02.01.2019, to protect the consumer interests and ensure larger energy security of the country as solar PV power installations are generally set up for a period of 25 years and solar PV cells and modules used in plants require long term warranty.
The order was put under abeyance for FY 2023-24.
“The scale-up in domestic module manufacturing capacity over the past 12 months is expected to improve the availability of modules from domestic OEMs. However, the sector would remain dependent on imports for sourcing solar PV cells and wafers, given the limited cell manufacturing capacity and lack of wafer capacity in India. In this context, setting up fully integrated units awarded under the production-linked incentive (PLI) remains important to reduce dependence on imports,” Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Group Head – Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd, told pv magazine.
From the IPP’s perspective, the earlier order exempted projects commissioning till March 31, 2024, from the ALMM requirement. “The Government has now relaxed this provision to a certain extent and has allowed ALMM exemption for projects which are in advanced stages of construction and wherein the order for modules (including the opening of letter of credit) is placed before March 31, 2024. This provides relief for IPPs with advanced progress in development and with expected commissioning post-March 31, 2024,” Kadam said.
Also, the order allows ALMM exemption for open access-based and captive solar projects, enabling these projects to source modules from the most cost-competitive sources. “Based on the prevailing cost of imported solar PV cells and modules, the sourcing of imported modules is relatively cheaper than the cost of sourcing modules from domestic OEMs after accounting for the import duties,” shared Kadam.

South Korean conglomerate LG has unveiled a new storage system for residential applications. The enblock E system is available in two versions, with usable energy capacities of 12.4 kWh and 15.5 kW.
“With just a few millimeters required on each side, the storage cabinet is not limited in any way when it comes to installation,” the company said in a statement. “Thanks to the IP55 protection class, enblock E can be operated in the cellar as well as in the garage without any problems.”
The system features lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) cells manufactured by the group’s LG Energy Solutions unit. It is also compatible with inverters from major producers such as Fronius, Kostal, GoodWe and SMA.
The smaller model has a usable energy capacity of 12.4 kWh and a battery capacity of 56.6 Ah. The voltage range is between 180.0 V and 262.8 V, while the nominal voltage is 231.8 V.
The system’s maximum charge-discharge current is 36.5 A and the maximum charge-discharge power is 6.2 kW. The battery pack’s roundtrip efficiency is more than 95%.
The larger product offers a usable energy capacity of 15.5 kWh and the same battery capacity as the smaller product. The voltage range is between 225.0 V and 328.5 V, while the nominal voltage is 289.8 V.
The system’s maximum charge-discharge current is 36.5 A and the maximum charge-discharge power is 7.7 kW. The battery pack’s roundtrip efficiency is more than 96%.
The two different models measure 451 mm x 330 mm, which enables easy deployment in the “furthest” corners, said the manufacturer.
“Owners of a PV system can integrate enblock E on the DC side with a new solar system or retrofit an existing solar system on the AC side,” said LG. “If the originally installed storage capacity is not sufficient, enblock E allows an additional storage module to be retrofitted up to two years after commissioning.”

Researchers from Portugal have studied the viability of agrivoltaics in the country as a way of addressing the need for both energy and food security for the world’s population. According to the group, Portugal has good climate characteristics for solar production and approximately 12% of Portugal’s national territory is designated as RAN (National Agriculture Reserve) and has the sole purpose of being used for agriculture.
“With the recent gathering of countries to discuss the future of energy, it was established in PNEC (Plano Nacional Energia e Clima) that Portugal will have around 8 GW of solar energy, around 4 times the value that it is producing today, which means that it is required a lot of investment and land availability to reach this objective,” the researchers explained, citing the potential for installing solar PV parks in RAN territory.
The group found that agrivoltaic systems can achieve a payback time of five years or less and generate more value than only PV systems or only agricultural production on the land. Additionally, in studying two types of layouts – one with elevated panels and one using spaced rows of panels – the researchers noted that the spaced solution has a slightly higher potential than the elevated one.
The team included a regular PV implementation for comparison and studied scenarios where all the energy produced by the panels was directly sold to the market using a calculated value. The analysis assumed that the farmer has a PPA and sells the energy at €0.043 ($0.046.34)/kWh. Monocrystalline silicon solar cells were chosen for the PV systems. To determine the payback period, various parameters were selected using PVsyst software, including initial investment and O&M costs and energy sales prices.
For the spaced PV project layout, a pitch distance of 20 m was used, creating a minimum of 15 m of space between the two rows of eight modules each, for a total of 16 modules. The modules had a 55% to -55% tilt angle, and trackers were used to follow the sun’s movement and optimize the power output. In the elevated PV array layout, all 16 modules were installed in a single-row series to reduce shadowing on the crops beneath them. Again, a 55% to -55% tilt angle was chosen, using trackers. However, in the Valverdinho installation, the terrain created too much shadowing, so the tilt angle was adjusted to 45% and -45%.
The analysis required the team to select which crops would be used, one of which needed to be “shadow-friendly” due to the shading from the elevated modules. “Thus lettuce was chosen, fitting the requirements and being produced in all national territory of Portugal. The other two crops, although being a bit less shadow-affectionate, are tomatoes and potatoes,” the group noted.
The results of the research indicated that the proposed projects had a lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE) than the energy price in the Iberian market, with payback periods of around 4-5 years.
The group’s findings are available in the paper “Agri-PV in Portugal: How to combine agriculture and photovoltaic production,” published in Energy for Sustainable Development. Members of the group included researchers from the University of Lisboa and the Military Academy.
