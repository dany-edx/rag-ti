“Coal-fired power simply cannot compete with the ongoing cost reductions of renewables. Solar tariffs in India are now below even the fuel costs of running most existing coal-fired power plants,” said author Kashish Shah, Research Analyst at Ieefa.
Compared to renewables with practically zero marginal generation costs, coal-fired generation with inflationary coal and coal transportation costs is a significantly expensive option for Discoms. The continued financial distress in India’s power distribution sector makes thermal power purchase agreements (PPAs) even more unbankable.
Given these issues, investors’ interest in the coal sector is already waning.
“In the last 12 months, no new coal-fired power plants have been announced, and there has been no movement in the 29 GW of preconstruction capacity. This reflects the lack of financing available for new coal-fired power projects, and also the flattening of electricity demand growth, which has impacted coal the most,” Shah added.
Despite these headwinds, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) still projects India will reach 267 GW of coal-fired capacity by 2030, which would require adding 58 GW of net new capacity additions – or about 6.4 GW annually.
Ieefa note points out it is “highly improbable” that the CEA’s projections will materialize given the ongoing financial and operational stress in the thermal power sector and puts the case that India’s coal capacity requirements should be urgently revised.
“Any projections for India’s future generation mix should take into account that new coal-fired power plants are likely to become stranded assets,” said Shah.
“The new capacity would only be economically viable if it replaced end-of-life, polluting power plants with outdated combustion technology and locations remote to coal mines.
“Even then, there would need to be sufficient coal plant flexibility to deliver power into periods of peak demand, and the time-of-day pricing would need to be high enough to justify the low over-the-day utilization rates,” Shah added.

The selected vendor shall also be responsible for the installation and commissioning of the PCUs.
Each PCU block must have a minimum power rating of 2 MW. 
To be eligible, the vendor should have supplied a minimum 500 MW cumulative capacity of central inverters/PCUs for PV power plants in the last four years, and commissioned at least 25 MW cumulative capacity of 1500V central inverters/PCUs.
The total quantity of 500 MW will be shared between two vendors. The manufacturer quoting the lowest price (L1) will get to supply 330 MW (170 MW+160 MW). The second-lowest bidding vendor will supply the remaining 170 MW if it accepts the L1 price.

As a first step, the company expects to have moved to 100% fossil-free electricity by the end of 2021. It has also announced a target to halve CO2 emissions along the value chain by 2030 and is working closely with suppliers to achieve this. Other 2030 planet-oriented targets include halving waste disposed and reducing freshwater usage by 25%.
“We see ourselves as a key enabler of a sustainable energy future and are playing our part in the fight against global warming,” said N Venu, Managing Director and CEO of Hitachi ABB Power Grids in India. “To get closer toward a carbon-neutral future, means that we have to start by strengthening our own environmental, social and governance practices. Electricity will be the backbone of the entire energy system and we are working on electrified, reliable, and decarbonized operations and products.”
The company aims to be at the front of enabling the clean energy transition for its customers too with revolutionary technologies like electric-bus fast-charging. Recently, it tied up with Ashok Leyland under an e-bus pilot at IIT Madras campus to support sustainable in-campus commuting for students and staff. It expects the pilot to be running in a couple of months from now.
Under the project, Hitachi ABB Power Grids will provide its innovative flash-charging technology for the e-bus provided by Ashok Leyland. IIT Madras will host the infrastructure required to operate the flash-charging system for the e-bus.
Headquartered in Switzerland, Hitachi ABB Power Grids serves utility, industry and infrastructure customers across the value chain, and emerging areas like sustainable mobility, smart cities, energy storage and data centers. The company prides itself on making in India for India and the world for over six decades. More than 80% of its portfolio today is locally manufactured.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/04/nano-micro-scale-cooler-for-solar-modules/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 4, 2021",Nano-micro-scale cooler for solar modules,"From pv magazine International
Scientists from the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH) in Greece have developed a solar module cooling technique based on radiative cooling and micro-scale patterning.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from its environment and less than the energy it radiates. When this happens, the surface loses heat to the outer space and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
Presented in the study Combined nano and micro structuring for enhanced radiative cooling and efficiency of photovoltaic cells, published in scientific reports, the novel system consists of a thin glass radiative cooler designed in nano- and micro-scaled periodic patterns. This device, according to the researchers, can be placed on top of a solar cell to reduce its operating temperature and, at the same time, achieve high optical transparency and high thermal emission.
The coating is based on a two-dimensional subwavelength nanostructured grating, which is imprinted in soda-lime glass and has enhanced mid-infrared emissivity, and a micro-structured grating. “The microscale patterning enhances cooler’s performance in the atmospheric transparency window while the nanopatterning further enhances the optical radiation absorption,” the academics explained. “The combined enhancement is possible because the emissivity enhancement provided by the micro-grating in the thermal wavelengths is not affected by the nano-grating and vice versa.”
The two gratings can be manufactured through laser-induced structuring. “Due to the nature of laser-processing technology, the patterned surfaces can be easily scaled up to large areas that could be used to enhance the light-harvesting in solar cells,” the research team emphasized, adding that the gratings can be realized not only as binary devices but also with appropriate structures of different shapes.
A silicon nitride (Si3N4) anti-reflective coating was also placed on top of the wafer to increase absorptivity. “When we place the nano-micro-grating coating on top of this structure, it results in a higher Si solar absorption of around 0.92%,” the academics further explained. This was achieved, according to them, without increasing the complexity of the cell design.
When the thin radiative cooling coating was placed on top of a silicon wafer, sunlight absorption in silicon increased by around 25.4%. “Temperature reduction and efficiency enhancement was also achieved when we applied the proposed cooler in realistic Si-based solar cells,” the Greek team added.  The temperature decrease provided by the nano-micro-grating coating compared to the bare doped silicon was found to be approximately up to 5.8 degrees Celsius.
When it was tested on a commercial solar cell, the cooling technique was found to improve its yield by around 3.0%. “Thus, our findings can significantly impact the PV industry, as well as other radiative cooling applications,” the scientists concluded.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from France’s Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon (INL), the Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.
