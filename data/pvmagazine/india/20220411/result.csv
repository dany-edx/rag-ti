China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Australia will propel the regional APAC market, according to a new report by data and analytics company GlobalData.
Bhavana Sri Pullagura, a senior power analyst at GlobalData, attributes the growth in the battery storage market to a “fall in battery technology prices, increasing need for grid stability and resilience of the integration of renewable power in the power market.” 
China, one of the fastest-growing economies, is expected to lead the global battery energy storage market with a $4.04-billion share in 2026. A mammoth target of 1,200 GW of wind and solar capacity will provide considerable growth opportunities to the energy storage market over the forecast period.

Besides China, South Korea, the US, Germany, and the UK will be the major markets on the back of supportive regulations and incentives.
Other countries will also see a buoyant demand due to the rapid growth in demand for electricity and the wider use of renewable integration. Grid transformations, improving electrification rates, and electricity provisions for the rapidly growing population will create market opportunities, explained Pullagura.
Over the last decade, various new digital and smart technologies have been integrated. Countries have been aggressively promoting grid modernization and enhancing the grid capability to meet the present and future requirements. Additionally, batteries are being deployed to aid smart grids, integrate renewables, create responsive electricity markets, provide ancillary services, and enhance both system resilience and energy self-sufficiency.
Pullagura concludes: “GlobalData believes that encouraging policies and high electricity charges are also nudging the market to renewables and storage plus renewables at the end consumer level. As the power sector evolves to accommodate new technologies and adapt to varying market trends, energy storage will play a crucial role in the transition and transformation of the power sector.”

Methane, the primary constituent of natural gas, is more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the climate system. Blending piped natural gas with renewable hydrogen offers a solution to lower the greenhouse gas emission. However, it is still under study how much hydrogen can be blended with the pipeline natural gas without influencing the combustion and cooking performance, whether the cooking appliances will require any modification, and the impact on cost.  
With a view to decarbonizing the cooking sector, India’s premier energy utility NTPC and city gas distribution company Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL) have joined hands on the blending of green hydrogen in piped natural gas. 
Green hydrogen will be produced using electricity from the existing 1MW floating solar project of NTPC Kawas. This will be blended with piped natural gas in a predetermined proportion and used for cooking applications in NTPC Kawas Township.
Initially, the percentage of hydrogen blending in the PNG shall be around 5%, and after successful completion, it shall be further increased.
NTPC, which has an installed power capacity of 69 GW with a diversified fuel mix, plans to achieve 60 GW of RE in a decade and is executing several pilot projects in the green hydrogen space.
GGL is India’s largest city gas distributor and has a presence across 43 districts in six states and one union territory.

Researchers from Stanford University constructed a photovoltaic cell with a thermoelectric generator that harvests energy even in the dark. The solar PV cell has both a hot and a cold side that generates voltage and current from the outgoing heat flow from the solar cell and the surrounding air.
The researchers conducted their work based on the premise that the outgoing heat flow occurs during both day and night, and harvesting that heat could generate power at night. They constructed a device that integrates a PV cell with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) module, and the result is that the solar cell generates power from daytime solar radiation while the TEG generates power from radiative cooling during nighttime. An added benefit is that it generates extra daytime power from solar heating of the PV cell.

“You want the thermoelectric to have very good contact with both the cold side, which is the solar cell, and the hot side, which is the ambient environment,” said author Sid Assawaworrarit. “If you don’t have that, you’re not going to get much power out of it.”
The team demonstrated not only that it can generate power from the device at night, bu that during the day, it runs in reverse and contributes additional power to the conventional solar cell. They achieved 50 mW/m2 nighttime power generation with a clear night sky, with an open-circuit voltage of 100 mV, which is orders of magnitude higher as compared with previous demonstrations, the researchers report.
The setup could be incorporated within existing solar cells. It is simple to construct and uses basic, off-the-shelf components, the researchers say, making it possible to put it together in remote locations.
“The most expensive thing in the whole setup was the thermoelectric itself,” said author Zunaid Omair.
Using electricity at night for lighting requires a few watts of power. The current device generates 50 milliwatts per square meter, which means lighting would require about 20 square meters of photovoltaic area.
“None of these components were specifically engineered for this purpose,” said author Shanhui Fan. “So, I think there’s room for improvement, in the sense that, if one really engineered each of these components for our purpose, I think the performance could be better.”
The next step in their work is to optimize the thermal insulation and thermoelectric components of the device, and they’re looking at improving the solar cell itself to enhance the radiative cooling performance while maintaining its solar energy harvesting capability.
The paper “Nighttime electric power generation at a density of 50mW/m2 via radiative cooling of a photovoltaic cell” is published in Applied Physics Letters, by AIP Publishing,

Germany’s Bosch has developed a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system for commercial and industrial applications and is preparing a production ramp-up in 2024. The SOFC system can run on natural gas, biomethane, hydrogen or different blendings, with an electrical efficiency of more than 60% and an overall efficiency of more than 85%.
“Our SOFC system is primarily used to produce electrical energy but can also produce thermal energy at temperature levels that can be used for heating or cooling,” Marcus Spickermann, senior vice president of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) at Bosch, told pv magazine. “We are running several pilot projects at the moment, and we are preparing for the market entry in 2024, when we will start with an annual production volume of 200 MW per year.”
The current prototype machines have a target power output of 10 kW electricity supply. They also produce up to 3 kW of thermal energy.
“We are currently planning to increase the capacity of the system, as our plan is to offer the device mainly in the commercial and industrial segment,” Spickermann said.
The modular SOFC units can be combined to a cascade or cluster that forms a decentral energy supply system and are designed as connected devices that are part of the Internet of Things. In the future, it will be possible to connect SOFC clusters to virtual power plants that reach high power capacities in the megawatt range.
“When these machines are linked together, and the power grid fails, their resilience has a value that many investors may be happy to recognize,” Wayne-Daniel Kern, vice president of SOFC at Bosch, told pv magazine.
The fuel cell unit also produces thermal energy at temperature levels that can be used for heating or cooling.
“The heat coming out of the system has a temperature of around 200 Celsius degrees, an optimal level to reutilize it to heat buildings or reconvert it into cooling for use cases in data centers,” Kern said. “This heat can be an efficient add-on supply to a building’s existing heat supply system. The machines are primarily intended at producing electricity, but making use of the heat supply helps reduce the costs of ownership.”
When commercial production is launched, the product may have a payback time of between five and six years, so by that time it will become very attractive, said Kern. Bosch aims to produce the fuel cell units on a large scale.
“We are not targeting a niche market, we are a mass manufacturing company,” Kern said. “We know how to industrialize and produce thousands of machines.”
In Germany, Bosch already operates around 50 SOFC pilot installations at its own sites in Bamberg, Homburg, Renningen, Salzgitter, Schwieberdingen, Stuttgart-Feuerbach, and Wernau. Its first pilots are running at customer locations such as Stadtwerke Bamberg. This SOFC unit supplies power to the surrounding area and the heat is used at a nearby bakery.
In preparation of the production ramp-up in 2024, further pilot projects will follow in order to prove the capabilities of the SOFC units. The company will develop a series of products that meet custom requirements in different use scenarios such as buildings, industrial applications, distributed energy supply systems (microgrids), and data centers.
