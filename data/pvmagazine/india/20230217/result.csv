https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/17/guidelines-for-pumped-storage-projects-in-india/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 17, 2023",Guidelines for pumped storage projects in India,"India’s ministry of power has prepared draft guidelines to promote the development of pumped storage projects (PSPs) across the country.
India targets to reduce the emission intensity of its gross domestic product (GDP) by 45% by 2030, reach 50% of the installed power capacity from nonfossil fuel sources by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.
Given the increasing integration of wind and solar power into the grid, PSPs are of paramount importance for providing greater inertia and balancing power to the grid. These can store a large amount of energy and provide frequent starts/stops and faster ramp-ups/ramp-downs.
The draft National Electricity Plan (NEP) published by the Central Electricity Authority indicates that 18.8 GW of PSPs and 51.5 GW of BESS (5 hours) are required to integrate the planned RE capacity addition till 2032. The PSP capacity requirement may further increase if the cost of BESS does not come down as expected.
The PSP guidelines issued by the ministry cover the allotment of project sites, charges to be paid by the developer, monetization of ancillary services, utilization of exhausted mines to develop PSPs, environmental clearances for off-river PSPs, green finance, etc.
According to the guidelines, for early development, state governments may award projects directly to hydro CPSUs or State PSUs on a nomination basis. PSP projects may also be awarded to private developers by following a two-stage competitive bidding process. In the first stage, the developers will be pre-qualified based on their financial strength, experience in developing infrastructure projects of similar size, past track record of developing projects, turnover, and ability to meet performance guarantees. In the second stage, bids will be based on quantifiable parameters such as the concession period of the project or any other parameter specified by the central/state government.
In case of allocation through the above modes, the home state shall have the right of first refusal for 40% of the project capacity and the tariff shall be fixed by the appropriate Commission under Section 62 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The developer would be free to sell the balance storage space under a short-, medium- or long-term power purchase agreement (PPA), in power markets, or through a bilateral contract.
The guidelines state that PSP projects may also be awarded on a tariff-based competitive bidding basis to developers. Here bids can be made based on composite tariff (including the cost of input power) in case input power is arranged by the developer, or tariff for conversion of power from off-peak to peak if the input power is to be arranged by the procurer of the storage capacity.
The appropriate Commission shall ensure suitable monetization of ancillary services like spinning reserves, reactive support, black start, peaking supply, tertiary and ramping support, and faster start-up and shutdown that help in supporting grid stability.
Efforts would be made to identify and develop exhausted mines including coal mines as prospective PSP sites.
PSP projects, where both reservoirs are built off-river or where one reservoir is built off-river and the existing on-river reservoir undergoes minor structural modification to connect it with the new reservoir, may be exempted from environmental impact assessment and public hearing.
Further, PSPs may be supported through concessional climate finance. Sovereign green bonds issued for mobilizing resources for green infrastructure as a part of the government’s overall market borrowings may be deployed in the development of PSPs that utilize renewable energy for charging.

The world could potentially install 350.6 GW of PV systems this year, according to new estimates from Taiwanese market research firm TrendForce. If confirmed, the growth would represent a 53.4% increase compared to 2022, when new global solar additions hit 228.5 GW.
This year, solar demand will be particularly strong due to decreasing PV panel prices. In addition, a high number of projects that were delayed in 2021 and 2022 for supply chain issues are now gradually going online, said TrendForce.
The Asia-Pacific region is expected to account for most of the installed capacity this year, with around 202.5 GW of projected demand. China, Malaysia, and the Philippines will lead this growth.
Europe is predicted to account for 68.6 GW of the total, with Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands taking the lead. The Americas will likely deploy about 64.6 GW, said TrendForce. The Middle East and Africa will jointly deploy 14.9 GW of new PV installations this year, up 49.5% year on year, according to the research firm.
China will be the largest market this year with 148.9 GW of expected demand, followed by the United States at 40.5 GW, India at 17.2 GW, Brazil at 14.2 GW, Germany at 11.8 GW, Spain at 11.4 GW, and Japan at 8 GW, said TrendForce.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/17/photovoltaic-thermoelectric-tech-with-potential-efficiency-of-65/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 17, 2023",Photovoltaic-thermoelectric tech with potential efficiency of 65%,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Science have designed a hybrid power system that combines photovoltaics, spectral-splitting (SS), radiative cooling (RC), and a thermoelectric (TEG) unit.
“The proposed system can be applied to solar photovoltaic power generation, with the thermoelectric materials using the separated solar spectrum to generate electricity,” researcher Jianfeng Guo told pv magazine. “At the same time, the combination of radiation cooling technology and thermoelectric materials can realize power generation at night.”
In the proposed ideal system configuration, the photovoltaic panel is based on heterojunction cells made of III-V materials, placed at the bottom of the hot side of the TEG to generate electricity using the temperature difference between the PV panel and radiative cooling.
“Radiative cooling needs to face the sky, so it is placed on the top,” said the scientists.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
The performance of the system was compared to that of a “conventional” PV-TEG system, in which the PV panel stays on the top acting as the hot side of TEG, and a heat sink is used as the cold side of TEG at the bottom. The TEG module uses numerous P-N thermocouples  and is placed in the middle, to generate electricity using the temperature difference between the solar panel and heat sink.
For the comparison, they applied a theory based on heat-flux conditions is employed to achieve maximum thermoelectric efficiency.
“The PV-TEG hybrid system with RC is superior to the conventional hybrid system, not only in terms of higher efficiency but also in its 24-h operation capacity,” the scientists stated.
They found that the hybrid system with four-junction cells could potentially achieve an efficiency of more than 65%, which they described as superior to most current photoelectric and thermal power systems. A system with a single-junction, efficiency reached 39.4%, and they said that this was higher than the theoretical PV efficiency at 500 suns of 38.2%.
“We only carried out theoretical analysis and numerical simulation on this system, without economic analysis,” Guo said. “In the future, we are going to build an experimental system, and then we will conduct cost analysis.”
The researchers introduced the system in “Maximizing Electric Power through Spectral-Splitting Photovoltaic-Thermoelectric Hybrid System Integrated with Radiative Cooling,” which was recently published in Advanced Science.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.
