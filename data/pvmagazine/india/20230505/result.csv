https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/05/acme-group-indraprastha-gas-ltd-sign-green-hydrogen-agreement/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 5, 2023","ACME Group, Indraprastha Gas Ltd sign green hydrogen agreement ","Diversified renewable energy company ACME Group and city gas distributor Indraprastha Gas Ltd have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to explore potential business opportunities in green hydrogen jointly.
 
ACME and IGL will work together to promote customer adoption and create demand for green hydrogen in the country. They will also explore the opportunity of setting up hydrogen generation plants, including electrolyzer deployment, to blend green hydrogen in IGL’s existing pipeline networks supplying gas to households and industrial & commercial setups and CNG for vehicles.
 
Manoj K Upadhyay, founder and chairman of ACME Group, said, “Both the partners will identify areas/projects for green hydrogen adoption in the country.”
 
ACME brings its experience and expertise to the partnership, while IGL being a green energy provider to several cities and millions of homes, has a ready-made network to blend green hydrogen. “The two partners will also co-operate on policy matters and help the industry and government to bring in an enabling regulatory framework that facilitates and incentivizes the customers to provide long-term offtake commitments for green hydrogen and green ammonia,” said Ashwani Dudeja, president and director (Green Hydrogen and Ammonia), ACME Group.
 
Sanjay Kumar, managing director of IGL, said, “Hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (H-CNG) pilot project in Delhi was operated by IGL in collaboration with IOCL. Presently, green hydrogen in automobile sector is at the nascent stage, and IGL being a leading city gas distribution company, certainly wants to explore possibilities of green hydrogen in the automobile sector. Production of green ammonia from green hydrogen has the potential to be another business vertical to IGL.”
