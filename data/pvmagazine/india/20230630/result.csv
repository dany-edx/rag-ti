German renewables developer Solar Kapital recently tested a white membrane to improve bifacial solar module yield at three of its solar facilities in Greece.
Solar Kapital reported that approximately 2,500 m2 of its membranes were used at its Lagkadas solar farm. The modules were installed on single-axis trackers with a fixed inclination of 25 degrees, positioned at an average height of 1.5 m above the ground. Measurements taken from June 2022 to May 2023 revealed a weighted average increase in output of 6.4% over the year, though values varied due to radiation intensity.
The company said that the actual yield of the two inverters during the period was 1,661 kWh per kW. Considering weather conditions, a 4% lower yield is assumed, resulting in an average production yield of 1,730 kWh per kW, which the company considers remarkable for the region. Solar Kapital said that with a guaranteed feed-in tariff of €0.073 ($0.079/kWh), the membrane’s payback time is less than 2.5 years.
Solar Kapital also conducted tests on the membranes at its Kilkis solar plant, which relies on dual-axis tracker technology. The measurements indicated an approximate 2.5% increase in yield for both inverters at the facility. Factoring in a feed-in tariff of €0.335/kWh and minimal labor and geotextile requirements, the company estimated the payback time of the membrane to be less than one year.
However, the payback period estimates do not consider variable costs associated with electricity generation or the potential benefits of reducing the need for grass clippings. The nature of the subsoil is also significant, as installation costs escalate on rocky ground.
Over time, the laid geotextile degrades, with Solar Kapital’s engineers assuming an annual loss of around 20% in its degree of reflection due to weather effects and dust. Consequently, the additional yields of the bifacial solar modules diminish.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/30/govt-releases-incentive-guidelines-for-green-hydrogen-electrolyzer-production/,"ELECTROLYZER,FINANCE,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 30, 2023","Govt releases incentive guidelines for green hydrogen, electrolyzer production","India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has notified the guidelines for implementing its incentive schemes for green hydrogen and electrolyzer production. The two schemes will provide incentives totaling INR 17,490 crore (INR 13,050 crore for green hydrogen and INR 4,440 crore for electrolyzers). This expenditure will be met from the budgetary provisions under the Nation Green Hydrogen Mission approved by the union cabinet for the five-year period from FY 2024-25 to FY 2029-30. 
MNRE has appointed Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd (SECI) as the implementing agency for these schemes. 
MNRE stated the incentives for green hydrogen production may be offered through several models, including competitive bidding based on incentives demanded. 
Under incentive-based bidding, the bidders will be required to quote the annual production capacity of green hydrogen and/or its derivatives for which the incentive is sought and the incentive demanded (in INR/kg) for each of the first three years of production. 
A direct incentive in terms of INR/kg of green hydrogen production will be provided for three years from the date of commencement of green hydrogen production.
The incentives will be capped at INR 50/kg in the first year of production, INR 40/kg during the second year of production, and INR 30/kg during the third year of production.
In the first round, green hydrogen capacity of 450,000 MT per annum will be available for bidding. The maximum capacity that can be allotted to a single bidder will be 90,000 MT per annum. The minimum bid capacity will be 10,000 MT per annum.
For electrolyzer manufacturing, incentives will be provided in INR/kW for five years from the commencement of electrolyzer manufacturing. Base Incentive will start at INR 4,440/kW in the first year and will gradually taper down annually to INR 1,480/kW in the fifth year.
The selection of beneficiaries will be based on the domestic value addition and performance quotient (specific energy consumption of the electrolyzer produced). To qualify for bidding, specific energy consumption should not be more than 56 kWh per kg of hydrogen production. Also, the bidder must commit minimum 40% local value addition during the first year of production for alkaline electrolyzers and min. 30% for other technologies.
In the first round, bids will be launched for 1.5 GW of electrolyzer capacity. The minimum bid capacity is 100 MW and the maximum is 300 MW.
Sandeep Agarwal, founder and managing director at Greenzo, said the MNRE’s initiative will encourage many more investments in the production of electrolyzers in the Indian market.
Agarwal said Greenzo Energy is setting up an alkaline electrolyzer manufacturing factory with an annual capacity of 250 MW in Sanand, Gujarat, and will benefit from the incentives scheme.
“As an MSME we appreciate this initiative, which will not only support the growth of the green hydrogen industry but also encourage the production of electrolyzers within the country. This step aligns with the larger goal of achieving Net Zero emissions by 2070,” he added.

In 2015, Sunwiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston warned large-scale solar developers that rooftop PV installations would end up eating their lunch.
“Now what I see is more nuanced and circular than that – renewables will eat itself,” he tells pv magazine Australia. “Transmission takes a long time to built … while you’re waiting for that transmission, there will be volatile and higher electricity prices. The natural response to that will be to install rooftop PV or install storage, potentially local storage, potentially local transmission-enhancing storage, all that sort of stuff.”
He said that batteries will be completed faster than transmission, leading to a decline in the economic justification for transmission. However, transmission projects will still be developed, which in turn will diminish the economic rationale for batteries.
While this business case conundrum most pointedly impacts big battery projects, which earn most of their revenue from spot markets, distributed energy resources like rooftop solar and network batteries will continue to utterly transform energy systems.
In April, Gabrielle Kuiper, a director of the Superpower Institute, noted the findings of ITP Renewables’ modeling, which suggests that once Australia reaches its saturation point with distributed energy resources, rooftop solar combined with battery trading could potentially reduce the evening peak of the wholesale market by 67% to 92%.
The demand forecasts which have underpinned much of Australia’s transition modeling to date are increasingly being questioned, given the fact models – as Kuiper points out – have the shortfall of relying on a past which is likely completely different to the energy future.
Johnston describes the assumption that Australia should be building copious amounts of transmission as something that has remained, until vey recently, “unexamined.” A growing choir of industry insiders are questioning whether the current extent of planned transmission projects are in fact vital, but this is also a relatively recent shift.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/30/spain-targeting-56-gw-of-new-solar-by-2030-under-new-energy-strategy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,SPAIN",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 30, 2023",Spain targeting 56 GW of new solar by 2030 under new energy strategy,"From pv magazine Spain
Spain’s Ministry for the Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge (MITECO) has published a revised draft of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC) with a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% compared to 1990 – surpassing the previous goal of 23%. The draft is currently open for public consultation until Sept. 4.
To meet these targets, the new energy strategy outlines a plan to have 214 GW of total installed capacity in the electricity sector by 2030. This includes 160 GW from renewable generation and 22 GW from various forms of storage.
The document acknowledges that the distribution of technologies is subject to change based on factors such as technology advancements, costs, availability, and integration capacity. It emphasizes the potential of photovoltaics, projecting a capacity of 76 GW by 2030, including 19 GW for self-consumption. The previous version of the plan aimed for 39 GW of solar photovoltaic capacity. As of the end of 2022, the PV source had reached 20 GW, indicating a need to deploy an additional 56 GW in the next eight years.
The plan also includes the addition of 62 GW of wind power, including 3 GW of offshore wind, 14.5 GW of hydro, and 4.8 GW of concentrated solar power (CSP). Non-renewable technologies are accounted for as well, with expectations of 26.6 GW of gas combined cycles and 3 GW of existing nuclear power plants by 2030.
Furthermore, the new plan raises the target for green hydrogen generation through electrolyzers to 11 GW, compared to the 4 GW outlined in the current roadmap.
José Donoso, director of the Spanish solar energy association UNEF, expressed a positive view of the new plan, stating that the objectives are attainable. He emphasized the importance of storage expansion and urges expedited regulatory measures to facilitate action.
Regarding the industrial plan mentioned in the draft, which addresses solar manufacturing, Donoso pointed to the budget of €1 billion ($1.09 billion) and the growing interest of panel manufacturers to invest in Spain. He emphasized the need for swift administrative authorizations and suggested promoting a “welcome packet” to attract investment.
