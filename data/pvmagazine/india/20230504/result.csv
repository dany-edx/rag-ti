While India’s solar PV ambitions are high, more efforts are needed in the implementation of and adherence to the International and National Quality Infrastructure (QI) is a challenge. India has set a target of 300 GW solar PV by 2030, with a cumulative capacity of 63.8 GW of solar PV projects currently in the pipeline. But in India, solar PV quality focuses more on component certification and less on the design and engineering of the solar energy plants, as highlighted by multiple experts from the sector in a workshop on QI this spring. The degradation rate of modules in India is 1.2% per year, while the global average is much lower at 0.4-0.5%. If India wants to change this trend, it needs to focus on quality infrastructure in the overall value chain to ensure a sustainable operation and long-term growth.
Global trends for solar PV are bright, and India can be at the forefront of installing additional capacities: During the 2010-2021 period, IRENA data shows that the global Capital Expenses costs (or CAPEX) for solar PV projects declined by 80%, capacity factors increased to 17.2%, and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) decreased by 88%. On the latter point, since 2010, LCOE costs for solar PV in India have declined by 90%. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the global cumulative capacity of solar PV in 2021 was 843 GW. To meet the net zero scenario, however, this capacity needs to increase to 5,221 GW and 14,036 GW by 2030 and 2050 respectively – QI will play a key role in meeting this goal.
The International Forum on Quality in the Indian PV Sector in Delhi raised many of these issues. IRENA, together with the co-organizers of the meeting, the German Metrology Institute, India’s National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE), and India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, discussed with Indian private sector representatives and authorities how investing in enhancing the quality infrastructure can help unlock the vast potential of the PV industry in the country.
Looking first at the risk that too few investments in QI hinder capacity, the meeting concluded that hot spots due to poor module design, microcracks due to transportation protocols not being adhered to, corrosion due to low moisture resistance of modules, broken solder joints due to poor wiring techniques, and broken cells because of people stomping on cells without awareness/training on correct installation practices all play a role in lowering quality. India’s quality gaps are usually the result of aggressive climate conditions and strong price pressure in the marketplace. These challenges are typical, but not limited to India. Recommendations are therefore relevant beyond the Indian situation.
How can India’s PV sector overcome these challenges by investing in QI? QI is an interdependent ecosystem of the different elements (accreditation, certification, standards, testing, metrology, inspection and monitoring) working together in harmony, and all associated services should be developed in unity and not in a piecemeal fashion. Improvements all along the QI system are necessary and interconnected; the workshop participants identified the following recommendations as the most pressing:
As these recommendations clearly show, while India has done tremendous progress and is pose to become a global leader in solar PV technology, there is still further work concerning QI improvements in the country, as for example the degradation rate of solar panels signals that the industry must take this path. By doing so, the entire industry and its consumers are the beneficiaries. After all, QI services outweigh their costs. On average, QI accounts for only 5% of total project costs. That is a win for everyone.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/04/solar-testing-group-warns-of-degradation-risk-for-topcon/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 4, 2023",Solar testing group warns of degradation risk for TOPCon,"From pv magazine Global
Each year, Fremont, California’s Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC) releases its PV Module Index, tracking the latest trends in solar module quality, performance, reliability, and emergent technologies.
The latest annual report, PV Module Index 2022 opens with remarks about the rise of TOPCon solar modules, a technology increasingly being adopted by major panel suppliers.
TOPCon was first demonstrated at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in 2013 and is now gaining market traction and acceptance.
The technology is comprised of n-type PV cells with passivating contacts. The modules have strong surface passivation and effective carrier transport, both of which contribute to a strong open-circuit voltage and high efficiency. The shift to TOPCon comes as p-type passivated emitter and rear-contact cell (PERC) modules begin to reach their theoretical efficiency limits.
RETC said this boost in efficiency has made TOPCon “the buzziest word in solar.”
The report noted that while Longi is “betting big” on p-type TOPCon, many other leading module companies, like JinkoSolar, Jollywood, JA Solar and Trina Solar are making significant investments in modules with n-type TOPCon cell designs. 
“Via higher open-circuit voltage values, you can achieve higher efficiencies and power ratings. In and of itself, that is likely going to move manufacturers to n-type TOPCon cell designs, as soon as they can get there,” said Kenneth Sauer, principal engineer, VDE Americas.
RETC said due to manufacturing complexities, high-efficiency n-type cells using heterojunction technology (HJT) and interdigitated back contact (IBC) cells are relatively expensive to produce and remain a niche part of the market. By comparison, n-type TOPCon cell production is very similar to the PERC manufacturing process, making for an easier transition from existing manufacturing lines.
“Though today’s n-type TOPCon modules cost slightly more to produce on a per-watt basis than p-type mono PERC modules, the efficiency gains result in a lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in large-scale field deployments. Best of all, leading experts expect n-type TOPCon to benefit from an accelerated learning curve,” said the report.
However, as with any emergent technology, the report notes that moving towards TOPCon may carry some risk. While n-type TOPCon PV cells have proven resilient to light-induced degradation and light and elevated temperature-induced degradation, some evidence exists of susceptibility to ultraviolet-induced degradation (UVID), which could chip away at module longevity.
Researchers at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have documented front- and back-side power loss from these technologies. The data does not point to a single degradation mechanism but suggest that different cell designs degrade via different pathways, said the report.
“We’re not trying to sound an alarm for no reason,” said Cherif Kedir, chief executive officer at RETC. “We just want to test the potential for UV degradation to educate ourselves and the industry. If there’s no problem, we can all move forward with our lives.”
Kedir recommends module makers conduct accelerated UVID testing as part of a technical due diligence survey. If cell passivation layers are improperly tuned, they can break down under this exposure. He recommends evaluating each new cell design on a case-by-case basis.
“If there is a problem, we will publish a report so that the industry can get out in front of the issue,” he said.
