In an effort to share its know-how on the construction of more eco-friendly solar farms, Hungarian solar company SolServices collaborated with national parks, environmental protection organizations, energy companies and even beekeepers to produce a comprehensive white paper.
The “Professional Guide for the Development of Next-Generation Solar Parks” offers a completely new, practice-based methodology detailing how solar farms can be operated in an ecologically conscious and nature-friendly manner and that can be recommended to investors.
Based on the company’s earlier biomonitor surveys but expanded in scope, the white paper aims to ensure that solar parks built on large stretches of land fit into the ecological balance of the area, taking into account as much as possible its ecological, biological and natural features.
Based on Hungary’s geographical and solar radiation characteristics, solar energy has a very high potential for electricity generation in the country. Installed PV capacity reached 1,144 MW at the end of 2019, of which around 38% was made up of household-sized units of less than 50 kW. The remaining capacity is spread among small plants with capacities below 0.5 MW and a few plants of a few megawatts.
Hungary’s new National Energy Strategy aims to expand solar capacity to 6,000 MW by 2030, and which could reach 12,000 MW by 2040. The country, however, requires grid upgrades to meet the challenges of a decentralized and highly weather-dependent electricity generation structure. It also requires the expansion of larg-scale facilities.
Achieving the country’s ambitious goals can only be achieved “in an environmentally and nature-friendly manner, taking into account the ecological requirements and characteristics of the given area as much as possible,” SolServices states in the report.
“Agri-environmental research in recent years has shown that, with appropriate land use and the strengthening of plant communities, wildlife populations can be significantly increased in agricultural areas,” it adds, noting that solar parks can effectively support wildlife and increase biodiversity.
“A particularly positive factor is that, with proper design and minimal management and intervention, a solar park can provide an almost undisturbed habitat for both flora and fauna for some 30 years after construction. A very small part of the solar farm area, less than 5%, is physically covered by various infrastructure (roads, inverters, support poles for panels), and even with the parts of the area covered by panels, this proportion covers only about 50% of the total area. The area not covered and partially shaded by the panels, i.e. roughly 95% of the solar park area, can be a diverse habitat for plants and animals.”
The paper details a number of methods that can be used to create suitable habitats to increase biodiversity and create a more natural vegetation cover that can benefit a wide variety of wildlife, from insects and amphibians to birds, bats, rodents and big game.
Pollinating insects, for example, benefit from a patchwork of plants that flower at different times of the year. “In addition, from herbaceous plants, the planting of red clover, which has been shown to increase the presence of bumblebees and butterflies, is of particular importance,” the paper notes. Clematis and honeysuckle grown on fences can also benefit pollinator species.
Amphibian-friendly solar parks can be considered if site conditions are suitable for permanent or temporary surface water and wetland habitats in the project area. “Reptiles prefer dense, bushy, lush undergrowth, so it is advisable to leave a minimum strip of 2 m of untidy, untrimmed vegetation along wetland areas (e.g. drainage ditches). In addition to offering easier and safer movement for animals, they also provide a home for many species of molluscs, worms and insects, and the latter provide a suitable food source for amphibians.”
For rodent and small game-friendly parks, sufficiently quiet and undisturbed habitats are necessary. Mosaic mowing and the creation of undisturbed green corridors to provide free movement and shelter for small animals are important when managing green areas, the paper advises. Such parks should include shrubs and hedges — taking into account the requirements of emergency management guidelines — as well as haystacks from locally mown hay, which can be used as daytime and winter shelter. Passages or tubes, both on the surface and underground, can facilitate the introduction of ground squirrels.
PV farms also offer different uses for a variety of different bird species. Some may use them as nesting and breeding places, while others may use them as feeding or resting areas. “We can help various species to disperse and breed in the project area by installing different types of dens or artificial nests, or by planting shrubs and trees, as long as this is compatible with the safety requirements of the solar farm and does not interfere with energy production,” the company explains.
Likewise, solar parks can be potential habitats for certain bat species. In Hungary, there are some 30 bat species found in a wide range of biotopes, from urban environments to natural habitats and abandoned mines. Insect-rich solar parks can be suitable feeding sites for bats.
Big game can be expected in arable land and grassland close to forest edges. The presence of big game around in solar parks, however, should generally be minimized to protect both the animals and equipment.
“Therefore, in the case of a big-game-friendly park, we are talking about solar parks that help big game to safely escape from the project area. To this end, it is recommended to install jump exits for big game. In addition, we can also install wildlife guide structures within the solar park to help stray animals find their way out as quickly as possible. These tools are especially useful in the first two years after installation, but can also be a valuable feature of the solar park after that.”

Agrivoltaics can mitigate the effects of drought on plant-based food production, according to a new study. While shading often reduces crop yields when there is sufficient water, it can actually lead to increased yields during dry phases, as plants benefit from less evaporation, according to “How to reconcile renewable energy and agricultural production in a drying world,” which was recently published in Plants, People, Planet.
The stabilizing effect of agrivoltaics on crop yields has been deemed promising by researchers, particularly in regions with population growth and pronounced droughts like India or Africa, as well as in Europe, where longer dry periods are expected due to climate change. However, additional research is needed to determine the most suitable plants for different systems.
Current studies indicate that most crops tolerate shading up to 15% without significant yield loss, with berries, fruiting crops, and some vegetables benefiting from shading. Leafy vegetables, tubers, root crops, and certain cereals experience minimal yield reduction.
In addition, investigating plant-based stress signals for real-time control of panel orientation and shading could contribute to the development of intelligent agrivoltaic systems, according to the scientists.

The line will start production by September. 
Gautam Solar is procuring the fully automated, n-type TOPCon production line from Jinchen. The supply deal between the two companies was signed at SNEC, 16th International Photovoltaic Power Generation and Smart Energy Conference and Exhibition. 
TOPCon (tunnel-oxide passivated contact) is a state-of-the-art solar module production technology in which a thin tunneling oxide layer is applied on an n-type silicon substrate, followed by a layer of highly doped polysilicon and passivated contacts. The tunnel oxide layer allows charge carriers to pass while minimizing recombination losses. The passivated contacts reduce surface recombination. Thereby, the technology helps increase the efficiency of the solar modules while reducing panel degradation over time.
n-type TOPCon cells can produce up to 30% more power than conventionally used p-type PERC cells.

The Q1 2023 installation included 76% large-scale solar (1.4 GW), with rooftop solar making up the balance 26%.
India’s cumulative installed solar capacity now stands at 64.5 GW.
As of March 31, 2023, the country’s utility-scale project development pipeline stood at 58 GW, with an additional 58 GW of projects tendered awaiting auction.
India installed a record 13 GW of solar capacity in 2022. Mercom expects capacity addition to be lower in 2023 as commissioning deadlines for several projects have been moved to next year. Besides projects stuck in the habitat of the Great Indian Bustard, an increasing number of projects are facing delays due to land and transmission issues.
“The market is re-calibrating following the ALMM decision by the government. Project extensions, GIB, and infrastructure issues point to a softer year than predicted,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. 
“On a positive note, module prices are trending in the right direction, and project costs declined for the first time after rising for ten consecutive quarters, bringing much-needed relief to the solar industry.” 
In Q1 2023, Rajasthan and Karnataka led solar capacity addition, accounting for 42% and 21% of the overall 1.9 GW installations, respectively. Gujarat installed the third largest capacity with a 19% share.

Established energy utilities are increasingly dominating the ownership and development of utility-scale solar plants. Only six renewable specialists now make the list of the world’s top 20 project developers, and only two appear among the top 20 utility-scale solar plant owners, according to the data compiled by UK research outfit Wiki-Solar.
NextEra Energy now tops both lists. According to Wiki-Solar’s Philip Wolfe, this is “thanks especially to the recent intense “solarization” of its subsidiary Florida Power & Light. Just six years ago, NextEra was down at No. 6, but it has moved up one place each year since then.”
Independent renewables developers are led by Canadian Solar and First Solar, which rank fifth and sixth. India’s ACME Solar follows at ninth place, with US-focused Cypress Creek at 14th.
Wiki-Solar counts Lightsource, which ranks 17th, as a renewables company, but BP now has a major stake in it. The last of the six is the legacy of projects left by the now-defunct SunEdison.
Five other pure-play renewable companies made it into the top 30 – China’s JinkoSolar and Europe’s BayWa r.e, In addition, Neoen, FRV, and X-Elio each have at least 2 GW (AC) of cumulative capacity under their belts.
On the list of utility-scale PV owners, China’s State Power Investment Corp. (SPIC) holds the second spot, with five other Chinese companies in the top 20.
Europe is led by Enel, which ranked third, but EDF, Engie, and Iberdrola are also all high on the list. India comes in with Adani at No. 4, and NTPC and Azure are also listed. AES, Dominion, and Duke Energy represent the United States, alongside NextEra.
“Utility-scale solar projects are getting ever larger, with the biggest now measured in gigawatts,” said Wolfe. “Few but the major multinationals have the financial muscle to take on projects at that scale, so we expect their dominance to continue.”
The only renewables companies among the top 20 IPPs/owners are JinkoSolar and Lightsource BP. Three infrastructure investors also feature, led by Global Infrastructure Partners at No. 19, with D.E. Shaw Renewable Investment (DESRI) and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway lower down.

Madrid plans to open Spain’s first green hydrogen plant to use reclaimed water. The plant will start operations in 2024 at the Arroyo Culebro Cuenca Media Alta wastewater treatment facility in Pinto. It will be built by Canal de Isabel II, a water-management company owned by the city of Madrid.
The project, with an initial capacity of approximately 80,000 kilograms of hydrogen per year, stands out for multiple reasons. Firstly, hydrogen will be produced from reclaimed water and undergo additional treatment through electrolysis. The Madrid government said that it will be the largest green hydrogen generation plant in Spain to use recycled water.
It will also combine two renewable technologies – solar generation and biogas cogeneration, using waste from the treatment plant itself. The oxygen generated during electrolysis will also enhance the purification treatment of wastewater, improving the facility’s ability to handle the pollution produced by 1.2 million residents.
By implementing tertiary treatment, Canal de Isabel II will supply the required water to the electrolyzer, with 12 liters of water necessary to produce 1 kilogram of hydrogen. The project involves an investment of €7.3 million ($7.8 million) and is expected to be completed in the next 13 months.
In addition, the wastewater treatment plant will have the capacity to produce up to 30 million liters of conventional reclaimed water per day. It will use ultrafiltration membranes and reverse osmosis for purposes such as irrigating green areas or cleaning streets.

It also identifies key areas of opportunity for agrivoltaics, justifying future research and investment. 
The study was supported by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).
The study finds agrivoltaics did not negatively impact, and in some cases even increased, crop yields. The pilot implementers interviewed in the study suggested the technical feasibility of agrivoltaics with no change (or even an increase) in the yield of some crops like leafy vegetables, millet, and medicinal plants under shading conditions. 
The study highlights the crop choices trialled in the pilot projects are still limited, and mainstream crops like paddy and wheat are yet to be tried successfully.
Agrivoltaics is still limited to a handful of pilots in India and is yet to reach a commercial scale.
The study suggests technological innovations and testing business models most viable in the Indian context as the key to the commercialization of agrivoltaics. It identifies three potential business models for deploying agrivoltaics: agrivoltaics jointly owned by farmer and developer; agrivoltaics solely owned by either the farmer or the developer; and developer as the primary promoter and farmer as a partner. 
Bifacial panels and sun tracking were found to show promising results in agrivoltaics and can be encouraged through state-sponsored pilots.
The study finds arid and semi-arid regions and peri-urban areas likely to be favorable locations for agrivoltaics in India. 
The study recommends state governments reform land-use and tax regulations to support agrivoltaics and highlights the need to develop consistent standards and definitions for agrivoltaics.
“States need to think beyond the uniform ceiling tariff regime if agrivoltaics is going to be commercialized at scale. A single ceiling tariff across a state negates the locational advantage of agrivoltaics in areas with high land rent,” states the study.
Among other suggestions, the study emphasizes capacity building to scale up agrivoltaics and continuous innovation and peer learning to overcome operational challenges.
This paper is based on the experiences of stakeholders (power distribution companies), agricultural universities, private solar PV developers, and farmers who have implemented agrivoltaics pilots across India.
