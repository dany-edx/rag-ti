Major reasons are policy conundrums, ill-designed institutional and governance structures, distorted market mechanisms, and technical challenges such as those involving grid connectivity, according to a new report by Asian Development Bank.
India achieved 4.4 GW of installed rooftop solar capacity by December 2019, which is just 12% of the 40 GW by 2022 target. Out of the total rooftop solar installations in the country, the residential sector has been the worst performer, at 16%, compared to other competing sectors such as industrial and commercial.
The report cites persistent policy-level inconsistencies as a primary cause of the slowdown. Poor and piecemeal implementation of net metering policies at the sub-national scale is a major roadblock for the uptake of rooftop solar in India. Most of the state regulations on net metering set the maximum capacity limit at 1 MW per metering point for rooftop solar systems to be connected to the distribution grid, which hinders large-scale deployment. Often this capacity ceiling is imposed based on the poor financial health of the distribution utilities. These arbitrary caps impede the uptake of rooftop PV.
The report stated that while rooftop solar systems require bottom-up approaches focusing on intense consumer engagement, the current policy and regulatory regime is designed based on a top-down approach with a uniform set of policies and regulations that lack flexibility. The most recent evidence of such policy-level obstruction is the withdrawal of net metering policies in certain states for commercial and industrial consumers. There is no adequate understanding of how the existing intervention types perform in varying policy, regulatory, and governance environments.
Apart from regulatory constraints, there are also societal and informational constraints. Poor understanding of the rooftop solar benefits among users is a major challenge. This is compounded by the high upfront capital cost to deploy the systems, particularly for residential consumers.
In one study surveying five Indian cities, close to 50% of respondents were found to be unaware of rooftop solar technology and its applicability in the household context.
In addition to the general information asymmetry, there is a substantial lack of knowledge about the specific products, processes, and approval systems inherent with these systems. Lack of credible and objective sources of information has led to consumers relying on vendors for information.
This lack of information is further compounded by the high upfront capital cost to deploy these systems, as these are often not within reach of the larger section of the society. Although there has been a dramatic reduction in the rooftop solar system cost in recent years, the initial cost continues to be a major hurdle even for small projects.
Further, banks and financial institutions are reluctant to lend funding for these projects due to their small scale. Traditionally, banks charge a high interest rate to developers (10%–12%, or up to 14%) depending upon the associated risks, nature of the project, and the borrower’s credit rating.
Lack of technical capacity often acts as a barrier to scaling up these interventions, particularly in rural settings. The needed market eco-system has not been created, and the much-needed supply chain has not yet been established.
The report stated policy makers need to modify the net metering policies and their obstructive provisions. The removal of capacity constraints would be attractive not only to existing consumers but also to new consumers.
Even if it is not possible to have uniform policies across states, policies could be formulated considering state-level nuances characterized by factors such as unmet Renewable Purchase Obligations and the strength of distribution utilities, it added.
A structured approach could go a long way in arresting some of the challenges currently encountered. The best way to minimize the regulatory burdens and procedural complexities is to institutionalize a single-window facility for the entire eco-system of rooftop PV deployment, encompassing connectivity, net metering, electricity inspection, and limitations on sanctioned load.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/18/renew-power-to-set-up-2-gw-mono-perc-solar-factory-in-gujarat/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 18, 2021",ReNew Power to set up 2 GW mono PERC solar factory in Gujarat,"Haryana-based developer ReNew Power has announced it has selected the Indian State of Gujarat for its solar cell and module manufacturing facility. 
The factory will be located in the Dholera Special Industrial Region (DSIR), approximately 100 km outside the city of Ahmedabad.
The greenfield facility will manufacture 2 GW of solar cells and modules annually using monocrystalline PERC (passivated emitter and rear contact) and large wafer technology. It will implement state-of-the-art practices in line with Industry 4.0 manufacturing standards. 
The Dholera manufacturing facility will also sell components to other renewable energy companies in India, apart from meeting ReNew Power’s own requirements for its utility-scale power generation business. It is expected to generate 2500 jobs in the state.
The project has been allocated 100 acres of land by the state government, which, the company said, is adequate to ensure any future capacity expansion. The plant is expected to be vertically integrated in terms of processes and infrastructure to manufacture solar cells and modules. It is expected to commence production from the fiscal year 2022-23. 
“The manufacturing capacity being set up will incorporate ReNew Power’s sustainability initiatives and ensure decarbonization of manufacturing processes and supply chain to create a ‘Green Factory’ of the future,” read a statement by Renew Power.
Speaking about the development, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of ReNew Power, Sumant Sinha said, “The Indian Government’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for solar photovoltaic (PV) modules has opened up several avenues for domestic manufacturing in the renewable energy sector. ReNew plans to manufacture both solar cells and modules in the Dholera manufacturing facility with the goal of creating a globally competitive manufacturing unit. We are committed to India’s ambition of achieving 450 GW of clean energy generation capacity by 2030, and we believe the new manufacturing unit will play an important role in boosting India’s domestic manufacturing capacity for clean energy.”
The new facility will help the company to bring a crucial function in-house and avoid paying high customs duties on imported components, which are expected to come into force from April 1, 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/18/micro-iii-v-solar-cell-with-33-8-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 18, 2021",Micro III-V solar cell with 33.8% efficiency,"From pv magazine International
A French-Canadian research team has recently developed a micrometer-scale triple-junction III-V solar cell for applications in concentrated photovoltaics (CPV).
The device is based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and germanium (Ge) and has an active area of only 0.089 mm2. “We have not included these cells into real modules yet,” Sherbrooke Professor, Maxime Darnon, told pv magazine. “We would be happy to collaborate with any group that would need such cells.”
According to him, the processes used to fabricate the cells are almost identical to the processes used for conventional III-V cells, such as those produced by German specialist Azur Space, except for the isolation and dicing process that is plasma-based, while in other cells for CPV applications saw dicing in commonly used. “It is hard to anticipate the exact cost in production conditions, but we can say that mm2 cells fabricated with plasma etching would be approximately the same price as cells fabricated with saw dicing, and for micrometer-scale solar cells, plasma etching is the only economically viable solution since we waste much less valuable material with plasma etching than with saw dicing,” he further explained.
 The cell was designed with rectangular, circular, and hexagonal active areas and built with a commercial epitaxial germanium wafer and titanium-aluminum (Ti/Al) metallization deposited on the backside of the wafer. An anti-reflective coating (ARC) made of silicon nitride hydrogen (SiNxHy) and hydrogenated silicon oxide (SiOxHy) was then deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), which was key to minimize surface recombinations.
Saw dicing was discarded to avoid defect generation due to the fragility of the germanium wafer and the targeted small area of the cell. “In addition, saw dicing generates linear channels that force the fabricated cells to be rectangular, which may be inadequate depending on the incoming light profile,” the researchers explained.
The performance of the micro-scale cell was analyzed under standard AM1.5G sunlight conditions and the device showed an open-circuit voltage of 2.350 V, a short-circuit current density of 12.40 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.7%. “However, a degradation of the electrical performance was observed when reducing cell areas with up to 10.2% drop in open-circuit voltage for cells without passivating ARC,” the research team noted.
The scientists achieved the maximum efficiency of 34.4% for a 1-mm2 cell under concentrated light of 450 suns and of 33.8% under 584 suns for a 0.25-mm2 device. “Lower current and lower series resistance in smaller cells are expected to shift the maximum efficiency to higher concentration,” they further explained.
The micrometer-scale cell is presented in the paper Miniaturization of InGaP/InGaAs/Ge solar cells for micro‐concentrator photovoltaics, published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The research group includes scientists from the Université de Sherbrooke and the University of Ottawa in Canada, the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), the University of Bordeaux in France.
The wrok was performed conjointly at the Laboratoire Nanotechnologies Nanosystèmes  ([labn2.ca]LN2) and Laboratoire d’Intégration du Matériau au Système (IMS). The research project was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Prompt, a Canadian non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating partnerships and R & D financing between businesses and the public research sector, and Canada-based industrial partner Saint-Augustin Canada Electric inc. (STACE).
The cost of producing solar cells based on compounds of III-V element materials–named according to the groups of the periodic table that they belong to–has confined such devices to niche applications including drones and satellites, where low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than costs, in relation to the energy produced.
