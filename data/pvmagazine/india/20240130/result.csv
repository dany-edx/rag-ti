The company wants to sell the panels to automotive, consumer electronics, sensor, and LED component manufacturers. “The pilot line will produce 200,000 units per year, each unit measures 3.82 cm x 7.62 cm,” Solaires CEO Fabian De La Fuente told pv magazine.
The types of applications Solaires targets include self-charging electronic devices, wireless keyboards, smart door locks, electronic shelf labels, and sensors. Solaires says its modules can be standalone or paired with rechargeable batteries.
Solaires will produce the complete stack in-house.
“We have all the equipment to do so. Our manufacturing process is a sheet-to-sheet process for rigid glass substrates using slot-die coating, screen printing, laser ablation and lamination. We also have in-house quality control and testing equipment,” said De La Fuente, adding that the manufacturing equipment is commercially available and scalable.
The modules are based on perovskite tuned for indoor light absorption and have a power conversion of 35% in indoor light. Current prototypes have an aperture area of 17.22 cm2 and an active area of 14.70 cm2.
Under halogen lamp illumination at 1000 lux, the panels achieved a power density of 0.15 mW/cm2 and a power maximum power point (MPP) of 2.2 mW, with current MPP at 0.52 mA, and short-circuit current at 0.60 mA.
Under light-emitting diode lamp illumination at 1000 lux, the power density is 0.06 mW/cm2, the power MPP is 0.9 mW, the current MPP is 0.23 mA and the short-circuit current is 0.27 mA. The voltage MPP and open-circuit voltage are the same for both types of lamps, at 4 V and 5 V, respectively.
The company, which originated at Canada’s University of Victoria, was founded in 2022. It started out as a producer of mixed halide perovskite solutions, a product it called Solar Ink, with an energy bandgap of 1.54 eV. It stood out from the competition due to its longer shelf life, according to De La Fuente.
Solaires will continue to sell perovskite materials in addition to manufacturing modules. “Our business model is to license our technology to manufacturers around the globe and includes providing materials, such as our perovskite ink and other unique layers in the full module stack,” said De La Fuente.
De La Fuente said that thin film technologies, particularly perovskites, excel in absorbing indoor light compared to silicon, due to their intrinsic material properties.

Europe is embracing polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis, prioritizing it over alkaline electrolysis, said Thomas Hillig, managing director at THEnergy. “While many of the older installations were alkaline electrolyzers, now there is a clear predominance of PEM technology,” he told pv magazine. THEnergy recently published an electrolysis capacity map for Europe. “My best guess would be that the map covers 80% of electrolyzers that are used for producing green hydrogen,” said Hillig. “Adding up the installations from the map results in approximately 135 MW. So, the total would be in the range of 170 MW.” He noted that a big wave of new electrolyzers emerged in 2023. “However, many projects are still under realization,” he said. “That also means that the map will look completely different in one year from now.”
Ecoclean has started series production of modular AEL electrolyzers on a megawatt scale. “The robust, low-maintenance electrolyzers from the globally active company are available as scalable standalone solutions and turnkey systems with outputs ranging from 1 to 20 MW,” said the German company. It claimed the systems deliver “high gas quality” and a system pressure of up to 30 bars. “As not every application requires a gas pressure of 30 bars or more, [we are] currently in the process of adding atmospheric-pressure alkaline electrolyzers to [our] product range,” said Ecoclean.
Lhyfe and EDP Renewables have signed a 15-year renewable electricity supply contract. Under their corporate power purchase agreement (CPPA), Lhyfe will buy energy from a 55 MW solar project in Germany developed by EDPR, through Kronos Solar EDPR. The companies expect to connect the installation to the grid during 2025. The CPPA is Lhyfe’s largest such deal to date and secures renewable power supplies for its future green hydrogen production sites in Germany. It is also the first PPA that EDP Renewables has signed with a hydrogen company.
Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe has launched a public tender for the procurement of up to 151,000 tons of low-carbon hydrogen, in order to supply direct-iron reduction facilities it is building at its plant in Duisburg, Germany. The steelmaker is seeking 10-year contracts for green or blue H2 to reduce emissions at Germany’s largest steel mill.
Masdar and Daimler Truck have agreed to explore the feasibility of liquid green hydrogen exports from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, to Europe by 2030. The aim is to decarbonize road freight transport in the continent. Daimler Truck is pursuing a dual-track strategy with hydrogen- and battery-powered vehicles. The company’s prototype Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck recently completed a trip of 1,047 kilometers across Germany with one fill of liquid hydrogen under real-life conditions. Daimler Truck is building a customer-trial fleet of Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Trucks, which is expected to be deployed in mid-2024.
Germany’s National Academy of Science and Engineering has concluded that a feasible German-Australian supply chain exists, as outlined in a new study it has commissioned. The Fraunhofer Research Institution for Energy Infrastructures and Geothermal Energy IEG conducted the study, comparing the economic benefits and technical feasibility of various transport infrastructures, including a hydrogen network, product pipeline, inland waterway vessel, and rail. Acatech President Jan Wörner said that an Australian-German hydrogen bridge promises a stable and mutually beneficial trade relationship between two democratic countries. The study is the final component of the HySupply project, initiated in December 2020 and funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), conducted in collaboration with an Australian consortium led by the University of New South Wales in Sydney (UNSW).
Edison Energy said numerous companies signed green hydrogen deals in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2023, supporting new production facilities. The clarity brought by EU regulations and support mechanisms, including the EU Hydrogen Bank for operating expenses, could spur competition for power purchase agreements (PPAs) if European hydrogen producers successfully address economic and technical obstacles in deploying renewable hydrogen production facilities. Edison Energy said that PPA pricing continued to fall in the fourth quarter across most markets, with Polish and Italian median prices decreasing by 16% and 12%, respectively, compared to the third quarter. In Germany and Spain, fourth-quarter PPA prices remained relatively unchanged from the third quarter, with a shift of around €2 ($2.17)/MWh. Median prices in these countries also fell compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as volatility eased, it said.

Activity in the clean hydrogen sector is “surging” globally, fueled by maturing policies and early commercial-scale projects, including here in Australia, according to international energy consultancy Rystad Energy.
Artem Abramov, head of clean tech research at Rystad Energy, said he expects hydrogen projects will take off in 2024 driven by large-scale projects in Australia as well as the Middle East and Africa, along with maturing policies in Europe and the United States.
“2024 promises more than just momentum, it’s a year of clarity,” Abramov said, noting that several key feasibility studies are to be completed, which he expects will reveal promising new use cases for hydrogen consumption.
Abramov also said a series of global auctions and grants will be rolled out, providing essential insights into key aspects of the emerging clean hydrogen sector.
“These events will shed light on pricing dynamics, technological advancements and the eventual victors and contenders in this transformative landscape,” Abramov said.
Rystad Energy’s forecast comes just weeks after the IEA delivered what it described as a reality check on green hydrogen development, noting that despite announcements on plenty of new projects, progress in realizing them has been slow.
In the latest edition of its annual Renewables market report, the IEA said that more than 360 GW of renewable energy-powered electrolyzer projects with start dates before 2030 had been announced but only 3% of these had reached financial close or started construction.
Rystad expects that there will be fewer clean hydrogen project announcements this year compared to previous years with most of the effort in 2024 to be focused on realising projects.
The consultancy said this marks the start of the learning-by-doing phase for the clean hydrogen economy.
Rystad said any announcements of new projects will be more conservative and of lower risks. This will continue the trend that was seen in 2023, where only 17.6 million tonnes of hydrogen were announced, following the 30 million tonnes announced in 2022.
Abramov’s positive outlook for green hydrogen is part of Rystad Energy’s look at what’s in store for the energy sector in 2024.
Last year was a pivotal one for the energy world with the latest figures from the IEA indicating that global renewables capacity grew by 50%, reaching almost 510 GW, with PV accounting for three-quarters of the additions.
Rystad’s head of Renewables and Power Research, Carlos Torres Diaz, said the coming year will be another rollercoaster ride for the industry, with elections, supply chain issues and the maturation of nascent industries all on the cards.
“This year is expected to be another record breaker for the solar and wind markets, adding more than 510 GW of solar PV and wind capacity globally,” he said. “The resulting new generation from these sources, more than 900 TWh, will be enough to cover most of the growth in demand, helping limit the need for fossil-fuelled power generation. “
Diaz did caution that while capacity will continue to grow, governments need to put in place the right incentives for renewable energy projects to ensure the momentum continues.

Germany’s AEG has launched a new n-type solar module based on all-back contact (ABC) cell technology.
“Everything electric happens behind the curtains: the contacts are placed on the back of the module, thus allowing a ‘gridless’ effect,” Conny Axel Hulverscheidt, the CTO of AGE’s Solar Solutions Group, told pv magazine, referring to the cell design. “Not only does this allow a larger active area on the module surface to convert sunlight to electricity, it also ensures an absolute sleek black look. Furthermore, the low-temperature coefficients and the robust dual glass design make this solar module a real flagship product.”
The AS-M1089B-GA(M10)/HV solar panel is currently available in three versions with a power output of 445 W to 455 W. Power conversion efficiencies range from 22.8% to 23,3%, while the open-circuit voltage is between 40.15 V and 40.35 V and the short-circuit current spans from 13.68 A to 13.80 A.
The panel is based on M10 wafers, measures 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm, and weighs in at 24.0 kg. It relies on 2.0 mm glass, a black frame made of anodized aluminum alloy, and an IP68 rating. It can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C. It features a temperature coefficient of -0.29% per degree Celsius.
AEG offers a 40-year product warranty and a 40-year power output guarantee. The 40-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 83.4% of the nominal output power.
“To underline the premium approach, this module design gives us the confidence to offer market-leading warranties of up to 40 years,” Hulverscheidt stated. “The series will soon also include a 460 W version and will be available in two variants: a glass-glass product and a glass-backsheet module. Both panels with have a 108-cell design.”

The academics investigated, in particular, the timelines of 12,475 projects using PV, wind onshore, wind offshore, biomass, and run-off-river hydropower spread across 48 countries. “The regions are defined as per World Bank country and lending group classification and sorted continently into Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD groups, as those in the OECD group tend to be wealthier countries,” they explained.
Their analysis considered project size, technology, project and developer characteristics, project site, and a project’s related market. They utilized project-level data sourced from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BloombergNEF) and other country-level data and environmental data from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Worldwide Governance Indicators, among others.
“We only considered projects where permitting and commissioning dates are recorded in the data and where a country has at least five transactions for any given technology,” the group specified. “The sourced data include details on installed capacity, names of actors developing the projects, project geocoordinates, permitting dates, and commissioning dates.”
One of the first conclusions drawn by the scientists is that, although PV is the technology that requires the least time to commission, the completion times for the deployment of utility scale solar plants in many countries increased from 2015 to 2022. “The findings further indicate that the mean time for deployment has increased for all technologies in the OECD and non-OECD groupings, except for biomass electricity in non-OECD countries,” they stated.
Referring to the critical factors that may delay projects, the academics said size has an “insignificant” impact and added that developers’ experience is, instead, a significant predictor of commissioning times, although only for PV and wind onshore. “This is likely due to low experience build-up in the other technologies due to relatively low deployment compared to solar PV and wind onshore,” they emphasized, noting that the presence of a domestic developer or a state-owned company may speed up deployment.
The analysis showed that completion times for PV and wind onshore increased by 0.5 years and 0.9–1.2 years respectively for OECD and non-OECD countries. “The upward trend also holds for different regions within the OECD and non-OECD groupings, with only Europe and Asia-Pacific showing a reduction in commissioning times for small hydro RoR and biomass electricity respectively,” the researchers noted.
The analysis also showed that factors such as currency devaluation and GDP contraction, as well as the COVID-19 crisis, had a significant impact on project timelines. It also showed that the average project size for solar PV during the 2005-2022 period is 17.3 MW in OECD countries and 34.4 MW in non-OECD countries.
The research group presented its findings in the study “A global analysis of renewable energy project commissioning timelines,” published in Applied Energy. “Future research could strengthen the econometric analysis with other potential factors and variables, and potentially apply them to energy technologies beyond renewables, such as electricity storage or grid assets, which might shed light on the robustness of our framework,” the scientists concluded.
