The study also finds that the nation requires a cumulative 903 GWh of energy storage to meet the demand from utility-scale storage and electric vehicles by 2030.
Earlier this month, the government announced that it had established Lithium inferred resources of 5.9 million tonnes in the Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir.
The CEEW study ‘How can India indigenous lithium-ion battery manufacturing?’ calculates the material and financial requirements and offers a blueprint for the domestic strategy as India’s energy storage demand is expected to increase significantly. 
The analysis is based on the minimum manufacturing plant capacity of 5 GWh allocated under the PLI scheme. These plants will also be energy-intensive – requiring 250 GWh of power annually for a 5 GWh plant – and require a cheap and reliable power supply. 
 “For a green future, minerals like lithium will be as important as oil and gas are today. It’s in India’s strategic interest to secure not just the mineral but also set up the required cell and battery manufacturing systems within the country. It will reduce our dependence on other countries in the long run, and power our grid and EV transition,” said Rishabh Jain, senior program lead, CEEW.  
“This year’s Budget has shown India’s interest in addressing these challenges by eliminating duties on battery manufacturing equipment and providing viability gap funding for battery projects. To scale up domestic lithium-ion manufacturing, India should step up R&D investments, focus on battery cell component manufacturing and reducing material costs, and support recycling to reduce the need for new materials.”
To fulfill the overall battery demand, India will need 969-1,452 kilotonnes of anode, cathode, and electrolyte material between 2022 and 2030. This requires the country to prioritize other energy storage technologies as well. 
The CEEW study recommends focusing on the strategic sourcing of critical minerals and pushing for research, development, and demonstration in all technologies to retain competitiveness. At the same time, reducing the cost of manufacturing batteries by innovating and updating manufacturing processes, and making policy changes to lower the cost of cell components are important. 
“Currently, India is import-dependent but the government has already started mobilizing resources to indigenize battery cell manufacturing. The focus on mineral processing and component manufacturing is, however, limited. The study estimates that the share of upstream component manufacturing and material processing can be as high as 61. Going forward, India must develop its capabilities to build skills, technology know-how, and infrastructure to indigenize this part of the value chain too,” said Dhruv Warrior, research analyst.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/21/renewable-energy-auctions-not-in-tandem-with-government-targets/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 21, 2023",Renewable energy auctions not in tandem with government targets,"India needs to boost the tender activity for variable renewable energy (VRE) as it must add more than 30-35 GW of new VRE capacity annually to meet the ‘450 GW by 2030’ target of installed capacity, says a new report by IEEFA and JMK Research. 
The report states that the nation tendered a cumulative 161 GW of solar, wind, and hybrid capacity from 2010 to 2022 and allocated 114 GW. Over the last few years, tendering (both issuance and allotment) of utility-scale projects (mainly solar and wind) has shown a downward trend and is not in tandem with government targets. The variable renewable energy (VRE) capacity tendered annually in India fell from 40 GW in 2019 to about 28 GW in 2022. 
The report highlights factors causing low tender volumes in recent years. It states there is a noticeable shift in the off-taker’s power demand profile. Distribution companies (DISCOMs) no longer prefer plain vanilla solar and wind projects. Instead, because of VRE’s inherent intermittency and seasonality, they seek alternate clean energy solutions that offer more stable and firm power, such as wind-solar hybrid and renewable energy coupled with energy storage.
The Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI)— the key central government entity responsible for issuing new tenders and concluding auctions—is transitioning to new-age tenders of round-the-clock (RTC) power supply, renewable energy coupled with storage, and others to suit the need of DISCOMs. 
“This has been a gradual process, and it has been a challenge to discover the optimum mix of technologies and tender conditions to arrive at suitable tariffs for both DISCOMs and developers. Currently, for firm renewable energy power, pumped hydro storage technology is the only viable option with tariffs of INR 5-6/kWh ($0.06-0.07/kWh),” the report states.
Some renewable energy-rich states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have already achieved their renewable purchase obligation (RPO) targets. Hence, tender issuance from these states has slowed significantly in the past couple of years, despite the still-free interstate grid transmission access for VRE.
The report adds a lack of participation from developers in some recent tenders led to under-subscription. Aggressive bidding and the failure of bidders to foresee a 30-40% rise in solar module prices have slowed developer participation. Rising project costs due to the Approved List of Module Manufacturers (ALMM) mandate and Basic Custom Duty (BCD) on solar cell and module imports have also diminished the risk appetite of developers to bid aggressively on projects. The poor financial health of state DISCOMs leading to payment delays and the renegotiation of already executed contracts by certain states are other factors negatively affecting developer participation.
Given that the tariffs discovered in auctions of new-age tenders are on the higher side, DISCOMs continue to rely on conventional thermal power. 
The report recommends future renewable energy tenders should consider the harmony of requirements between the energy generators (developers) and the off-takers (DISCOMs). The upcoming renewable energy tenders must have a balanced approach between driving down tariffs and maintaining healthy competition by reducing the financial stress as a result of excessively aggressive bidding, stated the report
The government is also planning to remove the reverse auctions in wind tenders to address the same issue. The bidding process will only consist of closed bidding to discover the lowest quoted (L1) tariff among all the bidders in an auction. There will be no subsequent round of bidding to further drive down the prices.
The report also recommends strict enforcement of renewable purchase obligations (RPOs) across all states with heavy penalties for failures to meet them. Further, payment security mechanisms should be strengthened to address developers’ fears of delayed payments, especially in state tenders.

RoyPow Technology is displaying its new “all-in-one” residential battery energy storage solution at Intersolar North America this week in Long Beach, California. The company brings more than 20 years of manufacturing experience in renewable energy and battery energy storage systems.
The latest product, RoyPow SUN Series, is a lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) home battery sporting up to 15 kW of power and 40 kWh of capacity. It has a maximum efficiency of 98.5%.
The high-power battery is a true whole-home solution, the company says, as it is able to back up larger home appliances like air conditioners, dryers, and pool pumps. The high-capacity storage is designed to offer homeowners an opportunity to maximize solar energy self-consumption, avoiding value loss from exporting energy to the grid.
Like many battery offerings today, the SUN Series is modular and stackable, allowing for what is reportedly an easy design and installation. Battery modules can be stacked from 5.1 kWh to 40.8 kWh. Up to six units can be connected in parallel, delivering up to 90 kW output.
The battery is IP65 rated, resistant to dust and moisture, and is UL certified for safety. The LFP chemistry negates the need for cobalt in the battery, a mineral tied to conflict mining and higher rates of battery fires in traditional lithium-ion batteries. The company reports that the switching time is less than 10 milliseconds, which makes the battery safer, but also allows for automatic energy transfers for on- or off-grid use without power disruption.
The SUN Series battery is paired with its namesake app, which can be used to monitor solar production in real time. The app enables preference-setting for optimizing energy independence, outage protection, or savings. The system can be controlled with remote access and instant alerts.
The new product will meet the emergent needs created by “the trend of rising energy costs and the need for greater energy resilience in the face of increasingly frequent grid outages,” said Michael Li, vice president at RoyPow Technology.
Li said the company will continue to develop products in the renewable energy storage space, targeting commercial and industrial solutions, vehicle-mounted and marine applications, and more.
RoyPow is based in China’s Guangdong province, with manufacturing centers in China and subsidiaries in the United States, Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, and South Africa.

Scientists led by the University of Rochester in New York state have considerably reduced electron recombination processes in lead-halide perovskites (LHPs) used for solar cell applications. Recombination can have a significant impact on electrical performance in perovskite cells, with implications for open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, and ultimately, power conversion efficiency.
The researchers used what they call a “physics-based method” to create a film based on a type of LHP known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). They deposited that directly on a plasmonic substrate made of hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) with a high local density of state, via spin coating. They fabricated the multi-layered HMM with four pairs of alternative 10 nm thick layers made of silver, aluminum sulfate, and ozone (Ag-Al2 O3) by electron beam evaporation.
“The metal layer serves as a mirror, which creates reversed images of electron-hole pairs, weakening the ability of the electrons to recombine with the holes,” the scientists said, noting that they used a momentum-resolved imaging technique to characterize the film’s transition dipole orientation, which is the key factor enabling control over exciton recombination processes.
They claim that the interaction between the in–plane dipole of the LHP and its image formed on plasmonic substrate results in a tenfold decrease in the recombination rate, without any chemical treatment, optical cavity, and photonic band–gap engineering.
“Furthermore, image dipole interaction enables us to substantially improve the device performance of photodetectors by achieving more than 250% increase in the photoresponsivity,” they added.
The academics presented their findings in “Gigantic suppression of recombination rate in 3D lead-halide perovskites for enhanced photodetector performance,” which was recently published in Nature Photonics.
