KPI will build the project comprising 145.20 MW wind and 50 MW solar components in the state of Gujarat. The project falls under the company’s ‘captive power producer’ business segment, stated KPI.
The company’s scope of work includes land acquisition, design, manufacturing, supply, construction, erection, testing, and commissioning for the balance of plant, as well as facilitating power evacuation facilities and securing the necessary approvals and permits for the project.
The project is scheduled to be completed in the financial year 2024-25.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/22/site-selection-for-best-performing-solar-farms/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",IIT Mandi researchers evaluate solar plants across different climatic zones in India,"Solar energy plants typically underperform due to various factors, such as the selection of the wrong location or wrong technology, the environment, pollution, extreme weather, and dirt.
Researchers at IIT Mandi evaluated seven NTPC solar PV plants in India with the goal of determining the best-performing solar PV plant in terms of cost, environment, technicality, and location. The researchers said the methodology used in their study will assist decision-makers in locating suitable sites for solar power plants. 
For the PV plant evaluation, the researchers chose the following criteria in decreasing order of importance: economic, technical, environmental, and connectivity. They gave the most significance to economic criteria because of the large initial investment cost associated with the PV plants and the high operation and maintenance costs. 
Dadri, Port Blair, Ramagundam, Talcher Kaniha, Faridabad, Unchahar, and Singrauli solar PV plants were chosen because they are all built by the same company (NTPC), and secondly, they cover most of India’s climatic conditions. [Dadri, Faridabad, and Unchahar are in the composite zone, Port Blair is in the tropical zone, Ramagundam and Singrauli are in the hot and dry zone, and Talcher Kaniha is in the warm and humid zone.] 
The researchers, Shweta Singh and Satvasheel Pawar, used hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods such as F-SWARA, F-COPRAS, and F-ELECTRE to compare these solar PV plants based on four main criteria and twelve sub-criteria. They referred to the data available from the existing literature, the NTPC website, other internet resources, and through NTPC field visits for the evaluation.


The study concluded that Unchahar solar PV power plant is the best alternative in terms of performance, location, development, and management, while Faridabad solar PV and Port Blair solar PV plants are the least preferred on these parameters. 
The findings favor Unchahar solar PV because it has the lowest levelized cost of energy ($0.00011/kWh) and total cost ($579,263/MW), outperforming other six plants. Also, it was found to exhibit the second highest overall efficiency (14.15%), which falls under technical criteria—the evaluation’s second most important criterion.
In comparison to other solar PV plants, the amount of CO2 reduction (environmental criteria) in the case of the Unchahar solar PV plant (1,389.5 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum per MW) is the third best. Regarding location, Unchahar solar PV also has very good connectivity values, with the nearest railhead connectivity (5 km) and nearest city/town connectivity (3.8 km).
The operation and maintenance cost for Dadri solar PV ($4,092.57/MW per year) is less in comparison with Unchahar ($5,600.35/MW per year) and Faridabad solar PV ($7,215.84/MW per year) due to installation of 64 robots for dry cleaning on daily basis.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/22/p-type-solar-products-may-be-phased-out-by-2026-as-n-type-tech-rapidly-expands/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",P-type solar products may be phased out by 2026 as n-type tech ‘rapidly’ expands,"Analysis and data by Taiwan-based industry analysts TrendForce show that the superior conversion efficiencies of n-type cells has led to “rapidly” expanded capabilities in 2022 and primed the market for competition. This has led TrendForce analysts to believe p-type PERC capacities could be phased out by 2025.
“Currently, PERC cell technology for producing p-type cells stands as the market’s mainstay,” the report said. “However, with the step-by-step realization of large-scale n-type cell capacities, there looms a risk that a substantial part of PERC cell technology capacities may be phased out within the forthcoming two to three years.”
Analysis suggests that as n-type silicon incrementally comes online there might be a sporadic shortage of high-quality silicon materials and wafers fit for n-type cells. “This could further establish a noticeable price disparity between n-type silicon wafers, and their p-type counterparts,” the report says, which may lead to a noticeable price difference between the two technologies.
Polysilicon supply poses its own problems. Although supply remains “abundant,” TrendForecast warned that if production continues to surge for nN-type cells there could be an oversupply of p-type silicon causing its price to drop faster.
TrendForecast predicts supply could reach 68.8% capacity by the end of 2023 and 40.3% capacity by the end of 2025. “By 2023’s end, it is projected that the total production capacity of polysilicon will reach 2.072 million MT,” the report said. “The actual output of silicon materials is expected to be 1.483 million MT, sufficient to support over 600 GW of solar panel consumption (given a silicon consumption rate of 0.245 MT/GW). This aligns with an annual installation demand of approximately 370-390 GW, indicating a clear oversupply of silicon.”
TrendForce said demand and limited output may lead to periodic shortages of n-type silicon, which would level out prices.
Silicon wafer production capacity is expected to reach roughly 921.6 GW by the end of the year, the report said, with silicon wafer manufacturers reacting to the n-type cell scramble by “rapidly” transforming operations and scaling up output. This may once again impact p-type cells.
“With the inclusion of rectangular silicon wafers occupying a portion of this capacity, certain dimensions of p-type wafers might experience short-term supply shortages, potentially failing to meet immediate demands,” TrendForce said. “If the n-type cell rollout falls short of expectations, there remains a risk of n-type wafer oversupply.”
But as N-cell capacity deployment experiences delays, PERC tech will most likely remain the victorious technology for 2023, the report said. Total wafer capacity primarily attributed to N-type TOPCon cell technology is expected to reach 1,172 GW by the end of the year – a 106% increase since 2022, the report said.
“However, TrendForce has observed some delays in the actual deployment of N-type cell capacity. Given the existing price difference between N-P type wafers, PERC technology is anticipated to retain its leading position in the market this year, although the penetration rate of TOPCon cells will accelerate.”

In a position paper, the association outlined a due diligence program that should help PV manufacturers avoid exposure to forced labor in their supply chains.
“The EU must adopt robust legislation as soon as possible to prohibit the sale of products made with forced labor,” the trade body said, taking a clear position on the matter for the first time.
The association said it urged all its members cut their ties with suppliers and sub-suppliers from the Xinjiang region in China, where forced labor is allegedly being implemented.
“In awaiting the legislation, the EU must act urgently to prevent products made with forced labour from entering the European market,” it said.
The ESMC also proposed the creation of a database for over risk-areas and products, the implementation of a reversed burden of proof mechanism, and the introduction of due diligence obligations, among other things.
The report does not provide new evidence that forced labor is currently being used in the PV industry in the Xinjiang region. The association said its sources are reports from independent research institutes and international organizations, but cited exclusively the most recent report from Sheffield Hallam University.
The ESMC is an industry association that was created in 2019 with the aim of promoting the interests of the European PV manufacturing sector.
