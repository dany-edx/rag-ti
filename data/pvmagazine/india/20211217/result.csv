A new joint report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and energy think tank Ember says the State needs urgent action to get back on track, not only to meet its own targets but also to avoid slowing overall progress towards India’s targets of 175 GW of renewable capacity by 2022 and 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.
As of October 2021, Uttar Pradesh had total installed renewable capacity of 4.3 GW, which is only 30% of its renewable capacity commissioning target of 14.1 GW by 2022.
By comparison, other states with high electricity demand are well ahead on their 2022 capacity commissioning targets. Gujarat and Rajasthan have achieved 85% and 86%, respectively, and  Tamil Nadu 72%, Maharashtra 47%, and Madhya Pradesh 45%, stated the report.
The report finds Uttar Pradesh is lagging behind its peers on its 2022 solar capacity target of 10.7 GW – the second largest solar target among all Indian states. Only about 2 GW, or 19%, of that target has been achieved.
“Uttar Pradesh has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to rolling out solar capacity to meet its targets,” says report co-author Aditya Lolla, senior electricity policy analyst at Ember.
Uttar Pradesh accounts for a tenth of India’s power demand – the second largest share after Maharashtra. Over the past decade, the state’s electricity demand has increased by almost two-thirds and peak demand has more than doubled. And by 2030, electricity production is estimated to grow by 47 TWh.
“Until now, Uttar Pradesh has met most of its strong demand growth with coal capacity expansion. Going forward, solar can fulfil the vast majority of future electricity demand growth if the state achieves its 23.5 GW by 2030 target,” says Lolla.
“Hitting that target requires a major effort to ramp up solar capacity additions to around 2.5 GW every year on average.”
Lolla and co-author IEEFA energy finance analyst Kashish Shah say Uttar Pradesh is now at a crossroads where the choices it makes about meeting future power demand growth could either speed up or slow down India’s decarbonisation journey.
Meeting its 2030 solar target will allow Uttar Pradesh to avoid locking in resources to build new coal plants beyond those already under construction, says Shah.
“Building new coal-fired power plants is becoming increasingly unviable,” he says. “Capital for coal power projects is drying up. Apart from state-owned non-banking financiers – Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) – there is no investor willing to finance coal projects in India.
“In addition, coal power plant utilisation has been falling. The plant load factor of Uttar Pradesh’s 23.7GW coal fleet has dropped from 68% to 61% in the last five years.
“And heavy reliance on coal now leaves its power system vulnerable to any disruptions, even those caused outside the state.
The report highlights various barriers to solar uptake that need to be tackled urgently. These include the cancellation of renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) in recent years by state electricity distribution companies (discoms) and the discoms’ increasingly high aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses of above 30%.
Expensive and unreliable coal-fired generation has put tremendous pressure on the finances of discoms. In the financial year 2019/20 the Uttar Pradesh discoms incurred a loss of Rs4,917 crore (US$660 million), despite tariff subsidies of Rs10,120 crore (US$1.36 billion).
The report outlines a number of key recommendations for improving the discoms’ financial and operational performance, which, the authors say, is critical to transforming the state’s electricity sector.
Power purchase costs can be brought down by retiring old thermal power plants, which consume more coal per kilowatt hour than modern plants and are more polluting, and replacing expensive thermal power with cheaper renewable power. Further, promoting distributed solar energy will help discoms avoid grid losses.
Discoms can better manage peak demand and grid variability from renewable energy penetration by procuring power from day-ahead, term-ahead and real-time markets in open market platforms such as power exchanges or short-term bilateral contracts.
The report also recommends reducing the subsidy burden and investment in technology and modernisation of the grid.

The mission envisages commercial production of green hydrogen production in the nation from the financial year 2025-26 onwards. The draft proposes to undertake hydrogen production projects through a competitive bidding mode which would be open to participation from both private and public entities. 
Further, the Mission includes frameworks for indigenous manufacturing and research & development aimed at improving the efficiency of electrolyzers—systems that use electricity to break water into hydrogen and oxygen in a process called electrolysis. 
Among other provisions, the Mission includes a framework for demand creation of green hydrogen through mandates in identified sectors. 
At present, no state-owned refinery in India is producing green hydrogen.
As for current capacity in the nation, a green hydrogen project with a production capacity of one tonne per day has been established at Bikaner, Rajasthan, under the private sector. Further, under a Research and Development project supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, a 5 Nm3/h (normal cubic meter per hour) green hydrogen production plant based on solar energy-powered electrolysis has been established at the National Institute of Solar Energy, Gurugram, said the minister. 
The National Hydrogen Mission was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Independence Day this year. It is aimed to make India a global hub for green hydrogen production and export.

The bus runs on hydrogen fuel cell technology developed in collaboration with the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) and Central Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI) under the aegis of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.
In addition to the hydrogen fuel cell technology, Sentient Labs also indigenously designed and developed from the ground up other key components like the balance of plant, powertrain, and battery pack. All of these components have been deployed on a 9-meter, 32-seater, air-conditioned bus. This is designed to provide a range of 450 km while utilizing 30 kg of hydrogen. Modular architecture allows for changes in the design to suit requirements of range and operating conditions.

The fuel cell utilizes hydrogen and air to generate electricity to power the bus. The only effluent from the bus is water, therefore making it possibly the most environmentally friendly mode of transportation. 
Ravi Pandit, chairman of Sentient Labs, said, “We are proud to launch an indigenously developed hydrogen fuel cell-powered bus. A strong technical team along with CSIR-NCL worked on several technology components. This will go a long way in powering Hydrogen Mission, AatmaNirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), and importantly sustainable mobility. We envision that the solution will see widespread adoption powered by several partnerships. Our efforts will also be pivotal in enabling vehicle makers and suppliers to build a net-zero carbon path in India.”
Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar, Member of Board of Directors, Sentient Labs, said “World over, efforts related to green hydrogen revolution are on, but Sentient Labs stands out. At Sentient, challenges that are core to India are understood, and solutions are developed. Digitization, decentralization, and decarbonization are what India needs for sustainable mobility and these innovations from Sentient will go a long way.”
Incubated by KPIT Technologies Ltd, Sentient Labs’ vision is to build technology solutions for sustainable mobility with a current emphasis on hydrogen-powered technologies. It has identified bottlenecks in battery technology, fuel cell technologies, and technologies for hydrogen generation.
Recently, Sentient announced the world’s first technology to generate hydrogen directly from agricultural residue for use in fuel cell-powered vehicles. This technology adds to the line-up of efforts around sustainable mobility.

French solar company Mecojit has developed a solar car solution that requires neither foundations nor excavation work and which does not affect the surface where it is deployed.
“The digging of foundations may be a barrier to the installation of a PV system at certain sites, as these works may disrupt commercial and industrial activities,” company CEO Yanis Desangles told pv magazine. “Our solution can be deployed in any industrial or commercial space in record time and at a lower cost.”
Called Mecopark, the solar carport is built on a concrete structure that may be placed on the ground without the work required for conventional metallic structures, which must be anchored via excavation works. “The carbon footprint is also lower, it can be halved compared to a conventional structure,” said Desangles
The patented solution is sold with several options. One of them, called WallBox, includes the integration of charging stations into the concrete structure. “We are integrating the charging station and we are looking at how it can interact with the PV system,” Desangles continued. “The electric vehicle is a good way to store energy and could, in my opinion, become a real mobile battery in the long term.”
