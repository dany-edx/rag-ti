It supplied its single-axis Genius tracker equipment to a 394 MW PV project developed by Tata Power in Gujarat. The project is located 110 km from the Ahmedabad district. The solar plant is expected to generate an amount of electricity enough to power around 376,000 households.
This is the largest solar project utilizing single-axis trackers in India. GameChange Solar’s Genius Tracker 1P was selected for the Tata Power project as it is designed specifically for challenging ground conditions and high wind speeds as experienced in the project area. 
“The project, which was only partially constructed at the time, withstood the Tauktae cyclone when it hit in May of 2021. This was the strongest cyclone to strike Gujarat since 1998 and had wind speeds over 160 km/h and uprooted trees and electricity poles. Due to the quality engineering and construction of the Genius Tracker, no damage was caused to the portion of the facility installed at that time,” read a statement by GameChange Solar.
More than 20% of the materials for the Genius Tracker were sourced from within India. Going further, GameChange Solar targets local sourcing of more than 50% of the parts for its systems on all future projects in India.
Vikas Bansal, Chief Operating Officer, International for GameChange Solar, said their company looks forward to bringing the cutting-edge Genius Tracker technology to more projects in India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/12/upc-ac-energy-solar-commissions-150-mw-farms-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,GUJARAT,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 12, 2021",UPC-AC Energy Solar commissions 210 MW DC capacity in India,"AC Energy, Philippino group Ayala’s energy arm, and UPC Solar Asia Pacific, Hong Kong-based UPC Renewables’ solar energy platform, have announced their joint venture UPC-AC Energy Solar has commissioned its two maiden solar farms in India, the 140 MW DC (100 MW AC) Sitara Solar and 70 MW DC (50 MW AC) Paryapt Solar.
The Sitara Solar farm is a US$65 million solar facility located in the Jodhpur district of Rajasthan, a desert state with the highest irradiation in India. It benefits from a long-term PPA with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) at an INR 2.48/kWh tariff.
The Paryapt Solar is located in the Amreli District of Gujarat. The US$38 million solar facility has been supplying energy to Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) at INR 2.55/kWh.
The aggregate 210 MW DC capacity of the solar farms comprises more than 466,000 solar panels, which could produce around 358 GWh annually and help offset an estimated 323,990 metric tonnes of CO2e.
Pranab Kumar Sarmah, CEO of UPC-AC Energy Solar and co-founder of UPC Solar Asia Pacific, said the two projects were commissioned on time and within the construction budget despite many challenges due to Covid-19 pandemic and rising material costs.
UPC-AC Energy Solar is now gearing up to start the construction of an additional 420 MW DC (300 MW AC) of solar assets in Madhya Pradesh this year. With initial successes on hand, it is aiming to have about 1 GW of operating solar assets in India by 2023.
Located in Khandwa district, the upcoming 300 MW project is named Masaya Solar and has an estimated project cost of US$220 million. The solar farm is expected to become operational by March 2022. It will supply energy for 25 years to SECI.  The project will be connected through a 220KV transmission line to The Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL)’s inter-state transmission network.
UPC Renewables is a leading renewable energy developer in the Asia Pacific region with offices in Australia, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. It has more than 73 wind and solar projects operational with a total installed capacity of 4,500 MW and an investment value of over US$8.4 billion.
AC Energy has 1.2 GW of attributable capacity in the Philippines. This is expected to increase with the infusion of AC Energy International, which has 1.4 GW of attributable capacity. AC Energy aspires to become the largest listed renewables platform in Southeast Asia, with a goal of reaching 5 GW of renewables capacity by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/12/recovering-waste-heat-from-solar-cells-via-a-thermoelectric-generator/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 12, 2021",Recovering waste heat from solar cells via a thermoelectric generator,"From pv magazine International
A U.S.-Italian research group has fabricated a hybrid thermoelectric photovoltaic (HTEPV) system that is able to recover waste heat from its solar cell and use it to generate additional power output.
The device consists of an optimized thermoelectric generator (TEG) placed in thermal contact with the back of a perovskite solar cell with a surface area of 1 cm² by means of a layer of thermal grease. While in thermal contact, the two units are electrically separated.
“The HTEPV should be used once two main requirements regarding the PV part are met,” research co-author, Bruno Lorenzi, told pv magazine. The first is that they use cells with a wide bandgap. The researchers estimate that cells with an energy gap greater than about 1.6 eV are needed, as large gap cells are less sensitive to temperature in terms of their performance. The second requirement is that the system has sufficient input power to raise the temperature enough.
Heat flows naturally through the TEG because its cold side is kept at room temperature, while its hot side, which is in thermal contact with the cell, is at a high temperature. The Seebeck effect, which is the direct conversion of temperature differences between two semiconductor materials into electric voltage, generates this difference which then translates into additional electrical power.

The scientists decided not to use a spectrum splitting technology, which is generally utilized in these applications, to direct different parts of the solar spectrum towards either the PV or the TEG unit. “It is more convenient, in terms of final efficiency gains, to keep the solar cell at the same temperature of the TEG hot side, instead of keeping the cell cold but losing much of the recoverable heat,” the academics explained, noting that a wide-gap solar cell based on perovskite was chosen for the device, due to its lower sensitivity to high temperatures. “Temperature-sensitive materials, such as silicon, lose too much efficiency to make the hybridization convenient,” they further explained.
The TEG is placed into an evacuated tube to minimize the heat exchange with the environment. It is able to extract waste heat from the solar cell and convey it to its cold plate, where it is dissipated by a fluid. Its cold side is attached with thermal grease to the vacuum chamber bottom and its temperature is controlled with a K-type thermocouple. “As the TEG part is placed under a difference of temperature a delta of electrical potential is developed between its hot and cold electrodes due to the Seebeck effect,” Lorenzi further explained. “Thus once the TEG is connected to a load it generates a flowing electrical current.”
The extraction of heat from the solar cell, according to the scientists, can provide efficiency gains ranging from 0.2 to 3.05%. Although the group tested different kinds of wide-gap solar cells for the HTEPV system, it found the perovskite-based devices offer the best performance in terms of power conversion efficiency.
“Evaluating the cost of this technology is not easy, because it depends a lot on the type of system you are considering,” the Italian researchers emphasized. “The thermoelectric material itself has a negligible cost, as very little is needed in volumetric terms per unit of area. What may increase the device’s cost, according to him are the heat sink, the vacuum tube, and the concentrator used for its assembly. “If you develop a hybrid starting from a PV technology that works in concentration and with a cooling system, the cost is very low and there are no problems,” he further explained. “The other cases must be carefully evaluated.”
The full description of the thermoelectric-photovoltaic device can be found in the paper Practical development of efficient thermoelectric – Photovoltaic hybrid systems based on wide-gap solar cells, published in Applied Energy. The research group includes scientists from the University of Milano-Bicocca and the University of Rome Tor Vergata in Italy, as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States.
