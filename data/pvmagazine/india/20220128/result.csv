Australian hydrogen-powered vehicle maker H2X Global has signed a binding agreement with Indian automotive components manufacturer and supplier Advik Hi-Tech establishing a joint venture (JV) company to manufacture and market hydrogen fuel cells, generators and vehicles in India.
H2X has retained a 49% stake in the JV company with Advik, which has more than $100 million in annual revenues, to hold the majority share.
The new JV will manufacture fuel cells, generators and vehicles designed and developed by the Victorian-based H2X team and will build a global supply chain of products and components for hydrogen-powered vehicles and powered products.
H2X, led by automotive industry veteran Brendan Norman who has worked for BMW and VW in Australia and Asia, said in a statement production is “scheduled to start immediately to cater for the rapidly growing demand for hydrogen-powered equipment and vehicles in India”.
Norman said the Indian market is critical to the long-term success of the hydrogen industry and H2X’s partnership with Advik will be critical to the company’s growth.
“We have long believed India is one of the great manufacturing powers of the world and we have found a great player in the automotive Industry in Advik,” he said.
“The cooperation between our companies gives us great strength in being able to address India but also to provide us with a strong manufacturing backbone to support our production activities in Australia and other parts of the world as well.”

According to its website, H2X has developed its own proprietary fuel cell and powertrain system. This system is at the crux of the company’s various light equipment vehicles. These are expected to include a van, minibus, SUV, and a ute. The technology itself is designed to drastically reduce refuelling time and increase driving range.
In a joint statement, the two companies said they had for the past 12 months been working together for the past 12 months to explore opportunities for hydrogen in India and the JV will establish them as a key player in the booming market.
“India is destined to be a leader in the hydrogen industry with strong support from government and industry and as a company which has always been ahead of the curve we are aggressively pushing into the hydrogen space as a core growth area for our company and as a leader of this movement in the country,” Advik managing director Aditya Bhartia said.
“We have great confidence in the product range from H2X as being one with several key opportunities to support to deployment of hydrogen in the Indian market and together with our local knowledge and expertise we see great opportunity to develop this for acceleration of the Indian clean energy movement.”
A core manufacturer and supplier of automotive components to almost all major original equipment manufacturers, Advik will not only manufacture H2X’s fuel cells, generators and vehicles. It will also supply the Australian company with products and components and will use its existing network to distribute H2X’s products into the Indian and international markets.
The JV company is set to commence manufacturing operations with production of H2X’s series of hydrogen powered generators.
H2X said it currently has two of these units ready for deployment in Australia but the first generators manufactured by the JV will be put into service with a large-scale power system to be installed at Advik’s research and development centre in Pune, India.
The first products from the JV are set to be delivered to the market within the coming few months, with the power system in Pune being the highlight of the launch of the venture.
“The opportunity for us to be able to launch a product to the Indian market at this early stage is reflective of the passion we have at Advik to lead our country and the world in terms of being active in new technological advancement,” Aditya said.
“We strongly believe that through our partnership with H2X we come into a position where we can become a global leader in the hydrogen revolution and strongly position the growth of hydrogen in India as a strong pillar of growth into the future.”
H2X is also looking to establish manufacturing operations in Malaysia after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the state-owned Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) to form a joint venture for the manufacturing, assembly and development of a range of hydrogen-powered vehicles.
Under the agreement, the JV will manufacture a range of vehicles, including H2X’s Warrego ute, as well as buses and hydrogen-powered generators.
H2X has also teamed with SEDC and renewables developer Thales New Energy to develop a 1.3 GW hydrogen export facility powered by hydroelectricity in Sarawak.
The agreement with see the trio form an incorporated JV to develop the Samalaju Hydrogen Production Plant, which is proposed to be capable of producing as much as 170,000 tonnes per year of liquid hydrogen or 970,000 tonnes per year of ammonia for export.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/28/govt-may-delicense-setting-up-of-standalone-energy-storage-systems/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 28, 2022",Govt may delicense setting up of standalone energy storage systems ,"Energy storage systems shall be an integral part of the power system under the Electricity Act. The government is also looking to delicense the setting up of standalone energy storage systems (units not co-located with renewable energy generation), power minister RK Singh said at a meeting with RE developers and energy storage industry representatives to discuss the draft Policy on energy storage systems.
The draft policy aims at the creation of a technology-agnostic storage system across the value chain of the electricity sector, viz, at generation, transmission, and distribution levels. Currently, pumped hydro storage facilities are the most common form of grid energy storage in India.
Energy storage systems will benefit power generators, State-owned distribution companies, grid operators, and other players in the electricity value chain as these facilitate peak shifting, peak shaving, ramp up/ramp down, and frequency control in the system and enhance the utilization of the transmission system.
Highlighting the elements of the proposed policy, Singh stated that storage will henceforth be a part of the Renewable Purchase Obligation. Also, the curtailment of renewable energy will be penalized under the provisions of the Act.
As per the proposed policy, energy storage system developers shall be granted inter-state transmission system connectivity under general network access. So, they can sell or purchase power from any part of the country. 
The energy storage facility can be set up and used by power generators to meet their generation obligation under the firm supply contract.
The minister said the quantum of energy storage systems included with round-the-clock (RTC) renewable energy shall be counted as Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for storage. Also, Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) may be issued to ESS developers. 
Discoms can set up their own storage, or procure or lease storage capacity from public or private energy storage system developers. Any sale of electricity from storage or sale/lease of storage space may be allowed through open competitive bidding, Power exchange, or through tariff fixed under Section 62 of the Electricity Act. 
The policy proposes renewable energy transmission charges be waived both at the time of charging the storage as well as at the time of selling the stored RE. 
The participants were requested to submit any further suggestions within 15 days.

In light of its ambition to go all electric by 2030, German luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz continues to expand its network of tech partners, this time through a collaboration with Taiwanese solid-state battery specialist ProLogium.
The first Mercedes-Benz test vehicles equipped with solid-state batteries co-developed with ProLogium are expected to be introduced in the coming years. The companies have agreed on milestones to enable the integration of solid-state battery technology into a range of passenger vehicles in the second half of this decade.
“We believe that range and efficiency are the new industry benchmarks for electric cars,” said Daimler head of development Markus Schäfer. “Solid state technology helps to cut down battery size and weight. This is why we are partnering with companies like ProLogium to ensure that Mercedes-Benz continues to break new ground in the automotive sector for the benefit of our customers.”
Under the agreement, Mercedes will take a seat on the ProLogium board. The high double-digit million euro investment by the carmaker will be used to support the development of the technology and ProLogium’s plan of establishing production capacity in Europe. The Taiwanese battery maker focuses on the development of next-generation batteries including solid-state devices with silicon and lithium metal anodes and bipolar technology.
“We have been working with Mercedes-Benz on the testing of our EV [electric vehicle] battery cells since 2016 and are excited to strengthen and expand our partnership,” said ProLogium CEO and founder Vincent Yang. “At ProLogium, we believe that innovative technology must be backed by the scalability of production. We look forward to ramping up our new plant by the end of 2022 and working with our customers toward successful mass production.”
Thus far, the development of solid-state batteries has been primarily driven by automotive companies. Mercedes has partnered with Canadian battery material specialist Hydro-Québec to integrate the technology into field applications and cut development cycle times and other legacy automakers have invested heavily in solid-state devices, including Toyota and Volkswagen.
Offering potentially higher energy density, more cycles at a reduced rate of degradation, and less weight, solid-state battery cells are described as one of the key levers for determining the cost, scalability, and energy density of EV batteries. A solid-state electrolyte offers the option of using materials with high storage capacity, high-ionic conductivity, and better chemical stability; replacing the flammable electrolytes used in conventional lithium-ion batteries.
The innovative materials and design of solid-state batteries could almost double the range of today’s conventional li-ion battery cells and could be far cheaper as they do not require cobalt. However, the technology remains relatively unproven, with auto manufacturers hoping their battery partners will give them an edge and help bring forward commercial production.
Elsewhere, Toyota and Panasonic have started research with the University of Tokyo into battery resources and recycling. In addition to closing the loop and realizing carbon neutrality, the aim of the project is to reduce production costs in the battery supply chain.
Four project partners: the Institute of Industrial Science at The University of Tokyo; the Prime Planet Energy & Solutions Inc joint venture set up by Toyota and Pansonic; Panasonic’s Energy Company unit; and Toyota trading arm the Toyota Tsusho Corporation, will look at two aspects of the battery economy. They will focus on the development of new processes in an integrated manner, ranging from the development of nickel, lithium, and cobalt metal resources to refining them during the development and manufacture of battery materials. The research will also consider the development of new processes for the recycling of battery waste and used batteries.
With the aim of further improving the recycling rate of batteries, the research project will promote the development of technology for the efficient and waste-free recycling of leftover materials from battery manufacturing and used devices. Combining the knowhow of the partners – manufacturing experience; commercial collection, processing and recycling of materials; and university research into rare metal refining technology – the project aims to significantly reduce CO2 emissions and recycling costs, which are currently a big issue.
“We will not only supply battery materials but also contribute to the reduction of environmental impact and the formation of a recycling-oriented society by promoting recycling, making use of our knowledge in the recycling-oriented venous business,” said Masaharu Katayama, chief operating officer for Toyota’s Metals Business Unit.
Following its historic listing on the Korean Stock Exchange, LG Energy Solution unveiled its expansion plans yesterday, with a commitment to construct a $2.1 billion battery manufacturing plant in the U.S. with General Motors. The facility will begin mass production in early 2025 and will produce 50GWh of EV batteries annually once fully operational.
The factory will be located in Lansing, Michigan and will produce batteries under the Ultium brand developed by a joint venture between General Motors and LG Chem. Ultium devices are said to be unique because their large-format, pouch-style cells can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside a battery pack, enabling engineers to optimize energy storage and layout for each vehicle design.
LG and General Motors are building two other battery cell manufacturing sites – one in Ohio and another in Tennessee – both of which will be capable of producing 35GWh of battery cells. “With a shared vision, GM and LG Energy Solution pioneered the EV sector by seizing new opportunities in the market well before anyone else did,” LG Energy Solution chief executive Young-Soo Kwon said. “Our third battery manufacturing plant, fittingly located in America’s automotive heartland, will serve as a gateway to charge thousands, and later, millions of EVs in the future.”
LG Energy Solution shares were sold at an IPO price of KRW300,000 ($250) this month in Asia’s second largest float, behind only the $12.9 billion initial public offering for the Alibaba Group in 2019. On its trading debut today, LG Solution’s shares surged 68%, solidifying the battery maker’s rank as South Korea’s second-most valued company.

Electrolyzer sales are expected to quadruple this year driven by the Chinese, US, and European markets, wrote BloombergNEF in a report published on Friday, adding that clean hydrogen demand from industry should be the main driver.
“Electrolyzer manufacturers delivered 458 megawatts in 2021, and BNEF expects shipments to at least quadruple in 2022, to between 1.8-2.5 gigawatts. China will account for 62-66% of total demand, driven by state-owned enterprises keen to show compliance with national decarbonization goals,” wrote BloombergNEF. BloombergNEF predicts that the US will be the second-largest electrolyzer market this year.
“U.S. developers will rush to announce projects in 2022, as the government readies a multi-billion-dollar investment in hydrogen as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. But with actual funding spread over the next five years, construction is likely to lag.”
BloombergNEF also expects at least four hydrogen companies to go public in 2022, the number of countries with a hydrogen strategy to jump from 26 to 48, and the industry’s focus on green ammonia and alkaline electrolyzers.
