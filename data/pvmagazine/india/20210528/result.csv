The first articles in our Solar 101 series, (Is my roof ready for solar?) and (Attaching your solar system to your roof) examined how the age and physical characteristics of a roof affect the design and payback of a prospective solar system. We also discussed the design constraints resulting from wind, dirt, and precipitation. And, in Working the angles to maximize your solar system’s output, we looked at the relationship between a panel’s latitude, pitch and azimuth to its solar electricity output.
Now, we’ll look at how to find a solid solar contractor to build your solar power system.
A well-designed solar system should last 20 or 30 years, or longer. The mounting hardware, which attaches directly to your home, will typically require drilling holes in your roof. But don’t fear. This guide for choosing the right contractor should help ease your concerns.
One rule of thumb: Find someone experienced. Installing solar panels, like anything else, involves doing a set of similar actions over and over. Experience represents more than just the labor of attaching solar panels and the required electrical gear. For instance, experience usually indicates:
Recent research by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Berkeley Lab suggests that more experienced contractors offer better pricing.  This chart from their annual Tracking the Sun report doesn’t explicitly break down experience, but it does show how pricing can vary by contractor.
Experienced solar contractors have a truck filled with various odds and ends leftover from prior solar jobs. These little components often mean the difference between finishing a project in a day or two, versus two or three days with several trips to the local hardware store mixed in.
The question then becomes “how do we find an experienced solar contractor?”
First off, ask your friends. And as strange as it may sound, knock on the door of someone who has already installed solar power and ask them. These folks have real experience with a contractor, and can give you a tip or two as you ask questions of prospective contractors.
If you know contractors who have done good work for you already, ask them who they would hire to install a solar system on their roof. Roofing and electrical contractors often have pre-existing relationships with solar contractors because their businesses have a lot of overlap. Your HVAC contractor may also have a good working relationship with a solar contractor. And finally, local professional engineers (specifically structural and electrical) will have knowledge of the local solar contractors because they have to sign off on solar design drawings.
Another technique is to reach out to your local town hall to learn who the local permit office likes to deal with. Be sure to ask which solar contractors always seem to submit the right paperwork. This question may be more important than it appears, because paperwork is a huge part of a solar installation.
And one last technique: Call your local contractor supply houses. Again, the supply houses have relationships with contractors that buy the most hardware from them. For this call, come prepared with a few key questions: Who pays their bills on time, who’s been in business the longest, and who is most organized?
One way to vet a contractor is to simply call them and see how they follow up with you. Their follow-up will give you an idea about the quality of service you might receive later in the process.  Be sure to call an actual local contractor, and not a sales organization that will simply hand the lead off to a contractor.
A few items to consider when the contractor representative shows up:
After reaching out to locals and others in the know, the next place to go is Google. But beware: Companies – and especially sales organizations – specialize in placing themselves high up the Google search results.
Contractors, on the other hand, specialize in building things. Many good builders lack grammar and/or web development skills. Look the other way and evaluate them on attributes that matter: reliability, knowledge, experience, and work product.
The one place that this author regularly sends people is SolarPowerWorldOnline’s Top 500 list. You’ve got to be smart, however, about using this list.
First, make sure you choose your own state because the default list is national. Second, recognize that companies pay a fee to get on the list. And third, consider that the companies near the top of the list are likely the largest national companies.
A second path to follow without cold calling is to use EnergySage. Contractors submit their profile to the company, must have at least 10 installations with positive reviews, and are regularly re-vetted.
Here’s the key value kicker from EnergySage: After you submit your address, you will get a few quotes from contractors who  know very well that they are competing with at least two or three other contractors. This will likely force these contractors to work their numbers to be competitive.
Contractors pay commissions to EnergySage – about $1,000 if the customer ends up installing. However, that commission is comparable to what a door-to-door salesperson might make.
Of course, you should also consider the largest national companies, with Sunrun, Sunnova, and Tesla being the big three these days. These companies all have unique offerings, and also some similar products, so research each of them and their offerings to know which might best fit your needs.
Sunrun and Sunnova are best known for their solar lease products. In essence, you rent your rooftop to them in exchange for a “free” solar power system. Tesla’s main business is to sell you a system that you fully own, whether it be standard solar panels or their new Solar Glass roof product. Both Sunrun and Sunnova will also sell, but their system costs typically don’t compete with Tesla’s pricing model.
The compromise: You will likely get the cheapest price for residential solar hardware from Tesla, but there also will probably be less personal interaction and system optimization.
A small local company might not be able to provide the lowest hardware prices, but will likely put more effort into customizing a design to fit your specific application. And always keep one eye open. Some mid-sized companies will quote twice as much as their competitors.

The manufacturer’s Series 6 modules, with next-generation M6 cells, exceeded the international quality and performance benchmarks by PVEL.
The company has claimed the top performer position in PVEL’s PV module reliability scorecard list for the third consecutive year, and has been listed as a top performer four times in the last five years
The rankings are based on results from rigorous, comprehensive testing programs. Top performing modules showed less than 2% degradation for the entirety of the test sequence.
This year, Vikram Solar’s Series 6 modules, Somera and Prexos, were nominated for accelerated stress testing and characterization under PVEL LLC’s PQP.  The test results exceeded the quality and performance benchmarks.
Vikram Solar’s annual PV module production capacity stands at 1.2 GW.

The company’s annual revenue from operations grew 85.4% year-on-year to INR 502.3 crore. Out of this, about 21.67% (INR 108.9 crore) came from exports (including to customers in the special economic zone). This compares to exports worth INR 62.7 crore in FY2020.
The yearly profit-after-tax grew several folds to INR 89.6 crore.
The company’s annual solid performance (despite a Covid-hit first quarter) was mainly driven by high production and sales in the fourth quarter. Sales in Q4 FY2021 stood at INR 195 crore, a 106% growth year-on-year. The quarterly profit-after-tax at INR 66.9 crore was about 16 times higher y-o-y. 
Record sales in Q4 FY2021 were significantly aided by high price realizations owing to an overall global supply crunch following a high local Chinese demand. The demand-supply was driven by higher installations in China and a steady shift towards the use of glass-glass modules (which require two glasses as against just one in a conventional module). 
“95% of the global production of solar glass is controlled by Chinese companies, who determine international pricing. Our company’s large customers follow the price trend of imported glass, and, as such, the company was able to realize higher selling prices from its domestic as well as export markets,” stated Borosil Renewables.
The increased demand meant the manufacturer’s production lines operated at their full capacity of 450 metric tons per day during February and March 2021.
Going forward, Borosil Renewables anticipates [the prices] will likely moderate as supply catches up with demand over the next few months or the market slows down for some reason, which has actually happened after March 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/28/simple-trick-to-protect-pv-systems-from-pigeons/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 28, 2021",Simple trick to protect PV systems from pigeons,"From pv magazine International
Rainer Sedlmaier from Nauheim near Frankfurt am Main, Germany, was concerned that his son’s rooftop PV system could have been damaged by the presence of pigeons, which sometimes can make their nests right under the modules.
Sedlmaier did not observe any issues with pigeons in his own photovoltaic system or that of his neighbors, as the inclination of the roofs was between 35% and 45%. In the case of his son, however, the roof inclination was only 20%, which means pigeons will have no problems nesting there.
To prevent pigeons from reaching the array, Sedlmaier applied rotating brushes with a diameter of 12 cm to the PV system frames and this solution, according to him, make the pigeons reluctant to approach the installation.
He calculated that for an average rooftop PV system, these brushes may cost a total of between €100 and €200 and recommended installing the brushes when a project is being built, as a retrofit may be more complex.
Brooding pigeons under the modules are particularly problematic because they can contaminate the systems with their aggressive droppings. Once they have nested there, they will be happy to come back, as these birds are loyal to their area. And they come back often because they breed several times a year.

Installations were 88% up year-on-year, compared to 1,090 MW added in Q1 2020, according to Mercom‘s CY Q1 2021 India Solar Market Update. 
With this, cumulative solar installations in India reached 41 GW (35.5 GW large-scale and 5.4 GW rooftop) as of March 31, 2021, representing 10.7% of the nation’s total installed power capacity. 
Out of 2,056 MW Q1 installation, 1,749 MW came from utility-scale projects and 307 MW from rooftop solar. 
Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh led the way in installation, followed by Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. 
According to the report, solar installations improved considerably in Q1 2021, with developers completing their delayed projects from last year. Rooftop solar adoption surged as the commercial and industrial sector looked for ways to cut costs during challenging market conditions. 
The large-scale project pipeline stood at 53.6 GW, with another 24.1 GW of projects tendered and pending auctions as of Q1 2021. 
The report expected the annual solar installation to be hit significantly as project timelines get extended due to the second wave of Covid. It forecasts about 7 GW PV installation in 2021 under a medium-case scenario for the Covid impact.  
“With the second wave of the pandemic hitting the country, the industry is battling solar component price increases and volatility. Even more concerning is the uncertainty in procurement as shortages are widespread. Policy restrictions and duties have added to the rising costs and unpredictability,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. 
“Due to the targeted lockdowns, this time around, disruptions and labor issues are not as widespread as last year. However, most of the lockdowns are in important solar states like Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh which will significantly impact installation totals this year,” added Prabhu.
