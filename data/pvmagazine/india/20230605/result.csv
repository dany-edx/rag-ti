The report stated India’s annual utility-scale solar capacity addition (made up mainly of capacity awarded in auctions) reached a record-breaking 14 GW in 2022. On the other hand, auction volumes in 2022 dropped by one-third, with only 10 GW AC awarded—the lowest capacity since 2017.

Tariffs discovered in 2022 auctions were 15% higher than in 2021, discouraging distribution companies (DISCOMs) in poor financial health from signing contracts. In addition, some states that had fulfilled their Renewable Purchase Obligations avoided further auctions, and government agencies put more emphasis on hybrid tenders. 
IEA expects the lower awarded capacity in 2022 to translate into a slowdown in PV capacity addition in 2023. 
Short-term supply-demand mismatches and higher prices, triggered by import tariffs, will further affect PV expansion in 2023 and 2024, IEA added.
Developers prefer high-output top-tier modules for their cost efficiency and to more easily secure low-cost financing. IEA stated the demand for high-capacity modules from large-scale top-tier manufacturers exceeds supply in the short term: “Although the list of government-approved manufacturers (ALMM) in February 2023 implied total manufacturing capacity of 22 GW, only less than 5 GW were declared by large producers offering modules with over 500 W of power.”
Along with supply-demand mismatches, introducing higher import tariffs on PV modules and cells in April 2022 led to a 30-40% increase in module prices in the second half of 2022. This reduced project bankability, forcing developers to cancel or delay projects while waiting for PV prices to fall. In response, the government postponed ALMM requirements for all projects commissioned by April 2024 and extended the commissioning deadlines. 
IEA stated while government actions have mitigated some challenges, the temporary supply-demand mismatch for top-tier PV modules will prevent rapid utility-scale PV expansion in 2023 and 2024. It, however, expects PV deployment in India to boom beyond 2025, with higher auction volumes and lower prices.
The report expects India to become fully self-sufficient in solar PV supply in the next four to five years as the manufacturing capacity awarded in the two rounds of the PLI subsidy scheme comes online.
Overall, it expects India’s renewable capacity additions to increase again in 2023 and 2024, owing to faster onshore wind, hydropower and distributed solar PV deployment.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/05/improving-ground-mounted-solar-power-plant-performance-via-orbiting-reflectors/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 5, 2023",Improving ground-mounted solar power plant performance via orbiting reflectors,"From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists from the University of Glasgow has suggested using lightweight orbiting reflectors powered by photovoltaics to increase electricity generation in solar power plants located on Earth.
Through their work, the researchers defined a single reference architecture for orbiting solar reflectors, as well as a detailed analysis of the integrating orbital dynamics, attitude control, and structures. They also assessed the breakeven conditions of these systems in terms of energy prices, launch costs, and discount rates, while noting that the proposed architecture is representative of current or near-term developments in both the energy and space sectors.
They specified that the orbiting reflectors may be particularly beneficial for terrestrial solar power generation at dawn and dusk when there is less sunlight and output is low.
The reflectors are assumed to be built with triangular elements, which the research group said have the advantage that a structure of any arbitrary size can be constructed with them. “Moreover, in the case of membrane tearing, only a single triangular module would be damaged, rather than the entire structure,” it explained. “Developments of the SpaceX Starship reusable launch vehicle will be considered for the transportation of materials and components to space.”
The reflectors would have a hexagonal shape and a diameter of approximately 1 km. They would also be based on multiple mirrors in formations and would utilize control moment gyroscope (CMG) rotors, while operating at an altitude of 884.59 km and being able to perform 14 orbits per 24-hour cycle.
“A hexagonal reflector has been considered for its versatility for in-orbit manufacturing and assembly, where it is assumed that the shape would be assembled from the equilateral triangular elements with 50m side length,” the academics stated. “A combination of the shape requirement and actuator constraints eventually leads to an overall hexagon side of 250m.”
The research team considered different planned or operating giant solar power plants to validate their approach and said that the world’s largest solar project under development – the $20 million Sun Cable project in Australia – may be considered an exemplary solar power plant for the proposed technology.
“This paper considers inclined orbits, but the orbit is selected such that it is ‘anchored’ to the Sun Cable solar farm,” it also noted. “The reflectors in this orbit can service nine large solar power plants over one sidereal day, delivering a total quantity of 283.8 MWh solar energy.”
Their cost analysis also highlighted that this technology may achieve an average cost of additional electricity of $70/MWh at a 5% discount rate over a 20-year period. “If a more realistic discount rate of 15% is used, then the same target price can be achieved by reducing the reflector mass density to approximately 13.2gm-2,” they concluded. “Even though this value is smaller than that found in this paper, it is expected that future advancements in space technology may lead to a reduction in the mass density, with the additional advantage that smaller actuators can be used for the same reflector size.”
They presented their findings in the paper “A reference architecture for orbiting solar reflectors to enhance terrestrial solar power plant output,” which was recently published in Advances in Space Research.

It will build the proposed facility with an estimated investment of INR 13,000 crore ($1.57 billion) in the initial phase.
According to a government release, the plant is expected to generate direct and indirect employment for more than 13,000 people. 
Building a domestic lithium battery manufacturing base is crucial for India to meet the surging demand arising from the decarbonization of the transport and electricity sectors. While lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity has been proliferating globally, battery manufacturing in India is yet to take off. As a result, India is dependent on imports to meet its battery requirements.  
According to a CEEW study, India’s lithium-ion battery imports touched $1.8 billion in 2022, which included $1.6 billion (or over 85%) worth of imports from China (including Hong Kong) alone.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/05/terrain-following-solar-tracker-with-a-pneumatic-twist/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 5, 2023",Terrain-following solar tracker with a pneumatic twist,"From pv magazine USA
What sets Sunfolding’s terrain-following tracker apart from other designs is pneumatics, a 360-year old technology that converts power into movement.
Traditional trackers are mechanically more complex, which can make installation and maintenance costly. Sunfolding developers discovered that pneumatics offered a simpler approach with advantages in certain solar designs. Some of those advantages include a reservoir (or bladder) for air storage so they can continue operating through loss of power.
They can also operate through loss of air and can run continuously without the threat of overheating. Read more about solar and pneumatics in Sunfolding’s white paper. Without batteries or metal drive components, the pneumatic technology is also able to withstand extremely low temperatures where traditional trackers have had issues.
As noted by Chip McDaniel in Industrial Equipment News, pneumatics offer the advantage of simplicity, low cost and reliability, providing “a quick path to motion,” providing significant force in a small space.
The patented AirDrive technology used by Sunfolding was invented by Leila Madrone, company founder and chief technology officer. Madrone is a roboticist, having received both her bachelors and masters in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT, with a focus on robotics and mechatronics. Early in her career she worked on automation for the genomics industry and the commercialization of NASA robotics hardware. Founded in 2012, Sunfolding was spun out of MIT’s Otherlab. In 2016, the company won a $4.2 million ARPA award for its “pneumatically-actuated PV tracking system.”
The AirDrive system
At the heart of its tracking system is the AirDrive. Based on Madrone’s invention, it consists of flexible bladders (shown above) enclosed in a metal housing with a bladder to the east and one to the west. When the bladders are pressurized to different levels, one side expands and tilts the solar structure in the opposite direction. AirDrive X actuators in the Sunfolding system reportedly weigh less than 50 pounds. Wes Fuller, vice president of sales and strategic partnerships, told pv magazine USA that two people can lift them and attach them to posts anchored in the ground. The automotive-grade pneumatic harnesses connect with the supply air system—one for each 5 MW. These systems come pre-assembled and can be dropped into place on site.
The pneumatic system has fewer critical points of failure than traditional mechanical systems, dramatically reducing maintenance costs, according to Sunfolding. The AirDrive X actuator uses advanced polymers supplied by DuPont, helping them weather exposure to wind, heat, rain and snow.
Sunfolding’s first product was the T29 tracker, which reportedly changed the tracker landscape with its use of pneumatics, is installed in 39 projects in 12 states including sites in California, Colorado, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Texas.
The TopoTrack, introduced in September 2022, is designed for varied terrain. Like the T29, it uses the AirDrive technology, but has mechanically independent, scaled down tracker rows.

The company reports that TopoTrack’s rows are 10 times shorter than traditional trackers, and that they can provide 20 degrees of variation between trackers, thus improving slope tolerance between the rows and allowing for articulation in terrain, including complete directional change in terrain if needed.
The design uses two posts, two actuators and two purlins. As a result of the tracker’s flexibility and simplicity, Sunfolding says that the tracker’s footprint across a project site can be increased when tracker-to-tracker spacing is reduced. Fuller noted that TopoTrack can reduce the need for grading by an estimated 97%, thus resulting in further cost savings.
Headquartered in Alameda, Calif., Sunfolding’s posts, actuators and purlins are made in the U.S. The company partners with auto industry component suppliers to manufacture the AirDrive, and reports that 90% of its bill of materials are sourced from a 250-mile radius of its manufacturing facility in the Midwest, enabling short lead times and reducing procurement risks.
TopoTrack was recently deployed on a site with strict environmental protections in place.  This site featured complex terrain in a high snow load location. TopoTrack technology reportedly enabled the customer to perform zero grading on this site, greatly minimizing the cost of handling complex terrain and permitting risk.
