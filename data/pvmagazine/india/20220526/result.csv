The project is situated at village Badiseed, and is Acme’s largest single-location project so far. 
The Acme plant in Rajasthan will supply electricity to Maharashtra, with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (MSEDCL) as the offtaker. The electricity supply will be enough to light up over six lakh homes.
 The Acme team was able to bring the capacity online in the shortest available time despite Covid-induced supply chain disruption and rising module prices.
“We faced two consecutive rounds of the Covid-19 pandemic that brought working at the sites to a standstill. It was burdened with disruption in the supply chain and sky-rocketing prices of solar modules and other equipment,” said Sandeep Kashyap, chief operating officer of Acme Solar. “Prices of nearly all components peaked, and freight increased many folds. We could overcome all the challenges …. and commission the project successfully in the shortest available time.”
Acme Solar is currently implementing another 1.75 GW of solar projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/26/solar-tariffs-to-rise-21-over-the-next-12-months/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 26, 2022",Solar tariffs to rise 21% over the next 12 months,"Solar tariffs in India may increase by more than one-fifth over the next year due to surging commodity prices and the introduction of a new duty on imported solar modules, finds a recent report by JMK Research and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
“The price and performance of modules are critical factors in project cost and, accordingly, in developers’ bids in solar auctions,” says report co-author and JMK Research Founder Jyoti Gulia.
Rising module prices due to an increase in key raw material prices and freight charges have led to higher tariffs discovered at solar auctions from early 2021. The lowest winning solar bids between January 2021 and March 2022 have increased by an average of 22%, relative to India’s record-low solar tariff of INR 1.99 ($0.03)/kWh in December 2020.
The report projects that solar tariffs will climb even further following the recent imposition of a 40% basic customs duty (BCD) on imported solar modules and 25% on cells, and the implementation of the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM). 
The report urges central and state government regulators to make a joint effort to address these policy hurdles by clarifying how long BCD will be applicable on imported modules and whether the duty will increase or decrease on a year-on-year basis.
The authors considered three scenarios to arrive at future tariffs when using domestically manufactured and imported modules. In the base case scenario, which assumes duty-free imported modules, the tariff is estimated to be INR 2.43 ($0.0323)/kWh.
With module imports subject to BCD, the tariff would be INR 2.95 ($0.039)/kWh – about 21% higher than the base case tariff. If a developer was able to procure domestic modules, the tariff would be INR 2.26 ($0.030) – about 7% lower than the base case tariff, as per the report.
However, the authors say a substantial chunk of projects that are likely to be commissioned by 2024 will not be able to secure a supply of domestic modules due to the huge demand across segments, including rooftop solar, open access, utility scale as well as the off-grid market.
“In this case, developers will have to import modules that will attract 40% BCD,” says co-author JMK Senior Research Associate Akhil Thayillam.
New technology will partly compensate for higher tariffs, playing a significant role in maximizing plant output, states the report. “For example, a developer opting for imported bifacial modules and a single-axis tracker could achieve a 4% to 5% capacity utilization factor (CUF) gain.”
But Thayillam says a lack of availability of domestically manufactured high-wattage modules and bifacial modules will be a critical challenge for developers.
“Prices of domestic modules are also volatile and may surge significantly in the near-term, chiefly due to demand-supply mismatch, an increase in global polysilicon prices, and 25% BCD on solar cells,” he adds.
To reduce dependency on imported equipment and raw materials, the Indian government, as part of its production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, has allotted an INR 24,000 crore ($3.2 billion) capital subsidy to set up vertically integrated domestic solar manufacturing facilities.
“These facilities are likely to start production by mid-2023 at the earliest. Even for domestic modules, prices until then are likely to see an upward trend,” says co-author JMK Senior Research Associate Prabhakar Sharma.
“To achieve our ambitious renewable energy targets for 2030, we must avoid delays in project commissioning caused by the short-term surge in module prices,” says co-author Vibhuti Garg, IEEFA Energy Economist and Lead India.
“Renewable energy is deflationary, and future solar projects will still have significantly lower tariffs than thermal projects. Accelerating the deployment of renewable energy systems to meet India’s increasing power demand will strengthen the country’s energy security and avoid future power shortage crises.”

Large-scale solar accounted for 86% of Q1 2022 installations, with rooftop PV contributing 14%. Rajasthan topped in installations, accounting for 52% of the overall quarterly addition. It was followed by Gujarat (with 18% share) and Karnataka (6%).
India’s cumulative installed solar capacity now stands at 52 GW. Over 54 GW of utility-scale projects are in the development pipeline, and another 33 GW capacity tendered is awaiting auction.
The report projects 2022 could see an even higher installation than 2021’s record 10 GW plus. The report said the annual installation may, however, get impacted by any delay in resolving the matter of laying of transmission lines for solar energy projects to be developed in the habitats of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB).
To protect the critically endangered bird [GIB], the Supreme Court earlier said that transmission lines running through the priority areas of the GIB need to be either underground or have bird diverters installed. A Committee has been formed to review cases individually and provide feedback to the Apex Court. This process is taking time and will likely affect project development this year.
“The uncertainty around the Great Indian Bustard case in Rajasthan is the only issue standing in the way of 2022 being another record year for solar installations. Everything depends on the Supreme Court ruling and how quickly it is resolved. A little push from the government can help India surpass the 60 GW large-scale solar installation target set for 2022, which will be a great achievement,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.

Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have built a heterojunction solar cell with highly conductive boron-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films. They claim it reduces fill factor losses to a minimum.
“Our cells were conceived for applications in large-scale solar modules,” researcher Wenzhu Liu told pv magazine.
The scientists fabricated the cell with a 244.63 cm2 Czochralski n-c-Si wafer provided by China-based Sichuan Yongxiang Silicon Material Company. They used light soaking to improve the dark conductance of the a-Si:H films, in order to help the diffusion and hopping of weakly bound hydrogen atoms, resulting in efficient boron tetrasilicide (B−Si4) doping.
“The light-soaking devices are made of LED arrays and were developed by Chinese companies at our request,” Liu said.
The scientists have found that boron doping, which stems from weakly bound hydrogen atoms, plays a crucial part in the formation of metastable hydrogen configurations in the a-Si:H films. Under standard illumination conditions, the solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.18%, an open-circuit voltage of 749 mV, and a fill factor of 85.42%, which the scientists described as the highest values among two-side contacted silicon solar cells.
An encapsulated device was also able to retain 98.70% and 97.59% of the fill factor and efficiency, respectively, after 1,000 hours. The scientists claimed that this demonstrates high stability against extreme climate degradation factors.
The scientists described the process in “Light-induced activation of boron doping in hydrogenated amorphous silicon for over 25% efficiency silicon solar cells,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. “We participated in their design and now both the cells and the light-soaking devices will be available in the market,” said Liu.
