The plant is spread over a 200-acre area in the Kheragarh District of Agra in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh. It was built with an investment of INR 250 crore.
The solar plant benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) signed with Uttar Pradesh Power Transmission Corporation Limited (UPPTCL) in February 2019. The power procured by UPPTCL will be further supplied to various districts and villages. 
The plant is expected to supply 1,05,100 MWh of electricity to the grid annually. 
Announcing the commissioning, Atul Gupta, head-Solar IPP, Jakson Group, said, “With this plant, the Jakson Group will be offsetting 85,000 tonnes of carbon emissions annually, which is equivalent to planting 550,000 trees.” 
The plant uses mono PERC modules and string inverters. A dry cleaning module using robots has been deployed instead of wet cleaning, eventually saving up to 80% water. Drones used for thermal screening to detect any damage during the execution of the plant would continue to be deployed.
Jakson Group is also currently developing Assam’s first large-scale solar PV plant of 70 MW in Anguri Solar Park. This project is expected to become operational by the end of the year.
Jakson’s total portfolio stands at more than 200 MW (including the 50 MW plant in Uttar Pradesh and 70 MW in Assam) and is expected to grow to 1 GW by 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/07/tata-power-installs-dc-fast-charger-near-statue-of-unity-in-gujarat/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV CHARGERS,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 7, 2021",Tata Power installs DC fast charger near Statue of Unity in Gujarat,"In a release issued today, Tata Power announced it had installed a DC fast electric vehicle (EV) charger at Kevadia—a famous tourist location in Gujarat housing the world’s tallest statue, the Statue of Unity. The charging point is located near the Kevadia railway station.
EV users can access the charging station Tata Power EZ Charge app. The app offers a seamless user interface, making it convenient for EV owners to locate, navigate, book, charge, pay, and check the availability of the nearest e-charging stations in real time.
On World Environment Day, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi had recently declared Kevadia would become the country’s first electric vehicle city with only electric buses, cars, and two-wheelers on roads. Tata Power’s initiative is in sync with the Government’s move to create the country’s first ‘only electric vehicle city’ at Kevadia.
“Visitors coming to the Statue of Unity can now travel in their EVs without the anxiety of charging their vehicles…Tourists coming from Surat, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, and other cities can now make the journey in their electric cars without worry. We are committed to installing EV charging points at important highway locations and similar tourist destinations,” said Sandeep Bangia, head–EV Charging, Home Automation and ESCO, Tata Power.
Tata Power is the only Indian Power utility that owns an expansive network of over 4,000 home chargers and over 500 public chargers in 102 cities across India. The company is present across all segments of the EV eco-system—public charging, captive charging, home and workplace charging, and ultra-rapid chargers up to 240kW for buses.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/07/all-solar-cell-efficiencies-at-a-glance/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 7, 2021",All solar cell efficiencies at a glance,"From pv magazine International
The international research group led by Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales in Australia has published Version 58 of Solar cell efficiency tables in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“In Version 58, we report 10 new results largely since January 2021,” Green told pv magazine. “Those of most interest will likely be the 4 new perovskite cell, minimodule and tandem cell results, although new efficiencies for more commercially relevant silicon heterojunction and TOPCon cells are also reported.”
Since 1993 when the Tables were started, the research group saw major improvements in all cell categories. “Copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) and multijunction cells have seen the most consistent gains, although perovskites have recently seen similar overall gains compressed into a shorter timescale,” Greener specified.
He also explained that the most important criterion for inclusion in the tables is that the results be independently measured at a test center on the group’s list. “As well as efficiency, we now publish the cell’s current-voltage and spectral response curve and sometimes include cryptic comments on measurement procedure or general comments on likely cell stability,” he emphasized. “The industry has shown that improved efficiency is the key to lower cost, stressing its fundamental importance, although stability is also a key factor as well as, for mass deployment, abundance and non-toxicity of the cell’s constituent materials.”
According to the scientist, the more mature cell materials, such as silicon and gallium arsenide (GaAs) are close to demonstrating their full potential, although still plenty of scope for improvement by combining with other materials in multijunction cells. “Organic solar cells have seen a recent burst in performance that I think will take them to over 20% efficiency while other earth-abundant, non-toxic cells such as those based on kesterite (CZTS) still have massive scope for improvement,” he added.
Referring to the importance of independent third-party certification of the achieved efficiencies, Green said that history has shown, on multiple occasions, that it is unwise to trust cell results based on “in-house” measurements. “All of our recognized test centers are carefully vetted prior to inclusion on our list and have been involved in round-robin testing with one another, ensuring consistency of measurements to well within the uncertainty estimates included with the published results,” the professor stated.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE), Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), and the US Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/07/ieefa-warns-the-financial-risk-for-new-coal-under-estimated/,"COAL-FIRED POWER,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 7, 2021",IEEFA warns the financial risk for new coal under-estimated,"India’s proposed and under-construction coal-fired power projects carry a massive stranded asset risk, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). 
The report highlights that the financial risk for new coal-fired power projects is under-estimated. It stresses on evaluating the financial viability of these projects based on the right estimation of utilization factors.
Currently, India has 33 GW of coal-fired power plants under construction and another 29 GW of proposed projects under various stages of regulatory approval.
The IEEFA report said coal-fired power plants may look like low-cost projects and worthwhile ventures to potential investors as their levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is being underestimated. 
The LCOE of coal-fired power plants is calculated by assuming a constant rather than a declining or variable capacity factor over the plant’s lifetime. In other words, it is assumed the plants will be able to successfully produce the same quantity of electricity every year throughout their lifetime. In fact, this constancy rarely occurs.
Kashish Shah, the author of the report and energy finance analyst at IEEFA, said the LCOE is the required tariff at which the net present value of the investment is zero. 
“In other words, LCOE is the minimum required average tariff for a power asset to reach a breakeven return at the end of its life. Anything less than that suggests the asset is unviable.”
For most coal plants in India, the LCOE is calculated by assuming a utilization factor of 85-90% throughout the project life. However, the LCOE turns out to be 64% higher with India’s average capacity utilization factor sitting at ~55% for the last few years.
Shah found that the average utilization rate of India’s coal-fired fleet has collapsed to a financially unsustainable low of 53% in financial year (FY) 2020/21 from a high of 78% a decade ago in FY2011/12. 
“The aspiration for further builds of coal capacity stems from the notion that coal is still ‘cheap’,” said Shah. “However, with tariffs now below INR 2/kWh (US$27/MWh), solar power is cheaper than even the variable cost of coal-fired power and is ready to absorb incremental daytime demand.”
“With zero fuel costs, the marginal cost of generation for renewables is practically zero,” said Shah. “On the other hand, with increasing inflation in Indian domestic coal prices and railway transportation costs for coal, the gap between cost competitiveness of renewables versus coal is widening. 
“This raises a serious concern about the viability of coal-fired power plants. Debt servicing for underutilized coal-fired power assets becomes extremely difficult and creates a liquidity crunch in the whole value chain. The financial stress then spills over to the power distribution sector as well as affecting India’s financial lending institutions. This further inhibits growth in other important segments of the power industry such as renewables and transmission infrastructure, which are extremely critical for India’s electricity sector transition.”
