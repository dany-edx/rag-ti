The US solar industry installed 6.1 GW of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, according to the US Solar Market Insight Q2 2023 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.
Several factors contributed to the record first quarter, not the least of which was the surge in demand triggered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. But in addition to the surge, projects are beginning to move forward after being delayed due to supply chain challenges that began during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts that the solar market will triple in size over the next five years, amounting to a total installed solar capacity of 378 GW by 2028.
A key component to the IRA is the domestic content adder. In May, the US Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released guidance that provides detailed information about the domestic content bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act. Solar power projects that use domestic content are eligible for the full 30% tax credit can increase their tax credit by an additional 10%, to 40% in total, and 0.3 ¢/kWh for projects that use the Production Tax Credit.
In addition to the tax credits for clean energy developers, the IRA provides incentives for the build out of US manufacturing, and it has effectively stimulated a number of companies to announce the intent to set up domestic manufacturing facilities. The SEIA/Wood Mackenzie report expects that, as a result of the surge in announced manufacturing facilities, domestic module capacity will rise from fewer than 9 GW today to more than 60 GW by 2026. At least 16 GW of module manufacturing facilities are under construction as of the end of first quarter of 2023.
In addition to the domestic content adder, the IRA specifies adders for energy communities and low-income community projects, intending to drive investments in underserved communities.
“As the Inflation Reduction Act begins to flex its muscle and drive demand, the U.S. solar and storage industry is eagerly awaiting further guidance on some of the most impactful pieces of the law,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, the president and CEO of SEIA. “Timely, specific, and workable implementation guidance from the administration will have a major impact on our success in both the near and long-term. This guidance is powerful, and if done correctly, it could unlock new market potential across the country.”

Researchers at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology have conducted a techno-economic analysis to assess their country’s potential for floating solar development based on a selection of water bodies.
“The approach for FPV plant assessment is utilized on seven artificial lakes across different regions of Bangladesh,” the scientists stated, noting that the proposed methodology can reportedly be generalized and can be applied to any potential floating PV plant evaluation. “Each plant’s viability is extensively assessed in terms of power generation, economic impact, and contribution to the national grid.”
The proposed approach works through the following six steps: 1) Selection of water bodies; 2) Selection of PV panels; 3) Calculation of generated power; 4) Plant design; 5) Economic Analysis; 6) Comparison with ground-mounted PV plants.
The team also specified it took a “conservative approach” as it considered 15% of the total lake area for the floating PV installation. “However, study was also conducted for 20% and 25% of the total area keeping future expansion of the plant in mind,” it added.
In their analysis, the academics considered three water surfaces in the area of the country’s capital Dhaka – the Dhanmondi Lake, the Hatirjheel Lake, and the Gulshan Lake. “These are the only man-made water bodies in the capital,” they specified.
They also took into account the Joydia Baor, Bukhbhara Haor, and Barapukuria Lakes located outside Dhaka and said these lakes were recommended by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as potential sites for floating solar.
They used PVGIS-SARAH, a global solar irradiation database, to determine the installed capacity, the required surface, and the panel efficiency of a floating project. They found that, among the three lakes in Dhaka, Hatirjheel Lake has the potential to generate the highest amount of electricity at 19.3 MW and Dhanmondi Lake has the least at 5.1 MW, while the Gulshan Lake may achieve 17.1 MW.
As for the other lakes, they found that the Joydia Baor may deploy a floating PV capacity of 34.30 MW, with Bukhbhara Haor and Barapukuria Lakes reaching 34.07 MW and 17.43 MW, respectively.
“The findings indicate that the proposed plants in Dhaka could meet 1.1% of the city’s entire demand, and that those in Kaptai Lake could satisfy 7% of Chattogram, the country’s port city,” the scientists emphasized. “In terms of the economic evaluation (LCOE, NPV, and IRR), each of the proposed plants demonstrates project viability following implementation.”
The academics also said that the simulated floating PV plants showed superior generating capabilities compared with ground-mounted PV plants. The latter are said to have the potential to generate 4.0 kWh/m2 to 6.5 kWh/m2 on a daily basis, while floating PV plants may achieve up to 8.3 kWh/m2. “Although the proposed FPV plants initially cost more than inland PV plants, the projected plants have superior generating capabilities and profitability than the inland counterparts,” they concluded.
Furthermore, the researchers found that the levelized cost of energy of floating solar plants located in the seven analyzed lakes may range from $0.0341/kWh (Gulshan) to $0.0486/kWh (Dhanmondi).
Their findings were presented in the study “Techno-economic assessment of power generation potential from floating solar photovoltaic systems in Bangladesh,” published in Heliyon.

It has invited bids from consultants to undertake a study to evaluate the feasibility of developing floating solar PV plants on reservoirs of different States and UTs. 
A study by sustainability think tank The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has calculated that around 18,000 sq. km of water bodies in India can generate 280 GW of power through floating solar PVs.
The report calculated the floating solar potential based on 30% of the water surface area of the country’s medium and large reservoirs.
According to the report, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh are the top three states in terms of potential for installations of floating solar PV.
The greatest potential lies in Maharashtra, where 57,891 MW of electricity can be generated from floating solar over 3,173 sq. km of water surface area in reservoirs.
Driving the floating solar market in India, NTPC has already developed a 100 MW floating solar PV power project on the reservoir of its Ramagundam Thermal Power Station in Telangana. The project is developed under the government’s flexibilization scheme. If commercially viable, the cheaper power from the solar plant shall replace the thermal power being generated by the Ramagundam thermal power station.
NTPC has also set up a 92 MW floating solar power project at its Rajiv Gandhi Gas-based Power Station in Kayamkulam, Kerala, and a 25 MW floating PV plant on the raw water reservoir of Simhadri thermal station in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.

A group of Belgian companies and research entities is currently trying to reuse silicon from end-of-life solar panels for the production of composite silicon carbon anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.
The Resiliex project, funded by the European Union, aims to demonstrate eight innovative technological solutions for carbon-free silicon production. Two research groups, including scientists from the University of Liege, are involved. One team, Greenmat, focuses on recycling silicon from solar modules for lithium-ion batteries. The second team, known as Gemme, develops technologies to recover silicon and silver from end-of-life panels.
The Si/C powders derived from recycled silicon have the potential to enhance the performance and charging capacity of high-energy batteries, enabling electric vehicles to travel longer distances on a single charge. The researchers also highlight the batteries’ suitability for stationary energy storage.
In addition to Recma Group and the Comet Group, which participate in the project, Ghent University researchers assess the environmental impact of new silicon solutions and explore recycling methods to reduce the environmental impact of mining and manufacturing.
The Resilex project, launched in 2022 with funding from HorizonEurope, includes the European PV association SolarPower Europe.
