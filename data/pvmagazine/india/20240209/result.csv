China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon prices in the country, was assessed at CNY60.67 ($8.52)/kg, up CNY0.67/kg from the previous week amid a pick-up in buying sentiment ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday – the first price increase in the solar value chain’s raw material this year.
February and some March delivery cargoes have been restocked in the past few weeks. Most market participants are expecting little market activity for the rest of February, with the Chinese market remaining shut amid the festivities.

Polysilicon supply has been increasing month-on-month, and the new capacities expected to come online in March will add to supply pressures in the Chinese market, a market participant said. These include Hoshine Silicon’s 100,000 MT Phase 1 polysilicon plant and Xinyi Glass’ 100,000 MT polysilicon plant, the market participant added.
N-type polysilicon prices gained for a third consecutive week, averaging at CNY71.9/kg, up CNY1/kg week-on-week, according to data from the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
N-type polysilicon prices have risen recently due to supply shortages as n-type polysilicon inventories were insufficient to meet demand from the n-type wafer segment, a market veteran said. P-type polysilicon prices have also gained, on denser and better-quality p-type polysilicon being able to be used in n-type production, the veteran added.
January polysilicon production is expected to reach 170,000 MT, according to data from the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/09/climate-change-mitigation-embracing-transparency-speed-and-zero-cost/,"CLIMATE CHANGE,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",,2024-02-09,"Climate change mitigation: Embracing transparency, speed, and zero cost ","Climate change presents one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Its impacts span rising temperatures, extreme weather events, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more. Mitigating climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The climate change mitigation industry plays a pivotal role in driving solutions. However, the traditional standards of opacity, slow pace, and high costs have hindered progress. By embracing transparency, speed, and zero-cost measures, forward-thinking initiatives aim to accelerate climate action worldwide. 
Transparency refers to clear, consistent, and open communication regarding climate initiatives’ planning, funding, implementation, and evaluation. Lack of transparency has often impeded climate progress. The 2009 Climategate controversy highlighted this issue. Leaked emails revealed scientists discussing ways to avoid disclosing raw temperature data, arousing suspicions around the integrity of climate research. 
More recently, carbon offsetting schemes have faced scrutiny over unclear methodologies and exaggerated claims. In 2022, a Carbon Plan analysis found that just 2% of company offset claims adequately demonstrated reduced emissions. Without transparency on offsets’ integrity, firms may mislead consumers while enabling continued fossil fuel use. Embracing honesty is essential to build public trust and policy support. 
The rapid pace of current climate breakdown necessitates equally rapid mitigation action. The IPCC report indicated that capping warming to 1.5°C requires halving emissions by 2030. This represents an unprecedented reduction rate of 7.6% annually this decade. Each year of delay exponentially increases mitigation efforts required later. 
Innovators are rising to accelerate climate solutions’ deployment. For example, startups such as Chooose enable consumers to instantly offset their carbon footprint from everyday online purchases. Such frictionless, micro-offsetting Gateways can engage vast pools of finance. Circular economy leaders like Desso are also accelerating change through their climate-positive carpets rolled out in under 36 hours. Embracing such swift and scalable approaches is vital to increasing mitigation velocities. 
Mitigating climate change can appear prohibitively expensive, especially for lower-income groups. However, many effective initiatives need not incur financial costs. Behaviour change campaigns that encourage no- or low-cost actions offer much promise.  
Transforming social norms around lower carbon transport and travel choices carries little individual financial burden while yielding a significant collective impact. Cycling infrastructure could also facilitate modal shifts to zero-direct-cost mobility. Transition Zero highlights such win-wins, where climate-positive choices enhance well-being, connection, and finances. Making concerted efforts to evaluate and promote zero-cost climate options can increase adoption and political buy-in. 
Emerging technologies are enabling transparency, speed, and affordability across climate mitigation. Blockchain platforms like Poseidon impart radical transparency regarding carbon credits’ origins and impacts, resolving offset greenwashing issues. Automation also assists rapid and accurate emissions monitoring, while AI streamlines data analysis for quicker mitigation insights. 
Advances like solar paints and 3D-printed houses promise faster, cheaper clean energy infrastructure deployment. precision fermentation can swiftly develop affordable, low-carbon protein alternatives to reshape diet-related emissions. technologies even target atmospheric carbon removal, from mineralisation to direct air capture. By continuing to invest in innovation, humanity can attain rapid, widespread mitigation at scale. 
Delivering efficient, ethical climate solutions requires unprecedented global cooperation. Collaborative initiatives can combine resources, knowledge, and financing across borders to achieve more than any nation alone. The LEAF Coalition thus mobilises funding from governments and the private sector to conserve tropical forests, a natural carbon sink. 
International climate activism movements also illustrate the power of collective pressure in demanding systemic change. Denmark became the first country to halt North Sea oil and gas exploration, citing public calls for faster decarbonisation. Such multifaceted partnerships across the governmental, private, and civil spheres are instrumental in redefining climate action’s scope and scale. 
Adopting transparency, urgency, and zero-cost strategies faces obstacles, from vested fossil fuel interests to behavioural inertia. However, solutions exist to overcome these barriers. Strong environmental regulations, carbon pricing mechanisms, and renewable energy subsidies can help phase out carbon-intensive systems despite resistance. Behaviour change models based on nudging and social feedback loops also show promise in normalising lower carbon choices. 
Critics may argue transparency increases reputational risks and time-to-implementation, while rapid transitions threaten economic stability. Yet transparency enables accountability to accelerate progress, and urgent action is indispensable to preserve stability amidst climate breakdown. Fair, inclusive policy frameworks can also ensure socially just rapid decarbonisation. With ethical governance, redefining climate mitigation standards promises a cleaner, brighter future. 
The climate change battle is intensifying, but so too are mitigation efforts. Rapid scaling of technologies like solar, wind and electric vehicles will accelerate decarbonisation. Innovative market mechanisms can also unlock mass finance flows into climate solutions ranging from regenerative agriculture to atmospheric carbon removal. 
Business and finance leaders are also increasingly aligning operations with 1.5°C pathways through science-based target setting. Transparent performance tracking using standardised metrics will norm. Carbon labelling schemes may also gain traction to nudge consumer choices. Behaviour shift programs focused on health and community co-benefits rather than guilt can make sustainable living irresistible. 
These multiplying climate solutions promise a decarbonised future. While the road ahead remains challenging, embracing transparency, urgency and innovation smooths progress. With ethical, cooperative leadership, humanity can redefine what climate action looks like to protect all people and ecosystems from the climate emergency. 
Climate change mitigation demands a transparent, swift and affordable transformation across all sectors globally. Technological and collaborative breakthroughs are expanding capacities to monitor, understand and reduce emissions rapidly and accountably. However, realising sustainability demands looking beyond narrow national and corporate self-interests towards collective welfare. 
By being honest, acting urgently and enabling cost-free climate progress, society can redefine the standards for success. Embracing and scaling transparent, speedy and zero-cost solutions will allow climate prosperity to prevail worldwide. The time has come to be the change our warming planet needs.

8,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/09/the-solar-rebound-effect-in-residential-pv/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,2024-02-09,The solar rebound effect in residential PV,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from Australia and Vietnam have analyzed the short and long-term dynamics of the so-called solar energy rebound effect.
The rebound effect consists of a reduction in expected gains from a more resource-efficient technology as a result of behavioral or systemic change. As for residential solar, this effect equals the change in a household’s electricity consumption resulting from PV power generation.
“The issue occurs in almost every country, no matter whether it is developed or developing. The issue we found in Vietnam, of which customers abandoned solar systems, is a new finding. However, we believe this could also happen in any country where the policy supporting solar power is not fully and scientifically explained, and where consumers are not comprehensively consulted,” the research’s corresponding author, Luan Nguyen, told pv magazine. 
The research group used a panel dataset encompassing approximately 3500 households in Hanoi, Vietnam, and obtained two datasets on the household and district level, respectively, covering the period 2015-2021. The panel dataset contains detailed monthly information on electricity demand and bills, solar system capacity, production, and installation time. About 48% of the households had PV, and the rest used electricity solely from the grid.
“If households that adopt solar panels also substantially change their energy consumption patterns, it is possible that the overall carbon emissions associated with energy use may be relatively unchanged. This phenomenon is known as a ‘rebound effect,’ where increased supply fails to induce substitution between solar and grid energy,” the scientists explained. “Notably, all homes in the dataset did not possess solar batteries, but none fed solar energy into the national grid. It means all solar owners either consumed all solar production or wasted it.”
To estimate the effects of PV installations on consumption, the researchers used the difference-in-differences identification strategy, which is a statistical method used to calculate the causal impact of an intervention by comparing it to a group that did not receive the same treatment.
“Leveraging a substantial, distinctive, and up-to-date panel dataset, we unveil a substantial rebound effect that challenges the presumed environmental advantages of residential solar energy,” the researchers highlighted. “We are also (to our knowledge), among the first authors to study the dynamics of this process and show that both the primary effect and the rebound effect tend to diminish over time.”
Based on their data, the academics extracted four estimation outputs: two for households’ total electricity consumption and two for demand from the grid. “The only differences between models in each pair are the inclusion or exclusion of exogenous variables, and those differences are to test the consistency of the estimations,” they explained. Exogenous variables included electricity demand, price, income, and other social parameters.
The academics found that, when including exogenous variables, solar installations immediately increased the total electricity demand by approximately 16.3% compared to non-solar households. However, it diminished to about 3.5% after 13 months. Also, the consumption from the grid fell by 3.6% after installation, fading out to about 1.5% at the end of the period.
“Since households that install solar panels may possess unobserved characteristics that distinguish them from households that did not, there is the potential for our results to be affected by unobserved confounding,” they stressed. “However, across a range of diagnostic methods, we find little evidence that endogeneity or misspecification issues may be biasing our results.”
The research group comprised scientists from Australia’s Griffith University, the University of Adelaide, and Vietnam’s Hanoi Power Corporation. Their findings were introduced in the paper “Solar rebound effects: Short and long term dynamics,” published on Renewable Energy.
