The digital transformation in the energy sector, for the past few years, has picked up pace to address issues like safety, productivity, accessibility and sustainability in the renewable sector. The digital RE is also proving to be the stepping stone to facilitate a peer-to-peer connection in the market.
In digital RE, to engage all the market players with each other, the concept of blockchain is being thought to be incorporated. The energy sector decision-makers and utility companies have asserted that blockchain technology could be a boon in the Renewable energy sector.
To understand the positive impact of blockchain technology in the RE sector, let’s first get into the basic understanding of the blockchain concept.
Blockchain is the shared and distributed data structure or ledger in digital transactions. These are the blocks of algorithms containing data of transactions having each block tied up with each other via a special function called a hash function (function of connecting data structure blocks) which is shared in an encrypted format. The data is accessible to each ledger holder involved in the transaction. The activity is done among the ledger (data structure) holders in the chain.
Each entity is liable to edit the data present in the ledger as per the blockchain prescribed standard. The computers involved in the calculations to create data of the transaction, perform separately in the network. So, it paves the way for the transactions to be exercised flexibly. Now to bring the emerging technology into implementation in the Indian market, strict commitment to serve the most volatile renewable sector most efficiently is needed.
The utility of blockchain could be brought in various business operations and processes like billing (to facilitate the concept of pay-as-you-go in energy transaction in the market), sales and marketing (to boost up the practices knowing the energy prosumer profile), smart grid application and data transfer (to maintain the data transfer most transparently), trading and markets (to increase the credibility of the energy certificate trading), automation, grid management, security and identity management, sharing of resources, competition and transparency.
The wholesale energy market has many incongruities. When transactions occur between two parties in the market, several arbitrators are involved to come to the final settlement. The deal between the parties has to go through a verification process in which the third party has to be involved. Unless and until the final settlement is reached, the process gets entangled in the verification circle.
Blockchain helps expedite the transaction between the two parties and final settlement is reached most probably. The imbalance in the settlements is alleviated by blockchain.
The present system of the energy sector is centralized due to which the prosumer’s and consumers’ direct connection is yet to be formed. It’s due to persisting challenges like transaction efficiency, security and data transparency in the Indian energy market.
The blockchain is a data-driven technology that helps create a very transparent process in data sharing among the peers involved in the system and sort out the challenges persisting in the energy market.
Due to the restricted exposure of nascent players in the Indian energy market, the consumer has to rely on a few available options. To make the RE sector customer-driven, the most robust system like blockchain is required to streamline the process in the energy sector. As far as the Indian scenario is concerned, a deep understanding of the conventional system is a prerequisite to bringing blockchain into the executable stage.
Though there are challenges in blockchain technology like power consumption and heavy hardware requirements, in the coming future, the technology is expected to pick up the market reliably. With the extensive research work being undergone in blockchain technology, recently few developed countries have started incorporating it in their renewable energy market. There would be an opportunity in India to adopt the blockchain and grow building up a peer-to-peer connected market in the most effective way.

Following the acquisition of sodium-ion battery provider Faradion, Reliance Industries, through its arm Reliance New Energy Limited (Reliance), has now signed the agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Netherlands-headquartered LFP battery specialist Lithium Werks for US$ 61 million. The investment also provides funding for future growth.
The Lithium Werks assets being acquired by Reliance include its entire patent portfolio, manufacturing facility in China, key business contracts, and hiring of existing employees as a going concern. 
Reliance’s choice of LFP battery technology is in line with the global trend towards cobalt-free cathode chemistries as cobalt availability and price volatility pose a challenge for manufacturing metal-oxide chemistry-based batteries like NMC and LCO. About 60% of the world’s cobalt supply is believed to come from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Further, cobalt mining has been linked to human rights abuses, corruption, environmental destruction, and child labor.
Speaking about Lithium Werks acquisition, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries Limited, said, “LFP is fast gaining as one of the leading cell chemistries due to its cobalt and nickel free batteries, low cost, and longer life compared to NMC and other chemistries. Lithium Werks is one of the leading LFP cell manufacturing companies globally and has a vast patent portfolio and a management team that brings tremendous experience of innovation across the LFP value chain. We are looking forward to working with the Lithium Werks team and are excited about the pace at which we are progressing towards establishing an end-to-end battery manufacturing and supply ecosystem for India markets.”
“Along with Faradion, Lithium Werks will enable us to accelerate our vision of establishing India at the core of developments in global battery chemistries and help us provide a secure, safe, and high-performance supply chain to the large and growing Indian EV and Energy Storage markets.” 
The transaction is expected to complete by June 2022. 
Founded in 2017, Lithium Werks designs, engineers and manufactures cobalt-free and high-performance LFP batteries ranging from cells to custom battery modules for industrial, medical, marine, energy storage, commercial transportation, and other highly demanding applications. 
The battery specialist has operations in the US, Europe, and China (two wholly-owned manufacturing plants in Changzhou and Suzhou, China). It has 219 patents related to the LFP process and technology, an exciting product development pipeline, and an integrated cell manufacturing capability. Its patented Nanophosphate cathode powder (developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) delivers high power, safety, and cycle life performance and is more ESG friendly than competing technologies.
The acquisition of Lithium Werks and Faradion Limited further strengthens Reliance’s technology portfolio for large-scale manufacture of key supply chain materials (like cathode, anode, electrolyte) as well as cells—giving Reliance the flexibility to produce batteries and battery module systems consisting of different chemistries for various applications across energy storage and mobility.
The management of Lithium Werks brings 30+ years of battery expertise and nearly 200 MWh annual production capacity, including coating, cell, and custom module manufacturing capability.
Joe Fisher, Co-Founder and CEO of Lithium Werks, said, “We are pleased to become a part of the Reliance New Energy initiative. This deal means increased resources and expanded global reach while leveraging our experienced team and IP portfolio and providing scale and momentum to help drive our product innovation, capacity expansion and accelerate our clean energy strategy”.
Christian P Ringvold, Co-Founder of Lithium Werks, added, “Reliance is committed to sustainable development and understands the importance of batteries in the transition to a fossil-free future. The company’s strong values, solid track record, and high ambitions make me confident that this is the right way forward for Lithium Werks.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/15/paving-the-way-for-green-hydrogen-certification/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 15, 2022",Paving the way for green hydrogen certification,"From pv magazine Global
The decarbonising end-use sectors working group at the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has provided a set of key recommendations for the creation of green hydrogen certificates and standards.
In the document “Decarbonising End-use Sectors: Green Hydrogen Certification,” the group of experts stressed the importance of relying on independent third parties for the verification of all data on the green hydrogen tracking systems, as well as on objective and public disclosure standards.
Two main models were identified for the future certification scheme: a “book and claim” system that is mostly applied to renewable electricity, in which the claim on consuming renewable energy booked by an energy provider is separate from the physical flow; and a “mass balancing” system that is commonly utilized for biofuels, in which a physical link between the production and consumption of green energy must always be proved.
“By granting consumers fully reliable information on the hydrogen supplied to them, such a tracking system can incentivize companies to commit to using green hydrogen, create social interest, and promote consumer information, and therefore have the potential to accelerate the clean energy transition,” the report reads. “The standardization of these certificates can also allow and support the development of green hydrogen trading and accelerate the emergence and establishment of an international market.”
The document also highlighted the difficulty of implementing common regulations on a global scale and the possibility that several communication issues may arise between the systems of different countries. “Transparency issues may come up if information on the production process and transport, particularly relating to links with non-renewables, is not clearly traced, documented, and stated,” the IRENA experts noted.
Four main requirements were outlined for the certification of hydrogen produced by renewable energy sources: A temporal correlation ensuring that the electricity used for the electrolysis is renewable; a geographical correlation, requiring some degree of physical link, for the hydrogen production; avoiding higher shares of fossil-generated electricity elsewhere in the electricity system; and specifications providing full transparency and information on the resources used.
Furthermore, carbon emissions should be considered for each kilogram of green hydrogen along the entire value chain, from production to transport. “Nevertheless, a degree of flexibility in regard to the geographical, temporal and additionality requirements should be taken into account in the short term to ensure that the nascent green hydrogen market can develop,” the document notes.
