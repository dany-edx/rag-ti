The company will set up 2 GW of panel production capacity in North India, the first phase of which will be a 500 MW fully automated module line with equipment sourced from Spain’s Mondragon Assembly.
BVG will produce PV modules through its solar division BVG Clean Energy, which provides customized turnkey solutions for all customer segments including residential, commercial and industrial, and utility-scale.
The company expects the 500 MW module line to become operational by September 2023. The facility will produce modules based on M10, half-cut cells and will be designed to produce more than 2,000 modules per day.
“This line will be fully upgradable to next-generation modules and cell sizes between M3 to M12 and up to 15BB, and has the option of producing glass-glass and/or glass-back sheet modules,” said Pankaj Dhingra, CEO, BVG Clean Energy.

L&T IDPL executes power transmission and road development projects under public-private-partnership (PPP) model. It is a joint venture between L&T and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) holding 51% and 49% shares, respectively.
L&T will divest its 51% stake in L&T IDPL to a portfolio company of Infrastructure Yield Plus II, an infrastructure fund managed by Edelweiss Alternatives.
“This is in line with L&T’s strategy of reducing its exposure to the non-core asset heavy developmental projects portfolio,” stated L&T.
Edelweiss Alternatives invests in operating infrastructure assets in core sectors of power transmission, renewable energy and highways among others. Post this acquisition, the platform will have a diversified portfolio of 26 assets across 13 states.
“Gross proceeds to L&T and CPP investments from the sale would be approximately INR 27,234 million before closing adjustments and other terms of the transaction,” stated L&T.

Meyer Burger, a Switzerland-based heterojunction solar module manufacturer, has signed a multi-year cooperation agreement to develop tandem perovskite solar cell technology with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) in Switzerland. Its other partners include Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB), the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE), and the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
“With a long tradition of proprietary development, Meyer Burger has an extensive portfolio of processes, technologies, and production techniques at its disposal for the potential mass production of tandem solar cells and modules in-house,” said Marcel König, head of R&D at Meyer Burger. “This includes the essential manufacturing processes and machinery for silicon-based perovskite tandem solar cells, as well as corresponding solar modules with Meyer Burger’s proprietary SmartWire connection technology. In conjunction with the skills of our academic partners, this is a unique recipe for success.”
The partnership is a new attempt to produce tandem perovskite cells, as Oxford PV terminated its cooperation with Meyer Burger in mid-2021, as the photovoltaic manufacturer still wants to use these proprietary technology solutions. The company said that it has already achieved a record efficiency of 29.6% for a 25-square-centimeter perovskite tandem solar cell with CSEM.
“This excellent result shows the potential of silicon perovskite tandem cells to achieve high efficiencies,” said Professor Christophe Ballif, the director of sustainable energy at CSEM. “Even if there is still a lot of work ahead of us, the industrialization of solar cells with an efficiency of over 30% is on the right track.”
The HZB has also been researching perovskite technology for a long time and has already achieved efficiencies of more than 31% when combined with heterojunction cells in the laboratory. These results will now be transferred to mass production with Meyer Burger and other partners.
“By manufacturing in Europe, Meyer Burger creates high-quality jobs while making use of technologies developed in Europe,” said Professor Rutger Schlatmann, director of the Competence Center Photovoltaics Berlin PVcomB at HZB.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/19/cooling-down-photovoltaic-panels-with-concrete/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 19, 2022",Cooling down photovoltaic panels with concrete,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Politecnico di Torino in Italy have designed a cooling system for photovoltaic panels that uses radiative coolers based on cementitious materials. These coolers are often used for thermal management in buildings and have strong potential due to the low costs of the concrete materials they are made with.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
“Our work was intended at determining the thermodynamic limit of the radiative coolers,” researcher Matteo Cagnoni told pv magazine. “In order to establish this limit, we considered the various terms of energy exchange between the solar cell, the cement-based cooler, the atmosphere, and the sun, which enables us to determine the maximum temperature reduction induced by the thermal coupling between the cell and the concrete substrate.”
The experimental simulated system consists of a stack made by a reflector, a cement-based radiative cooler, and a bifacial solar cell.
“This structure could be realized, for example, by building a thin film solar cell onto a cement-based substrate by sputtering, evaporation or solution deposition techniques,” the scientists explained, noting that the solar cell and the radiative cooler are thermally coupled and mutually transparent.
The academics found that the cooling technique could reduce the operating temperature of silicon-based solar cells by up to 20 kelvin (K), which could eventually result in efficiency improvements of about 9% and an increase in module lifetime of around 400%.
“We expect this solution to be very attractive for the market, especially if one considers building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV),” Cagnoni said. “For example, one could try to implement the theoretical system as a solar cell coupled to a roof tile. The cost of this solution may be only slightly higher than the cost of the photovoltaic panel itself, as cementitious materials are very cheap, highly scalable and robust.”
He said the additional complexity of the system involves the fabrication of the solar cell on a cement-based substrate by thin-film methods, or by thermally coupling a bulk solar cell with a cement-based slab. This additional cost is expected to be largely compensated by the gains in solar cell efficiency and system lifetime that a reduced operating temperature would induce.
“For example, a 20 C temperature reduction could lead to efficiency gains up to 9% in silicon solar cells, and up to a four-fold lifetime extension,” Cagnoni stated. “Of course, these are theoretical upper limits, but they suggest that significant gains are achievable also in the real physical devices.”
The Italian group described the new cooling technique in “Cementitious materials as promising radiative coolers for solar cells,” which was recently published in iScience.
“These works can provide a starting point for the practical implementation of our attractive concept and pave the way toward more efficient photovoltaic systems,” the group concluded.
