Ltd (BPCL) plans to build 240 MW of solar and wind farms with an investment of INR 1,600 crore ($195 million) this fiscal, Sukhmal Jain, Director (Marketing) at BPCL, told the daily newspaper The Economic Times. It will develop this capacity across three states, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh. 
Bharat Petroleum eyes net-zero for its refinery operations and the power it consumes by 2040, under Scope 1 and 2, respectively. To meet its climate commitments, it plans to build a renewable energy capacity of 1 GW by 2025 and 10 GW by 2040. 
The company said it will initially build RE projects to meet the power requirement for its refineries, which is around 350 MW. Going forward, it plans to participate in RE tenders. Construction of around 50 MW of solar plants is already underway at BPCL facilities.

The bidders selected by HPPC shall set up solar power projects in Haryana. The selection of solar projects for a total capacity of 500 MW with up to a maximum of 10 MW from a single bidder will be carried out through e-bidding followed by an e-reverse auction. HPPC shall enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders.
A bidder can offer projects at multiple locations subject to each project having a minimum capacity of 1 MW with cumulative capacity offered not exceeding 10 MW. The scope of work includes design, finance, procurement of land, engineering, procurement, construction, operation, and maintenance of the project.
Projects under construction or projects which are not yet commissioned will be eligible.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/21/gh2-solar-to-build-green-hydrogen-microgrid-in-leh/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS,MICROGRID,LADAKH",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 21, 2023",GH2 Solar to build green hydrogen microgrid in Leh  ,"GH2 Solar, part of Uneecops Technologies Ltd, announced this week it has secured the ‘letter of award’ for setting up a green hydrogen-based microgrid in Leh. It will install the project on EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) basis to supply power for a major hydro-power company’s guest house in Alchi
The project will be developed at a very high altitude of 3,200 meters, making it the world’s first project of its kind.
“The project aims to demonstrate the viability of green hydrogen-based fuel cells as a reliable source of energy for remote and off-grid locations. The guest house is an ideal location for this pilot project as it is situated in one of the most challenging terrains in India, where the availability of reliable power supply is a significant challenge,” stated GH2 Solar.
The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/21/oriana-power-commissions-rajasthans-first-floating-solar-plant/,"FLOATING SOLAR,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 21, 2023",Oriana Power commissions Rajasthan’s first floating solar plant,"Oriana Power has announced the commissioning of an 800 kW AC/1 MW DC floating solar power plant for Udaipur Cement Works Ltd, a subsidiary of JK Lakshmi Cement. The plant, located at Udaipur Cement Works’ Daroli Mines in Udaipur, is Rajasthan’s first floating solar plant and the fifth project by Oriana Power in the state. 
Oriana’s scope in the project included engineering, procurement, and construction of the floating solar power plant and a five-year contract for operation and maintenance services.
The contract was worth around INR 6 crore and the project was commissioned within six months.
The Daroli floating solar power plant is expected to generate around 1.7 million units of clean electricity annually while avoiding around 1,000 tons of CO2 emissions.
“The state has vast and largely untapped potential in terms of intense solar radiation, one of the highest sunny days in a year, and availability of vast barren and uncultivable unutilized government and private land. This has the potential to make Rajasthan a highly preferred destination for solar energy at the global level… By installing this floating solar plant, approximately 8000 cubic meters of water evaporation per year will also be reduced,” said Anirudh Saraswat, co-founder and chief business officer of Oriana Power.
