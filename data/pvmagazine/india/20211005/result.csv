https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/05/commercial-and-industrial-solar-addition-fell-34-in-the-second-quarter/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 5, 2021",Rate of commercial and industrial solar installation fell 34% in the second quarter,"Commercial and industrial (C&I) solar clients installed just 332 MW of solar generation capacity in the April-to-June window, to post a 34% retreat from the 501 MW added by businesses in the first three months of the year.
The second quarter figure comprised 127 MW of ‘open-access’, off-site solar projects and 205 MW of rooftop panels, according to India Corporate Renewable Brief compiled for the second quarter by analyst Bridge To India.
The latest installation data indicates India’s cumulative C&I solar capacity reached 10,817 MW by June 30. That figure is split between 4,595 MW of open-access solar and 6,222 MW of rooftop arrays.
The Bridge to India report cited lockdowns in multiple states as the main reason for the reduced installation level in the second quarter and the analyst has predicted more activity in the last quarter and the current three-month window, due to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.
According to the report, the price for mono-PERC modules rose to $0.255/W (INR18.93) in the second quarter, 4% higher than in the January-to-March period. The total engineering, procurement and construction cost for C&I solar rose 3%, according to the analyst, to INR32.69/W for open access arrays and INR39/W for rooftop systems.
Bridge to India expects costs to have fallen 8-10% last quarter, thanks to the expiry of a 14.5% safeguarding duty imposed on solar imports which came to an end on July 30. However, the analyst pointed out, solar developers face a huge challenge in securing supply as Chinese manufacturers appear reluctant to book fresh orders.

The panel features 144 half-cells (arranged in a 6×24 array) and a five-busbar design. It measures 2,010×1,000×35 mm and weighs 23.5 kg.
The panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V and an operating temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. It can withstand a snow load of up to 5,400 Pa and a wind load of up to 2,400 Pa. Power tolerance is +4.99Wp.
The panel is BIS, IEC, and UL certified. It comes with a 10-year product warranty and a 25-year linear power output warranty (considering 2.5% degradation in the first year and 0.60% from the second year to the 25th year).
The panel comes with anodized aluminum silver frames. Black is available on request.

Vector Green Energy currently owns 652 MWp of operating renewable energy capacity (628 MW solar and 24 MW wind) across 19 projects in 12 states of India. It shall use the amount, raised as long-term non-recourse debt, for its operating solar projects in Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.
“The debt has been raised under a unique financing structure with attractive terms and has been rated in the AA category,” stated the company.
With this, Vector Green’s entire operating portfolio is now rated either AAA or AA on a non-recourse basis, a unique feat amongst independent renewable power producers in India.
Vector Green is a wholly-owned subsidiary of India Infrastructure Fund II (IIF II)–a SEBI registered Category-I Alternative Investment Fund. IIF II is managed by Global Infrastructure Partners India LLP–the Indian afﬁliate of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), one of the world’s largest infrastructure investors managing over US$ 74 billion of assets.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/05/panasonic-launches-5-kw-fuel-cell-system-for-commercial-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 5, 2021",Panasonic launches 5 kW fuel cell system for commercial applications,"From pv magazine International
Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic has launched a 5 kW pure hydrogen fuel cell generator for commercial applications. It has previously installed the fuel cell in several pilot projects in Japan.
Dubbed H2 Kibou, the fuel cell system works with pure hydrogen at a density of more than 99.97%, and achieves electrical efficiency of 56%. “The higher electrical efficiency leads to the reduction in hydrogen use, therefore contributing to the reduction of total running cost,” the manufacturer said in a statement.

The system has dimensions of 834×417×1,766 mm and weighs 205 kg including the design panel. “The power output can be scaled up according to demand by connecting and controlling multiple generator units,” the company stated. “In addition, by taking advantage of its lightweight and compact housing, this generator can be flexibly adapted to various installation conditions, including the rooftop and in narrow spaces.”

The company also explained that, using a simple PC application, it is possible to bundle together up to ten units for a total capacity of 50 kW, and that these units can be further combined to create a MW-sized installation.  “By connecting a hot water storage unit (recommended product) with the product, heat generated from the fuel cell can be converted into hot water for use,” it also emphasized. “The generator has achieved total energy efficiency of 95% including the heat recovery, thereby allowing the effective use of energy without waste.”
The new product can be used with an operating temperature between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius, at altitudes not exceeding 500 m. During power outages, it is able to generate electricity and to use up to 2.5 kW of its capacity for at least 120 hours. “The product can be started in approximately one minute, which is useful for responding to peak cut control when a quick response from generators is required,” Panasonic highlighted.
The device was used by the Japanese conglomerate in a pilot hydrogen plant combined with photovoltaics and storage it built at its fuel cell factory in Kusatsu, Shiga Prefecture, in central Japan.
“Through this demonstration, Panasonic will accumulate know-how and establish a track record in energy management, including the operation of pure hydrogen fuel cell generators, and aim to commercialize the RE100 solution, which uses power generated in-house from renewable sources to supply 100% of the electricity required for business activities,” the company said at the time.
