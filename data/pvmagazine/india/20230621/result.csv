The projects involved the installation of solar pumps with a total capacity of 186 kWp in the Sarlahi and Siraha districts. 
The projects were supported by the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC), the Government of Japan, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The Government of Japan and the UNDP recently handed over a 9 kWp project to Harion Municipality in the Sarlahi district. It provides over 260 residents with access to potable water as well as irrigation for modern agriculture such as drip irrigation for polyhouse farming. 
In Nepal, the Chure hill regions especially lack access to clean water supply. Locals have long been forced to rely on tiny seasonal streams and water holes due to deforestation, haphazard development, and the extraction of sand and stone, all of which are made worse by climate change. Every day, 3-4 hours were spent by women and children carrying water to their homes. 
Along with the solar-powered drinking water system, solar PV backup systems were also installed with support from the Government of Japan. This ensured an uninterrupted electrical supply to critical medical equipment in 11 health facilities as well as computer and audio-visual equipment in two schools in the Sarlahi district. 
Moreover, 266 women and men have been trained in different aspects of solar PV technologies and institutional building to ensure their long-term use even after the project phases out. 
The projects were funded by the Japan Supplementary Budget

Vietnamese solar panel manufacturer AD Green announced it began manufacturing activities at its new factory in Thai Binh.
The facility currently has a capacity of 500 MW and is expected to reach 3 GW within 12 months. “The fully operational facility will start shipping its 540 W monocrystalline photovoltaic panels to customers both domestically and overseas starting this month,” the company said in a statement.
The manufacturer also explained that the new factory will produce modules mainly for the US market, thus taking advantage of the tariff exemption for solar panels from Vietnam that the US government announced in June 2022.
“This exemption, lasting up to 24 months, allows AD Green to meet the skyrocketing solar energy demand in the United States, opening new opportunities for the company to expand its market presence and contribute to the global renewable energy transition,” it stated.
AD Green is a subsidiary of Damsan Joint Stock Company, a Vietnam-based company primarily engaged in the textile industry.

Singh hinted that the government may bring another production-linked incentive (PLI) Scheme for grid-scale battery storage.
“We need to have another PLI scheme for grid-scale storage so that we can augment capacity and have round-the-clock renewable energy,” said the minister at an event in New Delhi.
The minister stated that since renewable energy storage is currently expensive, the government has come out with a policy to also encourage pumped hydropower projects. 
The minister underlined the need for diversification of supply chains, using technologies such as sodium-ion. He said that around 100 GW of battery storage capacity is going to come up in the coming years, out of which around 50 GW will be available for exports.
Singh expressed confidence that India will exceed its huge targets of renewable energy capacity. “Today, 42% of our energy capacity is from non-fossil fuels. We have committed to take this to 50% by 2030, but we shall achieve 65% of capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030. We will add 50 GW of capacity every year. We have emerged as the fastest-growing renewable energy destination,” he said. 
Singh, however, stated that even as India builds renewable energy capacity at the fastest rate, it will not shy away from adding thermal capacity to meet its energy requirements. “Our pace of energy transition will be the fastest in the world, but we will not compromise our energy needs. In 2030, I see the capacity crossing 800 GW, and that is at a conservative rate of growth.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/21/the-top-causes-of-solar-performance-issues/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,QUALITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 21, 2023",The top causes of solar performance issues,"From pv magazine USA
Each year solar technical advisory and inspection servicer Heliovolta releases a report on solar performance and safety called the SolarGrade PV Health Report.
The report assesses PV health using over 60,000 data points, ranging from projects from 100 kW to 350 MW in size. About 73% of the assessed projects in this year’s report are located on commercial rooftops, 25% are ground-mounted, and 2% are solar carports. All projects are located in the United States.
Heliovolta found some important problem areas for the performance and safety of these solar assets. A staggering 62% of inspected projects were identified to have critical or major issues. Of this share of projects with critical risks, 91% of the major issues were found to be in DC distribution components.
“Issues can be fixed before they become hazardous. Periodic inspections and proactive O&M — especially in the DC distribution section of PV systems — are critical to safe and reliable operations,” said the report.
Heliovolta noted that inverters often appear to be the cause of PV system problems due to the fact they are typically the primary device of energy yield data and error messages. However, on-the-ground data reveals that inverters are rarely the root cause of downtime. In most cases, inverters trip because they detect underlying issues located within the DC Distribution section, said the report.
The report shared that 74% of issues were in the DC distribution section, 9% in racking, 7% in modules, and 7% in inverters.

Within this critical DC distribution system failure are a few specific components driving most of the problems. Over 33% of failures in this system were due to field-made PV connectors. Wire management issues were the second cause of failures and safety issues, about 26% of reported problems. Other problems with conduits, raceways, improper installation, combiner boxes, grounding, and wire terminations were listed as significant risks.
“The most frequently observed issues are related to field-made connectors and wire management. Installer error is typically the root cause for these categories of issue — not defective equipment,” said Heliovolta.
The company said that 79% of all field-made connector issues are caused by improper installation or cross-mating of incompatible parts. Identifying and remediating compromised field-made connectors is critical to safety as they can trigger PV system fires by overheating and by creating arc and ground fault conditions. Heliovolta offers a safety guide to solar connectors.
Interestingly, the report found that 37% of all inverter issues were sourced from one inverter provider. This brand was kept anonymous by Heliovolta in the report.
As for solar module performance, about 30% of problems were related to microcracking. These small cracks restrict the flow of current, reducing energy yield and potentially creating hotspots over time. The report recommends using electroluminescent (EL) imagining tests to detect microcracking.
Heliovolta operates a cloud-based software platform called SolarGrade to help manage the performance and safety inspection process. The company’s report recommended five best practices to ensure a more reliable, productive, and safe solar facility:
1) Require robust installer training
DC distribution issues related to connectors and wire management are the most common problems at project sites. With better training protocols, the vast majority of these issues could be avoided.
2) Conduct QA/WC inspections at commissioning
Assessing EPC workmanship through QA/QC inspections early in a project’s lifecycle helps ensure that latent issues are corrected before catastrophic failures occur.
3) Require inspections during operations and maintenance visits twice a year
Periodically walking project sites to assess PV system health ensures that signs of latent component failure and accelerated degradation are identified early.
4) Standardize inspection processes
Make sure inspectors know what to look for in PV system health assessments by providing standardized, accessible, and easy-to-use guidelines. The SolarGrade platform comes with pre-written templates and issue descriptions.
5) Track issue resolution
Do not allow issues to get lost in the shuffle of PDF reports, spreadsheets, and clunky manual checklists. The SolarGrade platform allows field technicians to quickly find problems on the ground, and asset managers can dynamically track issue resolution in the cloud.

Solar irradiance plays a crucial role in managing PV assets throughout the world. Numerous institutional and commercial providers offer modeled solar irradiance data, making it challenging for users to determine the most suitable providers for their specific applications and locations.
Now, IEA-PVPS Task 16 has produced a worldwide benchmark of modeled solar irradiance data to help the solar industry to make better-informed decisions about solar resource assessments.
The study gives a point of reference for model-derived direct normal irradiance (DNI) and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data, using 129 high-quality ground-based radiation measurement stations across the globe from 2015 to 2020. It then compares DNI and GHI estimates from 10 solar radiation datasets, either public-domain or commercial, against this reference point. The datasets are ACCESSG3, DWDSARAH, CAMS v3.2, KNMISEVIRI, CAMS pre-v4, METEOTEST, CERES, NSRDBGOES, CSIROHIMAWARI, and Solargis.
The comparison is conducted at hourly temporal resolution and the performance of the modeled information is analyzed with respect to different regions and climate zones.
IEA-PVPS says the quality of the reference database is assured by selecting data based on a “comprehensive set of best practices and newly implemented quality-control procedures. These include automatic and manual data quality-control tests carried out by a team of experts for all stations and result in flags describing the quality for each time stamp.” Of the total 129 stations, 31 are in Africa, 31 in Asia, 27 in North America, 20 in Europe, 13 in Australia, five in South America, and two in Antarctica. The report calculates the mean bias deviation, root mean square deviation, and standard deviation between the benchmark and each station across the 2015-20 period.
“The benchmark results have shown noticeable deviations in performance between the various modeled data sets,” the report says. “In particular, it was found that the most appropriate data set actually depends on both site and climate or continent of interest. Some stations are especially challenging for some models, as evidenced by the high deviations observed for several data sets in difficult environments (e.g., high mountains or coastal areas).”
The report showed that the model errors and the differences between the various modeled data sets are much higher for DNI than for GHI, because of the former’s higher sensitivity to aerosols, clouds, and elevation, among other factors.
As for dataset-specific results, the study shows that CERES had significantly higher deviations than all other satellite-derived datasets, likely due to its coarser resolution. Solargis showed the lowest average deviation metrics and was also the best performer at many individual stations, according to IEA-PVPS.
“From a methodological standpoint, this benchmark underlined the importance of the reference data quality. Without a stringent quality control procedure, no real validation can be done, with the risk of obtaining invalid results,” the researchers concluded.

According to the consultancy, global trade and diversified transport infrastructure are crucial for unlocking the full potential of the green hydrogen market.
Deloitte’s outlook suggests that by 2050, major regions engaging in global trade could generate over $280 billion in annual export revenues.
In 2030, Asia is expected to capture 55% of the market, driven by soaring demand in China, India, and Indonesia.
The report notes the need for more than $9 trillion of cumulative investments in the global clean hydrogen supply chain to achieve net-zero compliance by 2050. It also says that clean hydrogen presents a significant sustainable growth opportunity for developing countries.
University of Alberta researchers have studied small modular nuclear reactor power plants (SMNRPPs) and their influence on hydrogen supply costs. Their findings indicate that in electricity markets with high fossil fuel-dependence, hydrogen supply costs can range from CAD 1.77/kg ($1.34/kg) to CAD 3.36/kg, while in low fossil fuel-dependence markets, the range is estimated to be CAD 2.11/kg to CAD 2.77/kg. Their analysis, outlined in the paper “Assessing the cost competitiveness of electrolytic hydrogen production from small modular nuclear reactor-based power plants: A price-following perspective,” involved combining economic dispatch and leveled cost analysis models. The researchers also considered the adaptability of SMNRPPs to adjust power output based on fluctuating electricity market prices. They emphasized that the SMNRPP-electrolysis system proves more cost-effective than fossil fuel-based hydrogen production at a capital cost decrease of CAD 4,700/kW, with the capital cost accounting for 75% of the hydrogen supply cost variance. The study was published in Applied Energy.
Iqony Energies has announced its intention to construct a 53 MW electrolysis plant in Saarland, Germany. The company aims to facilitate the decarbonization of industries in the region, including the steel industry and the mobility sector. Anke Langner, managing director of Iqony Energies, said that waiting for a sufficiently efficient European hydrogen pipeline network could hinder the industry’s rapid adoption of hydrogen.
Everfuel has initiated a controlled venting process for all hydrogen trailers from the same supplier after detecting a malfunction and leak in one of its 12 trailers. The initial investigation report pinpointed a valve as the cause of the leak and acknowledged the possibility of it being a systemic issue.
