This project is facilitated by Zetwerk, an India-based B2B custom manufacturing services provider. SolarSpace provided bifacial mono PERC modules for the project. All the manufacturing was done by SolarSpace in China and Zetwerk acted as the trading partner for supply to NTPC.
“In recent years, Zetwerk has established a strong trust through multiple successful collaborations with SolarSpace. After winning the bid for the NTPC project, Zetwerk decisively chose SolarSpace as the sole supplier for the Bhuj-Gujarat project, providing an opportunity for the first cooperation between SolarSpace and NTPC,” stated a release from SolarSpace.
This article was amended on March 14 to correct the role of Zetwerk as the trading partner.

JSW Neo Energy had secured the capacity through tariff-based competitive bid in SECI auction for setting up 1.5 GW ISTS-connected solar power projects.
With this awarded capacity of 700 MW, JSW Energy now has total locked-in generation capacity of 11.7 GW comprising 7.2 GW operational, 2.6 GW under-construction across wind, thermal and hydro, and LoAs for 1.9 GW capacity from SECI and SJVN. In addition, the company has 3.4 GWh of locked-in energy storage capacity through battery energy storage system and hydro pumped storage project. The company aims to reach 20 GW generation capacity and 40 GWh of energy storage capacity before 2030. It also targets a 50% reduction in carbon footprint by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Inorganic FeSi2-based solar cells have recently drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community as these devices offer superior thermal stability and good optoelectronic properties compared to conventional solar cells. Furthermore, Fe and Si used to form FeSi2 are abundant in nature.
The scientists explained that their tandem cell takes advantage of combining the larger bandgap of the top CdTe cell and the smaller bandgap of the bottom FeSi2 cell. “The top cell transforms photons with elevated energy efficiently while minimizing thermalization losses and transmitting the solar spectrum in the close-infrared region light to the lower cell,” they highlighted. “In order to improve light absorption, it is crucial to reduce the undesired losses at the junction resulting from Fresnel surface reflection.”
The scientists used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel cell configuration. They assumed the top cell to be built with an n-type cadmium sulfide (CdS) window layer, the CdTe absorber, and a back surface field (BSF) based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The bottom cell was designed with an n-type CdS window layer, the FeSi2 absorber, and a copper tin sulfide (Cu2SnS3) BSF.
In the simulation, the team considered parameters such as energy bandgap, diffusion length, and doping concentration. “CdTe has featured a 1.5 eV bandgap and a 4.28 eV electron affinity, while the bandgap and electron affinity of FeSi2 are 0.87 eV and 4.16 eV, respectively,” it specified. “An optimal, slender tunnel junction connecting the upper and lower cells with monolithic architecture has been assumed for the electrical linkage.”
The numerical analysis showed that the top CdTe cell may potentially achieve a power conversion efficiency of 26.13%, while the FeSi2 bottom cell may reach up to 35.25%. It also demonstrated that the tandem device may achieve an efficiency of 43.91%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.928 V, a short-circuit current of 25.338 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 88.88%.
“These results suggest the practical feasibility of fabricating high-performance CdTe–FeSi2 double-junction tandem solar cells for efficient solar energy conversion,” the scientists affirmed.
The cell was described in the study “Design and optimization of a high efficiency CdTe–FeSi2 based double-junction two-terminal tandem solar cell,” published in Heliyon.

ACEN has approximately 4.8 GW of attributable renewable capacity across the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India and a target of 20 GW of renewables capacity by 2030.
BrightNight is developing a global portfolio of 23 GW across the United States  and the Asia Pacific, including Australia.
“They have demonstrated success in scaling and operating large fleets of renewable assets through strategic partnerships across the region, and our existing India partnership is already delivering tremendous value,” said BrightNight CEO Martin Hermann.
In 2023, ACEN Renewables International formed a 50-50 partnership with BrightNight to develop, construct, and operate approximately 1.2 GW of large-scale solar and wind projects in India.
“The success of our joint projects in India, which are already winning customers and building capacity, serves as a solid foundation for our venture in the Philippines,” said ACEN Group Chief Investment Officer Patrice Clausse. “This move is a strategic fit for ACEN and aligns with our dedication to meeting our customer’s energy requirements while upholding our environmental and social responsibilities.”
