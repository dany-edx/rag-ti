“The industry has a high expectation for the clean tech sector in this budget including GST reduction and parity for battery swapping and alternate battery technologies; and financial incentives for the battery supply chain industry with additional ACC-PLI scheme for stationary storage applications,” said Debi Prasad Dash, executive director, India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA). “The Government should also focus and allocate special funds for R&D and innovation of advanced technologies and skill development and capacity building of emerging technology sectors like energy storage, electric mobility, and green hydrogen.” 
Specifically, the alliance has called for tax holidays to boost investment in the energy storage industry, along with the reduction of GST rates and exemptions on customs & excise duty to bring down the overall system costs in the short run. 
GST for EV batteries ranging from 18% to 28% is a key barrier to bringing down the cost of EVs. IESA has suggested bringing down GST under the 5% bracket to ensure affordability and a smooth transition towards EVs from ICEs. Moreover, the alliance has asked for an extension of the Fame II incentivization for the charging infrastructure and battery swapping as well. 
IESA has also urged the government to finalize the second PLI scheme of ACC battery manufacturing of 50GWh capacity for stationary storage applications including grid-scale projects, behind-the-meter, and consumer-end C&I applications. On cell manufacturing supply chain components and raw materials, the alliance has sought a significant reduction of duties and credit guarantee schemes for intermediate material manufacturers to promote exports. 
To support MSME and start-up ecosystems in the energy storage and e-mobility space, the alliance has called for effective measures to make funding access easy and affordable, including a loan guarantee for high-risk technology programs and a revenue shortfall scheme for the manufacturing sector. 
Rahul Jain, director at Crayon Motors,  says, “Even when the EV sales have doubled in the last year, the industry still suffers from higher initial ownership costs of EVs, which is a direct result of higher input costs. We hope the upcoming budget will reduce GST on raw materials/components, thereby accelerating India’s EV race. Because battery manufacturing in India relies heavily on imports, some duty relief could help reduce overall costs. EVs have fewer financing options and higher interest rates than ICE vehicles.”
Maxson Lewis, founder and managing director of Magenta Mobility, recommends a loan mandate to government sector banks and financial institutions to make financing easy for EV customers. “The government can see this as a kickstart to a sustainable economy while driving demand for the automotive industry,” he said.
Nitin Gupta, CEO and co-founder of Attero Recycling, hopes the government will unveil significant initiatives to boost the recycling industry in the budget.
Gupta said, “Numerous steps have been taken by the Indian government to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality. The government introduced the battery swapping program in the budget for 2022, and hopes for this budget are considerably higher given that it comes on the heels of India taking up the G20 presidency. 
“Recycling must play a crucial role in allowing India to transition from a linear to a circular economy. Adopting a circular economy will eliminate the issues connected with mineral scarcity and supply chain fragility, allowing the nation to be self-sufficient in battery materials. Lithium and cobalt comprise about 40% of the value of lithium-ion batteries, yet India has no lithium or cobalt reserves. These difficulties and future mineral demand can be met through urban mining.” 
Gupta said there is an urgent need to implement regulatory changes in the lithium-ion battery ecosystem, such as lowering taxes and import duties and prohibiting the export of used lithium-ion batteries and black mass.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/27/us-startup-begins-producing-40-efficient-thermophotovoltaic-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 27, 2023",US startup begins producing 40%-efficient thermophotovoltaic cells,"From pv magazine International
Antora Energy has started production at its 2 MW thermophotovoltaic cell factory in Sunnyvale, California.
“The cells are based on III-V semiconductors, which have a higher performance than conventional solar cells, and produce 100 times more power than similarly sized devices,” CEO Andrew Ponec told pv magazine. “The cells can convert any source of high temperature heat into electricity and their most important application is for energy storage,” he added referring to thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) consisting of a low-cost, grid-scale energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity above 2,000 C.
Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) is a power generation technology that uses thermal radiation to generate electricity in photovoltaic cells. A TPV system generally consists of a thermal emitter that can reach high temperatures, near or beyond 1,000 C, and a photovoltaic diode cell that can absorb photons coming from the heat source.
The technology has drawn the interest of scientists for decades, because it is able to capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. However, the efficiencies reported thus far have been too low to make it commercially viable, as TPV devices still suffer from optical and thermal losses.
“Until now, TPV technology has met neither the efficiency threshold required to compete with traditional heat engines nor the manufacturability threshold required to produce the technology at scale,” said Antora Energy. “Now, Antora has met both of these critical thresholds, demonstrating heat-to-electricity conversion efficiencies greater than 40%, and demonstrating the capability to manufacture TPV at scale.”
The startup said it has secured funding from the California Energy Commission to build the TPV manufacturing line in California in 2021.
“Some of Antora’s earliest funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to develop TPV technology in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Arizona State University,” said the company.
In April, a group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) unveiled a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell featuring III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV. This cell achieved an efficiency of 41.1% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 C. The group presented the device in “Thermophotovoltaic efficiency of 40%,” which was recently published in Nature.
