A new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) looks at how this can be done by augmenting traditional financing structures and sources with other channels such as green bond issuances, asset monetization, and capital recycling initiatives. 
The report examines in detail the positions and potential of three major players in India’s renewable energy sector, each with ambitious clean energy plans: NTPC, a government-owned utility transitioning to green energy; Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL), a privately owned pure-play renewable energy company planning to rapidly ramp up its capacity; and Tata Power, a private utility pivoting to renewables. 
“The capacity expansion plans of NTPC, Tata Power, and AGEL will require major financing drives to keep on track to meet renewable energy goals,” says report author an IEEFA energy finance analyst Shantanu Srivastava.
The report compares the capital structure changes of the three companies, explains their funding sources for capacity expansion in the past, and identifies trends that will shape the major industry players’ futures. 
Overall, NTPC’s Government of India parentage makes it easier to tap a diverse set of investors, but its predominantly thermal power asset base is increasingly a hindrance in global capital markets, according to the report. 
AGEL, the largest solar power company in the world, has capitalized exceptionally well on its green profile, evident from its high market capitalization, asset monetization, and bond lending program. 
Tata Power, to its credit, has been able to pare down debt, which improves debt raising capability in the future, but the company lacks patient global pension/corporate capital on its books, says Srivastava.
“A large proportion of India’s renewable energy capacity will be added by the largest players already operating in the industry, given the capital-intensive nature of the business,” he says.
There is a flood of global capital vying for opportunities to invest in zero-emissions infrastructure assets, driven in part by the rise of sustainable finance and environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing.
“India [with its installed renewable capacity target of ‘450 GW by 2030’] presents attractive prospects for these investors to deploy capital and gain exposure to the country’s growing renewable energy sector,” says Srivastava, “while also helping developers to secure low-cost capital from optimum sources.”
Srivastava says Indian companies should continue to leverage the breadth of funding avenues for capacity expansion on the most advantageous financing terms. 
Green/sustainability bonds let developers secure long-term capital at competitive rates from a diverse set of investors. Developers could also monetize operational cash-generating assets through infrastructure investment trusts. 
Joint ventures with oil and gas majors diversifying into zero emissions, and loans from offshore lenders committed to supporting renewable energy projects globally, and loans from multilateral development banks such as the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Germany’s KfW and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) are the other options available to them.
However, to secure the global capital for RE projects, companies will need to adopt green/sustainability bond frameworks, enhance credit ratings of projects, adopt globally recognized ESG frameworks and principles, ringfence renewable assets, and create a robust investor outreach program, the report says. 
For conventional utilities such as NTPC and Tata Power, this will mean delivering on commitments not to build new coal plants beyond current pipelines. AGEL will need to convince its parent Adani Group that aligning with the Paris Agreement is a prerequisite to accessing the widening pool of global investors eager to deploy capital into India’s energy transition, the report concludes.

The ongoing ravages of Covid-19 last year, and related solar power price inflation, failed to dent the photovoltaic industry’s ability to keep generating new jobs, according to the latest clean energy employment report published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
The Renewable Energy and Jobs Annual Review 2021, published jointly with the United Nations’ International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated solar employed 3.98 million people last year, up from 3.8 million in 2019.
The latest edition of the annual report included some eye-catching nuggets of information such as the claim made by the Mini Grids Partnership of UN partner organization Sustainable Energy for All, that only 13% of the $2.07 billion pledged from 2012 to March last year, by development finance institutions to foster mini-grid deployment, has actually been disbursed.
The report also cited a U.S. study which estimated 43% of the workforce employed in coal-fired power plants could be redeployed on solar plants without any additional training, and the authors of the study suggested the large proportion of renewables employees who would need only on-the-job training for a clean energy role offered a no-brainer for governments around the world to achieve employment targets via Covid-recovery spending plans.
That ties in with the paragraph on page 90 of the report which hints at a possible pivot away from the idea the private sector is best equipped to drive the energy transition. While the report’s authors state private companies have steered maturity in renewables technology, as well as significant price falls, they add: “But this will no longer suffice,” as interventionist government measures will be required to ensure the jobs windfall from the clean energy revolution is targeted towards those affected by fossil fuel job losses; that employment benefits are shared equitably across society, and geographically; and to ensure the good quality of renewables industry positions.
This year’s study also estimated labor costs supply around 17% of the development costs of large scale solar projects, and around 32% of operations and maintenance expenses. According to the report, labor costs account for only around 6-7% of polysilicon prices, and 10-11% of solar cell and module costs but make up 27-31% of wafer price tags.
In terms of solar job numbers, the IRENA-ILO study said China‘s PV workforce rose from 2.2 million to 2.3 million last year and numbers were also up in Germany, where they rose by 5,800 to 43,900 in 2019, in the latest available statistics; and in the Philippines, from 33,700 to 41,035. IRENA has estimated the German figure could have risen to 51,000 last year, as part of 239,000 solar jobs across Europe, around 194,000 of which were in EU member states.
Photovoltaic industry job numbers fell, though, in the U.S., from 240,000 to 231,000; in Japan (241,000 to 220,000); in India (a 15% year-on-year reverse to 163,500); and in the U.K. (to 7,500 in 2019-20). The initial 1 GW of mini grid generation capacity targeted in India could help create 800-877,000 new positions, according to the report.
Elsewhere, the report estimated Brazil had 68,000 solar jobs in 2020 and Malaysia 54,900 in the latest available figures, which refer to 2019. South Korea hosted 19,300 solar roles in 2019 and Vietnam 126,300 last year, although the report’s authors expect the numbers to slow there because of grid congestion constraints on new PV development.
The report noted the 500 MW Kalyon solar factory built in Turkey added 1,500 jobs last year and said Canada had around 3,000 solar posts, with Jordan boasting “more than 2,000.” The South African government estimated it had 21,451 solar jobs in 2020.
As far as off-grid solar employment was concerned, the report’s authors admitted it was much more difficult to be certain about the numbers. Based on a belief many off-grid companies managed to retain staff despite only 250 MW of generation capacity being deployed, IRENA-ILO said 342,000 such jobs may have been maintained last year, with around 191,400 of them in South Asia and 150,000 in east, west and central Africa.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/28/module-and-shipping-cost-inflation-could-cost-the-world-50-gw-of-solar-next-year/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RACKING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MAX HALL,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",Module and shipping cost inflation could cost the world 50 GW of solar next year,"From pv magazine International
Norwegian business intelligence firm Rystad Energy has predicted rising solar module and shipping costs could prompt the delay or cancellation of as much as 56% of the solar generation capacity currently planned worldwide next year.
With the average price of solar modules having risen from $0.20 per Watt-peak last year to $0.26-0.28 since July, up to 50 GW of the 90 GW of solar generation capacity planned for 2022 could be threatened by inflation, according to the Oslo-based consultant.
Modules and shipping costs typically make up between a quarter and a third of solar project capital costs, according to Rystad, and both input costs have soared on the back of a shortage of shipping containers, exacerbated by the Covid crisis; and rising prices for solar panel raw materials polysilicon, silver, copper, aluminum, and glass.
The polysilicon price alone has almost quadrupled in recent months and the shipping costs for solar panels have risen almost sixfold, from $0.005/Wp, in September 2019, to around $0.03 this month.
With Rystad senior renewables analyst David Dixon stating the supply bottlenecks are unlikely to ease within 12 months, the company has calculated the levelized cost of energy from solar projects is likely to have risen 10-15% from the average figure posted last year.
That will leave solar project developers with a stark choice of either reducing their margins, passing on the costs in the form of more expensive solar electricity, or postponing or cancelling solar plants.
