Total revenue (including revenue from the power supply and sale of goods and related services, and other income) in Q3 FY 2023 was INR 2,258 crore, 53% up from INR 1,471 crore in Q3 FY 2022.
Revenue for the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2022 was up by 42% year-on-year to INR 5,645 crore. This included INR 3,695 crore of revenue from the power supply.
The company said the robust growth in its revenues was primarily driven by the greenfield commissioning of 1,915 MW renewables capacity in 9M FY23. It commissioned 1,440 MW solar-wind hybrid plants in Rajasthan, a 325 MW wind power plant, and a 150 MW solar power plant in Rajasthan in the April-December period of 2022.
“The state-of-the-art ENOC enables real-time monitoring of our entire renewable portfolio with information access to the minutest level and automated alerts. With this analytics-driven operation and maintenance (O&M) approach, the plant availability is maximized, enabling higher electricity generation and higher revenues. It also helps curtail O&M costs, in turn enabling high EBITDA margins,” stated Adani Green.

OIL indigenously developed this hydrogen fuel cell-based bus under its Startup incubation program SNEH. The bus is powered by a 60 kW proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, which can provide a minimum range of 450 km on a single refill. The fuel cell uses hydrogen to produce electricity to drive the electric motor and also charge the auxiliary battery for back-up power during acceleration and braking. 
The bus has a tank capacity of 21.9 kg at 350 bar pressure. It is designed to accommodate 32 persons, including the driver.

The company has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority to set up the PV plant with an investment of INR 3,500 crore. 
SJVN has sought 3,000 acres of land around Ghatampur town or its surrounding area from the authority to set up the plant. 
The establishment of the PV plant is expected to generate employment opportunities for about three hundred people. The 700 MW of clean power generated from the plant will be available to industries at cheaper rates.
SJVN is also setting up two solar plants of 75 MW each in the Kalpi and Orai tehsils of the Jalaun district in Uttar Pradesh. Out of these, the project set up in Parasan village of Kalpi tehsil has started operation.
SJVN is also building a 50 MW solar power plant at Akbarpur in Kanpur Dehat. 
Apart from the open market, the company will directly approach industries and establishments like Kanpur Metro to sell electricity.

Researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have compared the energy savings potential of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) distribution systems for residential buildings equipped with PV and battery storage systems. In particular, they looked at whether DC setups could lead to lower energy losses.
“One aspect derived from the work is that we could present modeled loss-savings with DC distribution for a Nordic climate with – on average – lower irradiance,” researcher Patrik Ollas told pv magazine. “Also, the effect – and proven necessity – of PV and battery storage for achieving energy savings with DC.”
For their analysis of the daily and seasonal performance of the two topologies, the scientists used a full-year data set of load usage, PV generation, load-dependent efficiency characteristics of power electronic converters (PECs), and battery storage. They considered AC and DC configurations for a building with a south-oriented 3.6 kW solar-plus-storage installation at a tilt angle of 45 degrees. They assumed the building had space and domestic hot water heating via a ground-source heat pump.
“Individual measurements were obtained for the following appliances: ground-source heat pump, ventilation, water pumps, and PV generation,” the scientists said, noting that the annual load demand is 6,354 kWh, with PV generating 3,113 kWh. “This study was performed for a grid-tied building; a bidirectional AC/DC converter was needed for grid interaction.”
The work considered four different system topologies: AC—230 VAC with load-dependent efficiency, DC1—380 VDC with load-dependent efficiency, DC2—380 VDC with fixed converter efficiency, and DC3—380 and 20 VDC with load-dependent efficiency.
“A 20 VDC sub-voltage level was added to DC1 and DC2 to supply the smaller loads and lighting through a central DC/DC converter,” said the research team.
They found that the bidirectional converter losses significantly differ when modeled with fixed and load-dependent efficiency characteristics. They also found that the DC topology could achieve energy savings even without the inclusion of PV or battery storage.
“The losses of the grid-tied converter using a constant efficiency approach (DC2) were 34% lower than those in the case implementing load-dependent efficiency (DC1),” they said. “The system efficiency values of the respective systems (AC and DC1−3) were 95.3, 94.3, 95.8, and 93.7%, respectively.”
The group concluded that the DC setup did not present a favorable option in terms of loss reduction without the inclusion of a PV and battery system.
“In a more scientific context, the erroneous of using constant efficiencies for both the battery and power electronic converter was highlighted,” Ollas concluded. “Also, the most significant savings were obtained when PV power was fed to the loads directly or via the battery storage. I acknowledge that DC distribution in buildings is a niche application and is caught in a Catch-22 situation regarding supply of products and demand. However, some particular cases could be interesting for this, for example internal DC grids with PV, battery and EV coupling and office buildings with a good correlation between PV and load demand.”
The researchers presented their findings in “Energy Loss Savings Using Direct Current Distribution in a Residential Building with Solar Photovoltaic and Battery Storage,” which was recently published in Energies.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/08/enphase-demonstrates-bidirectional-ev-charger/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 8, 2023",Enphase demonstrates bidirectional EV charger,"From pv magazine Global
Enphase Energy, known for its microinverters, has announced a successful demonstration of its first bidirectional EV charger, which enables vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) use.
The charger will work in conjunction with the Enphase Energy System, which includes IQ microinverters, the IQ Gateway and system controller. These are all managed by the Enphase app, where homeowners can see the flow of energy and see the level of charge of the EV battery.
By leveraging the power of the microinverter to convert DC power of the car to AC  power of the home, the bidirectional charger connects to EV, and both charges and discharges the car battery. The IQ microinverter converts DC power of the car to AC power of the home.
The Enphase bidirectional charger can be used in three ways:

The bidirectional charger requires 240 V AC, and it can connect directly to the grid or through IQ System Controller. Enphase cautions, however, that when connected directly to the grid, some V2H features are disabled. The company says that its EV charger is expected to work with electric vehicles that support stands such as CCS (combined charging system) and the Japanese charging standard, CHAdeMO.  At present, separate demonstration prototypes are made for CCS and CHAdeMO. It supports 200 VDC to 1000 VDC for EV batteries.
Enphase is working with EV manufacturers to bring this revolutionary technology to market. A time frame for release has not been announced.
