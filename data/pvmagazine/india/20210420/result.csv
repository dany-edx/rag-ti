Bidding is open for an aggregate 750 MW of monocrystalline silicon modules. Each module must be rated for a power output of a minimum 390Wp, with 72 cells arranged in a 12×6 configuration or 144 cells (half-cut) in a 24×6 array. The modules shall be suitable for 1500V DC system voltage application. Under standard test conditions, the module efficiency must be minimum of 19%.
Only original manufacturers with a module manufacturing capacity of a minimum 400 MW/annum can apply. The bidder must have produced and supplied a cumulative 50 MW of installed module capacity using 300Wp or higher rated modules in any of the last three financial years.
The bidders must ensure compliance with the BIS registration and ALMM listing requirement.
Tentatively, the modules are to be delivered during the April-December 2022 period in a staggered manner, with the first lot of 30 MW expected within four weeks from the manufacturing clearance date.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/20/ntpcs-85-mw-bilhaur-solar-project-now-operating-at-full-capacity/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTTAR PRADESH",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 20, 2021",NTPC’s 85 MW Bilhaur solar project now operating at full capacity,"NTPC has announced it has commissioned the last part capacity of 15 MW of 85 MW Bilhaur solar PV project at Bilhaur in Uttar Pradesh. The state-run power producer had announced the commissioning of the first part capacity of 70 MW earlier this month.
With the latest addition, the plant is now operating at its full capacity. 
NTPC had won the 85 MW Bilhaur capacity at an INR 3.02/kWh tariff in an auction by Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Agency (UPNEDA) in December 2018. It will sell the power produced from the project to Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd.
NTPC already has a 140 MW solar project commissioned at Bilhaur.
The total installed capacity of NTPC and NTPC group now stands as 52,400 MW and 65,825 MW, respectively, and the commercial capacity of NTPC and NTPC group has become 51,740 MW and 64,505 MW, respectively.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/20/indian-firm-purchases-american-hydrogen-cylinder-maker-catalina-composites/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,INDIA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 20, 2021",Indian firm purchases American hydrogen cylinder maker Catalina Composites,"New Delhi-headquartered Uttam Group of Companies, a global manufacturer of ultra-lightweight composite cylinders and systems for compressed natural gas and hydrogen, has closed on the purchase of US-based Catalina Composites. The new entity, based in California, will now be known as Uttam Composites.
The strategic move comes as the Indian multinational sees demand skyrocketing for clean energy solutions, particularly in compressed natural gas and hydrogen, and believes the expansion will help it grow.
The acquisition will allow Uttam to expand to the U.S. and Europe, in addition to dominating the Asian market. Their business in India, Uttam Cylinders, has had a compounded annual growth rate of more than 60% in the last three years.
Speaking to pv magazine, Uttam chief executive officer Karan Bhatia said, “Hydrogen infrastructure is the key [to clean energy transition]. As refueling stations become accessible and widespread, the adoption of hydrogen vehicles will skyrocket. Uttam’s advantage is that our cylinders are not only the lightest but the most durable on the market because of our proprietary manufacturing process.”

“India is an emerging market for hydrogen and will continue to grow under the Indian Government’s ambition to invest in hydrogen infrastructure. Uttam is the market leader in ultra-lightweight, high-pressure cylinders for both CNG and hydrogen, and with this acquisition, we will be able to meet our overwhelming demand,” Bhatia added.
Uttam will be investing at least $20 million to expand staff, purchase new machinery and invest in research and development of new product lines.
The 107,000-square-foot facility, which produces thousands of cylinders a year, has already doubled its staff from 11 to 22 employees and will grow to around 50 people in the next two years
pv magazine has created a Hydrogen Hub to collect all the news and feature articles on the topic of green hydrogen, making it easy for you to stay up-to-date. As the industry develops, we will report on the most significant technological changes, co-location projects, and business models.
Catalina Composites said the company is in good hands. “The long-term prospects of the composites business under the ownership of the acquiring company are significantly more favorable than other available alternatives,’’ Catalina wrote to its employees in announcing the sale.
Uttam Group of Companies is a family-owned conglomerate established in 1900 that serves a wide array of customers and locations — from the Indian Army at the Siachen Glacier, the highest battleground on earth, to the Indian Space Research Organization’s mission to Mars.
