https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/26/fraunhofer-ise-presents-silicon-carbide-string-inverter-for-medium-voltage-applications/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 26, 2023",Fraunhofer ISE presents silicon carbide string inverter for medium-voltage applications,"Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) has unveiled a new medium-voltage string inverter for large-scale PV power plants.
In a press release, Fraunhofer ISE researchers said the new device is the first of its kind and is based on silicon carbide semiconductors.
Silicon carbide-based inverters are known to have higher power densities, with less need for cooling and lower overall system costs than traditional inverters. However, defects at the interface between the silicon carbide and the insulating silicon dioxide material could still represent an issue for such devices.
The researchers claim the new inverter is technically able to handle voltage levels of up to 1,500 V at 250 kVA.
“Modern PV string inverters have an output voltage of between 400 VAC and 800 VAC. Although the output of power plants is steadily growing, voltage has not yet been increased,” they said. “There are two reasons for this: First, building a highly efficient and compact inverter based on silicon semiconductors is a challenge. Second, there are currently no PV-specific standards that cover only the low-voltage range (max. 1,500 VDC / 1,000 VAC).”
The research institute emphasized that the increase in voltage from 800 V to 1,500 V resulted in a lower cable cross-section, which was reduced from 120 mm² to 35 mm². This, in turn, reduced copper consumption by around 700 kg per km of cable.
“Our resource analyses show that in the medium term, the electrification of the energy system will lead to copper becoming scarce. Increasing the voltage allows us to save valuable resources,” said Andreas Bett, director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.
The German institute developed the new inverter in partnership with German conglomerate Siemens and equipment supplier Sumida Components & Modules GmbH. It sits under the umbrella of the research project MS-LeiKra, founded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK).

Ltd. (MAHAGENCO). The order value of this project is estimated at INR 302 crore (over $36 million). The plant will be situated at Paras village in the Akola district of Maharashtra.
Gensol will be responsible for the conceptualization, engineering, provisioning, installation, testing, and commissioning of the state-of-the-art 62 MW AC solar plant based on crystalline PV technology. The project is being established under the “Flexibility in Generation of Thermal Power Station through Bundling with Renewable Energy” Scheme, which was introduced by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy in April 2022. 
Besides setting up the solar PV plant, Gensol will establish the associated HT overhead transmission line/underground cable, supplemented with all essential electrical equipment. It also encompasses the creation of bays culminating at the point of interconnection at the 220 kV bays at Paras Substation. Additionally, Gensol will provide five-year operation and maintenance support for the solar power plant and its associated evacuation mechanism. 
The project completion period is 12 months.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/26/hong-kong-researchers-develop-inverted-perovskite-solar-cell-with-25-6-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 26, 2023",Hong Kong researchers develop inverted perovskite solar cell with 25.6% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU) have developed an inverted perovskite solar cell based on a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) that can reportedly enhance the cell’s thermal stability.
Inverted perovskite cells have a device structure known as “p-i-n”, in which hole-selective contact p is at the bottom of intrinsic perovskite layer i with electron transport layer n at the top. Conventional halide perovskite cells have the same structure but reversed – a “n-i-p” layout. In n-i-p architecture, the solar cell is illuminated through the electron-transport layer (ETL) side; in the p-i-n structure, it is illuminated through the hole‐transport layer (HTL) surface.
The scientists said they anchored the SAM on a nickel oxide nanoparticle surface to form the charge extraction layer, which they said optimized the dipole moment for fast hole extraction and led to a low defect density.
“We discovered that high-temperature exposure can cause the chemical bonds within SAM molecules to fracture, negatively impacting device performance. So our solution was akin to adding a heat-resistant armor – a layer of nickel oxide nanoparticles, topped by a SAM, achieved through an integration of various experimental approaches and theoretical calculations,” stated the researchers.
The SAM is able to stabilize the interface between the perovskite absorber and the hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx). The energetic alignment, the favorable contact and the binding between the HTL and the perovskite reduced the typical voltage deficit of perovskite cells, leading to strong interface toughening effects under thermal stress, according to the research team.
“By introducing a thermally robust charge extraction layer, our improved cells retain over 90% of their efficiency, boasting an impressive efficiency rate of 25.6%, even after operated under high temperatures, around 65 C for over 1,000 hours. This is a milestone achievement,” said CityU researcher Zhu Zonglong. “This breakthrough is pivotal as it addresses a major obstacle that previously impeded wider adoption of perovskite solar cells.”
The academics presented their innovation in the paper “Stabilized hole-selective layer for high-performance inverted p-i-n perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science.
In April 2022, the same research group fabricated another inverted perovskite solar cell based on an organometallic compound known as ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc2), which is claimed to improve both the efficiency and stability of the PV device.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/26/israel-temporarily-waives-600-kwh-energy-storage-permits-due-to-war/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MICROGRID,POLICY,ISRAEL",LIOR KAHANA,"OCTOBER 26, 2023",Israel temporarily waives 600 KWh energy storage permits due to war,"From pv magazine Global
The Israeli Planning Administration announced it would temporarily scrap permits for soon-to-be-constructed storage units of up to 600 kWh. The move will be in effect for the next 18 months and is said to be due to the current Israel-Hamas conflict.
Storage units exempt from permits will be limited to 30 m2, according to a statement supplied by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure. They will also need to “maintain the reliability of energy supply during emergencies.” Energy units are expected to support the local authorities operating rooms and civilian gathering centers.
According to the statement, civilian gathering centers are designated public buildings such as schools. This is where civilians can evacuate during emergencies. Operation rooms are where civilian emergency operations occur.
“This measure is just the first,” said Eitan Parnass, director of the country’s major renewable energy lobby group, the Green Energy Association of Israel. He told pv magazine that “rapid implementation of electricity storage” in Israel is expected to follow.
“Storage will play a major role in Israel’s electricity market in the coming years,” Parnass said. “The capability of microgrids to survive blackout is a vivid reality in Israel, and a lesson for other modern electricity markets. In Israel, it’s missiles that are jeopardizing the grid, but in other countries, climate change and extreme weather can be the cause.”
