Siemens also agreed to subscribing to 26% of the paid-up equity share capital of Sunsole Renewables, subject to fulfilment of conditions precedent as agreed between the parties.
Sunsole was incorporated by Cleantech India OA to undertake the construction, operation and maintenance of a solar power plant and to supply, on a captive basis, the power generated from the said solar power plant.
Siemens Limited would procure renewable energy from this plant to reduce its carbon footprint for its manufacturing facility located at Kalwa, Maharashtra. 
Raju Shukla, founder and executive chairman of Cleantech Solar, said, “We are delighted to be selected by Siemens Limited as their solar partner. Cleantech Solar is committed to providing top corporates with reliable and cost-competitive solar solutions of the highest quality. Procuring green power will reduce carbon emissions and promote corporate social responsibility. We at Cleantech Solar would like to congratulate Siemens Limited on achieving this milestone in their sustainability journey and will continue to support them in achieving profitable and long-term growth.”
Nathan Schmidt, Regional Head Asia at Climate Fund Managers (CFM), said, “The new partnership between Cleantech Solar and Siemens Limited further reinforces our belief in Cleantech as the partner of choice for C&I solar in the Asian region. Together, Cleantech and Siemens Limited will reduce global emissions, and increase the role of renewable energy in powering India’s business. As the fund manager to Climate Investor One fund, CFM are delighted to be a facilitator of this transition.”
Siemens Limited focuses on intelligent infrastructure for buildings and distributed energy systems, and on automation and digitalization in the process, discrete and hybrid manufacturing industries. It offers broad expertise across the entire energy value chain, along with a comprehensive portfolio for utilities, independent power producers, transmission system operators, the oil and gas industry, and other energy-intensive industries. 
Headquartered in Singapore, Cleantech Solar has been selected for numerous solar power plants across India and Southeast Asia, covering over 600 MW across the various stages of operations, construction and development. This includes installations in India, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Singapore.

Belectric shall also provide operations and maintenance services (O&M) to the plant.
 The plant was completed on time despite disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  
“Because of Covid-19, it was not a given that we would be able to get this solar farm online on time. But our Indian team has overcome all challenges and we were able to deliver this new 250 MWac solar plant for our customer Fortum, safely, on time, and with a quality build,” said Ingo Alphéus, chief executive officer of Belectric Solar & Battery GmbH. “We are particularly proud that we delivered one of the first large-scale bifacial installations in India.”
The Belectric release stated around 40% of the large-scale solar farm is equipped with bifacial high-performance modules. Bifacial cells are embedded in a double-sided glass module by which the solar radiation can be absorbed from both the front and the back of the module. An automatic waterless cleaning system has been installed to clean the modules. 
In addition, Belectric has built a 33/220 kV substation for electricity transmission within the boundaries of the solar farm.
Jitendra Singh, chief executive officer and managing director of Belectric Photovoltaic India, added, “With the successful delivery of this project, Belectric India crossed the milestone of 1 GWp of installed capacity in India. Belectric continues to maintain the highest standard of health and safety guidelines and we are looking forward to many years of safe operations of the solar farm in Rajasthan.”
Belectric is one of the world’s leading EPC service providers with almost 4 GW of capacity built worldwide. Its Indian subsidiary, Belectric Photovoltaic India, has been involved in solar projects in the country with an installed capacity of more than 1.2 GWp.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/03/analyzing-the-opportunity-for-perovskite-solar-module-production-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 3, 2021",Analyzing the opportunity for perovskite solar module production in India,"From pv magazine International
Perovskite solar cells have long held the promise for high efficiency and low production costs. And as scientists make real progress solving their well-documented challenges with long-term stability, the industry is beginning to picture what large-scale production of this technology could actually look like – either integrated into silicon cell manufacturing as a tandem device, or as a standalone perovskite solar cell.
In India, meanwhile, recent investments point to big plans for a major solar manufacturing hub that will rely on many of the latest technologies. A group of scientists led by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, put these two together to conduct a techno-economic analysis of the opportunity to manufacture perovskite solar cells in their region of the country.
The group carried out the analysis based on a 100 MW production line, manufacturing perovskite solar modules utilizing a carbon-based electrode. This approach is less often seen in research devices, which commonly rely on metal electrodes. IIT states that while carbon electrodes typically achieve lower module efficiency, they can be produced at a lower cost and show an advantage in terms of stability.
Results of the analysis are published in the paper Costing Analysis of Scalable Carbon-Based Perovskite Modules Using Bottom Up Technique, published in Global Challenges. The group calculated two different manufacturing processes – low-temperature and high-temperature processing.
The group finds that for the high-temperature processing route (module A), a manufacturing cost of $0.2106/W could be achieved, and the low-temperature route (module B) could go as low as $0.1548/W. The calculations are based on module efficiencies of 12.77% and 13.57, respectively, which the group says represents 75% of the highest reported lab efficiencies for each technology.
In terms of the final cost of energy, they present calculations for various product lifetimes between 10 and 25 years and taking into account performance degradation rates similar to those assumed for today’s silicon PV technologies, finding that module A could reach a levelized cost of electricity between $US$ 0.034 and 0.016 kWh, while module B could go as low as $0.030 and $0.014 kWh.
That these figures are already competitive with silicon PV production, comparing a theorized 100 MW production line with the several hundred gigawatts of silicon manufacturing and associated economies of scale already in operation, shows the potential for perovskites to achieve low manufacturing costs.
The group at IIT, however, notes that there are still several issues in perovskite production that will need to be ironed out for its techno-economic analysis to become a reality, and that changing material costs would also dramatically affect its modeling. “…economies of scale will help to bring the costs down,” they conclude. “The techno-economic framework helps researchers assess the feasibility of similar emerging technologies or this technology with the updated process, efficiency, stability and raw material prices in the future.”
