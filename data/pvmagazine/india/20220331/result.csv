This information was shared by the Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, in the lower house of the Parliament (Lok Sabha).
To accelerate the e-mobility transition in the country, the Ministry of Power has issued revised consolidated guidelines and standards for the EV charging infrastructure.
A total of 2,877 public EV charging stations have been sanctioned in 68 cities under the second phase of the Scheme for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India Phase II) of the Ministry of Heavy Industries.
Action plans have been prepared by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for eight cities with a four million-plus population (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Surat, and Pune). Under these action plans, scenario-wise targets have been prepared for business-as-usual (BAU), moderate and aggressive scenarios for installing chargers in these cities.
The Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) invited proposals to build and operate public EV charging infrastructure on expressways and national highways under FAME India Scheme Phase-II. The auction saw Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), in consortium with Convergence Energy Services Ltd (a subsidiary of EESL), securing the work to set up EV charging stations along 16 national highways and expressways. The National Highways Authority of India has agreed to provide space/land near toll plazas and its buildings for the installation of EV charging stations by EESL, based on revenue sharing model.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/31/fire-incidents-highlight-burning-issues-in-indias-ev-ecosystem/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,GEOPOLITICS,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION CELLS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,INDIA",,"MARCH 31, 2022",Fire incidents highlight ‘burning’ issues in India’s EV ecosystem,"Over the last few years, India has witnessed a substantial growth in EV adoption especially in the two-wheelers and three-wheeler segment. While the country’s rapid growth is promising, there are certain challenges the sector is facing which can backfire in the long run.
We have already witnessed two accidents of EV bikes catching fire, one recently being in Pune. The Electric S1 Pro Scooter was seen to emit thick smoke supposedly from its floorboard and under seat storage eventually burning up in flames.
Such incidents bring to light the substandard battery quality or the lack of knowledge about batteries or usage of extremely high energy density batteries. It is mandatory to ensure premium quality batteries are used to avoid such instances. Also ensuring the vehicle stays cool is extremely important as the incident could have possibly been a case of battery cell rupture due to excessive rise in temperature. Thermal Runway is of paramount importance in battery design.
To avoid such accidents, certain measures must be kept in mind. One being the Government’s intervention in ensuring premium quality batteries are manufactured and supplied, effective implementation of battery swapping policy, educating the masses about the hazards of opting for cheap batteries and awareness pertaining to safety and operating guidelines.
Batteries account for almost 50% of the EV cost and with the recent tension between Russia and Ukraine, pricing of batteries have exponentially shot up. India is heavily dependent on import of raw materials like nickel, cobalt and lithium which are needed for battery cells.
Over the period of last few months, nickel prices have increased 25.30 percent monthly while surge in cobalt has been 11.88 percent in a month as Russia is the second largest exporter of Cobalt. This has increased the overall EV pricing to almost 25-30 percent in a month.
In addition to the geopolitical crisis, surge in covid cases in China have also had a major hit on imports as most components are imported from there. The Government must put in place favourable policies to support the indigenous manufacturers and suppliers to increase EV battery availability at competitive prices.
And although we may have just about commenced our run in the EV race, it is critical that we jump-start the pace of adoption by enhancing the overall perception of EVs from a safety and longevity standpoint.
Neuron Energy is a bootstrapped startup establishing itself in the battery manufacturing segment supplying lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries to the EV sector in India.

Researchers from Paderborn University in Germany have developed a model to deploy residential rooftop PV in combination with batteries for short-term storage and hydrogen for long-term storage.
“The system design has modeled on a residential building but it can also be used for other buildings if the load curves for electricity and heating are known,” researcher Stefan Krauter told pv magazine.”It can provide autonomy for electricity over the whole year.”
The decentralized energy system is designed to cover a household’s main power demand via photovoltaics, even during winter, by including sufficient storage capacity.
“The aim is to minimize the grid load by achieving low or even zero grid interaction, which is realized by the use of decentralized long-term energy storage,” the scientists explained.
The system utilizes a 6.8kW PV array and a 5kW electrolyzer powered by surplus solar power to produce hydrogen, which is then stored in a hydrogen tank via a compressor. In periods of high energy demand, when PV generation is not sufficient, the green fuel is used to produce electricity via a 1.24kW fuel cell system. Lithium-ion batteries are part of the proposed system configuration in order to react to too rapid load changes, which the hydrogen system would not be able to handle.
The heat waste generated by the fuel cell and the electrolyzer is transferred via heat exchangers to a hot water tank, which supplies hot water to the household. The remaining demand is covered by a heat pump.
The academics tried to identify the kind and size of components required under different scenarios. They also aimed to assess the conditions under which a system could compete with conventional power systems in terms of price and costs. The model was simulated in Simulink (MATLAB) to analyze when and how the PV system is fully able to cover the energy needs of a household.
The scientists also used HOMER software, which was developed by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in order to verify the results. Measurements were taken with a  time resolution of 15 minutes and a total time frame of one year.
The German group estimated that the electrolyzer used 4283.55kWh of surplus solar power to produce 80.50 kg of hydrogen in one year, while the fuel cell was able to return 1009.86kWh energy by burning 73.52 kg of hydrogen.
“The compression of hydrogen required a yearly energy demand of 268.14kWh, while the heating demand was 1208.66kWh,” the scientists explained. “The heating demand was reduced by 643.69kWh by using the waste heat produced within the electrolyzer and the fuel cell.”
They said their simulation via Simulink showed that household heating demand expands the required amount of decentralized stored hydrogen when aiming for energy-independent operations.
“Future research has to focus on optimizing the control system and on analyzing which component dimensioning under which scenarios is preferable in terms of energy and resource efficiency and in terms of lifetime increase,” they said.
The scientists described the system design in “Hybrid Energy System Model in Matlab/Simulink Based on Solar Energy, Lithium-Ion Battery and Hydrogen,” which was recently published in Energies.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/31/sunpower-launches-whole-home-backup-solution/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MARCH 31, 2022",SunPower launches whole-home backup solution,"From pv magazine Global
SunPower has announced an expansion to its residential battery storage system, SunVault Storage, in the form of 26 kWh and 52 kWh configurations, allowing the system to provide customers with backup power for every device in their homes in the event of an outage.
According to SunPower, the reasons behind the launch were twofold. According to the company’s 2021 Energy Sense Index, 40% of homeowners worry about outages every month. For customers in natural disaster-prone regions or California customers living in areas subject to frequent blackouts, these concerns often become reality, for a few hours or even days at a time. The company also cites EIA data outlining that the length of time an average American goes without electricity has doubled between 2013 and 2020.
“As power disruptions are becoming more commonplace, the demand for energy resilience and reliability is higher than ever,” said Nate Coleman, chief products officer at SunPower. “With the new SunVault, we are going beyond just the essentials. Customers can have the peace of mind that even if their grid service is disrupted, their lives don’t have to be.”
Under both battery configurations, the SunVault system can keep indispensable appliances running, like refrigeration and HVAC, while also allowing customers to keep power to non-essential, comfort appliances, like a pool pump, EV charger, or really anything in the home that runs on electricity.
Alongside the launch of the new battery configurations, SunPower also announced a new warranty for SunVault systems. All SunVault energy storage systems will come backed by a 10-year warranty, including 70% usable energy retention.
According to SunPower, installations of the new SunVault will begin in June 2022.
