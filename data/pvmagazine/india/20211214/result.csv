The capacity is part of a manufacturing-linked solar tender of 8 GW awarded to AGEL by SECI in June 2020, which set a record for being the world’s largest solar development tender ever awarded.
With this, AGEL has signed PPAs with SECI for a total generation capacity of close to 6 GW (4,667 MW plus 867 MW=5,534 MW) of the 8 GW awarded in 2020. AGEL expects to close the balance of 2 GW PPA in the next two to three months. 
AGEL had been awarded a PPA capacity of 8 GW solar power generation projects linked with the setting up of 2 GW solar PV manufacturing capacity.
AGEL, through its subsidiaries, has already signed PPAs for 867 MW at the tariff of INR 2.54 per unit for a period of 25 years. Further, contract agreements have been signed with the SECI for setting up of solar PV manufacturing plants for a total capacity of 2 GW. This will help AGEL move swiftly towards its target of 25 GW operational capacity by 2025.
“We are pleased to have signed the world’s largest PPA with SECI,” said Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group. “This is yet another step in our journey to enable India’s dual objective to accelerate India’s renewable energy footprint as well as promote domestic manufacturing under the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) programme. Following the proceedings at COP 26, it is increasingly evident that the world has to equitably transition to a low carbon economy faster than previously anticipated. This is why the Adani Group has committed US$50-$70 billion of investment in the renewables space. This agreement keeps us well on track to our commitment to become the world’s largest renewables player by 2030.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/14/recyclable-back-contact-solar-panel-from-the-netherlands/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RECYCLING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 14, 2021","Recyclable, back-contact solar panel from the Netherlands","From pv magazine International
Researchers from the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) are developing a full-size, recyclable, back-contact solar module which they claim enables Design for Recycling (D4R) without compromising the module life cycle.
The concept of D4R is a design principle that takes into account the recyclability of a product, including end-of-life considerations, at an early life cycle stage. “A D4R approach can exchange the present, rudimentary and detrimental panel shredding technique [with] sophisticated dismantling,” the scientists explained. “Key technology of the D4R approach, is a novel encapsulant with an integrated trigger mechanism for material separation at end of life.”
The encapsulant consists of adhesive foil that can be embedded in the solar cells in a photovoltaic panel. The module is being developed with the support of Dutch backsheet provider Endurans Solar, Netherlands-based brazing and soldering technology provider Mat-Tech, and Dutch module manufacturer Exasun, under the umbrella of the Parsec project.
“It would not necessarily add costs as it can be used in combination with standard factory lamination for the production of PV panels,” TNO researcher Martin Späth, told pv magazine.
Endurance created two different encapsulants for the panel– one for the front of the module. which joins the glass and cells together; and a slightly different formulation for the back of the module, which attaches cells and backsheet together. “The key point is that our encapsulant is a unique adhesive film based on hot-melt technology that enables the individual materials of the module to be separated and retrieved at high purity,” the company explained.
The back-contact technology was chosen for the module, the scientists explained, as it embeds the cell interconnection, as well as most of the bussing and wiring, in a single layer on the panel back side between the encapsulant and the backsheet. In conventional PERC monocrystalline panels, by contrast, cell interconnections are intertwined when connecting front to back side.
The first prototypes will be analyzed in a testing field in Amsterdam. “Ultimately, the new encapsulation must be demonstrated to work seamlessly with the standard lamination process used for all solar modules,” said Endurans, in its own statement. “Once this is achieved, the Parsec-developed recycling technology is well placed to become the industry standard, not only in back-contact technology but for all PV modules.”
*The article was amended on December 10 to reflect that the backsheet provider is Endurans Solar and not DSM, as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/14/storing-solar-power-with-compressed-carbon-dioxide/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 14, 2021",Storing solar power with compressed carbon dioxide,"From pv magazine International
Italy-based Energy Dome has developed a modular, scalable system for utility-scale, long-term electricity storage based on compressed CO2. It claims that the system is a non-site-dependent solution for storing wind and solar power, as well as grid electricity.
“The concept is the same as compressed air energy storage (CAES) and liquid air technologies” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told pv magazine. “With the difference, however, that storing CO2 can be done by occupying less space than with compressed air and without the need for finding a cavern or implementing underground works.”
The reduced volume at ambient temperature, which is required by the technology on the high-pressure side of the system, is the “secret sauce” for the CO2 battery’s competitive costs and high performance, according to its creators. These main features depend on the fact that CO2 becomes liquid with ambient temperature and pressure of only 70 bars.
“Unlike CAES and liquid air technologies, our storage concept is non-site dependent and can be applied almost anywhere without having to deal with extreme cryogenic temperatures,” said Spadacini.
The system draws CO2 from an inflatable atmospheric gas holder, which the company named Dome, and stores it under a 70 bar pressure at ambient temperature in a high-density liquid state. When the stored energy is needed, the CO2 is evaporated and conveyed through a turbine that produces power. After this process is implemented, the CO2 goes back to the atmospheric gas holder to be used again for another storage cycle, without any emissions to the atmosphere.
“It is a closed-loop cycle and no CO2 is released in the atmosphere,” Spadacini said. “The system, on the other hand, doesn’t need too much CO2 to work, I would say a few hundred tons would be enough for about 100 MWh of electricity.”
One of the Energy Dome’s main advantages, he said, is that this technology uses off-the-shelf components. There is no need for a new factory to be put up and running in order to have a plant built, nor extensive testing time of new turbomachinery or new chemical reactions.
The system’s optimal charge/discharge cycle should range from four to 24 hours which, according to the company, makes it perfectly suitable for daily and intra-day cycling when used for energy storage by grid operators and utilities. Its round-trip efficiency can reach up to 80%. The system modular design enables the construction of facilities with a storage capacity of up to 200 MWh.
“We expect a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of our technology already below $100/MWh with the first commercial plant we are going to build. With wider deployment of our technology, we are aiming to drop the LCOS below $60/MWh in a few years’ time,” Spadacini said.
Energy Dome has recently raised $11 million through a Series A funding round and intends to use the proceeds for its first 2 MW/4 MWh pilot project in Sardinia, which it is developing in partnership with Italian utility A2A.
“This project will be tested for grid electricity storage in the first quarter of next year,” Spadacini explained. “But our technology is also intended for the storage of power generated by large-scale wind and solar plants.”
The company is targeting markets such as North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India and Australia.
“Our technology allows for worldwide deployment of competitive energy storage plants without any geographical limitations,” concluded Spadacini.
