The Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for polysilicon manufactured outside China, plunged for the first time in three weeks in its latest price assessment on May 30 to $32.171/kg following increased market activity brought on by the 16th International Solar Photovoltaics and Smart Energy Conference and Exhibition (SNEC) in Shanghai. The major solar event, saw solar players cut deals and report prices far below prior highs.
The 7.25% decline is the largest percentage drop in GPM so far this year. Most sources, who were contacted at SNEC or in OPIS’ market survey after, put ex-China polysilicon prices at or below the psychologically significant level of $30/kg. A tier-one module maker has agreed to buy polysilicon at $29/kg from a global producer, according to multiple sources.
Another global producer concurred that prices were in this range, but also indicated that it did not make any transactions at SNEC and planned to cut its deals afterward.

China’s polysilicon prices, assessed as China Mono Grade by OPIS, continued their resolute march downwards following the SNEC as well. Domestic prices hit their lowest level in four months at 126.67 CNY ($17.7)/kg this week. Market chatter that the already-brisk rate at which domestic prices have been falling would steepen rapidly following the SNEC proved unfounded. China Mono Grade’s approximately 8% drop this week was comparable to the previous week’s roughly 7% drop.
Polysilicon prices in China are expected to drop below 100 CNY/kg very soon, with OPIS anticipating the critical number will be reached as soon as next month. With discussions of this number swirling aggressively at and since SNEC, one source summarized the discourse aptly, saying “Nothing is expected to stop the slide of Chinese poly below 100.”

The two companies signed the deal during the SNEC PV Power Expo 2023 recently held in Shanghai. 
Jinchen has been a supplier to Waaree since 2017 and has signed deals and delivered for 10 GW of Waaree manufacturing capacity. The latest 10 GW agreement with Waaree is Jinchen’s biggest overseas deal ever. 
Waaree is India’s largest solar module manufacturer, with a 12 GW per year production capacity. The company currently exports its products to over 20 countries worldwide. The collaboration with Jinchen brings Waaree closer to building a 20 GW manufacturing capacity.
According to a forecast by India’s Central Electricity Authority (CEA), India will install 292.6 GW of PV systems by fiscal year 2029-30. With the support and incentives provided by the government’s new energy policy, the Indian PV industry has a bright future, with competition within the market increasing by the day. This collaboration between Waaree and Jinchen will bolster the rapid development of India’s domestic PV industry and local manufacturing capacity, stated Jinchen.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/02/global-electronics-council-releases-new-standard-for-ultra-low-carbon-pv-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 2, 2023",Global Electronics Council releases new standard for ultra-low carbon PV panels,"From pv magazine USA
The Global Electronics Council (GEC) has unveiled the “Criteria for the Assessment of Ultra-Low Carbon Modules.” This set of criteria aims to “establish a framework, standardized methodology, and performance objectives to incentivize manufacturers and suppliers to design and manufacture low embodied carbon photovoltaic (PV) modules.”
The GEC developed two levels of emissions standards: low carbon and ultra-low carbon (ULCS). To meet the low carbon standard, a solar module, including its frame, must have an embodied carbon footprint equal to or less than 630 kg CO2e/kWp. To meet the ULCS standard, a module’s footprint must be at or below 400 kg CO2e/kWp.
In their analysis, GEC created charts estimating the carbon intensity of power grids in various countries involved in solar panel production. They then calculated a “Global Warming Potential” (GWP) coefficient for each solar panel subcomponent.
By adding up the GWP values for all subcomponents, they calculate the total CO2 emissions during solar panel and subcomponent construction. Finally, they divide the total emissions by the wattage of the solar panel (kWp) to determine whether it meets the 630 & 400 kg CO2e/kWp thresholds for certification.
To confirm the inputs for each solar panel and obtain certification from the GEC, independent third-party inspectors must verify the inputs. Much of the GEC’s documentation covers the third-party verification process.
The developer Lightsource BP commented on the standard, stating, “Reducing the embodied carbon in solar farm equipment can bring the emissions payback period for solar assets from 1-3 years, depending on local energy mix, to under 1 year in many locations, accelerating the positive impact that solar energy development has on climate change.”
Stakeholder organizations involved in this initiative include First Solar, Hanwha Q Cells, Hemlock Semiconductor, NREL, NorSun, REC Solar Norway Fraunhofer, Meyer Burger, and Wacker Chemie.

The developer said the funding would enable it to pursue its growth plans of becoming a >5 GW platform over the next three to four years. 
The funding is a mix of primary and secondary.
Brookfield Renewable made the investment through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund and will have a controlling stake in CleanMax with the investment. It will work with existing shareholders and management to drive the platform’s growth in India’s commercial and industrial (C&I) segment. 
Kuldeep Jain, founder and MD of CleanMax, said, “This will see us have adequate growth capital for at least the next 3-4 years. With a large capital pool available from Brookfield, the company expects to maintain its market leadership in C&I and to be able to add about 800-1000 MW annually to its C&I portfolio.” 
Along with active participation from Brookfield, CleanMax is also looking to explore additional growth avenues in the corporate renewable energy space and to assess and pursue other drivers for value creation. 
CleanMax offsets 2.5 million tons of CO2 equivalent per annum through 1.6 GW of clean energy generation capacity, including on books and third-party CAPEX sales capacities. It helps power sustainability for 350+ clients through 3076 GWh clean energy generation, sufficient to power 855,000 households.
