https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/29/financial-feasibility-of-behind-the-meter-solar-plus-storage-in-india/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA,TAMIL NADU",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 29, 2021",Financial feasibility of behind-the-meter solar-plus-storage in India,"Energy storage systems will become a financially attractive option for most residential and commercial consumer categories in India as battery prices drop steeply over the coming years, according to a new report by Auroville Consulting.
Commercial users will start seeing solar-plus-energy storage (sized to store 30% of generated solar energy) becoming financially viable to reduce their electricity bills as early as 2023 for all battery types (lithium-ion, lead-acid, advanced lead-acid). And, by 2025, even sizing the battery to store up to 50% of generated solar energy becomes viable. 
In the case of high-paying residential consumers, the financial viability of the solar-plus-storage for the case of 30% solar energy flowing through the battery is delayed by four years, i.e., 2027. And for energy storage sized to store 50% solar, the solar-plus-storage system will not reach grid parity until 2030.
The study also finds that throughout the analysis period up to 2030, advanced lead-acid will continue to compete with Lithium-ion technology and will be comparable in cost. Notwithstanding lesser space requirement and weight of Li-ion battery energy storage systems (BESS), both technologies will remain in play in the future for behind-the-meter application for electricity bill management.
Currently, the levelized cost of solar-plus-energy storage hasn’t reached grid parity in any of the user cases, considering the battery is sized so that at least 30% of solar energy flows through it. For Li-ion BESS and the case of 30% solar PV generation stored in the battery, the average levelized costs of solar plus energy storage for residential, small non-residential, and large non-residential users are INR 13.04/kWh, INR 11.49/kWh, and INR 11.48/kWh, respectively. The corresponding values for advanced lead-acid BESS are INR 12.17/ kWh, INR 10.87/kWh, and INR 10.97/kWh. Hence solar plus energy storage is not a financially attractive option yet for an electricity bill reduction.
However, the Auroville report finds that energy storage will dominate the coming decade as their costs decline, just as the previous decade saw solar PV recording big growth. 
The authors computed the levelized cost of solar-plus-energy storage in Tamil Nadu over the next ten years. They adopted a bottom-up approach to analyze the capital costs for standalone energy storage and solar. BESS technologies considered were Li-ion, lead-acid and advanced lead-acid. The cost reduction for each capital cost component of the PV system as well as BESS was taken into consideration for future projection of levelized cost.
Three use-cases were considered: Residential, small non-residential, and large non-residential. BESS capacity assumptions for the three cases were 4 kWh/1–2 kW for residential, 48 kWh/12–24 kW small non-residential, and 96 kWh/24–48 kW large non-residential.
The levelized cost projections of solar-plus-energy storage were compared with the existing retail electricity tariffs in Tamil Nadu. The levelized cost for residential users is compared with the domestic (LT 1-A) retail energy tariff of INR 6.60/kWh, and that of non-residential (commercial) user cases was compared with the LT commercial retail energy tariff of INR 8.05/kWh. These tariffs are assumed to increase at 4% every year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/29/arc-shaped-pv-system-for-agrivoltaics-from-germany/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 29, 2021",Arc-shaped PV system for agrivoltaics from Germany,"From pv magazine International
German EPC contractor Goldbeck Solar has developed an arc-shaped PV system for applications in agrivoltaic projects.
Called MarcS, the system was developed in partnership with German mounting structure provider PMT and is said to enable more effective land use, increased profitability, and more efficient use of resources.
The arches have been designed to slide on the side rails so that the positions of the solar modules can be flexibly adjusted and the arable land underneath can either be exposed to, or protected from, the sun, depending on the farmer’s need. At the same time, the solar modules offer animals and plants protection from extreme weather conditions such as hail, drought, or excessive sunlight. Furthermore, temperature, humidity, and light can be controlled and the quality of breeding and harvest can be optimized.
The assembly of the solar arches can be automated or at least semi-automated. It consists of rows of solar modules that are arched at a height of 2.50 to 3.50 meters. The arrangement connects the modules with the substructure to form a fixed static part that can span up to nine meters, according to Goldbeck Solar.
The modules are aligned with an east-west orientation with different angles of inclination, which increases the yield. The company estimated the additional yield at up to 30% compared to conventional ground-mounted systems and up to 60% compared to other agrivoltaic systems. It added that this technology can enable more than 2 MW of photovoltaic output per hectare.
From 2022, Goldbeck Solar intends to offer the “MarcS” mounting system in the Netherlands. A 45 MW pilot PV project is also currently being planned.

The modules are India’s first to reach 21% efficiency, and allow outputs ranging from 450W to 600W.
The Helia series PV modules will be available in both mono-facial and bifacial categories. The bifacial category offers an additional power gain of up to 15% from the rear side of the modules due to the use of a transparent backsheet.
The modules are equipped with multi-busbar technology and high-density interconnections, offering significantly better output at higher temperatures and under low-light/shading conditions.
The PV modules are designed with excellent anti-potential induced degradation (PID) characteristics and can perform at their peak even in the most challenging of environments. These are covered by 25 years of performance warranty and 12 years of product workmanship warranty.
“The Helia range of PV modules are also cost-effective and will positively impact return on investment (ROI) of a solar plant by reducing the requirement of land/rooftop space. This subsequently translates into a significant reduction in levelized cost of energy (LCOE), balance-of-system (BoS) costs, civil work costs and operation and maintenance costs,” according to Jakson.
