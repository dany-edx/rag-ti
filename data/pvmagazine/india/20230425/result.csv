The modules are built with made-in-India cells and are therefore eligible for government projects and schemes mandating domestic content requirement (DCR). These are available in monofacial and bifacial variants, with a power output ranging from 520 Wp to 550 Wp, and are ideal for residential and government projects.
Hardip Singh, president & global head of sales & marketing at Goldi Solar, said, “[These] DCR modules are designed to provide optimal performance and efficiency in various environments, making them a reliable and affordable choice for customers in the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana regions…we have stock available for immediate delivery.”
Founded in 2011, Goldi Solar has a cumulative module manufacturing capacity of 2.5 GW at Pipodara and Navsari in Gujarat.

Its revenue from power trading crossed INR 10,000 crore (around $1.2 billion) mark for the first time since its inception.
To date, SECI has awarded renewable energy (RE) project capacities of over 56 GW. 
SECI is also active in setting up projects through its investments as well as for other public-sector entities as Project Management Consultant (PMC). It has been assigned the highest credit rating of AAA by ICRA.

The open-access plant is located at Bangarmau in Unnao and is INOXAP’s largest investment in renewable energy.
The plant, built with an investment of INR 100 crore ($12.2 million), was commissioned by Sunsure Energy in a record time of nine months.
The solar power plant will supply over 31 million units of green power to INOXAP’s units in Uttar Pradesh, helping to offset 28,000 tonnes of CO2 every year, for the next 25 years.

The Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon produced outside of China, fell 1.33% week on week to a six-week low of $37.218/kg on April 18 (see chart). Market sentiment for the raw material turned more subdued in recent weeks, ahead of new capacity additions.
China’s new polysilicon manufacturers are expected to add a total of 150 GW of polysilicon output during the third and fourth quarter of the year, the impact of which industry players said would inevitably spill over into international markets. The price of mono-grade polysilicon in China has already fallen for eight consecutive weeks, reaching an 11-week low of CNY 189.93 ($27.58)/kg on April 18 (see chart), according to OPIS data.
 

Free On Board (FOB) China wafer prices, meanwhile, continued to largely trade sideways, with Mono M10 eking out a 0.12% on-week gain to $0.831/pc. G12 remained unchanged on-week at $1.041/pc on April 18.
Low inventories coupled with tightness in high-purity quartz (HPQ), which is used to make expendable crucibles critical to the wafer manufacturing process, have buffered the wafer sector against weakness in the upstream polysilicon market.
The recent arrival of HPQ imports in China should help to ease some of the manufacturing bottlenecks, but any resulting respite would be unevenly distributed, as most of the imports were bought by the few major wafer makers, sources have said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/25/german-startup-unveils-mobile-tiltable-pv-modules/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULE MOUNTING STRUCTURES,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"APRIL 25, 2023","German startup unveils mobile, tiltable PV modules","From pv magazine Global
Sinn Power, a German startup specializing in floating PV, has presented its new SKipp mobile, tiltable photovoltaic solution.
The new product does not have to be anchored in the ground and is therefore particularly suitable for deployment in nature reserves and water-protection areas, where no ground anchoring or piling is permitted.
According to Sinn Power, its solar modules remain upright even in strong winds. The modules can be tilted and feature a pendulum weight to ensure they return to their vertical position, even in windy conditions.
“Tipping over can be ruled out, even without anchoring the modules to the ground,” the manufacturer stated.
Systems using this product can use bifacial solar modules oriented vertically in an east-west direction. This boosts output, especially during morning and evening hours, compared to traditional southern-oriented photovoltaic systems. The system also produces more solar power in winter, like other vertical PV installations deployed at high latitudes.
“With SKipp, we have redesigned open ground-mounted and agrivoltaic systems,” explained Philipp Sinn, founder and managing director of the German company. “This photovoltaic solution meets the highest technical requirements and at the same time offers our customers maximum flexibility and optimal electricity yield in terms of location and duration of use.”
