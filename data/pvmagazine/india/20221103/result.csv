Due to the large consumer base and India’s push towards faster adoption of electric vehicles, the demand and supply of lithium-ion batteries are on an exponential rise. This provides a good opportunity for the urban mining industry.
Since India does not have any significant reserves of its own of rare metals like cobalt, lithium, and nickel, it becomes imperative to find alternative channels to ensure a consistent supply of these. 
One very obvious way is to collaborate with other nations. However, this is very risky and prone to unpredictable geopolitical changes beyond one’s control. 
The other safer method is to tap into the incoming supply of these metals in the form of lithium-ion batteries. Once it can be ensured that metals can be extracted from these batteries in a sustainable and clean manner, it could supplement the former supply sources as these metals are infinitely recyclable and do not offer any degradation as compared to freshly mined metals.
Recycling could help India address the challenge of raw material supply for lithium batteries but the sector needs a regulatory push. Are the existing regulations enough to enforce the onus on different stakeholders?
Even though there is a long road ahead, the new Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022 is a step in the right direction to boost the recycling/e-waste management sector and achieve a circular economy. 
The Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022 include a clear outline of the responsibilities of all the key stakeholders in the value chain of a lithium-ion battery, starting from its production to its usage to its collection and finally, proper disposal via sustainable recycling practices. 
The targets set for each of these, like the minimum percentage of recycled material to be used in new batteries by OEMs and the minimum material recovery rate by recyclers, would ensure that valuable resources such as cobalt, nickel, and lithium do not end up in the landfills along with the end-of-life lithium-ion batteries. 
This is important, especially for a country like ours, because of the unavailability of natural deposits of these rare metals resulting in our dependency on other nations for imports.
As for the recycling process itself, the costs involved seem to be a deterrent. Isn’t it?
Metastable Materials has developed a new chemical-free process called ‘Integrated Carbothermal Reduction’ (ICR) to ‘mine’ metals out of scrap lithium-ion batteries. The process, developed right here in India, practically reduces the cost of recycling by half as compared to other processes in the global market. The additional advantage of ICR is that it produces materials in their standard commodity forms. This ensures flexibility for our buyers to utilize the metals in whatever form they require. 
We have been able to design our technology to be scalable and sustainable in the long run. This would help in rapid expansion.
With our upcoming recycling unit capable of handling 4-6% of India’s total demand alone in its first six months of operations, we are hoping to off-load some of the dependence of India on other countries for the supply of rare metals like cobalt, lithium, and nickel. We are also simultaneously working on establishing cleaner supply chains and alleviating some of the anxiety that is related to the safe transportation of batteries, especially end-of-life ones.
How many stages does your Integrated Carbothermal Reduction process involve?
Integrated Carbothermal Reduction is a six-step process, the first three of which remove materials like copper, aluminum, and plastics, while the final three steps involve the processing of ‘black mass’ to generate high-quality lithium, cobalt, and nickel. 
The entire process is completely chemical-free and makes use of some very smart process and mechanical engineering breakthroughs by our R&D team to achieve more than 90% material recovery. It is designed to minimize waste and produce zero effluents. We have been able to achieve this by putting extra focus on designing our equipment in such a way that our entire process is sealed from end-to-end. So, nothing gets out of the system that is not meant to.
Our philosophy of ‘Waste as Ores’ is guided by the idea that we need to look at the problem of recycling from the lens of the mining industry, as if these batteries are freshly dug out of the ground, just like ores, and how one would go about extracting the required metals out of them. In essence, we are bringing in the actual practices of the mining industry to ‘Urban Mining’.
Can the Integrated Carbothermal Reduction process be used for all lithium battery chemistries? 
Integrated Carbothermal Reduction applies to most lithium-ion battery chemistries, although the process requires some adjustments on a case-to-case basis. We are currently working on optimizing the process to make it as chemistry- and form-factor-agnostic as possible.
How do you plan to collect the dead lithium batteries?
Since Integrated Carbothermal Reduction is chemistry- and form-factor-agnostic, Metastable has an all-hands approach to the collection and use of lithium-ion batteries. We are looking to procure battery packs from not only EV and stationary storage applications but also from consumer electronics systems. That is why we are in talks with several OEMs across industries to build together a supply chain network for the collection and safe transportation of riskier end-of-life batteries.

Redox flow batteries are one of the most attractive technologies for large-scale stationary storage applications due to their low capital cost, excellent safety, and environmental credentials. Their most unique feature is the independent scalability of energy and power. However, the latter is normally not possible in hybrid flow battery systems.
Now, researchers at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio, have come up with a concept for a slurry iron redox flow battery. It offers the potential for very low-cost, large-scale energy storage with safe and sustainable materials. By incorporating a conducting carbon slurry into the negative electrolyte of an all-iron flow battery, the researchers have ensured that the iron plating reaction occurs in such a way that makes the decoupling of power from energy possible for their hybrid flow battery system.
“Our iron slurry battery has advantages over the hybrid iron flow battery, where metal is plated into the electrochemical cell,” Nicholas Sinclair, research engineer at the CWRU Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, told pv magazine.
The slurry electrode allows for the plated metal to be directed into tanks for long-duration energy storage, Sinclair said. The hybrid system is limited in how much energy they can store by how much metal fits into the cell.
“In the slurry system, you can simply add more electrolyte and make the tanks bigger without changing the size of the electrochemical cell, which determines the power output,” Sinclair said.
The researchers described the scalability of the novel redox flow battery in “A perspective on the design and scale up of a novel redox flow battery” which was recently published in MRS Energy and Sustainability. They said that while the scaling of flow batteries is simple due to their modular nature, it becomes complicated when making large-scale increases in a single step. Nonetheless, their  proposed battery technology is now edging toward commercialization.
“The battery technology was developed under an ARPA-E program for several years. During that project the technology matured to a point where commercial scale units are now being designed and tested by a company who licensed the technology from us,” said Sinclair. “We have follow-on funding for developing the technology further and expanding it to other battery chemistries as well.”
While the final price tag of the novel battery could change when it is commercialized, cost estimates calculated under the ARPA-E project stand at around $50/kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/03/longi-launches-all-new-back-contact-module-promising-22-8-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 3, 2022","Longi launches all new back contact module, promising 22.8% efficiency","From pv magazine Global
Longi Solar has launched a brand new module series, and introduced a ‘hybrid passivated back contact’ cell technology. The new Hi-MO 6 series will initially run in four different formats primarily targeting rooftop and distributed generation projects, and includes products supplied with integrated module-level power electronics. The series will also be available in a range of colors suited to BIPV applications.
In solar manufacturing, 2022 has largely been defined by manufacturers either switching to heterojunction (HJT) technology, or upgrading their existing PERC capacity to produce tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells. By moving to produce back-contact technology, Longi is aiming at even higher efficiency, albeit with a less-established technology that’s still thought to have huge potential.
Datasheets for the new product range promise module efficiencies of up to 22.3%. Additionally, Longi expects to be able to achieve a maximum of 22.8% in manufacturing. And with its new cell technology, the company also expects to gain many of the advantages seen with TOPCon and HJT.
“Modules equipped with HPBC cell technology can generate a greater volume of energy under high-temperature and low-irradiation conditions, and also have superior power degradation performance,” the company stated. Longi added that its simulations show an average yield increase of up to 10% compared to PERC in typical installation scenarios.
With Hi-MO 6, Longi is sticking with the 182mm cell format that it introduced a few years back. The modules will be offered in 54, 60, 66 and 72 cell formats, with power ratings between 410 W and 575 W.
Alongside the new cell technology, Longi is introducing several other module innovations likely to appeal to customers in the rooftop/distributed segment. One module in the series named ‘Guardian’ is to be supplied with built in module-level power electronics, in the form of Longi’s smart optimizer. This allows for flexible system design, real time monitoring and optimization, and rapid shutdown capability – increasingly a requirement in many rooftop markets.
Another module in the series, marketed under the name ‘Artist’ will be available in various colors and highly customizable to suit building-integrated projects. Back-contact technology itself promises improved aesthetics, since the modules can be designed with minimal gaps between cells and no busbars, making for a smoother appearance.
The series is rounded out by two more products, the ‘Explorer’, which will be available with a black backsheet, and ‘Scientist’, which targets the highest possible efficiency.
All of the modules will be supplied with a 15-year product warranty and 25-year performance warranty, which specifies 0.4% annual degradation from year 2 to year 25, leaving the module with 88.9% of its initial performance after 25 years in operation.
Following today’s announcement, Longi expects to have the full Hi-MO 6 range in mass production before the end of 2022.
