https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/23/sungrow-to-supply-inverters-to-200-mw-bangladeshi-solar-project/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,BANGLADESH,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 23, 2021",Sungrow to supply inverters to ‘largest solar project in Bangladesh’,"Chinese inverter maker Sungrow has announced the signing of a contract with India-based Rays Power Infra to supply inverter solutions to the largest solar power plant in the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.
Sungrow shall provide its central inverter solution as well as comprehensive on-site and post-sale service to the 280 MW solar power plant, located in the Rangpur District, on the banks of the river Teesta.
A consortium comprising Rays Power Infra and Zetwerk Manufacturing Businesses has been tasked with the engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, and operation and maintenance of the solar plant, while Switzerland-based ABB Ltd has been awarded the switchyard and substation contract.
Extreme humidity is a major consideration affecting this plant’s efficient operation.
Sungrow, anticipating this challenge, shall provide its 1,500V, 3.125 MW central inverter, one of the most popular central inverters around the world. The 3.125MW central inverter is equipped with IP65 protection, and thus guarantees efficient and unimpaired power generation—even in river Teesta region of 90% humidity.
The solar plant will be connected to the grid in April 2022 and annually generate 395 GWh of clean electricity, offsetting 316 thousand tons of CO2.
“Sungrow now occupies about 65% market share in Bangladesh, and it also was recently rewarded the 2021 Bangladesh Solar Week Leadership Award. Sungrow has been cooperating with reliable partners like Rays Power Infra, and previous projects prove successful. This 280 MW contract further enhances the mutual partnership between the two companies, and opens broader prospect for future cooperation,” said Sunil Badesra, International Director, Sungrow.
At the recent COP26, Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced the nation’s commitment to having 2.3 GW of solar power capacity by 2030. The government also targets to generate 40% of the country’s total electricity by 2050 from renewables.

The influence of human activities on the planet has further warmed the land, ocean, and atmosphere. It further says that CO2 levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in two million years, sea-level rise is at its fastest in three thousand years, and arctic sea ice is at its lowest in at least 1000 years. 
The initiatives undertaken to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions are quite ambitious and will help in limiting global warming to 1.5°C or even 2°C above the pre-industrial levels. At the recently concluded (Conference of the Parties) COP 26, India pledged to increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and meet 50% of its overall energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. India would reduce its emissions intensity by close to 45% by 2030 as well as reduce one billion tonnes of carbon emissions by 2030.
The core objective of renewable energy deployment in India is to promote economic growth, enhance energy security, increase energy access, and reduce climate change. Sustainable development is possible by the use of clean energy and by ensuring access to affordable and reliable energy for every citizen.
India has emerged to become one of the world’s most attractive renewable energy markets, due to strong government backing and an improving economic position. To achieve sustainable growth and avert catastrophic climate change, the government will make a rapid shift to renewable energy technology. Customers are becoming aware of saving energy by the use of solar, wind, biomass, waste, and hydropower energies as it is evident that clean energy is affordable. 
India has set a target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. The target is distributed into 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from bio-power, and 5 GW from small hydropower. Investors have planned to create a total capacity of more than 270 GW viz., 191 GW by private corporations GW, 58 GW by foreign companies, 18 GW by private sectors contributed 18 GW, and Indian Railways contributed 5 GW. As per the recent predictions, solar and wind potential will be more than 750 GW and 410 GW by 2047.
For the first time in 2019, cumulative yearly sales of battery electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles surpassed the two million mark globally. The electric vehicle sector has progressed significantly, with automakers investing billions in everything from R&D to plant redesign to offer new electrified vehicles. 
Traditional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), new-entrant OEMs, captive financing institutions, and dealerships will all face substantial possibilities and problems as EVs expand in popularity in the years leading up to 2030.
EVs have two distinct traits that make them ideal candidates for future vehicle technology. For starters, they may be charged with electricity from low- or non-CO2-emitting sources, allowing for further decarbonization than vehicles that run on biofuels. Second, electric engines are far more efficient than internal combustion engines (ICEs) or other suggested technologies like compressed-air vehicles.
Another major area where many advancements are anticipated is energy storage. Batteries hold the key to weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels, and they will undoubtedly play a critical role in the future decades. Due to considerable R&D and enormous production increases in lithium-ion batteries over the last decade, costs have dropped by 80-85%, making not just energy storage but also electric cars financially viable.
According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, India’s total installed renewable energy capacity, excluding major hydropower, has surpassed 100 GW, accounting for around 26% of the total capacity. Renewable energy sources, including major hydropower, currently account for 150 GW, i.e., 40% of India’s total power generation capacity.
 Beyond the climate imperative and the drive from the Indian government, there is another reason driving green energy’s growing appeal. While most policymakers recognized the significance of transitioning to non-fossil-based power generation a decade ago, the status of technology at the time meant that large-scale solar or wind energy projects were economically unviable without government subsidies.
Massive global investments in renewables technology, such as improving PV module efficiency in solar, lowering the balance of plant costs, and improving wind turbine technology, particularly large rotor diameters and higher hub heights, have resulted in a significant reduction in the cost of green energy. 
While the cost of wind energy has decreased by 30-40%, the cost of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) has decreased by 47 percent. The greatest significant reduction in recent years has been in the cost of solar photovoltaic (SPV) electricity, which has been reduced by 82%.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), new renewable power production projects are currently less expensive than maintaining many existing coal facilities.
In its bid to promote the use of non-conventional sources of energy, MNRE has set a target of achieving 500 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030. The government is taking several efforts to boost the country’s renewable energy industry, including pushing private sector developers to use advanced technologies in renewable energy projects to get the most energy out of them. 
The majority of renewable energy projects in the country were being carried out by private sector developers selected through a transparent bidding procedure. The government has released standard bidding criteria to help distribution licensees get power at competitive prices in a cost-effective way. It also is assisting developers by authorizing up to 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) through the automatic method. 
Moreover, to meet the 175 GW target, Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges and losses for inter-state sale of solar and wind power are also waived for renewable projects commissioned by December 2022. Norms for the Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) have been set prescribed till 2022. Grid integration of utility-scale renewable energy capacity addition shall be aided by the development of Green Energy Corridors. 
The government has launched PM-KUSUM, solar rooftop phase II, 12,000 MW Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) scheme Phase II, among other initiatives for the better future of renewable energy in India.
With a growing economy, the demand for energy from the commercial and industrial sectors is going to increase. Setting up new power plants is inevitably dependent on the import of highly volatile fossil fuels. Thus, it is essential to cater to the energy demand through judicious utilization of abundant renewable energy resources, such as biomass, solar, hydropower, and wind energy. Apart from securing the energy supply, renewable resources will help India in mitigating climate change. Renewable energy can create many employment opportunities at all levels, especially in rural areas. With an emphasis on presenting the real picture of massive renewable energy potential, it would be possible to attract foreign investments to herald a Green Energy Revolution in India.

It also plans to apply for and participate in the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) battery Storage, issued by the Ministry of Heavy Industries.
With the evaluation of the next steps, the company shall be sharing more details on the above as it further develops its plans.
The company already has a state-of-the-art 1.5 GWh lithium battery assembly unit in Gujarat, set up in a joint venture (Nexcharge) with Swiss energy storage solutions company Leclanche. The plant is equipped with fully automated lithium-ion assembly lines for battery packs and modules. It has already started production and shall be offering energy solutions that are scalable and eco-friendly.
Batteries dominate the overall cost of electric vehicles (EVs). By expanding downstream to include lithium-ion cell manufacturing, India has the opportunity to lower battery costs and develop batteries suited to Indian conditions.
According to a CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) report, the battery pack contributes 35-50% of the overall EV cost. Breaking down the battery pack, lithium-ion cells form approximately 60% of that cost. The report said India could bring the cost of lithium-ion cells down by 25–30% through appropriate policy measures.
Commenting on the new development, Subir Chakraborty, managing director and chief executive officer, said, “We have now planned to setup a multi-gigawatt lithium-ion cell manufacturing plant and to participate in the Production-Linked Incentive Scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell manufacturing as proposed by Government of India. Cell manufacturing is an integral part of the Lithium-ion battery manufacturing chain, and we believe that the setting up of this plant will enable us to be more cost-competitive and better serve our esteemed customers.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/23/solar-bakery-as-a-containerized-solution/,"COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",CORNELIA LICHNER,"DECEMBER 23, 2021",Solar bakery as a containerized solution,"From pv magazine International
A new artisanal bakery could open in Senegal as early as the end of March, delivering fresh, tasty bread that is also produced CO2-neutrally with solar power.
The special thing about it: The bakery will be completely set up in a container and shipped to Senegal from Munich by the German start-up Solarbakery. The solar modules and the mounting system are then unpacked and installed on site. The equipment for the bakery and a carefully separated, insulated, and air-conditioned room will remain in the ship’s container, which is almost 14 meters long and 2.45 meters wide. A battery storage system is also embedded in the container and is intended to provide enough power for the early shift.
The idea for Solarbakery came from Simon Zimmermann, who, together with a partner, had already deployed a container bakery in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Through this business, the company achieved sales of US$128,000 in the first fiscal year, but the power supply of the bakeries was still being ensured by polluting and expensive diesel power generators
As a co-founder of Solarbakery, Zimmermann was able to win over Torsten Schreiber, who had been working with Africa Greentec on the solar electrification of African villages and is now responsible for converting the bakery container for photovoltaic operation. For this, the bakery is given a solar roof with 144 modules totaling 52 kW. The company’s third founder, Daniel Petruccelli, is a master baker. He changed the production process to that the majority of electricity consumption is incurred during the day, with the finished bread only briefly reheated in the dark before dawn. He also trains employees and works on new recipes.
Solarbakery is being financed by a crowdfunding campaign on the Conda platform. The target is €500,000, of which more than €300,000 have already been raised. While 17 days remain in the fundraising period, the campaign may be extended by two months if the goal is not achieved in the allotted time, Zimmermann said. The money will initially be used to deploy two bakeries. One is going directly to Senegal, where a production facility for further solar bakeries and Africa Greentec’s mobile power plants are expected to be built in Dakar, Zimmermann added. A second bakery will initially remain in Germany as a demonstration model to convince investors to invest in the company or directly in a solar bakery.
In the future, Solarbakery wants to utilize three different business models. First, there is the construction of its own bakeries, which are then operated by partners in Africa at their own locations. Second, containers are to be sold as turnkey solutions in which buyers operate a bakery under their own name. “Aid organizations, for example, come into question,” said Zimmermann. The third variant is a lease model in which local entrepreneurs rent a bakery without large upfront costs and use the proceeds to finance the monthly installments. “But that only works when the processes are sufficiently standardized for a franchise.”
Solarbakery offers crowdfunding investors an interest rate of 4.5 percent over seven years and a bonus interest if the business develops positively. In any case, the interest in the idea is huge, Zimmermann beamed.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/23/solar-for-railways/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"DECEMBER 23, 2021",Solar for railways,"From pv magazine International
Photovoltaic projects developed along railways to feed electricity directly into the traction current network are not new. German solar project developer Enerparc has built the first photovoltaic power plants in Northern Germany for this purpose. However, such projects are by no means a sure-fire success, as some technical and legal peculiarities have to be observed.
The German Center for Rail Transport Research (DZSF) at the German Federal Railway Authority has, therefore, tasked TÜV Rheinland to investigate the potential for such photovoltaic applications on and in the rail infrastructure through a 14-month research project. An interdisciplinary team of rail and solar specialists will investigate which photovoltaic applications are compatible with the rail infrastructure in order to feed solar power directly into the rail power network. In addition, it should be determined how much photovoltaics could increase the share of renewables in traction current.
“If it is possible to generate energy along the widely ramified traction current network and feed it in directly, thereby making better use of the existing infrastructure and reducing energy losses through repeated conversion and transport, the rail mode of transport could further improve its greenhouse gas balance,” explained Jürgen van der Weem, railway technology expert at TÜV Rheinland. There are various options for photovoltaics to be integrated into railways, such as in the trackbed or on noise barriers, he added. The particular challenge lies in feeding the generated solar power directly into the single-phase 15-kilovolt network.
TÜV Rheinland will implement the project in three directions. First, it wants to investigate the market potential for these projects, assess all technical aspects and components for direct feed into the traction current network and analyze existing projects.
In a second step, the German institute wants to determine the areas on and in the rail infrastructure in Germany that can be used for such applications, as well as the possible feed-in power and energy yields. For this purpose, it will rely on databases of German railway operator Deutsche Bahn as well as solar radiation maps. However, not only the direct feed into the traction current network will be considered, but also internal consumers in the railway sector that are close to the generation point.
In the third phase of the project, the TÜV Rheinland experts will establish the main requirement for PV projects connected to the railway traction network. In this context, they would be able to provide specific recommendations for the necessary adjustments to railway regulations for the integration of photovoltaic systems on and in the rail infrastructure, taking into account the direct feed-in. The project will also seek to highlight existing obstacles and restrictions and develop recommendations for their removal.
