Revenues from operations contracted to INR 153.60 crore from INR 195.54 crore in FY 2019-20, but the company was able to significantly moderate raw material and other costs.
The manufacturer, which has a 250 MW solar cell and 250 MW module capacity, earned INR 153.6-crore revenue from production and sales of 158 MW solar cells and 8 MW modules. 
Websol expects to further improve the financial performance for the year 2021-22 with increased capacity utilization. The company is sold out for its complete manufacture of solar cells for the coming months and is working towards producing 175 MW of solar cells and 135 MW of modules for FY 2021-22. 
“The improved performance of the company during the fourth quarter and the full year is a reflection of the sharp turnaround in operating realities of the renewable energy sector in India,” said SL Agarwal, managing director. “This improvement has been driven principally by a forward-looking government policy.”
“The company was able to widen cell manufacturing margins and moderate raw material costs as a percentage of revenues from 60.55% in the third quarter to 53.67% in the fourth quarter, strengthening its overall competitiveness.” 
Websol Energy Systems expects to capitalize on the solar sector’s growth prospects. India is probably the only country within the G-20 to have met its target in renewable energy accretion. The country has targeted to commission 175 GW of renewable energy capacity creation by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030. 
The trickle-down of this reality is being reflected in the prospects of Websol Energy Systems. The company is restructuring its existing 250 MW solar cell capacity to produce larger cell sizes and contemplating the commissioning of additional solar cell capacity incorporating cutting-edge technology in 18 months.

Scientists at the Central University of Jharkhand, in India, have simulated a methylammonium tin iodide perovskite solar cell optimized with a hole transport layer (HTL) made of copper (I) oxide (Cu2O) and an electron transport layer (ETL) based on titanium oxide (TiO2).
“We are now planning to fabricate the device in a laboratory,” research co-author Basudev Pradhan, told pv magazine. “The estimated cost of this type of perovskite-based solar panel could be 8-10 times cheaper, over the present silicon-based solar panels.” According to him, this type of solar cell can be easily manufactured by using roll-to-roll screen printing machines.
The lead-free perovskite solar cell has an n–i–p layout and is composed of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a TiO2 layer, a methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) perovskite film, a Cu2O hole transport layer (HTL), and a layer made of gold (Au).
The numerical simulations were made through the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film solar cells developed at the Department of Electronics and Information Systems (ELIS) of the University of Ghent, in Belgium.
The academics explained that the optimization of the ETL is key to achieving high efficiencies and they found that a thickness in the range of 40-60 nm, which is nearly equal to carrier diffusion length, is ideal. The diffusion length is the average distance that the excess carriers can cover before they recombine.
“We have optimized different properties like doping density [and] the thickness of active materials as well as [the] hole and electron transport layer (HTL and ETL) for the further improvement of … device performance,” the researchers said. “Moreover, it has been observed that the varying HTL thickness has minimal impact on the device operation and its performance, whereas the thicknesses of [the] ETL and absorber layers significantly impact the device parameters.”
The simulations showed, the scientists went on to say, that the proposed cell configuration has the potential to reach a power conversion efficiency of 27.43%, a short circuit current density of 25.97 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.203 V, and a fill factor of 87.79%.
The device is described in the paper Performance optimization of lead free-MASnI3 based solar cell with 27% efficiency by numerical simulation, published in Optical Materials.

In its latest quarterly report, India Solar Compass Q1 2021, the analyst projects India to add 1,350 MW of utility-scale solar in the April-May-June period of 2021, 43% less than its previous estimate 2,350 MW. 
The installation will likely recover in Q3, with capacity addition expected at 2,470 MW, it said.
According to the report, India added 2,105 MW of grid-connected solar power generation capacity in Q1 2021, about 33% up from the previous quarter.
New capacity addition included 1,735 MW utility-scale solar and 370 MW rooftop. With this, India reached a total installed PV capacity of 44,241 MW as of March 31, 2021. This includes 35,939 MW utility-scale, 7,162 MW rooftop and 1,140 MW off-grid solar. 
Total PV project capacity in pipeline stood at 52,392 MW as on March 31, 2021.
