Rajasthan, with 8,644 MW installed PV capacity, leads the nation’s solar march. It is followed by Karnataka (7,483 MW) and Gujarat (6,052 MW).
This information was shared by power minister RK Singh in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) recently.
The nation has a solar power potential of around 750 GWp, as assessed by The National Institute of Solar Energy based on the availability of land and solar radiation.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is working towards resolving land allotment and grid infrastructure challenges in the solar project implementation as the nation chases the 500 GW by 2030 goal of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, including solar energy.
The Ministry has introduced new modes for better implementation of the solar park scheme to solve the land allotment problem: Mode-5 in the Scheme allows central public sector undertakings to set up solar parks in their land or on third-party land. Mode 8 incentivizes the states for facilitation in the procurement of land.
This apart, the government has allowed waiver of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges for inter-state sale of solar and wind power from projects to be commissioned by June 30, 2025. A dedicated transmission system for renewable energy has been taken up under Green Energy Corridor Scheme, said the minister.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/10/indias-clean-power-target-will-double-electricity-supply-economically-if-low-cost-storage-is-deployed/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",India’s clean power target will double electricity supply economically if low-cost storage is deployed,"Dramatic cost reductions over the last decade in battery storage and wind and solar energy position India to leapfrog to a more sustainable system for delivering affordable and reliable power to serve near a doubling in electricity demand by 2030, according to a new study by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).
India, with a population of more than 1 billion people – and the world’s third-largest energy consuming country, owing to rapid industrialization and rising incomes – has set ambitious clean-energy targets to reduce pollution and battle climate change, all while meeting growing electricity demand. The country has committed to installing 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2022, up from 100 GW currently, and rising to 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity by 2030, per Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement at the recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.
Using state-of-the-art computer models and simulations, researchers examined a least-cost investment pathway to reliably meet India’s electricity demand through the year 2030 in the publication, “Least Cost Pathway for India’s Power System Investments.” The study demonstrates that if India achieves its target of installing 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity by 2030, it could reduce electricity costs by 8 to 10%, provided the renewable energy and battery storage prices continue to decline. From 2020 levels, the carbon emissions intensity of its electricity supply would reduce by 43 to 50% by 2030.
“We found that building such high levels of renewable energy would actually be economical for India, thanks to the cost reductions in clean technologies that have occurred much faster than anticipated,” said Berkeley Lab scientist and the study’s lead author, Nikit Abhyankar. “However, the key to achieving the lowest costs, while maintaining grid reliability, lies in complementing the renewable energy buildout with flexible resources such as energy storage and demand response, and utilizing the existing thermal power assets in the country in the most efficient manner.”
Berkeley Lab researchers found that by 2030, nearly 50% of India’s electricity supply could come from carbon-free sources compared to only 25% in 2020. This would require a near quadrupling in total renewable energy capacity over the decade. The researchers also found that complementing renewable energy buildout with flexible resources such as shifting agricultural electricity consumption to solar hours, using batteries to store four to six hours of daily energy for nighttime use, and utilizing flexibility in existing thermal power plants is cheaper than building new coal- or gas-based plants.
The study shows that by 2030 coal consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector can almost hold at 2020 levels. Transitioning to clean energy sources to meet electricity demands is therefore unlikely to lead to a loss of coal-mining and transportation-related jobs in the near to medium term, giving India time to plan for a longer-term transition.
“The cost of energy storage for grid-based applications is rapidly falling, making it a viable near-term option for scaling up renewables,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary Anna Shpitsberg for the Bureau of Energy Resources of the U.S. Department of State. “Along with adding renewable capacity, scaling battery storage and enhancing demand response capabilities are essential to India’s efforts to move along a low-carbon trajectory while meeting its demand growth reliably.”
In a complementary report, the research team emphasizes that an enabling policy and regulatory framework is critical for India to achieve this least-cost resource mix. Such a framework includes, among other things, enabling states to share resources with each other, integrating reliability and cost-effectiveness in electric utilities’ planning and procurement practices, widening and deepening the electricity markets, ensuring that energy storage is appropriately valued and compensated for, and coordinating between power and gas sector operations for efficient utilization of the existing gas pipelines and gas power generation assets.
Additional Berkeley Lab authors in this research include Shruti Deorah and Amol Phadke. The research was funded by the Department of State, Bureau of Energy Resources (ENR), under the Flexible Resources Initiative of the U.S.-India Clean Energy Finance Task Force. The initiative seeks to advance cost-effective strategies to assure that India’s power system has sufficient flexibility and robustness by incorporating a spectrum of flexible resources to integrate the large capacity of renewables coming online over the next decade.
ENR leads the Department of State’s efforts to develop and execute international energy policy to promote: energy security for the United States and its partners and allies; U.S. economic growth that benefits American business and people; and global political stability and prosperity through energy development.

In September, the United States Department of Energy released the Solar Futures Study which outlines how solar energy could produce 45% of the nation’s electricity by 2050.
In order to reach this target, the U.S. would need to deploy 1,570 GW of solar by that date. The target also hinges on the existence of a concerted policy effort, aggressive cost-reductions, extensive deployment of other clean technologies, and expansions of the transmission system, as well as large-scale electrification of end uses.

Research and development is vital to maintaining or, ideally, accelerating solar photovoltaic technology cost-reduction trajectories for continued industry growth. There is a particular opportunity for the U.S. to establish itself as a global leader and achieve national decarbonization goals by supporting domestic manufacturing of next generation solar cell technologies.
For several years, crystalline silicon solar cells have dominated the market and have become the industry standard against which all alternatives are compared. In 2019, about 83% of the total PV market in the United States was crystalline silicon-based products. Under the umbrella of crystalline silicon cells, monocrystalline p-type passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) undisputedly dominate the market.
PERC cells are expected to reach an efficiency plateau at around 24% in mass production. With mass production efficiency approaching 23%, PERC seems to be approaching its limits of possible efficiency and performance enhancements. PERC will continue to play a major role in PV deployment in the coming years as manufacturers attempt to close the gap between actual and maximum efficiency. But the race to overtake PERC is already well underway.
The successor to PERC is yet to be determined but it’s safe to say that it will be based on one of the high efficiency n-type-based cells that help overcome the limitations of p-type-based cells. Reports indicate that the market share for n-type cells could grow to 28% in 2028 from barely 5% in 2021.

One such limitation of the p-type cell is bifaciality, or the ratio of rear efficiency in relation to the front efficiency subject to the same irradiance. The introduction of bifacial technology has enabled higher energy generation from solar systems. The ease with which monofacial PERC cells can be converted to bifacial has contributed to the PERC’s dominance in the market.
But PERC’s bifaciality is limited to roughly 75%, while n-type cells can achieve more than 90% bifaciality depending on the cell structure.
Another limitation of the p-type cell is its high temperature coefficient, which reduces the performance of the modules when operating at higher temperatures. PERC cells have temperature coefficients of power in the range of 0.35%/oC to 0.40%/oC. N-type wafer-based cells inherently have lower temperature coefficients.
There are two main n-type cell technologies: Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contacts (TOPCon) and Heterojunction (HJT). Both technologies have the potential to exceed 25% efficiency in mass manufacturing, with HJT having the potential to go even further.
TOPCon cell manufacturing involves depositing a nanometer scale layer of silicon oxide, followed by a thicker polycrystalline silicon layer, between the silicon wafer and metal contacts. Because the cell architectures are so similar, TOPCon cells can be made by upgrading existing PERC mass production lines with relatively small equipment expense. This gives TOPCon an edge in terms of ease of manufacturing expansion over other n-type cell technologies.
That said, there are challenges in phosphorus doping of n-type wafers at large scale. Bifaciality of TOPCon cells is around 85% and temperature coefficient of power is typically in the range of 0.30%/oC to 0.35%/oC. TOPCon cell efficiency in mass production is expected to plateau at around 26%.
HJT cell manufacturing involves deposition of an amorphous layer of silicon on both the top and bottom of the wafer followed by transparent conducting oxide deposition and making of metal contacts. HJT cell manufacturing consists of significantly fewer steps than PERC or TOPCon.
However, HJT cell production lines are currently more expensive than TOPCon and have to be newly built. HJT cells also use more expensive metallization paste. HJT cells are by nature bifacial, with bifaciality rates above 90 percent, the highest of any cell technology. Temperature coefficient of power of HJT cells is in the range of 0.25%/oC to 0.30%/oC. Higher bifaciality and lower temperature coefficients result in higher energy output compared to TOPCon cells. HJT cells in mass production are expected to reach about 27%.
One of the most interesting developments in the solar industry is the research and development of tandem cells using HJT as the bottom cell. Laboratory efficiencies of 29% have been obtained using these cells, making HJT cells even more advantageous than TOPCon cells.
It is expected that many of the existing PERC lines will be converted to TOPCon lines over the coming years given the relatively lower cost of conversion and performance improvement over PERC. It is also expected that most brand new manufacturing capacity will use HJT technology given the many advantages outlined above.
 
As things stand, HJT cells are more expensive to produce than TOPCon cells. This explains the embrace of TOPCon technology by utility-scale solar developers, who are more sensitive to price increases. HJT technology has started to be more regularly adopted by residential and light commercial installers because they address property owners’ demands for enhanced aesthetics, higher durability and increased output.
While HJT modules may currently have a higher initial price tag, property owners are willing to pay for the superior performance and longer lifespan.
Remember the Solar Futures Study’s 2050 goal of 1,570 GW solar deployment? We are roughly at 110 GW in cumulative deployment, which is less than 1% of the needed deployment over the next three decades. The U.S. gave up solar innovation and manufacturing leadership more than a decade ago; the tariffs on foreign imports over this period did nothing to bring it back. The good news is, HJT cell (and module) development presents a tremendous opportunity for the U.S. to regain solar leadership.
HJT technology fills an existing innovation gap in the residential and commercial rooftop PV market, which today entirely consists of standard crystalline silicon modules. With additional policy support, HJT modules can provide the required cost reductions to drive continued growth beyond rooftops and into the utility scale segment.
For these reasons, the U.S. would benefit from scaling domestic manufacturing of HJT solar cells and modules. In doing so, the U.S. can reclaim leadership in solar cell technology and achieve ambitious decarbonization goals.
Policies like the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which was recently signed into law under the infrastructure bill, will help reduce the capital intensity of new manufacturing facilities to cost-effectively scale next generation PV cell technologies, boosting U.S. cleantech competitiveness.

The up-to-15-year lifespan of electric vehicle (EV) batteries – and their ability to gain a second life in stationary storage systems – is likely to mean a scramble among the world’s ever growing number of recycling companies in the years ahead.
A potential bidding war for the rest of the decade, in which Chinese recyclers are expected to hold all the cards, has been predicted by U.S.-owned analyst Wood Mackenzie which, in a note issued yesterday, again stressed the importance of North America and Europe establishing their own battery manufacturing supply chains.
With recyclers around the world announcing plans to ramp up their capacities “quite aggressively,” according to Verisk-owned WoodMac, a lack of end-of-life products is likely to see the industry starved of feedstock.
Though EV rates are rising rapidly, the long life of batteries is likely to cause “a scramble” among recyclers for products to work with. In such a scenario, recycling facilities based near battery manufacturing plants will have the upper hand, as Chinese recyclers currently do. At present, said WoodMac in a press release yesterday, “Chinese recyclers benefit from greater integration with nearby cathode production plants, so [they] can regularly bid much higher prices for used batteries than their Western counterparts.”
Unless North America and Europe establish their own EV battery supply chains, warned WoodMac, “China will remain the most appealing location for battery recycling.” If that happens, research analyst Max Reid said, only the biggest of new entrants into the battery recycling sector outside China are likely to survive long enough to reap the longer term rewards of the EV transition.
The expected scramble for dead batteries could at least drive more value into the products. Right now, it is cheaper and faster to manufacture new EV batteries than to recycle them and producers are focusing on ever cheaper raw materials.
The analyst said a new battery cathode plant, for example, can churn out 50 kilotons per year of materials for NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) batteries, enough to kit out 400,000 EVs. The typical battery recycling facility, however, only produces 5-10 kilotons per year – the equivalent of 30,000 devices.
With battery companies exploring new technology, such as solid-state devices, the recycling industry could be about to get even more complex, as WoodMac’s Reid pointed out when he said: “This decade will see the [new battery] supply chain further establish itself to be able to supply vast quantities of battery-grade chemicals and cathodes to cell manufacturers whilst recyclers will struggle with the large mass and complexity of EV packs.”
