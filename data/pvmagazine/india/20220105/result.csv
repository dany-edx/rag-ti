The plant at its Pump station-3 in Jorhat will generate green hydrogen using anion exchange membrane (AEM) technology.
The hydrogen so generated will be blended with natural gas using the existing infrastructure, said Pankaj Kumar Goswami, Director (Operations).
With this, Oil India has joined the list of state-owned oil and gas companies venturing to set up green hydrogen facilities in their decarbonization efforts.
Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), a State-owned oil and gas major with the largest number of refineries in India, has already launched an Expression of Interest to set up green hydrogen generation units at its Mathura (Uttar Pradesh) and Panipat (Haryana) refineries in India. The plants, to be on a ‘build-own-operate’ basis, will have installed capacities of 5,000 MT per annum and 2,000 MT per annum, respectively.
Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) is looking to buy a 10 MW electrolyzer to produce 4.5 tons of green hydrogen daily.
Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) is mulling a tender for a 20 MW electrolyzer to build the country’s largest green hydrogen plant.
According to a report by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), as of 2020, hydrogen demand in India was close to 6 million tonnes annually, with most of the demand coming from ammonia production and refineries.
Refineries use hydrogen in the de-sulfurization of crude oil to make petrol, diesel, etc. However, most hydrogen in India is produced using natural gas through steam methane (CH4) reforming and used in the refinery and fertilizer industries. The hydrogen so produced is termed ‘grey’ as the carbon byproduct leads to CO2 generation.
Green hydrogen is zero-carbon hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water (splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen) using renewable electricity.

This refinery will be set up at a cost of INR 2,200 crore. It will create about 1,000 direct and indirect jobs in the State. The proposed lithium refinery will produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide, a key component used in the production of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles.
“We have shortlisted Gujarat to set up our plant in the next 3-4 years. This plant will be set up near the port area, where we have already identified the land. We are in the process of getting all the clearances to set up the plant in the shortest possible time,” said Navjeet Singh Kalsi, managing director, Manikaran Lithium Private Limited.
The MoU signing follows a study by Manikaran Power Limited and its partner Australian project development company Neometals to evaluate the feasibility of a lithium hydroxide refinery located in India.
The high-quality spodumene concentrate will be sourced across the world and locally sourced reagents would be used to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide in India, Manikaran Power Limited mentions on its website.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/05/rystad-residential-solar-soars-past-ci-in-2021-globally/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JANUARY 5, 2022",Rystad: Residential solar soars past C&I in 2021 globally,"From pv magazine International
Residential PV achieved a 30% increase in installations in 2021, in a standout figure from Rystad Energy’s year-end summary. According to the analysis, solar installations on homes or small businesses grew from 18.9GW in 2020 to 25.2GW.
The result means that residential PV surpassed the C&I segment for the first time, which registered a decline to 19.9GW in 2021, from 20.6GW in 2020.
One reason for the shift is cost dynamics. With PV module prices having largely increased throughout 2021, as a result of a number of supply chain challenges, larger PV projects are more likely to be postponed or delayed, including those planned for C&I rooftops. The residential segment, by contrast, is more insulated from price increases, with labor and sales costs contributing a larger share of overall PV system cost for the end customer.
Rystad reports that PV module costs increased 57% in 2021, from US$0.21/Wp in 2020 to $0.33/Wp this year. Module material cost increases have been blamed for the increase, which was further compounded by high shipping costs.
The burgeoning Chinese residential rooftop segment, which had been long-awaited and arrived with gusto in 2021, is another driver of residential PV expansion. While not noted in the most-recent Rystad analysis, IHS Markit said that in the first seven months of 2021, China saw 7.66GW of residential rooftop installations – and expected 17GW to be installed throughout the year. Chinese homeowners and developers, in figures reported by IHS Markit analyst Holy Hu in October, installed a massive 1.8GW of rooftop PV in July alone.
Turning to the big end of town, Rystad found that the utility scale solar segment grew by 15% in 2021. Dampening growth has been some 20GW of PV power plant projects that were deferred or delayed in 2021.
“The renewable energy industry is facing some of its most significant challenges yet over the short term,” reported Rystad Energy’s Head of Renewables Research, Gero Farrugio, in a statement. “But the future has never looked brighter with new and aggressive commitments from governments and companies alike.” Farrugio said that carbon-neutral pledges made at the COP26 negotiations in November are likely to result in “major growth in the coming years.”
Across the renewable energy sector, offshore wind, utility scale battery storage, and hydrogen electrolyzer installations all saw growth in 2021. Large scale battery installations increased three-fold, and hydrogen electrolyzer capacity expanded from 0.04GW in 2020 to 0.08GW in 2021.

Rystad expects 270GW of renewable energy installations to be installed in 2022 – with solar and green hydrogen leading the way. This is despite ongoing PV module price hikes, with the analysts expecting prices to continue to increase to $0.41/Wp in Q3 2022. Rystad says that 50GW of utility scale projects could be threatened by such high prices, “as their economic feasibility dwindles.”
Renewable project transactions point to continued growth, notes Rystad, with 195GW of utility scale wind project transactions having been concluded as of November 2021. This contrasts to just 14.9GW in 2020. Leading greenfield developers for the year were BP and 7 X Energy, and Repsol and Hectate Energy.
Renewable energy’s arrival on the energy sector mainstage was also highlighted by Rystad, with notable acquisitions such as German developer and EPC ib vogt, by DIF Captial, and Italian developer Falck Renewables, which was snapped up by JP Morgan’s infrastructure investment fund.

Huaneng Power International (HPI) has completed the world’s largest floating PV project – a 320 MW facility in Dezhou, in China’s Shandong province.
It deployed the floating array on a reservoir near Huaneng Power’s 2.65 GW Dezhou thermal power station.
It built the solar plant in two phases with capacities of 200 MW and 120 MW, respectively. The first phase, which included the deployment of 8 MWh of storage capacity, was completed in 2020, while the second phase was finished between mid-September and the end of December. The facility is expected to generate around 550 million kWh of electricity per year, the company said, without disclosing additional technical details.

In mid-December, the company also commissioned a 130 MW solar plant in an intertidal zone near Yuhuan, Zhejiang province. It described the Qinggang Photovoltaic Power Station as China’s first intertidal PV project, with 242,000 solar modules deployed across an area spanning 1.2 million square meters.
The project is expected to produce around 150 million kWh per year. It will be resistant to typhoons and water corrosion, among other harsh environmental factors, said the company.
Huaneng Power also plans to build a 2 GW solar plant in Fengcheng, Jiangxi province. The experimental array will include floating PV, agrivoltaics and solar parks on fishponds. The first 320 MW unit will be completed this year, with the rest of the capacity to be installed by 2026.
