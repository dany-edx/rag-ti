The scheme, with an outlay of INR 18,100 crore (US$ 2459 million), will incentivize global and domestic companies to build a cumulative 50 GWh of advanced chemistry cell (ACC) and 5 GWh of ‘niche’ ACC production facilities in India.
The fiscal incentives are proposed under the umbrella initiative of National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage that aims to reduce India’s ACC import dependence.
While several companies have already started investing in battery packs in India, there is a negligible investment in ACC manufacturing and value addition. As a result, India has to meet all of its ACC demand through imports.
Globally, manufacturers are investing in ACC battery storage technologies at a commercial scale as the demand for such batteries is expected to boom through 2030 due to the robust growth in electric vehicles, advanced electricity grids, rooftop solar, etc.
Under the PLI Scheme, incentives will be given to domestic and global companies setting up mega-manufacturing plants in ACC battery storage technology areas such as lithium. The manufacturers will be selected through a transparent, competitive bidding process.
The selected bidder would have to commit to set up an ACC manufacturing facility of a minimum 5 GWh to maximum 20 GWh and ensure a minimum of 60% domestic value addition at the project level within five years.
The manufacturing facility would have to be commissioned within two years. The incentives will be disbursed after that over a five-year period. 
The cash subsidy shall be offered on the output, i.e., the volume of cells manufactured and sold by the beneficiaries. The incentive amount will increase with increased specific energy density and cycles and increased local value addition. 
The beneficiary firms have to achieve a domestic value addition of at least 25% and incur the mandatory investment of INR 225 crore (US$30.6 million)/GWh within two years (at the mother unit level) and raise it to 60% domestic value addition within five years, either at the mother unit, in case of an integrated unit, or at the project level, in case of a ‘hub and spoke’ structure.
The Scheme is expected to drive a direct investment of around INR 45,000 crore (US$6114 million) in ACC battery storage manufacturing projects. The ACC capacity created domestically is expected to lead to import substitution of around INR 20,000 crore (US$2717 million) every year.

The coal/lignite segment added 3.9 GW, according to the latest edition of the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) Market Handbook. 
Solar (grid-scale and rooftop) installation dominated at 5.5 GW, accounting for 71% of the new RE capacity addition and 45% of the overall new power generation capacity.
Rooftop solar contributed an impressive 1.8 GW (till February 2021). CEEW-CEF attributes this to favorable policies of states such as Gujarat, which has incentivized rooftop solar for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises.
In FY21, around 21.2 GW of RE capacity was auctioned. Grid-scale solar PV (17.3 GW) dominated the auctions, followed by wind-solar hybrid (2.8 GW) and wind (1.2 GW).
The announcement of basic customs duties on solar cells and modules drove up auction tariffs by 11% in the fourth quarter of FY21. Tariffs discovered in solar auctions held in Gujarat rose from a historic low of INR 1.99/kWh in December 2020 to INR 2.20/kWh in March 2021. A basic customs duty of 45% on solar modules and 20% on solar cells will be applicable from April 1, 2022.
Gagan Sidhu, Director, CEEW-CEF, said, “India’s RE sector, particularly solar, has shown resilience in FY21 despite supply chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The discovery of a historical low in solar auction tariffs this year and the fact that key RE developer stocks significantly outperformed the market (Sensex) are encouraging signs. India must now accelerate its RE sector’s development by subsidizing credit enhancement for RE projects, developing the corporate bond market, and improving liquidity in the power market.”
Nikhil Sharma, Associate, CEEW-CEF, added, “India’s RE sector has become quite attractive for investors and project developers. While a handful of developers continue to dominate auctions, new market entrants are giving them competition by bidding aggressively. These include large public-sector companies such as NTPC Limited, SJVN Limited, and Coal India, as well as smaller, private developers and international developers such as Al Jomaih Energy and Water Co.”

A document published by the European Commission for the bloc’s Council of Ministers has identified various supply chain concerns related to the planned ramping up of green hydrogen production on the continent.
With the EU having already noted potential future shortages of solar panel and battery storage raw materials such as cobalt, lithium, aluminum, nickel, steel and copper; various basic materials needed for electrolyzers, fuel cells and hydrogen storage have also been identified by the commission as potentially problematic.
The Strategic dependencies and capacities document published by the commission a week ago identified 30 raw materials which are sourced by the EU – and global rivals – from a limited number of countries. Of those, the commission identified 13 materials as critical to the deployment of green hydrogen production, with the EU aiming for 6 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyzer capacity by 2024 and 40 GW this decade, from a base of less than 1 GW last year.
Most of the critical materials are catalysts, stated the commission study, with platinum, for example, accounting for around half the cost of a fuel cell stack. South Africa is the world’s primary source of platinum, noted the study, with Russia and Zimbabwe the next biggest suppliers. In terms of more processed materials needed for fuel cells, the EU is currently capable of producing only around 15-20% of them and is critically reliant on non-EU nations for four components: CFCs; certain polymers; carbon and cloth paper; and nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes.
The high-quality carbon fiber needed to construct compressed hydrogen tanks for storage and transport is almost entirely sourced by the EU from Asia as well, the commission said.
As part of pv magazine’s global UP sustainability initiative, we focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. You can read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo and the development of raw material recycling. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
The document also noted the global semiconductor chip shortage which is starting to be highlighted as a problem by some solar manufacturers. With the Chinese, American, South Korean and Japanese governments already planning big investments to reduce their dependency on Taiwan for the world’s smallest, most advanced, 5nm chips, the EU is heavily reliant on U.S.-held design patents and on Asian nations for packaging, testing and the fabrication of such devices.
Europe, at present, is incapable of manufacturing chips smaller than 22nm and the commission said the stipulation at least 20% of its post-Covid Recovery and Resilience Fund be spent on projects for the digital transition could go a long way to addressing the problem. That 20% would equate to member states sharing €145 billion of digital transformation investment in the next two or three years.
