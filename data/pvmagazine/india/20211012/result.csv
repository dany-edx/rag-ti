The projects were awarded by the Uttar Pradesh Power Transmission Corporation Limited (UPPTCL). MYSUN will develop these projects across multiple districts, primarily in Western Uttar Pradesh.
The projects were allocated under UPPTCL’s Open Access scheme to promote the use of solar energy by large industries and corporations in the State. Overall, about 1.5 GW of grid sub-station capacity was put up for allocation. The latest round of allocation saw connectivity approvals being granted for central, western, and eastern parts of UP.
Gagan Vermani, Founder and CEO of MYSUN, said, “The allocation of this 140MW is a commitment from our side to provide clean, reliable, and affordable solar power to large energy consumers like industries, data centers, corporate parks, and builders in Uttar Pradesh. There is a lot of existing demand and with a renewed focus on industrialization in UP, clubbed with an upcoming new international airport, we foresee a huge demand for solar energy from our open-access power projects.”
MYSUN, under its recently launched asset vehicle MYSUN+, is expanding its presence across States like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu along with the National Capital Region. The company is already in early-stage development of more than 220 MW of projects under the captive/open access mechanisms. MYSUN+ was launched in February 2021 to develop solar projects under the distributed and open access models with an overall investment of INR 600 crore in the first phase. 
In its recent developments, the company has raised INR 15 crore in debt funding from TATA Cleantech Capital Ltd (TCCL), a joint venture between Tata Capital Limited and International Finance Corporation (IFC), Washington DC, USA.

The company shall utilize this capital for clean energy infrastructure projects in the field of agriculture and to expand operations and the team in northern India.
Oorja aims to empower 10 million farmers globally by 2030 with the agricultural services they need to sustainably increase their income and quality of life. Its solar-powered, pay-per-use solutions bring down the cost of irrigation, milling, and cooling services for smallholder farmers that were previously reliant on diesel engines for their on-farm energy needs. 
Oorja has pioneered an inclusive pay-per-use model for productive-use appliances. Users pay based on the volume of irrigation water used or the quantity of grains processed or produce stored.
The funding will help Oorja scale its operations in existing and new markets in India over the next 18 months. The company will expand its customer base in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. It looks to deploy 121 solar projects concentrated in 22 Clusters impacting up to 6,000 low-income households by December 2022. It will also bring onboard new talent at the middle and senior management levels.
Oorja’s customers are one-acre farmers with a monthly income of less than $100 per month. They can save up to 50% by transitioning from diesel to Oorja’s services.
“This infusion of capital will be catalytic in expanding Oorja’s footprint in the agriculture and cleantech sectors,” remarked Oorja’s CEO, Amit Saraogi, and CTO, Dr Clementine Chambon. “We strongly believe that innovative business models are needed to bring income-enhancing technologies to farmers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/12/large-clusters-of-solar-power-stations/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 12, 2021",Large clusters of solar power stations,"From pv magazine International
We have seen that the world’s largest individual solar power plants now have AC capacity in excess of 1 GW. Meanwhile, solar parks, where several projects are co-located in one organized site, are expanding from about 3 GW towards 5 GW or more.
This ‘solar park’ model is most widely adopted in China, India, and the Middle East, where the electricity industry is highly regulated. In other countries, notably the U.S., where the power market is more liberalized, solar projects also sometimes congregate together around the best locations, but without the formal coordination that solar parks offer. We call these groups of neighboring plants ‘solar clusters’.
Solar clusters typically form in areas where the available grid connection capacity and sunlight levels are favorable. This article looks at some of the largest clusters, though size is more subjective because it depends on how wide an area is included. For consistency, I have totaled the capacity of all plants within a 50 km (31 mile) radius.
This list shows clusters above about 1.5 GWAC, together with (in brackets) the position each held when last published in 2019.
The arid region north of Phalodi in India’s Jodhpur district hosted some of India’s earliest utility-scale solar power projects, dating back to 2011. Today it accommodates two solar parks and a growing number of smaller individual solar plants.

The Godawari CSP plant at Nokh is also included this cluster (see the red outline near the top).
This cluster’s rise up the table is thanks to new plants at both the Bhadla Solar Park, currently #2 in the world, and Rawra Solar Park, which has now climbed to #6. Between them, the parks house seven 300 MW projects supplying power to India’s ISTS (Inter-State Transmission System).
Other standalone solar plants in the area – including the 600-MW Lawan-Purohitsar station further south, now ranked #9 in the world – take the total number in this cluster to 90 with a combined capacity of some 6.6 GW – about the same as the national totals for France or Australia.
Further plants are under development in the district and are expected to take the total capacity of this cluster over 8 GW. Another cluster further east in Rajasthan, the area around Jamsar, houses over 1 GW of plants and is expected to rise to 2.5 GW in coming years.
Gonghe County in Qinghai’s Hainan Prefecture, China, looks like the world’s ‘giga-solar capital’. Readers of the previous articles in this series will not be surprised to see it near the top of this list.

Though the cluster holds only 18 plants, they include the world’s #1 plant Huanghe Hydro­power Developments’ 2.2 GW monster and Longyangxia Solar-Hydro, now listed as the #3 biggest solar park in the world. A handful of other nearby plants take the total capacity of this cluster to 5.1 GW.
New recently installed transmission lines taking the power over 1,000 kilometres east to Beijing make this a prime location for a renewable energy cluster.
Imperial County borders Mexico at Mexicali and has become home to many solar projects, including the multi-phase Mount Signal, Centinela and Imperial Valley projects.
Recent expansions to these plants have increased the total capacity to some 2.8 GW, shooting Imperial Valley up this list. Projects still in development should take the eventual total towards 5 GW.

Unlike the previous clusters in arid and desert regions, this is relatively fertile land, making the solar arrays (bordered in blue) harder to spot in this aerial view.
It is a sign of how fast Vietnam’s renewables market has progressed that it has now broken into this list. When it was last published in 2019, the whole of Vietnam had less than 1 GW of utility-scale solar.

The southern part of Ninh Thuận province now houses 40 plants with a combined capacity of 2.6 GWAC. The largest plant is Trung Nam Group’s 450 MW plant at Phươc Minh.
Around 12⁰ latitude, this is the first of only two clusters in the top 10 outside the subtropics; all the others are between latitudes 27⁰ and 38⁰N.
A second California valley is heading towards 5 GW – this one to the west of the Mojave Desert and north of Los Angeles, Its sunny location is boosted by good connectivity to the electricity markets of south and central California.

Amongst the 70 solar projects in Antelope Valley is the U.S.’s second-largest PV power plant, Solar Star, ranked #10 in the world.
Total connected capacity in this district currently stands at 2.5 GW.
The other cluster outside the subtropics, centered in Zhangbei County of Zhangjiakou in China’s Hebei province is just north of 41⁰N. It houses 1.8 GWAC of utility-scale solar from about 50 projects, a few of which are in neighboring Shangyi County and just over the provincial border in Inner Mongolia. However, the biggest concentration is in the municipality of Gonghuizhen.

Three CSP projects totaling 150 MW were also scheduled to be built in this area, but do not appear to have been completed yet.
The area around the city of Jinchang, also in China, accommodates, in addition to the world’s #5 solar park to the northwest, several more solar plants to the southeast, the largest of which is 200 MWP. The combined capacity of this cluster is 1.7 GW, and that can be expected to rise if Jinchuan Solar Park is further built out. However, no new capacity has been added in this cluster since the list published in 2019.

Zhongwei County in Ningxia is home to Tengger Desert Solar Park – once the world’s largest, but now down at #14. The area also has a few concentrations of individual solar plants, most notably around Zhongning, Hongsibu and Tongxin.

In total, the cluster houses 45 plants with a combined capacity of 1.5 GWAC.
In the desert to the south of Las Vegas, around Eldorado Dry Lake are clustered several large solar plants, including the multi-phase Copper Mountain PV project – now #4 in the world – and the Nevada One CSP plant.

Visible in the south-western part of this view are the facilities that make this area so attractive to solar developers – the three high capacity electricity substations and the power lines heading north to power-hungry Las Vegas and southwest to California.
The combined capacity is currently 1.4 GW, with further projects under development.
The list shows that the cluster approach is best suited to less densely populated regions of countries with high energy consumption. It can be expected to spread to parts of South America, Australia, and southern Africa. For example, the areas around Calama and Diego de Almagro in Chile already hold half-GW clusters, which are due to increase substantially.
Europe’s larger solar markets do not have many wide-open spaces available. Typical plant and cluster sizes are smaller, like those in Germany’s Brandenburg, France’s Landes, and Montalto di Castro in Italy. Rapid market growth may make Spain an exception, however. Teruel already hosts a ¾-GW cluster, and this is scheduled to grow to 2.6 GW.
The term ‘solar plant’ is used for an individual project that has been developed by a single developer or consortium. The largest of these were listed in an earlier article. Where multiple plants are co-located in a discrete area under the coordination of an identified agency, this is called a solar park, as described in the previous article. Today’s article explains how I use the word cluster where multiple solar farms are sited in an area without formal coordination.
Image Credits: The satellite views are from Google Earth, using imagery from Airbus, CNES, Copernicus, Digital Globe, and Landsat. In these shots, individual plants are highlighted in blue (if PV, or red if CSP), with solar parks in green. Colour coding on Wiki-Solar’s maps is similar.
Also for consistency, all capacities are quoted in MW/GWAC to allow direct comparison between PV and CSP plants (and other forms of generation). Readers will be aware that the DC peak capacity of PV plants is typically ~25% higher than the rated AC capacity, quoted here.

The global energy storage market is expected to enter a “prolonged period of growth” this year, with annual installations reaching more than 30 GW by 2030, up 250% from 2021 levels. That’s according to a new report from IHS Markit.
The firm forecasts that the energy storage industry will notch rapid growth this year, with installations topping 12 GW. That would be an increase of more than 7 GW from 2020. Annual global installations are forecast to exceed 20 GW in 2024 and 30 GW by 2030.
The company said its outlook is underpinned by a growing number of national energy storage targets linked to stronger decarbonization goals. It said of particular note was China’s recently announced 30 GW energy storage target by 2025, which will help Asia to account for a growing share of global demand in the coming five years.
IHS Markit said growth in electric vehicle (EV) adoption is leading to increased constraints in the supply of Li-ion batteries. This could cause delays to project commissioning as cell manufacturers prioritize larger customers in the automotive industry over relatively small energy storage system integrators.
The lower share of battery demand from the energy storage industry will leave it at risk of supply shortages. Even so, IHS Markit said it expects that the disruption to ease within 12-18 months, as suppliers diversify their supply base and EV manufacturers firm their procurement plans.
Globally, around 87 GW of national energy storage targets have been announced this year. Reaching those goals will require developing new market opportunities as well as regulatory changes, IHS Markit said.
It said this is particularly the case in China, where targets are expected to drive it to be the largest market globally in terms of annual installations by 2025. The firm said China will grow “significantly faster” than any other region in order to meet its target, with annual installation levels expected to be 14 times higher than 2020 levels in 2030. This compares to growth rates of 3 times and 4 times for the United States and Europe, respectively.
