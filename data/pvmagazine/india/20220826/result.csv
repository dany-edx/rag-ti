The auction attracted bids from companies like Acme, Hartree Partners Singapore, Eden Renewable, Sterlite Power Transmission, NTPC Renewable Energy, ReNew, and Azure Power, in addition to JSW Energy.
As per the tender requirement, JSW will set up the BESS plant in Rajasthan, close to Fatehgarh-III Substations of the ISTS network. It can set up the BESS as two projects of 250 MW size, each with the capacity to store at least two hours of electricity.
The battery energy storage capacity will be made available to the SECI (acting as an intermediary nodal agency for using the energy storage facility) or other buying entities for charging/discharging “on demand.”

He will launch the plant’s construction in an event organized to mark 40 years of Suzuki in India.
Suzuki is setting up the EV battery plant at Hansalpur in Gujarat with an investment of around INR 7,300 crore (around $914 million). The plant, Suzuki Motor Gujarat, will manufacture advanced-chemistry cell batteries for EVs. 
Suzuki arm Maruti Suzuki is a leading carmaker in India. It plans to introduce electric vehicles in the Indian market by 2025. Suzuki’s investment in the battery plant in Gujarat is part of the plan.
In all, Suzuki has committed to invest around INR 10,400 crore ($1.3 billion) for manufacturing EVs and batteries in the Suzuki Motor Gujarat plant. This will be Suzuki’s second EV battery initiative in India after TDS Lithium-Ion Battery Gujarat (TDSG), which it set up in Gujarat in collaboration with Toshiba and Denso. TDSG is India’s first lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant with cell-level localization. It supplies lithium-ion battery packs for Maruti Suzuki smart hybrid vehicles.

MG Energy Systems B.V., a Dutch storage system manufacturer, has unveiled a new lithium-ion battery for residential commercial applications.
“The batteries are assembled at our facility in the Netherlands,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “We currently use different types of battery cells manufactured, for example, in Taiwan, China, and South Korea.”
The MG LFP 24 V battery is available in two versions, with storage capacities of 5.8 kWh and 7.2 kWh and nominal capacities of 230 Ah and 280 Ah. The smallest device measures 517 mm x 294 mm x 193 mm and weighs 41 kg. The largest measures 652 mm x 294 mm x 193 mm and weighs in at 53 kg.
The devices feature a cooling technique based on natural convection and can operate at temperatures ranging from -20 C to 45 C. They also feature an IP40 protection level and a nominal voltage of 25.6 V. The manufacturer said the storage system provides steady operation for up to 3.500 charge cycles and its end-of-life period is 70% of its initial capacity at 25 C, with the cycle life depending on the battery temperature.
“The assembly line for this new battery model starts rolling this autumn,” the spokesperson stated. “Therefore the first batches will be available from the end of November.”
