The report states the targets set by the Indian government can only be achieved by collaboration between Indian developers and global sector participants that have a strong balance sheet and know-how to navigate potential pitfalls in the market.
“Over the last few decades, any mention of the cleantech sector has become synonymous with renewable power producers. The fact is that only 20% of the final energy consumed is in electrified form. Investments in the decarbonization of the balance 80% share will require and witness participation from a multitude of players in addition to renewable power producers and its current ecosystem,” said Prateek Jhawar, managing director and head-infrastructure & real assets investment banking, Avendus Capital.
India’s renewable energy sector attracted around $10 billion of annual investment over the past five years and project finance investment of $16.6 billion in the year 2021. Early estimates by Clean Energy Pipeline show that project financing in India rose significantly in 2022 as well.
 “Green hydrogen, energy storage, EV charging, carbon capture & utilization, and energy efficiency are the segments that will create a mark for themselves over this decade. Existing companies will expand their offerings and multiple new players/business models will contribute towards energy transition,” said Akhil Dokania, director, infrastructure and real assets investment banking, Avendus Capital. 
“Grid load management is critical and we expect investments will go into both pump storage hydro and battery-based storage projects. Further, EV charging infrastructure will require large-scale investments to support the growing EV penetration in India. While the carbon capture, utilization and storage industry is in its nascent stages, commercially-viable business models will have to be developed for it to become an attractive investment proposition. Indian companies are coming up with service-oriented solutions for energy delivery as well as management, which further creates a significant value creation opportunity for early investors in the emerging energy transition segments.”
The report specifically calls on the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), which has financed more than 2,900 renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of 19.4 GW, to increase its role as a provider of long-term financing. 
IREDA is planning a public listing, an Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), and green bond offerings to secure additional funds from domestic and international investors. This would be in addition to INR 1,500 crore ($187 million) equity infusion from the Government of India.
As part of the study, Avendus commissioned a survey that was conducted by Clean Energy Pipeline to gauge global investor interest in India’s clean energy industry, which garnered over 2,000 responses. It indicated that high economic growth and a stable commitment to decarbonization have drawn the attention of major organizations and investors around the world. The report also interviewed a few key companies and investors who participated in the survey, including SUSI partners, Actis, ABB, and Ikigai Capital.

California-based Amprius has verified the performance of its silicon anode battery cells with third-party tester Mobile Power Solutions. The results show that the cell model provides 504 Wh per kg and 1321 Wh per L at 25 C.
Amprius said the silicon anode cell is roughly half the weight and volume of leading conventional commercially available lithium-ion cells. The cells have applications in the rapidly growing electric aviation space and could be integrated with electric vehicles. Together, electric aviation and light-duty EV battery demand is estimated to exceed $100 billion throughout the world by 2025, said the company.
The Amprius cells offer a run time of 200% compared to leading graphite battery cells. However, they are lighter and smaller than other batteries with the same energy content.
“This latest validation continues Amprius’ track record of producing the world’s most powerful battery cells and sets an industry benchmark for next-generation battery technology that will ultimately revolutionize how high we fly, how far we travel and how long we can use our devices,” said Jon Bornstein, president of Amprius Labs.
Customers can adjust specifications on the battery cell platform to meet a project’s engineering needs. The customizable platform allows customers to select the option to either increase energy content in a battery pack without increasing weight, reduce weight in applications that target a fixed energy content, or a combinations of the two. Higher energy is important for longer run times, range and endurance, while lighter packs increase energy efficiency.
The battery cells are planned to be integrated with the AALTO Zephyr, a high-altitude platform station (HAPS). The solar-electric telecommunications aircraft offers persistent earth observation with 18cm ground sampling distance, near-real-time video and imagery from the stratosphere, day and night.
“We look forward to taking advantage of Amprius’ 500 Wh/kg cell to further develop Zephyr’s unrivalled stratospheric endurance capabilities,” said Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technical officer at AALTO HAPS, an Airbus subsidiary. “Amprius is a valued current supplier with a great track-record, and we are confident that its battery will deliver the capability we need.”
Amprius operates a research and development laboratory in Fremont, California. It recently signed a letter of intent for a 774,000 square foot facility in Brighton, Colorado that would provide up to 5 GWh of manufacturing capacity.
The US Department of Energy (DoE) targets improvements in battery performance to stabilize the critical materials supply chain and offer attractive products to vehicle buyers. “While a number of electric drive vehicles are available on the market, further improvements in batteries could make them more affordable and convenient to consumers,” according to the DoE.
The DoE funds advanced battery development, systems analysis, and testing in pursuit of these goals.
