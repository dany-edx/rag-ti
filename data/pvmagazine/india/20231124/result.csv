The investments are for setting up renewable energy projects of about 600 MW+ across different states in the region and an integrated 1.3 GW solar cells and modules manufacturing facility in Odisha.
Last month, AmpIn Energy Transition had announced a partnership with Jupiter International Ltd to set up the 1.3 GW per annum solar cell and module manufacturing facility under the government’s production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme. The modules produced through the alliance will be consumed locally by AmpIn and supplied to third-party developers.
AmpIn said it plans significant RE investments in West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Northeastern States.
In the region, the company purportedly has the largest solar open-access portfolio of 200 MWp, the largest utility power purchase agreement (PPA) with CESC for a 250 MWp wind-solar hybrid project, and the largest behind-the-meter industrial solar project of 10.5 MW.
“Time has come for the Eastern region which is the home of coal to embrace renewable energy. Our investment in the region marks a significant milestone in our mission to drive the transition to renewables in the region,” said Pinaki Bhattacharyya, MD and CEO, AmpIn Energy Transition. “AmpIn can partner with any customer to help them achieve 100% RE and we believe that with the right policy intervention like Green Energy Open Access, the shift to renewables is unstoppable. Also, the integrated solar cell & module manufacturing capacity that we are establishing in the region, would strengthen the push to renewables.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/24/solar-wafer-prices-marginally-rise-supported-by-currency-exchange-rate/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 24, 2023","Solar wafer prices marginally rise, supported by currency exchange rate","The price of wafers this week notched upward slightly as a result of the US dollar’s weakening relative to the Chinese yuan.
FOB China prices of Mono PERC M10 wafer increased by 0.68%, or $0.002 per piece (pc), to $0.295/pc this week, while Mono PERC G12 prices increased by 0.49%, or $0.002/pc, to $0.412/pc.
Currency fluctuations aside, the dynamics underlying China’s domestic market remained the same, leading to a continuation of the flat trend in the EXW wafer prices in the China domestic market for the second week running. The prices of Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafers remained stable at about CNY2.38 ($0.33)/pc and CNY3.32/pc, respectively.
Recently, low operating rates resulted in greater manufacturing costs for wafer producers, according to an integrated manufacturer. Now that wafer inventories have somewhat dropped, wafer makers are keen to increase their operating rates, the source continued.
There have been recent talks about wafer producers raising their operating rates and buying polysilicon at a faster rate due to the industry-wide sentiment that the price of polysilicon is about to bottom out. However, OPIS learnt from its market survey that the operating rates at wafer companies did not significantly grow, as production costs would decrease but losses would accumulate with unsold wafers.
According to a cell supplier, the consumption of inventories of good-quality wafers has slowed as some cell producers have been buying wafers of reduced quality. This may resonate with a few downstream users who have been worried about the impact that this cost war may have on module quality for 2024.
There are no profitable wafer companies currently, and some small-size wafer factories in China have closed, according to a market observer. Some wafer businesses are looking for chances to establish manufacturing facilities overseas in order to survive, the source continued.
Another source from upstream concurred, stating that wafer manufacturers would find it challenging to turn a profit in the near future. As a result, this source does not anticipate a notable increase in the operating rates of wafer companies, since more production entails higher losses.
Looking ahead, the industry expectation points to stable wafer prices, in equilibrium between weak demand and steady polysilicon and crucible cost.

The 8.5 GW capacity addition included 5.06 GW of utility-scale solar, 3 GW of rooftop solar, and another 0.4 GW of off-grid solar. Utility-scale solar installations in the Jan-Sept. 2023 period (5.06 GW) were 84% down from 9.3 GW installed during the same period in 2022. Rooftop solar installations (3 GW), on the other hand, were 2.3 times up year-on-year.
In the wind segment, 2.28 GW of new capacity was added from January to September 2023. This is 123% higher than the 1.02 GW capacity added in the first nine months of 2022, according to JMK Research.
In terms of cumulative solar and wind installations as of September 30, 2023, Adani is the leading player with about 8.3 GW of operational capacity and another 20.4 GW of projects in the pipeline.
In the third quarter ending September 2023, about 0.85 GW of utility-scale solar capacity and about 0.7 GW of rooftop solar was added.
Sungrow was the leading inverter supplier followed by Sineng and FIMER.
Jinko topped in solar module supplies with about 23.5% share of total shipments.
JMK Research analysts expect the installation activity to pick up with about 4.8 GW of solar and 2.2 GW of wind capacity likely to be added in the next two quarters.
Annually, India is expected to install about 11 GW of new solar capacity in 2023, including 7 GW from utility-scale, 3.5 GW from rooftop solar, and another 500 MW from off-grid component. Whereas in the wind segment, around 3 GW of new capacity is likely to be added in 2023.

The ministry said that a central part of the program will be the deployment of at least 5 GW of solar capacity.
“We want to enhance the energy independent of the area, enabling it to act as an ‘energy island’ in times of need,” the ministry said in a document. “Such island will be able to produce and consume electricity intendedly of the grid.”
The ministry said it is developing a multi-year program for the project. It aims to build 5 GW by 2030, including rooftop and ground-mounted PV systems. It also mentioned plans to build PV fences and bicycle lanes, as well as PV equipment production and energy storage solutions.
Some villages will become microgrids with buildings incorporating PV panels and storage units for self-sufficiency. The rebuilt structures will use high-energy-efficient materials. The program aims to develop electric car infrastructure, green public transportation, connect villages to natural gas, and upgrade water and sewerage systems.
“Together with the residents of those villages, we will make the Gaza Envelope into an ‘energy Island,’ a global renewable energy model,” Minister Israel Katz said. “We will build storage infrastructure, R&D centers, gas infrastructure, and more.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/24/solar-module-prices-may-reach-0-10-w-by-end-2024/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 24, 2023",Solar module prices may reach $0.10/W by end 2024,"From pv magazine Global
Solar module prices may approach the threshold of $0.10/W by the end of 2024 or eventually in 2025, according to Tim Buckley, director of Australia-based think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF).
“This would be nicely ahead of Dr. Martin Green’s $0.10/W by 2030 forecast made three years back,” he told pv magazine, adding that he came to this conclusion after estimating that new annual PV additions may reach between 600 GW and 1 TW already by the end of this decade. “I am very bullish on the rate of global growth in solar installs over the next few years. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has reminded everyone of the need for supply chain and energy security, particularly in terms of imported energy reliance.”
Buckley also noted the likely new climate accord by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden, might see a formal call for a tripling of renewables capacity globally by 2030.
“At a time of massive capital investment cost blowouts, to be able to invest in deflationary solar is a massive global boon that will provide cost of living pressure relief as well as improved energy security,” he said.
Overcapacity issues
Buckley said price pressure will increase due to the staggering capacity increases announced by the PV industry at the global level, although he questioned a recent forecast by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its recent World Energy Outlook 2023, which claimed thaT the world’s cumulative installed solar capacity could reach 2 TW by 2025.
“I find the IEA assumption that the Chinese will run their brand new factories just 35% of the time as ludicrous,” he added. “As this new capacity is brought online for a full year, I would expect the IEA figures to be undercooked by over 50% in terms of global annual solar installs.”
Buckley estimates that solar module prices will end up dropping by 40% this year.
“This will give many investors in the US, India, EU and China good reasons to pause or rethink their financial assumptions that underpinned their announcements of massive capacity expansions,” he said. “Against this, both the US and India have 40% solar module import duties against Chinese products, so they are largely insulated from excessive price competition, and share the cost savings of the 70% decline in polysilicon price over the last year as well.”
Rapid deflation and excessive price pressures, on the other hand, may soon lead to the closure of old technology, sub-scale solar manufacturing facilities, both in China and globally.
“Old facilities simply can’t compete with the scale advantages nor the new technology investments of the world leading firms in this sector, almost all of which are Chinese,” said Buckley.
New cycle
Describing this new industry cycle for the solar PV technology, Buckley said it is different from previous ones, as solar is now the cheapest electricity, which is disrupting incumbent industry competitors.” This means finance will rapidly flee from investing in any new thermal power capacity in the electricity sector globally,” he said.
The analyst is convinced that finance won’t just flee for environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues or moralistic or climate reasons, but it will flee nonetheless because it will not provide new financing to inevitably stranded assets, particularly with the concurrent rapid scaling up of battery energy storage and EVs.
“This time is different because of the convergence of power-industry-transport markets,” Buckley said.
Tim Buckley is the main author of “Solar pivot: A massive global solar boom is disrupting energy markets and speeding the transition,” which was published by CEF in June. There, Buckley and his colleagues said they estimated solar electricity costs to drop 10% annually for the rest of this decade, halving by 2030. The report also provides detailed information on the operating and planned capacity of the global PV supply chain.
