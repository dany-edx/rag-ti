https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/23/inoxcva-flags-off-indias-largest-liquid-hydrogen-tank/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,INDIA,SOUTH KOREA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 23, 2022",INOXCVA flags off India’s largest liquid hydrogen tank,"INOXCVA, an India-based cryogenic equipment and solutions manufacturer, has finished building the largest liquid hydrogen storage tank ever made in India. The tank is built with a massive storage capacity of 238 cubic meters. It has already embarked on its journey from INOXCVA’s Kandla facility to a clean energy demonstration project in South Korea. 
Hydrogen is liquefied at a cryogenic temperature of -253 C to make it dense enough to be stored and transported as liquid hydrogen. Its gaseous volume reduces by 800 times when liquefied. 
INOXCVA’s bulk cryogenic storage tank is built to European Standards and meets Korean Gas Safety (KGS) requirements. It will be deployed for South Korea’s first hydrogen liquefaction plant, with 5 tons per day of capacity, to offer supplies to hydrogen charging stations for buses, trucks, and trams. Doosan Corp. is constructing the plant for the Changwon Hydrogen Liquefaction Project, which is set to start commercial operations in 2023.
Doosan has signed an agreement with Air Liquide Engineering and Construction to support the construction of the liquid hydrogen plant as an enabler of clean transport development in the country. Under this framework, Air Liquide Engineering and Construction, France, placed the liquid hydrogen tank order to INOXCVA. 
“We are honored to have designed, engineered, and manufactured the largest liquid hydrogen tank ever made in India, and become a part of a global clean energy initiative. We have demonstrated our world-class cryogenic capabilities for projects of such magnitude,” said Siddharth Jain, director of INOXCVA. “This tank, which is first in a series of many such solutions to be manufactured at our Kandla facility, will strengthen India’s hydrogen infrastructure and support the country’s vision of becoming a green hydrogen hub and augment the adoption of this clean gas as an energy alternate.”

At this rate, annual EV sales would reach 17 million units by 2030, with almost 15 million (88%) of these vehicles projected to be electric two-wheelers (e-2Ws). 
Battery demand is anticipated to increase by 41% annually between 2021 and 2030, reaching 142 GWh from 6.5 GWh in 2021, according to IESA. It said that lead-acid batteries still dominate the Indian EV ecosystem due to high demand for e-rickshaws. Lead-acid batteries accounted for 81% (5.3 GWh) of the 6.5 GWh market in 2021.
However, the market share of lithium-ion batteries has been steadily growing, said IESA. And in 2021, for the first time, sales of such batteries exceeded the 1 GWh threshold. Among lithium-ion chemistries, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) is the chosen option for electric three-wheelers (e-3Ws) and electric four-wheelers (e-4Ws). Nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) is the preferred option for e2W and e-buses, according to IESA.
The research report considers three different market scenarios to make projections for the current decade. IESA expects the Indian EV market to grow quickly after the 2024-25 period, as the initial EV costs become comparable with those of internal combustion engine vehicles due to falling battery prices, advancements in EV technology, higher domestic production, and economies of scale. 
According to the report, the main factors driving the EV market’s expansion in the current decade will be rising consumer awareness, rising fuel prices, commitments from fleet aggregators and corporations, the emergence of new players, advancements in EV technology, ongoing subsidy support from both the central and state governments, and the anticipated implementation of strict emission standards (CAFÉ norms from 2022).

Researchers from the Jadavpur University Salt Lake Campus in India have proposed a new way to combine gravity storage and redox flow batteries with PV generation in a multi-level buildings.
“Our hybrid system can be implemented in any kind of building but the energy content of the gravity storage system increases with the height of the building, which means high buildings offer the largest potential for its development,” researcher Mayurakshi Mondal told pv magazine.
The hybrid system consists of a conventional rooftop PV system, a solar tree, two gravity power modules for building (GPMBs), and a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), with the three storage systems being charged exclusively by the two solar installations. “The proposed system emphasizes on supplying the essential load demand of a building through renewable energy as much as possible, especially focusing on the reduction of the demand from the grid at peak hours,” the scientists explained. “The system is also focused to flatten the load demand curve of the grid.”
They estimated the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the redox flow battery at $0.424/kWh and that of the GPM at $0.148/kWh. Due to this difference, the battery is used only as a secondary storage system, the said. During the charging phase, the GPMBs work via a motor that drives a pump to push water from the top of a piston in a larger pipe into a smaller one. It then pushes it back to the larger pipe below the piston.
“This pushes the piston upward and the operation terminates when the piston reaches the topmost position of the larger pipe, thereby storing energy in the mechanical form,” the Indian group said, noting that both GPMBs should have a diameter of 1.5 meters each for the larger pipe.
In the discharging phase, the piston in the larger pipe comes down and pushes the water downward, into the smaller pipe. The water flows through the pump/turbine unit operating in the turbine mode and generates electricity with the electrical device operating in the generator mode, the academics said. “The discharging operation ends when the piston reaches the bottom-most point in the larger pipe.”
They considered a 110-meter building with 39 floors and a total floor area of 750 square meters. The two GPMBs have a storage capacity of 96.2 kWh each and the redox flow battery is able to store 300 kWh. The 75.4 kW PV system occupies a surface of 450 square meters, which corresponds to around 60% of the roof area, and five solar trees totaling 57.7 kW are installed in the exterior open-air space of the building.
“After meeting the residential load demand and charging both GPMBs, any extra generated energy is used to charge the VRFB. Thereafter, any remaining energy generated is sold to the grid,” they said.
In the proposed system configuration, two GPMBs only supply electricity within the peak hours 6 pm to 9 pm and 9 pm to 12 pm, in order to reduce the burden of peak hours over the grid.
“The proposed system is able to supply 47.77% of renewable energy to the building as a yearly average and is capable of injecting 48.89% renewable energy to the building along with grid,” the researchers said.
They described the hybrid system in “Solar PV driven hybrid gravity power module—Vanadium redox flow battery energy storage for an energy efficient multi-storied building,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Energy Research.
“Further studies on GPMB are required before practical implementation, like the effect of high starting current devices such as an air-conditioner, water pump and so on over its operation,” the scientists said. “The system also requires a cost optimization analysis.”
