However, a study by World Resources Institute finds decentralized solar installations in India’s energy-poor states lacked design for climate resilience. 
The researchers analyzed 14 decentralized solar energy systems (standalone or minigrid-sized installations) installed in community-level healthcare, education, and livelihood facilities in climate-vulnerable regions across three states (Assam, Jharkhand, and Rajasthan) of India. The primary climate risks in these states were listed as floods, waterlogging and extreme precipitation in Assam, thunderstorms in Jharkhand, and extreme heat and water scarcity in Rajasthan.
The researchers said that none of the decentralized solar installations covered in the case studies specifically incorporated predictions of future climate change into their project design. Climate considerations were even less evident in the operational and financial design. 
The researchers found that only a limited number of case study installations had operational clarity on roles and responsibilities during and after a climate-related event or have funding arrangements to deal with the aftermath of an event. Furthermore, the clarity that some possess stemmed from learning through experience and not from the project design. 
The researchers acknowledged that many renewable energy projects adapted their designs considering specific local conditions. These considerations, however, didn’t suffice to manage climate-related risks over the project lifecycle. For example, in Assam, to deal with waterlogging and flooding, installations are designed to withstand higher water levels, either through raised platforms or through technologies such as floating solar installations. Jharkhand is prone to thunderstorms and lightning, and a few pilot implantation projects in the state have installed lightning rods, surge protectors, and chemical earthing. In the desert state of Rajasthan, the installations are designed to withstand extreme temperatures and strong winds and include insurance of structures in project design.
The researchers identified additional considerations for decentralized solar energy installations in climate vulnerable regions as the study outcome.
Technical considerations include understanding the current and future climate risks in the region, how they affect the demand for and supply of electricity, and what technology options, codes, and guidelines exist to ensure that the energy system remains useful and functional. The implementing agencies and vendors should also consider whether project timelines include climate risks through the four stages of the project life cycle and whether the technical design considers the market availability of spare parts if disruptions occur.
Organizational considerations include whether the contractual and non-contractual responsibilities of all participants are laid out in the event of climate-related disruptions and whether they have adequate capacity to execute them. Users and implementing agencies should account for local capacity building, contingency communication, or response plans under contractual obligations that can be activated during climate-related events. Energy project planning should consider the local community’s expectations, including the role played by energy in the community’s current and future coping mechanisms to manage climate-related risks.
Economic considerations include a realistic estimate of whether finance for the project incorporates climate resilience as a critical element of project planning. Funding agencies, implementing agencies, and users should collaborate on project planning that is flexible enough to integrate innovative financing options to hedge against short- and long-term uncertainty.

The selection will be made through an open bidding/application process. The selection document would be issued soon on the website of IREDA, the agency notified.
Notably, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has appointed IREDA as the implementing agency for the scheme to drive integrated PV manufacturing, from polysilicon to finished panels. 
IREDA has been entrusted with handling the scheme on behalf of MNRE and selecting the manufacturing capacities through bidding. 
The MNRE has already issued PLI scheme guidelines for solar manufacturers who wish to apply for state cash to set up production lines. The guidelines say, “The manufacturing unit must have a minimum level of integration across solar cells and modules. The unit can integrate ingot and polysilicon manufacturing also.
The minimum capacity of the manufacturing unit to be installed under the scheme shall be 1 GW.
Further, the modules being manufactured under the scheme must offer minimum module efficiency of 19.5% with a Pmax temperature coefficient of better than -0.3% per degree Celsius, or a minimum module efficiency of 20% with a Pmax temperature coefficient equal to, or better than, -0.4% per degree Celsius.
‘The manufacturing capacities shall be online within a period of 18 to 36 months from date of award, depending on the level of integration.”

With energy storage technology playing an ever more important role in our daily lives, one that is set to increase dramatically with the adoption of electric vehicles, availability of the materials to manufacture lithium-ion batteries, their safe disposal and strategies for recycling are increasingly important concerns.
Though Europe and other regions are beginning to introduce laws requiring use of recycled materials in battery production, extracting these economically remains a major challenge for recyclers – separating and purifying the materials to the point where they can be reused requires multiple expensive and energy-intensive processes.
Scientists led by Finland’s Aalto University were initially studying the aging mechanisms of lithium cobalt oxide, commonly used in consumer electronics products, and made an observation that led them to investigate new methods to extend their lifetime or enable reuse of components without the complex process of stripping them down to raw materials. “We noticed that one of the main causes of battery deterioration is the depletion of lithium in the electrode material,” explained Aalto University professor Tanja Kallio. “The structures can nevertheless remain relatively stable, so we wanted to see if they can be reused.”
The group developed an electrolysis process to replenish the lithium in battery electrodes, and then compared the performance of electrodes treated in this way with those made from brand new materials. The results are published in the journal ChemSusChem, in a paper titled The reuse of LiCoO2 electrodes collected from spent Li‐ion batteries after the electrochemical re‐lithiation of the electrode.
The group found that the re-lithiation process served to restore the original electrode structure, and demonstrated capacity, rate capability, and cyclability properties only slightly behind the brand new batteries. The group further noted that comparable electrolysis processes are already used in various industries, and that their approach would also be worth investigating on an industrial scale.
“By reusing the structures of batteries we can avoid a lot of the labor that is common in recycling and potentially save energy at the same time,” says Kallio. “We believe that the method could help companies that are developing industrial recycling.”
For now, the group at Aalto University’s next goal will be to test and optimize its process for use with other battery chemistries, particularly the nickel-rich cathode designs that have moved to large-scale production in recent years, primarily as batteries for electric vehicles.
