Utility-scale PV installation stood at 9.3 GW, rooftop 1.3 GW, and off-grid 0.6 GW, according to a new report by JMK Research.
The nation reached about 60.8 GW of cumulative solar power generation capacity as of September 30, 2022, about half of which (51.3%) is concentrated in the three states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Karnataka.
JMK analysts expect India to add about 13.6 GW of solar capacity (12 GW from utility-scale and 1.6 GW from rooftop solar) in 2022.
Quarterly installation
In the third quarter (July-Sept) of 2022, India added about 2.82 GW of utility-scale solar capacity and more than 400 MW of rooftop arrays.
China’s Sineng was the biggest inverter supplier, accounting for more than 1 GW of the overall 2.9 GW of quarterly shipment in the nation. It was followed by Sungrow and FIMER.
Domestic manufacturers ruled PV module supplies as imports contracted due to the imposition of the basic customs duty. Waaree was the biggest module supplier in Q3, contributing about 14% of total 1.28 GW shipment. It was followed by Adani Solar and Goldi Solar.
JMK Research
Around 85% of the overall 1.28 GW of quarterly module shipment was high-efficiency mono PERC.
In Q3 2022, solar cells and modules exports increased by 57% and 524%, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. Solar cell imports also increased, but module imports fell 64%.

With the COP27 climate summit over, progress has been made in helping hard-to-abate sectors of the global economy reduce their emissions. This is particularly the case when it comes to green hydrogen, with the EU announcing partnerships with Kazakhstan, Egypt, and Namibia to import renewable hydrogen – an important development which arguably has not received the attention it warrants.
Though hydrogen is no silver bullet to solve all of our problems, when applied correctly it has a critical role to play in transitioning our heaviest-polluting and most power-intensive industries. The iron and steel industry alone is responsible for 11% of global CO2 emissions, according to UK-based sustainable policy group Carbon Brief, and relies on coal furnaces at more than 60% of steelmaking sites. Alternatives such as electric arc furnaces can use recycled metals combined with hydrogen – or natural gas plus carbon capture – to reduce emissions but this has not yet become commonplace.

To contextualize this, analyst Wood Mackenzie says net-zero production of steel would require the annual production of 52 million tons of green hydrogen by 2050. With such huge quantities required, the fact the EU is recognizing the important role that developing countries can, and unquestionably will, play in realizing this figure is pivotal for our industry and the global transition more broadly. No wonder that 30% of the EU’s primary steel production could be decarbonized by 2030, based on the use of renewable hydrogen.
The three deals signed at COP27 will pave the way for hydrogen development for two reasons. Firstly, they are a clear indicator that the EU recognizes the potential of renewable hydrogen not just on its net-zero merits but also as an effective economic lever to drive international trade and cooperation with other states – ensuring the green transition does not come at the cost of economic growth.
Secondly, it is a clear acknowledgement that the transition must not be an inequitable one that further disadvantages developing countries to the benefit of those which already have the strongest economies. Rich in raw materials and existing industrial capacity, developing countries have the potential to be global bastions of green hydrogen and are already seizing the initiative. Kazakhstan is now building one of the world’s largest green hydrogen production facilities while Chile is already one of South America’s leaders in clean hydrogen and aims to become one of the world’s top three exporters by 2040.
These targets may have previously seemed unrealistic; now they are anything but. The rapid growth our industry has seen cannot be understated. Even as the most abundant element in the universe (making up approximately 75% of normal matter) production of hydrogen has long been expensive because the energy carrier has only been found in compound form and, therefore, requires huge amounts of energy to harness it. This has meant industries such as shipping and large scale manufacturing have remained fossil-fuel reliant. However, the developments at COP27 are a clear sign that the winds are changing to reflect the progress our industry has made in recent years.
At Hystar, we have developed the world’s most efficient PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyzers, which produce up to 150% more green hydrogen than conventional systems. In the context of the 52 million tons of green hydrogen needed by 2050, such breakthroughs will have a significant impact on hydrogen commercialization. Such drastic savings, and ongoing technological breakthroughs, are paving the way for green hydrogen, in particular, to emerge as a clear and indisputable long-term solution within the energy transition. Major industry names Equinor and Yara have both joined Hystar’s HyPilot project, which will qualify our technology in field conditions.
Simply put, the idea that green hydrogen commercialization is anything but inevitable is one that should be quickly dispelled. Hydrogen’s potential to tackle pollution at scale, and now at cost, should be embraced equally by those who wish to see a cleaner planet and those who wish to see this achieved in an economically pragmatic way.
When it comes to the role of hydrogen in developing countries, its potential to further utilize renewable energy sources will be revolutionary for helping such nations grow their own green industries and promote energy security beyond just the West. By signing the COP partnerships, the EU has sent a clear signal that it recognizes these merits and will work to ensure they are attained.
This is where our efforts to commercialize hydrogen should be focused. Agreements like these will support developing countries and create durable supply chains. Focusing our attention on this will ensure that hydrogen commercialization occurs effectively and sustainably. It is only by optimizing hydrogen in heavy-polluting industries and using it as a key lever for economic growth that decarbonization can be achieved globally.
The widespread commercialization of renewable hydrogen is imminent and COP27 made that abundantly clear to those who still had any doubts. Green hydrogen has a vital role to play in realizing the global transition, decarbonizing the heaviest polluting industries and driving greener economies across the world.

A group of scientists from the DLR Institute of Networked Energy Systems in Germany has proposed to utilize a three-step method to quantify energy fluctuations in PV systems in an effort to estimate the flexibility potential of buildings and city districts hosting solar arrays.
The novelty of the methodology consists of providing not only the amount of energy that must be reserved or shifted locally for balancing purposes within a day, but also the required duration of energy reserving or shifting.
“The developed method distinguishes between power and energy fluctuations of PV systems,” the academics said. “The quantification of the power fluctuations only requires technical characteristics and time series with the measured power values of the PV systems.”
The proposed method is based on analyses of the so-called power ramp, which the researchers describe as the difference in power values between two successive points in time in a PV system. The three steps consist of the classification of the days with PV generation in the “low variability” and “high variability,” the computation of the distribution of PV power ramps, and the calculation of PV energy fluctuations.
This method computes power ramps at each point in time and the energy fluctuations on a daily basis. “Because the PV power prediction uncertainties are summed over the day, the computed daily energy fluctuations can be compared to the capacity of the local flexibility sources to estimate whether the available flexibility sources have a sufficient amount of energy to balance the daily energy fluctuations,” they further explained.
The research group tested its method in seven PV systems with a capacity ranging from 1.2 kW to 100 kW, located in either northern or southern Germany. Through this analysis, it found that days with high variability and those with low variability feature characteristic distributions of PV power ramps. “The computed distributions of the power ramps enable the magnitudes of power fluctuations that arise most frequently in a given PV system to be estimated,” it said. “In other words, based on the computed distributions, the probability of any power ramp of any PV system can be determined for the given variability class.”
The researchers said the testing showed that PV installations located in the same area should have similar distributions of power ramps. “However, all of the investigated PV systems are located in Germany in western Europe. It may be academically interesting to apply the developed method to PV systems in other locations with apparently differing climate and weather conditions,” they stated.
The researchers also claim the new approach can support adequate dimensioning of the PV system in buildings and be integrated into energy management systems for scheduling the operation for the next day.
They described the novel methodology in the paper “Quantifying power and energy fluctuations of photovoltaic systems,” published in Energy Science & Engineering. “The proposed methodology for quantifying PV energy fluctuations can be applied to any PV system if solar radiation predictions for its particular location and technical parameters are available,” they concluded.
