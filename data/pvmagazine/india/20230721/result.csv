Annual open-access solar and wind capacity additions in India have remained below 3.5 GW thus far, with cumulative installations reaching approximately 13.6 GWp.

The analysts said the C&I market presents significant growth opportunities for the renewable sector, and the implementation of open access norms by the government is expected to bring much-needed transparency, and reliability, and attract additional private investments.
The government has introduced green energy open access rules to accelerate the transition towards renewable energy and make the market attractive for both power producers and consumers in the C&I sector.
Initiatives include reducing the eligible load to 100 kW from 1 MW for consumers to procure power through the open access route, defining the modalities of open access charges that can be applied by state distribution companies (discoms), and stipulating a minimum banking period of 30 days for consumers.
Discoms are also obligated to supply green energy at an additional cost upon consumer request.
While the government aims to harmonize open access rules nationwide, individual states have the jurisdictional powers to determine open access charges for their customers through their electricity commissions.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/21/future-of-distributed-green-hydrogen-in-india/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,INDIA",,"JULY 21, 2023",Future of distributed green hydrogen in India,"Under the ambit of the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the government of India has announced Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT)—an ambitious and far-sighted program to support and incentivize domestic production of green hydrogen and electrolyzers. In its pursuit of making India a hub for using, producing, and exporting green hydrogen, SIGHT reflects the Indian government’s intent towards creating a green hydrogen ecosystem that stands on its own while giving the country the global edge regarding clean economy evolution. 
India is one of the largest consumers of hydrogen. The maximum of approx. 6 MMT of domestic hydrogen production is consumed in two sectors: fertilizers (55%), ammonia/urea production and refineries (43%). The remaining 2% is used in various industries, including steel, glass, and methanol production. 
With SIGHT, the government has rightly prioritized large-scale, export-oriented green hydrogen production. However, shifting a bit of the focus to decentralized production can prove to be a game changer. 2% is a small but vital market, which, if incentivized for a decentralized production model and supported with an encouraging policy framework, can provide broader acceptance and attract private investments for scalability. 
A decentralized production model involves developers setting up and operating clean energy production plants for customers at the point of consumption, thereby avoiding long lead times and execution bottlenecks associated with offtake procurement projects. 
In the case of green hydrogen, flexible deployment of electrolyzers at the customer premises or industrial hubs can enable end users to transition to clean energy based on their specific needs and capacities. The developer is responsible for plant construction and operation and maintenance (O&M) for the duration of the plant’s life and green hydrogen is then sold to the customer, in the same way as green electricity is offered under RESCO arrangement in the case of roof-top solar PV plants. 
This approach not only improves the accessibility and reliability of green energy but also attracts private investments in the sector by opening new financing avenues.
Distributed roof-top solar business model, subsidized and supported by the government of India through initiatives like net metering, led to significant growth in India’s solar energy sector. Customers benefitted from cost savings and ownership in power generation, leading to significant adoption, especially amongst commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. 
Today, as India strives to diversify its clean energy mix and achieve ambitious net-zero goals, a similar framework in green hydrogen production is needed to realize this sector’s enormous scalability potential.
 Green hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water into oxygen and hydrogen by power derived from a zero-carbon source such as solar energy. While India’s intentions on green hydrogen are consistent with international opinion, factors such as price competitiveness, quality, technology, and innovation will determine global leadership in this industry. 
Renewable energy (RE) accounts for 70-80% of the total cost of green hydrogen production, necessitating the elimination of tariff and sourcing barriers such as ALMM, basic customs duty, and high GST (goods and services tax) on RE used in green hydrogen production. 
High landed costs of renewable energy due to varied and high open access charges across India currently pose a substantial barrier to commercially viable distributed green hydrogen production. Additionally, restrictions or limitations on banking (storage) result in unstable energy necessary for electrolysis. 
While several nations worldwide are incentivizing green hydrogen production, India should consider measures like open access charges waivers and suitable banking to greatly impact this sector, even if direct capital subsidies are not feasible.
Besides cost-related constraints, it is crucial to highlight that interest in hydrogen as an energy source has surged only recently. Due to limited experience in installation and operations in this sector, suppliers and consumers cannot fully comprehend the technical and commercial potential of green hydrogen. 
The availability of technologically advanced equipment is also a barrier, as there is a global supply shortage of electrolyzers, and India does not have sufficient domestic production capability. To minimize hindrances to the growth of this high-potential sector, initial reliance on imports necessitates avoiding import restrictions similar to those encountered in the solar energy sector. 
India has made significant strides in addressing climate change. The country can gain the necessary edge in this critical industry by focusing more on making green hydrogen production accessible and affordable. Using the distributed business model and building an enabling regulatory framework will stimulate wider acceptance and help India achieve its net zero ambitions.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/21/australian-team-claims-99-recovery-rate-with-solar-recycling-process/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 21, 2023",Australian team claims 99% recovery rate with solar recycling process,"From pv magazine Australia
The patented process includes the use of stainless steels balls as a high-abrasion sieving aid, with the UNSW team saying that in tests they have been able to extract 99% of the components, including silver, from solar cellw for potential reuse.
Recycling end-of-life solar panels thoroughly continues to be a challenge with the individual materials, including glass, silicon, precious metals, wiring and plastic, integrated in such a way that makes them hard to separate. For the process to be viable, components need to be carefully separated to avoid contamination, but that has been hard to achieve.
But now a team from the UNSW Process Modelling and Optimisation of Reacting Flow (ProMO) lab, led by Professor Yansong Shen, has developed a new process that allows them to quickly and efficiently sort the individual materials. The process integrates conventional methods for the separation of large components, such as the aluminum frame and glass sheets, and crushing of the cell, but relies on a very highly abrasive separation system to improve the process.
“The key to our new process is the addition of the sieving aids which help to crush the solar cells into smaller particles allowing a better separation of all the components,” Shen said. “That makes it much easier to recover important elements such as the silver contained in the solar cells.”
The ProMO research team discovered that using stainless steels balls as a sieving aid provided the optimal solution for the process.
“We spent around three or four months working on that element, also testing with sieving aids made of clay or plastic,” team member Chengsun He said. “We can use different size sieving aids for different stages of the process. The main goal is to ensure that all of the PV cells particles can be crushed by the sieving aids, while the glass and other significant material remains intact at the top.”
The entire crushing and sieving process, which occurs inside a vibrating container, takes about five to 15 minutes to effectively separate 99% of the materials.
Once the material has been separated using the new patented process, the team is able to employ a traditional chemical leaching, as well as precipitation to extract the specific elements such as pure silica and silver, which accounts for about 0.05% of the total weight of a panel but makes up approximately 14% of the material value.
Shen said the team is already working with some industry partners “but we would like to engage in more industry collaborations to scale this process up and enhance the economic feasibility of the PV recycling process … Our group of 30 researchers is the largest in Australia working on PV recycling technology development, not lifecycle assessment only, and probably one of the largest in the world. This patent is just one part of one recycling process for end-of-life solar panels and we are also working on other solutions to the other steps.”
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) says that cumulative PV waste volume on a global scale will reach up to 8 million tons by 2030. That figure soars to up to 78 million tons of waste by 2050 as successive generations of solar panels installed at the start of the century come to their end of life, according to IRENA.
