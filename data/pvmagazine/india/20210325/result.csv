https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/25/how-to-protect-rooftop-pv-systems-from-fire-risk/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 25, 2021",How to protect rooftop solar systems from fire risk,"From pv magazine International
The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and the Dutch Institute for Safety have published a guide to help homeowners or businesses operating a rooftop PV system, or willing to install one, become aware of the fire risks associated with solar power generation.
The guide also provides firefighters with tools to act quickly and safely in the event of an incident and defines the most common fire causes, such as bad system design, inadequate installation, animals chewing on wires, storm damages, manufacturing faults in PV products, including connectors and junction boxes, and heat accumulation, among others.
The basic principle proposed by the TNO experts is that a PV system, including the inverter, must have its own fire compartments, as far as this is possible. These compartments should comply with the Dutch WBDBO requirement, which establish that the fire in a building should be stopped in 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes, depending on the type of building and its function. WBDBO stands for Weerstand tegen BrandDoorslag en BrandOverslag, which translates to Resistance Fire Bursts and Fire Spread.
“For the layout of a commercial roof with solar panels, we recommend working with surfaces of a maximum of 40 by 40 meters, or 1,600 square meters, as in this way the firefighters can still reach all solar panels during their operation,” the Dutch experts said, adding that a safe space must be maintained between the PV system compartments, also in residential installations. “What is also very important if a fire breaks out is that the firefighters can find all information about the existing PV system in the meter cupboard or at the entrance of the building,” they explained. This should help the firefighters identify the location of the inverter, the possible presence of a storage system, and a fireman’s switch.
The guide is said to be a working paper that will be updated constantly according to adjustments in regulations and technology.
In September 2018, the Netherlands enterprise agency Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) tasked the TNO to conduct an investigation into fire accidents involving rooftop PV systems reported by Dutch media at the time. In April 2019, the research institute ended its investigation and stated that around 70% of the fires were caused by faulty connectors, and especially by cross-mating, which happens when connectors of different kinds are mated.
In December, Underwriters Laboratories, a U.S. nonprofit standards development organization, published the new UL 3741 safety standard, which is related to the evaluation of PV hazard control functions.

Most of this capacity came from the State of Karnataka, which has installed 7355 MW. Karnataka is followed by Rajasthan (5473 MW) and Tamil Nadu (4404 MW) in installed PV capacity.
Sikkim, with just 0.07 MW, has the least grid-connected PV installation.
New grid-connected additions in fiscal 2020-21 are 4477 MW as of February 28. This compares to 9363 MW in 2017-18, 6529 MW in 2018-19, and 6447 MW in 2019-20.
Off-grid solar
In off-grid solar, the nation has installed a cumulative 79,48,219 solar lamps/lanterns, 1,723,479 solar home lighting systems, 830,373 solar street lights, 281,368 solar pumps, and 216 MWp solar power plants/packs as of February end this year.
Out of 216 MWp off-grid solar plant capacity, maximum is installed in Chattisgarh (31,373 kW), followed by Rajasthan (30,449 kW) and Kerala (16,078 kW).
Under PM-KUSUM Scheme, the government targets the installation of 20 lakh standalone solar pumps by December 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/25/abb-hits-5gw-milestone-in-delivering-solar-plant-automation-solutions-in-india/,"MARKETS,OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 25, 2021",ABB hits 5GW milestone in delivering solar plant automation solutions in India,"Swiss giant ABB has reached the cumulative 5 GW mark in providing programmable logic controller (PLC) based solar plant automation solutions in India. The company attributes this milestone to many significant solar power projects that it won across India for its utility-scale supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and string monitoring solutions.
ABB’s SCADA system, an automation control solution, helps in the efficient running of solar plants and enables plant operators to seamlessly monitor and analyze relevant solar project data in one place.
“This milestone reinforces ABB’s next level strategy of driving the renewable energy revolution with market-focused technologies. The recent measures unveiled by the Indian government in its annual budget will boost local manufacturing, encourage new investments, and address the challenge of availability of funds for setting up solar plants in India,” said AR Madhusudan, president-drive products, Motion, ABB India Ltd.
“This is a positive move for the industry and will catalyze India’s plans of generating 100 GW of solar power by 2022. We, at ABB, will continue to play a key role in achieving this target,” he added.
As solar power contributes to the increasingly growing share of the energy mix, the system component technology is continuously evolving to help lower the cost of energy production. Some of the crucial requirements from solar plant operators are constant supervision of the production, maximization of the solar energy yield, real-time information about the system status, and grid code compliance.
Delivered as a part of ABB’s Drive Products offering, the Utility-scale SCADA solutions reduce the cost and risk of investment in operating photovoltaic (PV) power plants. In most utility-scale solar PV projects, string boxes are fitted with monitoring systems that perform different kinds of protection, performance and efficiency monitoring. ABB’s string monitoring solutions reduce downtime and increase productivity, while improving the safety of PV panels, and the entire plant.
With tracking devices, the energy production of a PV plant can increase up to 30% in optimal locations. ABB’s AC500 PLC, part of the automation solution, uses high-precision solar algorithms to ensure all type of trackers precisely align and follow the movement of the sun with exceptional accuracy.
ABB has a strong footprint in the solar segment and has partnered with major EPC firms that are building projects across India, including Sterling Wilson, BELECTRIC, Vikram Solar and Mahindra Susten.
