The IPO includes  a fresh issue of equity shares worth INR 1,350 crore  (US$182.6 million) and an offer for sale of 4 million shares by existing shareholders and promoters. Currently, Waaree Energies has a solar module manufacturing capacity of 2 GW at its plants in Gujarat.
Jharkhand starts getting 200 MW solar power from Gujarat 
The state of Jharkhand, which has been facing electricity demand-supply gap of 200 to 500 MW for the last few day, has started getting 200 MW of solar power from Gujarat. The State discom Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited is getting solar electricity at a price of INR 2.5/kWh under a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) signed in July 2018. As per the agreement, SECI will supply 700 MW of solar power to JBVNL at this rate for a period of 25 years. The balance 500 MW is likely to be supplied starting July in a phased manner.

A Dutch consortium led by the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and the social housing organization Woningcorporaties, has connected an existing residential building located at TU Delft’s campus to an underground hydrogen network that is now meeting all demand for space heating and hot water.
The project, called H2@Home, is the first of its kind in continental Europe as it combines an underground-pipeline hydrogen network similar to a natural gas network and hydrogen pipes that run through the building and are connected to an H2 heating boiler in the attic.
According to the research group, hydrogen has a lower energy density than natural gas and, when existing infrastructure is used, the hydrogen flow rate must be increased considerably in order to meet the same energy demand. “These high speeds and volumes are expected to result in noise pollution and undesirable resonances in the indoor installation,” they also warned. “Moreover, hydrogen is very flammable and colorless and odorless, which are all properties that require additional safety and management measures for the use of hydrogen.”

The building’s existing gas pressure regulators and the smart gas supply shut-off, which were not immediately suitable for the application of hydrogen, needed to be adjusted, as well as the gas meter and piping. Furthermore, the researchers added a communication module for the network operators to ensure the system’s safety, through monitoring.
Through the proposed configuration, the building’s residents should not perceive any difference in use, warmth, and comfort compared to a system based on a conventional central heating boiler.
The system and of all its components have been online since November and will be tested until July 2022.

Out of this, 75 MW is to be developed near Gurhah village in the Jalaun district and 50 MW at Gujrai in the Kanpur Dehat district.
SJVN won the capacity through tariff-based competitive bidding by quoting a price of INR 2.98/kWh (US$0.040/kWh) for both these projects. The power generated from these projects will be procured by UPNEDA for 25 years.
With the tariffs of solar and wind power projects going down, the State-owned hydropower producer sees development of hydro power projects, its core strength, becoming increasingly less viable. The company, therefore, is looking to increase its wind and solar energy project portfolio manifolds as it aims to become a 5 GW company by 2023, 12 GW by 2030 and 25 GW by 2040. It has been continuously looking for opportunities to set up solar, wind, hybrid (solar plus wind), floating solar, and ocean hybrid projects pan India through competitive bidding processes.
