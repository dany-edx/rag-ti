Longi has introduced its new Hi-MO X6 Guardian C&I module at Sydney’s Smart Energy Conference.
The module for the the Australian market allows water to run freely off its surface, so dusty residue does not build up around the edges where the frame meets the glass. However, the module still has traditional framing on its longer sides, so the modules must be mounted on a vertical axis, rather than horizontally.
The module uses back contact (BC) technology, which Longi fully transitioned its Australian ranges to in 2023. BC technology has advantages for panel efficiencies, as it reduces shading losses.
The Guardian module’s maximum power output is 590 W. It is big and particularly long, measuring 2,281 mm x 1,134 mm, and weighing in at 27.2 kg.
The company plans to launch a residential module with the same self-cleaning frame concept in the third quarter or fourth quarter of this year, with dimensions of about 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm.
In terms of cost, the company said the Hi-MO X6 Guardian comes in around AUD 0.30 ($0.20)/watt.
Later this month, Longi will also launch a new Ultra Black module to the residential Australian market, with a power output of 440 W. One of the Ultra Black panel’s features is that it is fingerprint-proof, making it easier for installers to handle without marking. Representatives for the company said this does not extend to fingertips covered in sunscreen or zinc, however.
Longi is not the only company in the Australian market with an anti-dust module based on a  lowered frame design. DAH Solar has been supplying its Full Screen module in the country since October 2023 through wholesaler Austra Energy. The DAH Full Screen module has all edges of its frame lowered to prevent the accumulation of dust and water.

The joint initiative will simplify access to key information and resources to help organizations start their net-zero building journey.
“At Mahindra, we strongly believe in operating as a ‘Planet Positive’ organization. The group has undertaken multiple initiatives to decarbonize our operational infrastructure—leading to both financially and environmentally value accretive outcomes. We also understand the critical role of collaboration in accelerating a sustainable future, and hence join hands with Johnson Controls, leaders in net zero building solutions, to share our learnings and best practices with everyone,” said Abanti Sankaranarayanan, chief group public affairs officer and group executive board member.
According to the International Energy Agency, three-quarters of India’s anticipated 2040 buildings have yet to be built. With the sector accounting for 20% of emissions and more than 30% of energy consumption in the country, the transition to smart and sustainable buildings is becoming an environmental and economic imperative.
“With India on the cusp of a building revolution, now is the time to actualize the benefits of smart and green buildings for India’s economy and society,” said George Oliver, Chairman and CEO of Johnson Controls. “The joining together of our two companies to develop this unique initiative is a natural fit—leveraging Johnson Controls’ leadership in smart building technology and Mahindra’s renowned multi-industry expertise and reach. We believe it will help guide and inspire a movement toward a more sustainable built environment, both in India and beyond.”
As part of the Net Zero Buildings Initiative, the two partners launched a free-of-cost, sustainable buildings toolkit and training in India. This will help building and facility owners learn about best practices of sustainable buildings, implement tools to assess building parameters, identify and implement conservation measures, and understand building regulations in India, available incentives, technology, financing models, and more.
“This collaboration is a statement of intent from the construction industry to support the Indian government’s journey towards the low-carbon pathway of development…Built infrastructure is responsible for 40% of the global energy related emissions today, and most of the built environment in India’s cities, is yet to be constructed. It is absolutely imperative that we integrate sustainability and climate resilience into the life cycle of the built environment,” said Hardeep Singh Puri, union minister for housing & urban affairs & minister for petroleum and natural gas.
Investing in energy efficient infrastructure can potentially reduce electricity consumption by 40-60% compared to conventional buildings. According to India Energy Outlook 2021, even a 30% improvement in energy efficiency from buildings can potentially save 250 TWh of electricity by 2030, which means significant electrical energy could be given back to the grid to further fuel economic growth.
Across Mahindra Group, Mahindra Holidays has increased energy efficiency by more than 50% across resorts, Mahindra Auto & Farm sector has increased energy productivity by more than 90% across factories, and Mahindra Lifespaces launched Mahindra Eden, India’s first Net Zero Energy Residential building, that is expected to save over 1.8M kWh electricity annually. Similarly, Mahindra Logistics is investing to build energy efficient warehouses.
As part of the initiative, Mahindra and Johnson Controls will work closely with Indian national and state governments, think-tanks and industry associations, providing greater visibility on building data to aid in climate progress reporting and formulating strategies and frameworks.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/06/delta-electronics-explores-indias-renewable-energy-landscape-from-lithium-batteries-to-green-hydrogen/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GREEN HYDROGEN,HYDROGEN,HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS,INVERTERS,MARKETS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,2024-03-06,Delta Electronics explores India’s renewable energy landscape from lithium batteries to green hydrogen,"How is your containerized data center solution powered? For remote areas where grid electricity is not available, does it provide the option for renewable energy integration?
With the innovation happening and the technology taking another leap, the integration of renewable sources is becoming more relevant, more sustainable, and also cost-effective. The returns of investment into renewables are also becoming possible now as India has started to produce solar panels and other components. So now the business case of deploying a renewable or integrating a renewable energy source into the solutions that go into the remote areas is becoming more and more prominent. We can see that happening in telecom.
Currently, our containerized data center solution is powered by grid supply. When the grid supply is not available, we have the battery as a second solution, and when the battery exhausts, we have to switch over to the generators at this moment.
Do you manufacture lithium batteries in India?
We have started our new business to produce lithium batteries in India. We already have a large facility of lithium-ion batteries in Taiwan, which is a business that we acquired from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 2014 and moved their manufacturing plant from Japan to Taiwan. It’s a very highly automated plant.
And with that learning of almost 8-9 years, now we have started to produce lithium-ion batteries in India. However, for lithium-ion battery production in India, we still import the battery module cells from our global factories. Gradually, when the business and the volumes grow, we’ll start to think about producing cells as well.
What are your plans for solar energy storage solutions?
The first and foremost application where we are using the lithium-ion battery is telecom. And in telecom, we have a large market share with over 1 million installations done over around 700K towers in the country. All these 1 million installations require a battery backup.
For the batteries that we are producing at our Krishnagiri plant in Tamil Nadu, telecom is one of the first applications that we’re trying to serve. Besides that, UPS also need a lithium-ion battery solution and people are now graduating from the normal conventional VRLA batteries to lithium-ion batteries. So, that’s the second application [for our li-ion batteries], along with the data center applications. Even here, we use the lithium-ion batteries which we produce by ourselves.
And then gradually, battery energy storage systems will certainly become an area of importance for us. Once we have more competence and more opportunities in the marketplace, of course we’ll see to do that as well because globally we have that competence of doing large MW-scale BESS solutions.
We are frontrunners in adopting LIB technology worldwide. So it’s already in our domain. But, in India, it may take more time as we’re just starting for the telecom power and the data centers.
Delta Electronics manufactures PV inverters in India. What’s your strategy in this segment to counter the competition?
This is one area where we have been constantly working to develop new designs in terms of central inverters and string inverters. Globally, we have lots of competence, but in India we have developed these solutions right from scratch, going up to MW scale. The first inverter that we designed in India was 1 MW. Now we have a range from very small rating of inverters going up to 2.5 MW.
There are certain innovative designs under R&D in India and also globally. We are a large company, so we have procurement efficiency as well and also lots of components are being done by ourselves in terms of thermal management. With our strengths in manufacturing and scale of procurement, clubbed with a very large domestic market opportunity, I think in the coming times we should be able to attempt to this market more efficiently.
What are Delta Electronics’ green hydrogen plans for India?
Delta Electronics, Inc. has unveiled ambitious green hydrogen plans for India through a groundbreaking collaboration with Ceres Power Limited, a subsidiary of London Stock Exchange-listed Ceres Power Holdings plc. This long-term agreement, valued at approximately GBP43 million, encompasses technology transfer and licensing, granting Delta access to Ceres’ cutting-edge hydrogen energy stack technology portfolio.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/06/u-s-solar-up-52-in-2023-as-nation-deploys-35-3-gw-of-capacity/,"MARKETS,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,2024-03-06,U.S. solar up 52% in 2023 as nation deploys 35.3 GW of capacity,"From pv magazine USA
The U.S. deployed 35.3 GW of new solar capacity in 2023, an increase of 52% versus the 23 GW deployed in 2022. Despite lower electricity demand, significant declines in both wind and hydro generation resulted in minimal growth in total clean electricity.
The data was released by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), along with The Business Council for Sustainable Energy, in their Sustainable Energy in America 2024 Factbook.

For the year, the U.S. set a record in utility scale solar, deploying 23.7GW of capacity, some of which were projects delayed from the previous year due to supply chain issues. Small scale solar totaled nearly 11.6GW of capacity, a record as well. The total capacity deployed, 35.3 GW, was 52% greater than the new capacity of just under 24 GW in 2022.
The Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) and Wood Mackenzie Renewables & Power project at least 50 GW of solar being deployed in 2024.
Along with the solar, seven GW of wind was deployed, and 7.5 GW of battery storage. The battery capacity deployment increased by 62% over the prior year, bringing the nation’s total deployed capacity to 19.6 GW. In 2024, the EIA sees 15.3 GW of new battery capacity being deployed, which would be a 78% expansion of the nation’s battery fleet.
In total, demand for electricity fell 2.2% from 2022, even while the nation’s GDP expanded by 2.4%. The report notes that, with these two pieces of data taken together, U.S. energy productivity (the ratio of US GDP to total U.S. energy consumption) increased by 3.8% year-on-year. In fact, since 1990, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for electricity has been slowly decreasing, hitting 1.0% in 2023 – while the nation’s GDP has grown over 400% during that period.

The addition of significant new wind and solar capacity, combined with steady electricity demand, has contributed to a reduction in emissions from both the sector and the nation as a whole.
Collectively, low-emissions electricity sources, excluding nuclear, saw a marginal increase from 962 TWh to 972 TWh of generation. The flat growth was a balance of hydroelectricity falling by just over 6%, while wind fell by almost 2%. Overall, accounting for the 1% growth and a 2% decrease in electricity demand, renewables met 23% of all generation, setting a new record. Adding in nuclear power, 41.1% of all electricity generated was from zero-carbon sources, another all-time high.

One reason for the large volume of deployment growth in 2023 was a rebound from the slowdown in 2022 due to COVID and supply chain constraints. The biggest price increase was in solar modules, with pricing heavily influenced by a significant increase in polysilicon costs. However, since then, polysilicon prices have dropped sharply, with module prices remaining near record lows for the past several months.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/06/new-approach-to-improve-mppt-in-partially-shaded-pv-systems-operating-at-high-temperatures/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-06,New approach to improve MPPT in partially shaded PV systems operating at high temperatures,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Al-Ahliyya Amman University in Jordan and the Addis Ababa Science and Technology University in Ethiopia have developed a new methodology to track global maximum power point (GMPP) in partially shaded PV systems.
The GMPP defines the ability of an inverter to sweep the IV curve of a PV system and identify the array voltage at which the global maximum power point occurs. When a PV system is under partially shaded conditions, its output power-voltage characteristic curve generates multiple local peaks. Under these conditions, the conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) methods could fail to maximize the output power as they track the local maximum power point (MPP) instead of the global MPP (GMPP).
“Our model yields benefits by simulating 33% less power loss, showcasing a capitalization that is less than three times compared to alternative stability methods,” the scientists said.
The proposed methodology is based on the genetic algorithm (GA), which is able to solve constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution, and the backstepping controller (BSC), which is a recursive technique that is commonly utilized to extract the maximum power from the PV system. It works by breaking down the nonlinear control problem into a series of simpler subsystems.
The BSC algorithm adjusts the pulse width modulation (PWM) signal, which governs the system’s operation through the converter connected to the load, while the GA algorithm computes the BSC gains to achieve an optimal PV system outcome. “The main objective is to ascertain the ideal voltage of the photovoltaic (PV) module, which is constrained within the range of 0 V and the open-circuit voltage,” the researchers explained.
The group tested the novel approach in a simulated PV system located in Maroua, Cameroon. It consisted of three 55 W panels interconnected in series, a DC–DC converter, and a resistive load with a value of 150 Ω. “There is a noticeable and significant rise in temperature in the specified area, characterized by arid conditions and high temperatures similar to those found in a semi-desert climate,” the academics explained.
They said the proposed technique was able to achieve the PV system stabilization in just 0.06 seconds while showing “exceptional” resilience. They also noted, however, that the new methodology has to be validated by future experiments. “Our method accurately detected and mitigated partial shading effects, aiming for the global maximum power point to minimize energy loss,” they concluded.
Their findings were introduced in the paper “Enhancing MPPT performance for partially shaded photovoltaic arrays through backstepping control with Genetic Algorithm-optimized gains,” published in Scientific Reports.
