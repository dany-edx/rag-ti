Ltd for solar projects aggregating to 1.2 GW capacity. Out of the PPA capacity, 1 GW of solar projects can be developed anywhere in the country, while the balance of 200 MW of solar projects are to be developed in Punjab.
These projects will be developed within 18 months on a build-own-operate basis and will involve an investment of around INR 7,000 crore, stated SJVN.
The Letter of Intent for these 1.2 GW of projects was received from PSPCL on July 21, 2023.
The projects are expected to generate 2,997 million units in the first year and about 69,661 million units cumulatively over a period of 25 years. The commissioning of these projects will help to offset more than 34 lakh tonnes of carbon emission.

Revenue for Q1 FY24 stood at INR 1,517 million, 47% up year-on-year from INR 1,029 million in Q1 FY23. EBITDA was up 179% YoY to INR 437 million. Profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter grew 2% YoY to INR 102 million.
Gensol Engineering offers engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services for developing solar power plants. It has installed ground-mounted and rooftop solar power plants with a combined capacity of over 590 MW. Expanding its operations, Gensol has also established an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing facility in Pune, India, to develop and produce electric three-wheelers and four-wheelers.
In March this year, Gensol announced the acquisition of Pune-based Scorpius Trackers. The purchase allows Gensol Engineering to offer a comprehensive solar EPC package that includes Scorpius Trackers’ innovative solar tracking technology.

The cluster includes projects totaling 2.14 GW, all commissioned by Adani Green Energy.
The cluster spans an area of 11,500 acres. The PV capacity is built with around 5.8 million solar modules of 535 Wp each, with fixed-tilt module mounting structures used for 40% of the overall PV capacity and 60% with trackers. A total of 353 wind-turbine generators have also been put into operation.
Adani Green Energy is now working to develop 15 GW of hybrid solar-wind projects at Khavda in Gujarat. The cluster, housing almost seven times the hybrid generation capacity of the Jaisalmer cluster, will span 70,500 acres and employ 33.6 million PV modules of 570+ Wp each, trackers with robotic cleaning, and 375 wind-turbine generators (5X machines).

“Its smart home energy management platform integrates a cloud-based battery management system (BMS), providing multiple safety protections and fault warnings for homeowners,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The unique sodium-ion (SIB) active balancing technology effectively extends the battery’s cycle life, allowing users to use the product for a longer duration.”
The I.Power Nest solution measure 600 mm x 810 mm x 155 mm and weighs 60 kg. The devices have an efficiency of 97% and an expected lifetime of more than 3,000 cycles. Their cell capacity is 75 Ah and the rated battery voltage is 48 V. The maximum DC power is 6 kW and the maximum input voltage is 500 V.
The batteries also have an MPPT voltage range of 120 V to 450 V and a maximum MPPT input current of 13 A. In addition, they feature IP21 enclosures and a cooling system based on forced air.
“An intelligent app enables users to effortlessly control home electricity usage and switch between various operating modes, making electricity usage more convenient and worry-free,” said Biwatt Power.
The company is based in Shenzhen, in China’s Guangdong province. It manufactures batteries and integrated technologies for solar energy storage and EV charging.

The team, led by the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT) and Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, addressed challenges posed by the non-radiative recombination of photogenerated carriers and sluggish reaction kinetics of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting by creating a novel Fe-doped Ni3S2/Ni foil/OHP photoanode. The group said that this involved synthesizing a Fe-doped Ni3S2 catalyst for OER on Ni foil, fabricating OHP photovoltaic cells with SnO2 electron transport layers (ETLs), and combining them to produce the photoanode. The researchers achieved an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 12.79% for the fabricated photoanodes and improved stability by adding glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTMACl) to the anode.
China’s National Standards Committee, along with the National Energy Administration and five other departments, has issued the “Hydrogen Energy Industry Standard System Construction Guidelines” to establish a national-level standard system across the entire hydrogen industrial chain. The guidelines cover issues related to safety, hydrogen preparation, storage and transmission, refueling, and applications.
The German government has allocated €211.8 billion ($232.9 billion) to promote the energy transition and climate protection from 2024 to 2027. Approximately €63.5 billion will be used to alleviate the burden on citizens and companies, around €60.7 billion will support building subsidies, and about €18.6 billion will foster hydrogen industry development. Around €13.8 billion will advance electromobility, and €12.5 billion will enhance rail infrastructure, said the German government.
LNVG, the world’s first company to employ hydrogen trains, says that it will replace all diesel trains between the Ems and Elbe rivers in Germany with battery-powered trains. Lower Saxony Transport Minister Olaf Lies said that by 2029, 102 new multiple-unit trains with battery technology will be introduced, gradually phasing out diesel fleets. Battery-operated trains are advantageous due to reduced infrastructure requirements, eliminating the need for overhead contact wires along the entire route.
