“This algorithm is designed to be adaptable to any scenario derived by setting certain parameters in the generalized series-parallel PV array model,” the research’s corresponding author, Shashank Kumar, told pv magazine. “It’s important to note, however, that it may not be directly applicable to configurations that cannot be converted into this generalized model.”
The GMPP defines the ability of an inverter to sweep the IV curve of a PV system and identify the array voltage at which the global maximum power point occurs. When a PV system is under partially shaded conditions, its output power-voltage characteristic curve generates multiple local peaks. Under these conditions, the conventional MPPT methods could fail to maximize the output power as they track the local maximum power point (MPP) instead of the global MPP (GMPP).
In the study “A novel GMPP estimation technique for series parallel connected partially shaded PV array,” published in Solar Compass, the researchers explained that an accurate estimation of the GMPP of a solar power generator under partially shaded conditions is more difficult to achieve than under uniform irradiance conditions, due to the presence of multiple peaks or local maximum power points (LMPPs) in the power-voltage curve.
The proposed method utilizes PV module parameters such as connecting wires and diodes, as well as irradiance and temperature as input data.
It also uses a series of equations to find and sort all of the relevant zero points of the PV array. “It could be said that zero-points approximate the points where the 𝑃 − 𝑉 or 𝐼 − 𝑉 curve of the array changes its shape due to partial shading condition,” the academics explained.
The novel approach also offers a mathematical expression for the iteration voltage based on a generally observed property of LMPPs.
To test the new technique, the researchers ran 2,000 randomly generated partially shaded cases over their generalized model. Half of the cases looked at a 3 x 2 PV array using 252 W modules, with the other half referring to a 4 × 2 PV array with the same modules.
“In 3×2 PV array irradiances of all 6 modules are generated randomly in the range of 100–1100 𝑊 ∕ 𝑚 2 for every single case of 1,000 cases. All the diodes and modules in 3 ×2 PV array are at the temperature of 25 C,” the scientists added. “All the parameters of diodes and temperatures of 4×2 PV array are different, however, irradiances of 8 modules are randomly generated in the range of 100–1100 𝑊 ∕ 𝑚 2 for every case of 1000 cases.”

The researchers found that, in all of the 2,000 simulated cases, the maximum errors and the root mean square (RMS) errors were less than 1%. For the 3 × 2 PV system, the average computational time for each case was 0.3398 seconds. For the 4 × 2 arrays, that time was 1.23 seconds.
To validate their results, the scientists also built an experimental setup and compared their observations from it with the algorithm fed with the same data. “It is seen that the error in the GMPP power obtained using the proposed method is 2.5706% with respect to the GMPP obtained experimentally, which is well within the limit,” they concluded.
“Future enhancements are in the pipeline for the GMPP estimation method. My aim is to develop a more compact formula for GMPP specifically tailored for this generalized model,” Kumar stated.

EDF Renewables North America is among the largest developers in North America, with over 35 years of experience and a portfolio that currently consists of 16 GW of developed projects and 13 GW under service contracts.
The company announced an agreement with Solarcycle, a technology-based solar recycling company, to recycle solar panels damaged or broken during construction and operation.
With the rapid growth in solar energy in the U.S., there is also growing concern about what will happen to solar panels at the end of their useful life. Without an increase in solar recycling, the U.S. will contribute 10 million metric tons of trash in landfills and other waste facilities by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). To put into context, the U.S. dumps almost 140 million tons of waste each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
“As a company, we have committed to developing the recycling capability of our clean energy assets, starting with solar,” said Edgar Puerto, associate director, strategic procurement at EDF Renewables. “We view this as a key strategy for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and catalyzing a new domestic supply chain for made-in-America solar products.”  
Solarcycle reports that its proprietary technology allows for the extraction of 95% of the value from recycled panels, including silver, silicon, copper, aluminum, and glass. After extracting the raw materials from the solar panels, Solarcycle intends to sell the materials for the next wave of solar manufacturing in the U.S.
Solarcycle currently has facilities in Odessa, Texas and Mesa, Ariz. Jesse Simons, chief commercial officer and co-founder, told pv magazine USA that the company intends to break ground on a third in the Southeast soon. The intention is to have a facility within 500 miles of 80% of the installed solar in the U.S.
“We have a team of reverse logistics professionals who are experts in optimizing the number of panels on a truck to ensure we are using the fewest number of trips in order to bring panels to our sites, lowering costs and lowering carbon emissions,” said Simons.
The company has performed a lifecycle assessment, which determined that the carbon benefits of Solarcycle’s recycling process, which requires centralization and scale, far outweigh the carbon involved in transport.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/08/india-will-overtake-southeast-asia-as-the-second-largest-module-producer-by-2025/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,EUROPE,INDIA,MALAYSIA,THAILAND,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",India will overtake Southeast Asia as the second-largest solar module producer by 2025,"A Wood Mac report forecasts that India will overtake Southeast Asia as the second-largest module production region by 2025. The nation is experiencing a strong build out in solar manufacturing, thanks to strong government policy in the form of PLI incentives.
The report, “How will China’s expansion affect global solar module supply chains?,” finds that China’s policy support for and investment in manufacturing across the solar supply chain will keep the country on top in terms of capacity through 2026.
China has invested an estimated $130 billion into its solar industry this year, according to the Wood Mackenzie report. With more than 1 TW of wafer, cell and module forecast to come online in the next year, China will have enough capacity to meet global demand through 2032, the report says.
“China’s solar manufacturing expansion has been driven by high margins for polysilicon, technology upgrades and policy support,” said Huaiyan Sun, senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie, and author of the report. “And despite strong government initiatives for developing local manufacturing in overseas markets, China will still dominate the global solar supply chain and continue to widen the technology and cost gap with competitors.”
The report forecasts that China will hold more than 80% of the world’s polysilicon, wafer, cell, and module manufacturing capacity from 2023 to 2026. In addition, not only will the country dominate in capacity, its product will come at a lower cost. For example, the report says that a module made in China is half the price of that made in Europe and 65% less than that made in the U.S.

This comes as no surprise because, as noted at the recent pv magazine Roundtables US 2023, building a supply chain takes time. It has been just over a year since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S., which includes $370 billion to support renewable energy build out. Expert panelists noted that they expect the U.S. to be heavy with downstream solar manufacturing, and “we’ll have to continue to rely on imports from foreign partners for polysilicon, ingots and wafers to the U.S.,” said MJ Shiao, vice president of supply chain and manufacturing for the American Clean Power Association. Shiao estimated that it can take from three to five years to build new polysilicon manufacturing.
The buildout of U.S. solar manufacturing will begin with modules, which Shiao said is the smart way to go to ensure that we meet the downstream demand, then start to look for more of the upstream part of the supply chain to meet domestic demand. But upstream manufacturing takes time, the panelists agreed.
“Despite considerable module expansion plans, overseas markets still cannot eliminate their dependence on China for wafers and cells in the next three years,” Sun said.
The U.S. isn’t the only region seeking wafer and cell capacity. As seen in the chart below, Europe and the U.S. both have polysilicon and module capacity, but fall far short in wafers and cell. Southeast Asia, on the other hand, has nearly matched capacity for cells and modules, with India not far behind.
As other regions are slower to ramp up cell production, China will continue to be the leader in capacity, holding an estimated 17 times more cell capacity than the rest of the world.
However, it is not without its challenges. The report notes that China has recently announced the termination of more than 70 GW in capacity due to oversupply and competition. This mainly concerns old production lines that produce lower efficiency p-type and M6 cells. Wood Mac analysts expect p-type cells to decline to just 17% of supply by 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/08/europe-should-produce-its-own-green-hydrogen/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,NORTHERN AFRICA",,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",Europe should produce its own green hydrogen,"In recent years, the idea of importing green hydrogen from North Africa has surfaced as a potential avenue to bolster Europe’s clean energy mix. Much of this was driven by the idea that the processes of both producing green energy, and converting it to hydrogen, were prohibitively expensive in Europe. For many in Europe, the focus quickly shifted to countries where producing renewables would be cheaper than at home.
The arid expanses of North Africa offer abundant sunlight and vast tracts of land to house solar installations, driving down one of the main costs of producing renewable hydrogen. Falling European solar and wind costs, however, along with the benefits of not needing to transport green hydrogen long distances, actually paint a much more positive picture of producing the energy carrier domestically, in Europe. With green energy costs expected to sink below €0.02 ($0.02)/kWh by 2038, the cost benefit currently attributed to North Africa should fade in a major way.
Understandably, cost dynamics play a pivotal role in the green hydrogen business case but energy production contributes only part of the final cost. The expense associated with shipping hydrogen over long distances could significantly hinder its economic viability. Transporting hydrogen from North Africa to European shores entails a complex, energy-intensive process, whether via pipelines or ships. Shipping alone could increase the average end price by a staggering 50-150%. This logistical hurdle not only drives up costs but also increases the carbon footprint of green hydrogen, tarnishing its clean energy credentials. Add in the geopolitical risks associated with importing green hydrogen and its perceived benefits fade quickly.
On the other hand, locally generated green hydrogen, in Europe, has a number of distinct advantages. For one, a Europeanwide network of pipelines is currently being developed to support the cost effective rollout of green hydrogen. Immediate proximity to the market not only slashes transportation costs but also enhances demand responsiveness, a crucial factor in the evolving energy landscape and one which contributes to the very important issue of European energy security. Moreover, local production stimulates economic growth, creating jobs, and fostering a self-sufficient energy ecosystem.
Environmentally, the case for local production is equally as compelling. Europe has been making significant strides in harnessing renewable energy in recent years, with a rapidly expanding network of solar and wind installations. These renewables resources are instrumental in powering electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen, ensuring a low-carbon production process. Additionally, advancements in technology will continue to drive down the cost of green hydrogen production in Europe, making it an increasingly competitive option.
Investing in local green hydrogen production also augments Europe’s energy security. Relying on imports, particularly from politically volatile regions, could jeopardize the steady supply of green hydrogen. That is a risk that could be mitigated by domestic production. The extremely difficult energy challenges that sprung from the war in Ukraine should ensure that the importance of this factor is not overlooked in the near future.
Lastly, nurturing a robust local green hydrogen industry can position Europe as a global leader in clean energy technology. Although the continent still remains an important R&D hub for much technology, it has ceded a large slice of green energy production to third countries, particularly China. European green hydrogen would not only showcase the region’s commitment to combating climate change but also set a precedent for other markets to follow suit, hopefully providing a blueprint for a more decentralized global energy system.
One question that remains, and which represents a significant hurdle to securing widespread funding and support for European green hydrogen, is identifying and proving initial customers for the energy carrier. Thankfully, this has already been a key topic for many of the companies pioneering the European green hydrogen market. The initial targets for hydrogen producers are industrial players which can realize significant sustainability gains through a switch to the green energy carrier. Steel and glass are two particularly fitting heavy industries.
Beyond those heavy emitters, which, due to their immense heat demands, can represent a cumbersome switch, there are many applications that can easily be converted to green hydrogen without much effort. These include the chemical industry, where green hydrogen can simply replace fossil fuel derived “grey” hydrogen; and powering industrial vehicles such as forklifts, at logistics depots, and delivery trucks for commercial fleets.
While North Africa may promise a wealth of cheap green energy, it is becoming clear that the profitability, as well as the environmental sustainability, of importing green hydrogen across the Mediterranean is quickly fading. As regulations such as the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) come into effect, we should see a distinct rebalancing in terms of what will best contribute to Europe’s green ambitions. From 2026 onwards, H2 and its derivate products will need to fully report and pay into the CBAM.
Perhaps North Africa’s ambitious green hydrogen plans can be better applied to the region’s own expansion aims rather than being used as a crutch for a European industrial sector that is apprehensive about pushing the innovation agenda on its own shores.
With the cost of producing this important material here in Europe continually sinking, now is the time to position domestic suppliers to scale the technology at the earliest chance they can get. Europe has the opportunity to once again take a leadership role in a vital sector of our future energy system. This will rely on regulators and industry leaders aligning on a path forward – something which is easier said than done.
The global green hydrogen rollout is still in its early days and Europe should take this opportunity to jump in and help shape this industry of the future. The long term benefits of opting for a domestic green hydrogen industry, rather than relying once again on energy imports, will be far reaching and will help Europe make a strong push to re-establish itself as a major industrial player on the world stage.
