For the agrivoltaics sector to thrive, measures to safeguard farming communities and agricultural production should be a key part of the policy and regulatory reforms that the sector needs, says report author and IEEFA guest contributor Dr Charles Worringham.
Agrivoltaics refers to pairing farming with solar power generation in ways that maintain agricultural productivity. Sixty percent of India’s land area is farmed, half as much again as the world average. Given that, agrivoltaics in India is better placed than in most countries to relieve pressure on other land and ecosystems due to solar adoption.

The report, “Agrivoltaics in India: Fertile Ground?,” says agrivoltaics could help India accelerate the renewable energy roll-out by distributing it throughout the country at a variety of scales, relieve the pressure of renewable energy facilities on sensitive lands and ecosystems, and contribute to a stronger and more diverse rural economy.   
Noting that experience elsewhere has shown that certain crops can tolerate moderate shading and that during extreme heat some may even benefit from lower temperatures and improved soil moisture, Worringham pointed to the features that work in India’s favor.
With nearly 20 projects underway using a variety of panel configurations, India has already started a research effort to establish what specific methods, crops, and conditions work best, at commercial facilities and public bodies such as the Central Arid Zone Research Institute, he says.
The report highlights policy challenges that must be addressed if agrivoltaics is to reach its full potential.
Worringham noted wide agreement on some necessary reforms. A new agrivoltaic land-use classification is essential, as farmland must generally be reclassified for commercial use if it is to host any solar generation. 
“A classification based on the definition used by the French, of an agrivoltaic project as one that is primarily agricultural, and secondarily produces solar energy, and creates synergies between the two would be a good starting point for a special class of land use,” he says.  
Farming communities could not only earn additional income from selling any power they generate but also use some of that power to add value to their produce and reduce wastage, for example by powering drying, cleaning, milling, local refrigeration, and establishing cold chains.   
Given that and the unreliable grid electricity, the report suggests that new policies should prioritize retention of land and ownership of the project by farmers themselves, and be flexible enough to allow the sale of the power or self-consumption.
The report states India enjoys the advantage of being able to select from the technical and policy developments that have been hard-won elsewhere. 
According to it, vertical bifacial arrays could be a particularly attractive option for agrivoltaics developers in India. When mounted vertically, like fences facing east and west, they produce peak power in the morning and afternoon, unlike horizontal panels that peak at midday.
“This configuration can help the grid by producing power closer to peak demand time, which is typically in the evening. This might allow certain loads like residential cooling to be brought forward a little and use that power directly, or by shortening the time between generation and use, make battery storage easier and more flexible,” says Worringham. 
“For farmers, this layout can give better access for machinery and allow panels to stay cleaner for longer.” 
The report also highlighted policies and rules that other countries have introduced, some of which may transfer well to Indian circumstances.
“It’s very important that India protects productive agricultural land. Other countries have found out the hard way that unregulated agrivoltaics can lead to problems, such as when Taiwanese rice farmers crammed in too much solar capacity because the power made them much more money than their crops.  
“The government had to step in and allow projects only where any decline in yield is within specified limits, and set regulations such as minimum panel heights. Japan and various U.S. states have similar regulations. The Union ministries and states can benefit from these experiences by crafting sensible rules at the outset.”
Other recommendations in the report address financial incentives, governance, and standards.

Engineering firm Schlaich Bergermann Partner (sbp sonne) has had a 50kW prototype of its floating photovoltaic system in the water in Hungary since mid-October. The system does not consist of small plastic floats that are connected to each other; instead, it is comprised of 40-meter-long and 80-centimeter-thick membrane tubes that are only inflated during installation on site. This offers a whole range of advantages over other systems, according to sbp’s engineers.
In the design, two tubes are inflated parallel to each other. A steel frame with a width of 4.5 meters is attached between them, to which the modules are fitted. Over the length of the tube, 24 PV modules can be added. Unlike the prototype, where only four pairs of tubes were installed, 25 pairs of tubes are to be connected to form an island.
Two such islands next to each other will then form a block of one-megawatt power, with the power electronics on board. The dimensions of a one-megawatt block would be 80 meters in length and up to 108 meters in width. On one half of such a block, 2,708 square meters of module area would come to 4,320 square meters of gross area. This corresponds to a space utilization factor of around 63%.

In an interview with pv magazine, Markus Balz, managing director of the sbp Sonne office said that they have designed the first floating system optimized for bifacial PV modules. This is because a light-colored membrane layer with an albedo value of over 0.6 is stretched underneath the steel frame, meaning that 60% of the light is reflected by the membrane.
For comparison, 0.8 is roughly equivalent to the albedo value of freshly fallen snow. Water surfaces usually have an albedo value of 0.1 and are therefore not really suitable for the use of bifacial modules. To ensure that the membrane also receives enough direct sunlight, sbp Sonne chose the spacing between the modules at an optimal ratio of 50 millimeters. “We had to give the modules some spacing so they wouldn’t collide with each other in bad weather,” Balz explained. “That’s when we optimized the spacing between the modules right away for use with bifacial modules.”
Transport can also be improved with the inflatable system. Logistics are quite expensive with floats made of blow-molded plastic, as they take up a lot of space. The inflatable tubes, on the other hand, can be folded up. This allows floating photovoltaic construction material to be transported in a shipping container for three times the capacity of a conventional system. The tubes are also said to offer better protection from waves and wind. Because of the elongated shape, the tubes can partially conform to the shape of the waves, compensating for some of the movement. In addition, this hull shape provides less surface area to attack than small-scale rectangular systems, so anchors and mooring can be sized somewhat smaller.
If the waters were calm, only a few millibars would be pumped into the tubes. Since these are very large, they would still appear hard to humans. When the forces of nature become much more noticeable and the wind picks up, the tubes can be inflated to higher pressures via integrated pumps. The increased pressure, however, results in a very high rigidity of the system, he said. “Similar to a single-axis tracker, we also want to increase the stiffness of the floating system when the wind loads become greater,” Balz continued. By making the pressure in the tubes adaptive, the material can be spared from premature wear, when the weather does not demand particularly high stiffness.
A weather station on board the system monitors wind speed and wave action and can thus autonomously decide whether to inflate the tubes. Since the system inflates itself in case of danger and the prototype was built near the membrane manufacturer’s site in Hungary, sbp Sonne named its system “Gömbhal” – Hungarian for pufferfish.
Should air ever escape from one of the tubes, they would initially be protected by an adjacent parallel tube. Should all the air escape from a double tube, the system would still be buoyant, Balz said. At the 50-kilowatt pilot plant in Hungary, air has already been let out of one of the tubes to exchange it while the plant was floating on the water. The test worked flawlessly, he said.
Over the next year, the engineers plan to collect data. To do that, all sorts of sensors have been attached to the system. This is to determine whether the assumptions about the increased bifaciality also correspond to real-world conditions. The engineers at sbp are already confident about the static properties of the system and say that nothing stands in the way of commercial sales of these systems. According to Balz, the company is already in talks with the first project developers and EPC companies but is also open to other interested parties.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/07/canadian-bipv-module-maker-releases-790-w-panel/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 7, 2021",Canadian BIPV module maker releases 790 W panel,"From pv magazine International
Mitrex Integrated Solar Technology, a Canadian building-integrated PV module producer, has released a new 790 W panel with a power conversion efficiency of 19.5%.
The Mega HP M790-M1F module is the company’s most powerful product. It combines two 395 W panels fused in a single device. It is built with 144 monocrystalline cells with an efficiency of 22.5%, 3.2 mm tempered glass, and an IP68 enclosure.
The panel measures 2,036 mm x 1,992 mm x 40 mm and weighs in at 42 kg. It can operate with a system voltage of 1,000 V and has a power temperature coefficient of -0.36% per degree Celsius. The open-circuit voltage is 96.2 V and the short-circuit current is 9.86 A.
“During the first year, Mitrex warrants the actual power output of the products will be no less than 97% of the labeled power output,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “From year two to year 25, the actual annual power decline will be no more than .7% by the end of year 25. By the end of year 25, the actual power output will be no less than 80% of the labeled power output.”
Mitrex produces the panels at its facility in Toronto. It said it is using its patented anti-reflecting technology, which involves color-treating the glass through pigments that are fused into the glass itself.
“The glass coating materials are characterized by high solar transmittance, minimal absorption, and increased durability,” the manufacturer said on its website, in reference to the colored layers. “Treated glass can have reflective, semi-reflective, or matte surfaces, depending on the product’s aesthetic requirements.”
Mitrex also makes smaller solar modules, as well as PV facades, solar cladding, solar glass and BIPV systems.
