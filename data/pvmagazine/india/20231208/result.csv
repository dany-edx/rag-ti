https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/08/china-module-prices-slide-to-new-record-low-manufacturers-cut-production/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"DECEMBER 8, 2023","China module prices slide to new record low, manufacturers cut production","The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for mono PERC modules from China, was assessed at $0.123 per W, down $0.003/W week on week, while TOPCon module prices fell $0.004/W to $0.131/W. These new record lows come amid muted year-end demand as module makers cut production.
Prices in China have seen particular declines. While most tier-1 players – including a top 5 solar major – generally offer modules at around the CNY1 ($0.14)/W mark, some sellers lowered prices past that psychologically significant threshold. PERC modules have been offered as low as CNY0.72 ($0.10), multiple manufacturers said.

The winter season is a “weaker period of the year, hence, lower demand,” a solar market veteran said. China’s module makers are trying to clear their inventories, according to a module seller, during this off-season. Before their fiscal year closes in December, Chinese companies are attempting to sell stock and “bump up their revenues,” a different veteran said.
Operating rates are falling in this oversupplied environment. Some medium-sized solar factories are already closing for a break, according to a module maker. Factories in China usually only break during the Spring Festival, and a break now two months ahead of that holiday suggests that “factories don’t have orders,” the module maker said. Module factory operating rates are said to be 50-60%, according to an experienced market observer.
Low prices continue to be on the horizon as 2023 ends and in the year to come. 2024 will be a challenging year, according to a major solar developer. Low prices will persist for a time, with the industry gradually starting to stabilize in 2025 and then recover, the developer said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/08/lenders-choose-renewables-over-coal-for-second-year-in-a-row/,"COAL-FIRED POWER,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 8, 2023",Lenders choose renewables over coal for second year in a row,"Not a single coal power plant in India received project finance lending in 2022. All energy projects that reached financial closure for project finance lending in 2022 were renewable energy projects, finds an analysis by Centre for Financial Accountability (CFA) and Climate Trends. On the flip side, the report showed a 45% reduction in project finance to renewable energy.
The 2023 Coal vs Renewables Investment Report assessed 68 project finance loans across 11 coal and renewable energy projects in India that reached financial closure between Jan. 1, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2022.
While renewable energy projects are defined as hydroelectric, geothermal, wave, wind, or solar power projects, this report looked at wind and solar project finance loans only. Total project finance loans amounted to INR 18,577 crore ($2.36 billion), all of which flowed into renewable energy projects. However, the total amount is 45% less than 2021 levels.
The report attributes the fall in the amount of project finance loans to external factors such as project delays due to the pandemic, supply line disruptions, increase in costs of finance due to higher interest rates as well as increased costs due to domestic policies.
Solar energy was once again the renewable energy project of choice, accounting for six out of eleven deals, or 40% of financing. However, solar lending in 2022 dropped by over 64% to INR 7,361 crore ($935 million), financing 1,849 megawatts (MW) of solar projects.
Wind power comprised only 4% of total renewable energy lending in 2022, financing two projects equalling 144 MW of wind energy. This represents a more than 80% decrease compared to 2021.
The majority of the funding (56%) went into loans for hybrid (solar and wind) projects. In total, the three hybrid loans amounting to INR 10,484 crore supported a capacity of 950 MW.
“There has been curiosity around India not signing the global pledge to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency at the COP28 despite it championing the idea during its G20 presidency. Since the pledge on renewables was framed in recognition of reducing investments in coal, most likely India did so to ensure it defends its use of coal for energy security in the foreseeable future.
However, this analysis shows project finance investments towards solar and wind in 2022 reflect India’s commitment to its NDC 2030 target of 500 gigawatts of electricity generation from non-fossil fuel sources. Making finance more accessible and affordable for renewable energy will not only help India outperform its own commitments but also strengthen its position as a climate leader of the global south,” said Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends.
The majority of loans came from commercial banks, totalling five deals and 68% of overall funding. Commercial lending for renewable projects decreased by 51% from 2021 levels. The Coöperatieve Rabobank UA was the largest lender, with a loan totalling INR 7,749 crore ($985 million). This loan outperforms the largest renewables loan of 2021, provided by L&T Finance, which was INR 4,214 crore ($565 million).
“Cost of renewable energy with storage is now comparable and cheaper than new coal plant construction, irrespective of the location. Besides losing out to renewable energy on per unit cost of electricity, coal power plants will have to be retired within a decade from now. Financial institutions are reluctant to fund coal projects, be it power plant construction or coal mining, knowing fully well that the global outlook on coal remains heavily in the negative”, said Joe Athialy, Executive Director, Centre for Financial Accountability.
Like in 2021, Rajasthan was the biggest beneficiary of renewable energy lending compared to other Indian states, securing over INR 7,579 crore ($963 million).
India has already installed close to 132 GW of renewable energy from its earlier target of 175 GW and yet is determined to make additional power demand be met by renewables where possible. The World Energy Outlook 2023 pegs that India will meet its 2030 target to have half of its electricity capacity be non-fossil well before the end of the decade. As financial institutions reduce their investments in coal projects, policy and regulations must also ensure more funds flow towards renewable energy projects.

The projection comes when the country is increasingly investing in expanding its transmission and distribution network, prompting an uptake in solar wires and cable manufacturing.
Notably, solar panels harness, store, and convert solar energy into the form of usable electricity. However, they depend on solar wires and cables to transmit energy to the electric unit. The crucial application has prompted solar cable manufacturers to level up their products to support efficient solar energy transmission.
Solar cables are vital for the functioning of solar panels and photovoltaic systems. They transmit power from the panels to the solar inverter, battery, and all crucial components of the system, which helps convert the DC current to AC current.
The primary role of solar cable is rooted in its ability to transfer electrical energy safely while maintaining the photovoltaic system’s stability. However, using poor-quality cables and improperly installed cables can hamper overall efficiency. Such a glitch reduces energy efficiency, causes overheating, creates durability issues, and may start fires.
To address such issues, leading solar cable companies are procuring high-end equipment and processing technology to enhance their product range. For instance, many industry leaders have adopted e-beam process technology, using specialized compounding solutions for insulation, and investing in premium raw materials to produce high-quality cables. In addition, they are conducting rigorous testing on frequent basis to ensure the product they develop meets safety standards.
Today, several types of cables are available in the solar industry. Some of the most widely used ones include the following:
Photovoltaic cables: These cables help connect the photovoltaic panels to the solar system inverter. The photovoltaic cables can withstand UV radiation and harsh weather conditions, enabling them to resist sudden temperature fluctuations and ensure high electrical conductivity.
AC cables: This type of solar cable connects the system inverter to its protection equipment and electrical panel, eventually helping in the safe supply of energy to households. The AC solar cables are typically flame-retardant and heat-resistant, which ensures a smooth and efficient flow of alternating current between the connected devices.
DC cables. DC solar cables act as interconnect cables for advanced solar panels and PV arrays in power grids, as they help transmit DC solar energy via photovoltaic panels to the system inverter and battery. These cables are known for their high mechanical strength and temperature resistance, making them suitable for solar energy systems.
Ground cables. Ground cables offer an electrical ground to an advanced solar energy system. These wires are thoughtfully crafted to ensure safe energy discharge in case of a faulty system.
While the options are many, selecting the right kind of solar wires and cables is essential to ensure the smooth functioning of the energy system. Companies and concerned entities can make an informed decision regarding their preferred type of solar cables by keeping a few factors in mind:
Voltage and amperage. It is recommended to pick solar cables with voltage and amperage ratings that meet the specifications of a preferred solar energy system. Taking this factor into consideration will help ensure safe and smooth energy transmission.
Quality. Solar cables made with high-quality material tend to be more durable and resistant to harsh external conditions, including fire, UV radiation, oil, and chemicals. To further ensure performance efficiency, individuals should look for solar wires and cables that adhere to international standards and are made using the e-beam cross-linking process. Such an advanced process ensures that the products are more durable and have high chemical resistance and material strength. This assurance makes the e-beam cross-linked cables more uniform, safe, and reliable.
Safety standards and codes. When looking for safe and efficient solar wires and cables, one should prioritize products that meet the established safety standards for energy transmission. It is suggested to get products compliant with national and international standards like the EN and IS standards to ensure the highest level of reliability and wider acceptance.
The solar industry growth has accelerated the demand for wires and cables in India. Since solar cables are key in transmitting power from the photovoltaic panels to the system, it is essential to invest in the best-suited type of solar cable that meets stability and safety norms. Voltage and amperage, quality and safety standards, and cable life are the key factors to consider. Last but not least, proper installation is also important for the safe and efficient operation of their advanced solar panels and photovoltaic solar systems.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/08/teri-recommendations-to-accelerate-pumped-storage-development-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 8, 2023",TERI recommendations to accelerate pumped storage development in India,"As India targets 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, energy storage would be essential for the optimal utilization of the rapid increase in solar capacity that would need to be created. Storage would also be necessary for reliable supply and grid stability as the share of variable renewable energy goes up sharply from the existing level of around 10%.
A new report by TERI states that pump storage projects (PSPs) are the most attractive option amongst various storage technologies and should therefore be given the highest priority for utility-scale storage. The report reveals renewables-plus-pumped hydro storage produces cheaper power than new thermal power plants. Also, PSPs are cheaper than battery energy storage systems (BESS).

“The tariff discovered for 500 MW/ 3,000 MWh of standalone PSP storage capacity is equivalent to INR 4.80/kWh on the basis of PSP performing a single daily cycle. With two cycles per day, the effective storage charge would be INR 2.40/kWh. The tariff of power to be procured by SECI from a 500 MW/ 1000 MWh standalone BESS is INR 10.84/kWh,” according to the report.
As per CEA, the current potential of ‘on-river pumped storage’ in India is 103 GW. Out of 4.76 GW of installed capacity, 3.36 GW is working in pumping mode. About 44.5 GW including 34 GW off-river pumped storage hydro plants are under various stages of development.
The TERI report states there is already sufficient interest in developers. It highlights the need for bids to be invited and contracts awarded to ensure that storage capacities are created in time to match RE capacity creation. Standard bidding documents may be developed to accelerate the implementation of PSPs.
For on-river PSPs, the maximum percentage of energy loss in pumping operation (or the percentage of input electricity to be supplied on demand after storage through pumping), number of pumping cycles per day, number of hours for which supply will be required on demand may be firmed up. Bids may be invited after assembling land, getting clearance from CEA for the detailed project report, and environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. This would reduce the risk perception of the bidders, resulting in lower price bids.
For on-river PSPs, the report also recommends identification of new reservoir sites for all existing hydro projects, initial thrust by State governments and central PSUs to generate momentum for PSP development, and creation of a revolving fund for project preparation.
For off-river pumped storage plants, the timeline for bidding may be kept as 120 days. This will provide the potential bidders enough time to locate sites and decide the technology and optimal capacity. This will increase competition and result in lower price bids. This will also reduce the time needed for completion of the project after the award of the contract as the site and technical details would have been finalized during the bid process. To ensure greater competition, bidders should be given flexibility in the quoted capacity with the bid parameter remaining the same—capacity charge or tariff for round-the-clock supply.
The report recommends that developers be given full freedom to identify sites and take these up for development after obtaining requisite clearances. Discarded mines including coal mines in different parts of the country could be used as hydro storage and thereby become natural enablers for the development of PSPs. Satellite-/ drone-based survey may be undertaken to locate the sites.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/08/reducing-pv-module-temperature-with-beeswax-paraffin-wax/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"DECEMBER 8, 2023","Reducing PV module temperature with beeswax, paraffin wax","From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Northern Technical University and AlNoor University in Iraq have investigated the ability of phase-change materials (PCM) to cool PV panels in extremely hot temperatures.
PCMs are substances that can absorb and release heat energy during phase transitions. The PCMs used in this study were natural beeswax, paraffin wax, and a combination of both. They absorb heat when changing from solid to liquid and release it when transforming back.
“This study aims to evaluate the effect of integrating phase-change materials with solar panels and passive cooling under the influence of Iraqi weather conditions, which are characterized by their heat,” the academics from the Northern Technical University said. “We compare the performance under these conditions in terms of electrical efficiency, panel temperature, and electrical output through experimental work.”
For their experimental setting, the scientists placed four 50 W panels with polycrystalline cells on a rooftop in the city of Hawija, northern Iraq. One panel was kept in its original condition for reference, while the other three had cavities in their back to contain the different PCMs. The five-liter cavity was then filled with the various waxes, with 10% space left empty for solidification.
The group took the measurements on a July day in 2022 with the ambient temperature reaching 43.5 C and solar radiation values ranging from 300 to 956 W/m2. Different measurement instruments were installed in this rig to measure the panel’s temperature, electricity production, and efficiency.
The analysis showed that the panel without a PCM had temperatures ranging from 38.65 to 69.4 C, with an average daily temperature of 54.7 C. By contrast, the PV module with paraffin reached an average of 54.21 C, with the panel relying on beeswax averaging 51.66 C. The panel with both materials, meanwhile, achieved an average of 53.62 C.
All three PCM PVs acted similarly, having lower temperatures than the reference PV until between 2:00 pm and 3:00 pm, when the wax melted. Afterward, as it could not absorb any more heat, the wax froze, emitting heat and therefore raising the panel temperature to higher levels than the reference set-up.
“Regarding electrical generation, the average daily electrical output was 28, 28.5, 31, and 28.7 watts for the reference plate, paraffin, beeswax, and PV mixture,” the academic group added. “The electrical efficiency of beeswax improved by 1% compared to the reference rig. As for the other two types, the improvement was very slight.”
The research group shared its results in the study “Comparative study of different phase change materials on the thermal performance of photovoltaic cells in Iraq’s climate conditions,” published in Energy Reports.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/08/frances-profils-systemes-unveils-new-solar-veranda/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"DECEMBER 8, 2023",France’s Profils Systèmes unveils new solar veranda,"From pv magazine France
Profils Systèmes has developed a PV veranda that can be integrated into existing and new buildings.
“We developed this product more than fifteen years ago,” Denis Bounio, a sales manager for Profils Systèmes, told pv magazine France, noting that the rise in energy costs has brought this product back into fashion.
The Wallis&Energy photovoltaic veranda is a grid-connected PV system that can host solar modules with power outputs of up to 500 W and panels from a wide range of manufacturers.
The size of the photovoltaic panels may vary from 700 mm x 1,000 mm to 1,210 mm x 1,800 mm. Their thickness is between 26 mm and 50 mm, with the filling of the insulating panel ranging from 32 mm to 55 mm. The generators can be opaque, assembled on insulating panels, or semi-transparent, assembled in insulating glazing.
Integrated above the insulating panels, the solar modules provide ridges with troughs, allowing easy passage of electrical cables. The equipment benefits, as an option, from a box of remote roller shutters, a support for spotlights or LED strips and a support for blinds.
“It’s an interesting solution when you want to enlarge your house, especially since administrative procedures have been simplified and photovoltaic panels now offer much better yields,” Bounio explained.
Waterproofing is ensured from a 5% slope by sealed insulating panels sealed with ethylene propylene rubber (EPDM) seals. Furthermore, installing panels on the roof of a veranda optimizes its insulation, by adding a layer of material that limits heat loss through the ceiling.
Profils Systèmes, based in Baillargues, France, is a unit of Groupe Corialis.
