Therefore, testing PV panels is essential to ensure their reliability and safety. Conformity assessment bodies and calibration laboratories play a vital role in ensuring the quality of solar PV panels in factories or solar PV plants.
Sun simulator is considered the heart of a testing or calibration lab used to test solar PV panels indoors under controlled and repeatable conditions. It uses an electrically powered lamp to simulate sunlight over a focal plane providing uniformity, collimation, and light spectrum matching daylight.
Special attention is needed while procuring a flasher/sun simulator for a lab as measurement uncertainty of testing/calibration depends on the accuracy of the flasher. Various parameters should be considered for the selection of a flasher.
The module sizes have been increasing for the last few years. With M10 and M12 wafers, the maximum size of the module has reached up to 2,465 mm x 1,134 mm and 2,384×1,103 mm. In most Indian solar PV labs, very large-size modules can’t be tested as the module test area of the flasher is shorter than the module size.
Nowadays, high-efficiency PERC modules have replaced BSF modules in the PV module market. In the coming days, high-efficiency modules like TOPCon and HJT will capture the module market.
For characterizing BSF panels, 10 ms pulse is required. On the other hand, pulse width of 60 ms is required for PERC, 100 ms for TOPCon, and >200ms for HJT modules. Also, the flasher should come with a really long pulse. Otherwise, measurement uncertainty will be higher.
IEC 60904-9 specifies the requirements of a sun simulator. The spectral mismatch, spatial non-uniformity of irradiance, and temporal instability of irradiance are the significant parameters based on which the Sun simulator is classified as A+A+A+, AAA, BBA, etc. One should verify whether the particular flasher is providing a full spectrum of 300 nm to 1200 nm or not. This is nowadays measured by the % spectral coverage (SPC) according to IEC 60903-9 ed3.
Irradiance range is another crucial parameter to be kept in mind while selecting a flasher. We need an irradiance range from 100W/m² to 1100W/m² for testing as per IEC 61853-1 standard. For bifacial module testing, 1300W/m² irradiance is required. So, ideally, go for a flasher capable of providing irradiance range from 100 W/m² to 1,300 W/m².
For solar PV, quality infrastructure services are essential throughout the value chain, from components manufacturing to electricity consumption. Only with the necessary quality infrastructure services in place can it be guaranteed that the technology and installation have the required quality level so that the expected amount of energy can be safely produced and consumed. Testing and certification labs play a significant role in the quality assurance of solar panels. So, these labs should be equipped with the best equipment to check the quality of imported or indigenous solar PV panels.

It will manufacture hydrogen-run two-wheeler and three-wheeler EVs at its Bhuj facility, Gujarat, where it plans to start the production of EV trucks this year itself. 
The company is already in discussion with a few Indian states for setting up a well-equipped EV car manufacturing base in India with all the advanced technologies and state-of-the-art infrastructure.
With the latest announcement, it has become the first auto manufacturer in India to foray into the hydrogen-run two-wheeler and three-wheeler segments. It will also be exporting these two-wheelers and three-wheelers from India. 
Triton has already established its comprehensive Research and Development (R&D) Center facility in the Anand District of Gujarat, where it will develop two-wheelers and three-wheelers, in addition to EV trucks, EV cars, and special-purpose vehicles. 
The R&D facility is strategically located near Ahmedabad and Triton’s EV manufacturing hub in Bhuj, Gujarat, ensuring faster decision-making.
“Hydrogen-powered vehicles are being considered the new-age mobility mantra. Since our priority is to drive the new age mobility, hydrogen-fuel-run vehicles are natural advancements for Triton EV,” said Himanshu B Patel, founder and MD of Triton EV. 
Triton EV is involved in the energy storage system business ranging from transportable small battery packs to a 10 MWh battery storage unit for customers in the USA and abroad for applications like energy generation, load management, EV charging stations, etc. It is also involved in manufacturing electric vehicles using battery technologies developed by them.

Arizona-based startup New Use Energy Solutions has unveiled SunTarp, a new line of portable frameless solar PV panels for off-grid and residential applications.
“We found that adhering multiple modules to a custom vinyl tarp allows the user to reconfigure the modules strings to accommodate 12, 24 & 48V off-grid systems all the way up to residential type all-in-one inverters that require over 120 Vdc to charge batteries. ,” the company’s COO, Lee Feliciano, told pv magazine. “Our module provider is US-based Merlin Solar.”
The flexible modules are provided by Merlin Solar.
New Use Energy Solutions’ PV array is available in three versions; the TriFold SunTarp array, which combines three solar modules, weighs 6.8 kg and has a power output of 210 W; the 320 W FourFold SunTarp model that integrates four panels and weighs in at 10.8 kg; and the six-module HexFold SunTarp which has a power output of 410 W and has a weight of 20.4 kg.
“They store easily even in the trunk of compact cars, and we can scale them into larger arrays,” the company’s CEO, Paul Shmotolokha, stated. “Our modules are 30% lighter than traditional monocrystalline solar panels and easy to fold, carry and stow.”
According to the company’s website, the TriFold SunTarp array is sold at $906.53, while the FourFold SunTarp and HexFold SunTarp have a price of $1,318.45 and $1,806.13, respectively. “They provide way more power than the rather small tiny panel kits that small portable power stations provide,” Feliciano stated.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/25/industrial-process-for-mobile-solar-module-recycling/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RECYCLING,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 25, 2022",Industrial process for ‘mobile’ solar module recycling,"From pv magazine Global
Flaxres says it has transferred its proprietary technology to an industrial process, and is bringing its pilot solar panel recycling system to market.
The basis for the breakthrough was a successfully completed mass test with the recycling of 7.5 tons of solar modules in the “Flaxthor” production plant, it added. According to Flaxres, more than 200 kg of silicon and 4 kg of silver were recovered, as well as 4.9 tons of glass of the highest quality. The site in Dresden has a potential recycling capacity of more than 1,000 tons per year.
The new site serves purely as a development location, a Flaxres spokesman told pv magazine. There, the pilot production plant with a maximum capacity of 10 tons per day will be operated to test new and optimized process steps for full automation. The company its pilot plant achieves a cycle time of 10 seconds per module.
Based on this prototype, Flaxres wants to develop mobile equipment that will fit into a shipping container and be rented to customers, he said. “A full-scale stationary plant is rather counterproductive. The issuance of the operating license is advised for the end of 2022,” the Flaxres spokesman added. The plan, he said, is to begin constructing these new “Flaxthor” plants in 2024, and to have them available to customers by 2025.
According to the Flaxres spokesman, several contracts have already been signed with customers operating internationally. “However, the plants will not be sold, but only leased on a monthly basis with our personnel.” He also said that 100% of the total recycling capacity of the five new plants has already been allocated for 2024.
The plants are suitable for both crystalline and thin-film modules, and can process modules with damaged glass panes. All modules are separated into their main components with a low energy input. The materials recovered are of high quality due to the separation process developed and can thus enable a genuine recycling economy. The company does not rely on chemicals for its recycling process, it added.
The quantities of solar modules generated annually for recycling are still rather small. By 2030, however, a quantity of around 400,000 tons of these solar modules is expected for Germany alone, according to Flaxres. This corresponds to a number of about 20 million individual modules, and many companies and researchers are working on efficient recycling processes.
