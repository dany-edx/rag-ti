In practice, this has meant that the Centre takes charge of all interstate matters, as well as matters where the ownership rests with the Centre, and the State government is responsible for matters within the state.
The Ministry of Power has notified the amendment to the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) 2020 Rules regarding net metering for rooftop solar installations. The amendment permits net metering to the prosumer for loads up to 500 kW or up to the sanctioned load, whichever is lower. Additionally, this amendment considers net billing or gross metering for rooftop solar systems over 500 kW capacity.
First of all, the amendment states that the arrangement of net metering, net billing, and gross metering shall be as specified by state commissions by their regulations. It is also important to note that this amendment will be applicable only in the states where the regulations do not provide for the net-metering or net billing or net feed-in.
As per my understanding, this amendment is only a guiding rule for state commissions to decide on the subject and doesn’t necessarily cap net metering up to 500 kW. 
It is further important to note that net metering earlier was capped at 1 MW until the government proposed to cut it to 10 kW in December 2020 significantly. Several solar developers and stakeholders made representation to Government that this reduction in capacity will destroy the rooftop solar sector.
After severe opposition and representation by the solar industry, the government proposed net metering for capacity up to 500 kW without giving any rationale. Even if it had to be done, it should have been made mandatory for the states to allow net metering up to 500 KW. 
The concurrent nature of jurisdiction on electricity allowing states and centre to make rules on the same subject leads to inefficiencies and ambiguities in the system. Since state governments are influenced by the local pressures and requirements, they may end up making rules restricting net metering for lower capacities.
If it had been a purely central subject, there could have been more consistency over the country and possibly a more efficient and rational power business. Since this cannot be changed now, the states must take this amendment as an absolute guiding principle and allow net metering for much higher capacities over and above 500 KW and not make rules restricting the net metering capacities below 500 KW.
The Centre in this amendment should also have recognized the “behind the meter” category of solar installation so that it can be uniformly accepted by all the states. Many states have already recognized behind-the-meter solar installations, such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/23/panasonic-life-solutions-commissions-7-mw-agrivoltaic-project-in-maharashtra/,"AGRIVOLTAICS,HIGHLIGHTS,MAHARASHTRA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 23, 2021",Panasonic Life Solutions commissions 7 MW agrivoltaic project in Maharashtra,"Panasonic Life Solutions India today announced the commissioning of a 7 MW AC solar power plant built on an EPC basis for the developer Gro Solar Energy in the Indian State of Maharashtra. The project, located at Degoan in the Dhule district, is spread over a 50-acre land area.
The agrivoltaic project uses 30,300 Panasonic’s ‘Anchor’ make of polycrystalline solar modules “Made in India” installed along with string inverters to maintain high uptime. 
The solar electricity generated is evacuated at the nearest substation to power homes across multiple villages in the vicinity and provide the much-needed daytime power to the farmers for irrigation activities.
Project developer Gro Solar Energy benefits from a power purchase agreement with MAHAGENCO through a power sale agreement with MAHADISCOM. The project was installed under the Government of Maharashtra’s“Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojana” to energize the agricultural feeders in Maharashtra. 
“This project will generate approximately 15,891 MWh of solar energy and assist in eliminating a total of 14,300 tonnes of CO2 emissions over the lifetime of the PV plant,” according to Panasonic Life Solutions.
Gulabsing Girase, one of the Directors of Gro Solar Energy, said they are looking at the possibility to reap agriculture yield by planting low-height guava, lemongrass, and a few other crops between solar module tables by extending the pitch and the height. “It will not only lead to agriculture yield but also help save the water utilized for cleaning, ensure a less dusty environment, and maintain a reduced ambient temperature. Further, this results in higher gains in solar power plants,” he added.
Amit Barve, business unit head of solar business, Panasonic Life Solutions India, said, “The commissioning of 7 MW AC project is a significant achievement for us, especially during tough pandemic conditions. Excellent support, mutual trust, and coordination with Developer, Gro Solar Energy Pvt. Ltd. was the reason behind the smooth and fast execution of this project.”
In agrivoltaics, the same area of land is used to produce both solar energy and agricultural products. In other words, solar panels co-exist with crops on the same surface. After the project is fully developed, it will act as a model for agrivoltaic projects in India. Gro Solar Energy plans to start agricultural activities in 2022. 
 Gro Solar Energy is a special-purpose vehicle founded for this Project by Gulabsing Girase, Rajdeep Girase, Abhijeet Girase, and Sonal Patel. The Power Finance Corporation of India has funded the project.

Fourth Partner Energy manages a portfolio of 550 MW across its distributed and open access solar portfolios. Statkraft India solar assets are its first acquisition this fiscal as part of its capacity expansion plans, post securing $125 million funding from Norfund and TPG’s The Rise Fund earlier this month. 
The company is now strengthening its onsite and offsite solar presence in the subcontinent and key markets across South and Southeast Asia with a 3 GW installed solar capacity target by 2025.
Aditya Gupta, Head – Asset Acquisition, Fourth Partner Energy, said, “Acquiring good quality assets backed by strong off-takers is a key focus area for the company as we cement our leadership position and this portfolio of Statkraft is a natural fit.” 
The distributed solar market is ripe for consolidation, with assets switching hands at a rapid pace, especially in the pandemic era, said Gupta, adding that Fourth Partner Energy is looking to acquire around 100 MW this fiscal.
“At Fourth Partner Energy, we thoroughly scrutinize build quality, historical generation, and bankability of solar plants before adding them to our asset base. Our team is well armored in terms of financing and capabilities to onboard larger portfolios and is looking to add close to a 100 MW of installed capacity this fiscal via the acquisition route,” Gupta added.
For Statkraft, the decision to exit the distributed solar power business is part of its changed solar strategy for India. The company shall now focus on developing large-scale projects. 
“Statkraft is happy to announce the sale of 100% interest and ownership in Statkraft Solar to Fourth Partner Energy. We are confident that Fourth Partner Energy will carry forward the excellent customer service standards displayed by Statkraft India over the years.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/23/german-start-up-offers-5-2-kwh-ac-battery-that-works-without-inverter/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JULY 23, 2021",German start-up offers 5.2 kWh AC battery that works without inverter,"From pv magazine International
German start-up Sax Power GmbH is offering a residential AC battery it says works entirely without an inverter and has 50% more capacity and service life than conventional batteries.
According to its specifications, the battery stores direct current and can deliver both alternating current and direct current. The conversion is not carried out by transistors such as IGBTs or MOSFETs, but via the software of the battery management system. By interconnecting with cascaded H-bridges, the cell blocks can be controlled individually. That enables the system to build a sinusoidal curve typical of alternating current from the individual DC voltage values. It also increases efficiency, since the conversion is purely electronic. Sax states the efficiency of its solution is 99%. The option of plugging the battery into a main socket is a further innovation, according to the company.
Sax Power said, in this type of device the current is measured by folding current transformers. That means no cables have to be disconnected in a household network. In addition, a second current measurement of the same type is carried out on the feeding line to the house. The battery then receives the information it needs for optimal use, via wireless communication units.
The manufacturer said some performance can be lost with the plug-in device, which has a nominal power output of 3.7 kW. The standard product, without the plug-in, has an output of 4.6 kW.
The battery comes with lithium iron phosphate cells and the capacity of the basic model is 5.2 kWh but it can be expanded with extra modules to 15.6 kWh. The nominal current is 20 A, or 16 A with the plug-in installation.
The company offers a 10-year guarantee for the device, which weighs 52kg and is said to be easier for installers to mount as they do not have to handle an inverter.
In May, the product received a German Innovation Award and Sax Power said it will be on display in October at the EES storage fair held alongside The Smarter E trade event. The developer said its product has qualified as a finalist for the EES Award at this year’s show.
A price for the product can be found on the Sax Power website. The basic version is listed as costing €5,079. In a version with wireless communication and a better smart meter, the device costs €5,210. It will be sold in series from autumn.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/23/polysilicon-shortage-will-continue-through-2021/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COVID-19,EMPLOYMENT,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JULY 23, 2021",‘Polysilicon shortage will continue through 2021’,"From pv magazine International
Despite describing the polysilicon shortage which has driven up solar module prices in recent months, and other material constraints, as “brief incidences that are already being resolved,” in a upbeat conclusion to a new report, trade body SolarPower Europe has said it expects the scarcity of the solar module raw material to remain this year.
That was one of many predictions made by the European solar industry body – many of them more upbeat – in its flagship Global Market Outlook For Solar Power 2021-2025 report, published yesterday.
While conceding the poly squeeze is unlikely to ease this year, SolarPower Europe said the upward pressure on prices appears to have peaked, according to last month’s factory-gate numbers. The trade body says that is because of the rising volume of corporate-driven solar projects worldwide. If the price of panels becomes too expensive, unsubsidized solar parks planned by private businesses will simply not be built, and the world’s solar manufacturers are aware of the fact, according to the authors of the market report.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, we have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
The tone of the document was mostly upbeat, with the organization happily reporting the negative predictions made in last year’s iteration of the outlook – written during the worst period to date of Europe’s Covid-19 crisis – have mostly been revised upwards after solar weathered the public health storm much better than had been anticipated.
Rising Covid-19 vaccination rates and, pertinently on the polysilicon issue, plans to ramp up silicon production capacity have prompted the organization to make a slew of positive predictions, with SolarPower Europe predicting the world will add 163 GW of solar generation capacity this year, to reach 773 GW.
The world will break the 200 GW barrier for new solar next year – two years earlier than predicted by the lobby group a year ago – by adding 203 GW, and a further 225 GW will come online in 2023; 239 GW the following year; and 266 GW in 2025. That would add up to a global solar generation fleet of 1.8 TW by the middle of the decade, with the terawatt mark passed at some point next year. And that, SolarPower Europe added, is based on its medium-scenario expectations; in its most optimistic forecast, the world could have 2.15 TW of solar by the end of 2025, especially if mooted green hydrogen generation plants begin to take shape during that period.
Solar superpower China is expected to add up to 71 GW of capacity this year and SolarPower Europe predicted it will bring a further 76 GW online next year and then 85 GW, 91 GW and 102 GW, to 2025.
The changing of the guard in Washington could see the U.S. add 24.1 GW this year and peak at 28 GW of new solar in 2023, driven by an extended Investment Tax Credit for solar. After that, the U.S. will level off at around 25.5-26 GW per year, according to the report’s authors.
With Germany set to add 6.2 GW this year; Denmark and Greece to join the gigawatt-market club and Turkey to regain admission, SolarPower Europe has predicted its home market will bring 37.4 GW online next year, rising to 45 GW in 2024, and 51 GW in 2025.
There was wide variance in the figures expected from India, after it’s Covid-related solar slump last year, with the outlook guesstimating 5.6-10 GW could be added this year, depending on which of its scenarios is considered. That could leap to 18-22 GW next year, said the trade body, but with a solar fleet of 41 GW at the time of publication, the 100 GW solar target set by prime minister Narendra Modi for next year is more likely to be achieved in 2024, after around 19 GW of plants comes online in each of 2023 and 2024.
SolarPower Europe said enthusiasm for rooftop solar would ensure Mexico adds 2.3 GW this year, despite the fossil fuel-focused policies of president Andrés Manuel López Obrador but noted solar installation volumes are expected to retreat in Japan, Australia, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as in Ukraine, after the government’s retroactive reduction of feed-in tariffs (FITs).
The annual report also offered an interesting insight into the best performing nations in terms of the volume of solar capacity installed per citizen, with Australia topping the ranking with 826 W of solar for every resident. Germany boasted 652 W per capita, followed by the Netherlands (603 W), Japan (563 W), Belgium (540 W), Switzerland (354 W), Italy (350 W), Greece (315 W), Spain (303 W) and Israel (301 W).
The membership body behind the report noted new, vaccination-resistant variants of Covid-19 might pose a significant threat to the solar success story. The allegations of forced labor in Xinjiang, China which have prompted the Biden administration in the U.S. to announce an intent to boycott such goods could also prove a fly in the ointment, especially if other nations follow America’s lead, SolarPower Europe noted, while considering either roadblock unlikely.
With the outlook including reports from solar associations in each of the world’s gigawatt solar markets, perusal of the national round-ups revealed Ghana‘s off-grid commercial and industrial PV segment is being hindered by unspecified domestic content rules; Australia’s solar industry could explode to more than 120 GW if vast green hydrogen and green ammonia facilities come to fruition; Mexico’s political troubles mean it will add less than a gigawatt of big solar parks annually for the foreseeable future; and 5,000 people left Ukraine’s solar industry last year, in the wake of FIT cuts and an ongoing suspension of planned renewables auctions which were set to start, under new rules, in December 2019.
