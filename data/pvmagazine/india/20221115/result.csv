London-based EY has once again ranked India as the most attractive destination for PV investment in its latest Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index. The country received a score of 62.9, followed by China and the United States, with scores of 61.1 and 58.5, respectively.
Australia, Israel, Germany, Egypt, France, Brazil and Morocco completed EY’s top 10. For overall renewables investment, the United States ranked first, followed by China, and then Germany, which moved up one spot from last year.
“The US retains its top position due to the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022, which is viewed as a game changer for its green hydrogen industry,” the report says.
China is expected to add 100 GW of solar this year, according to the China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute. Germany’s rise to third place was reportedly bolstered by its Easter package commitment to renewables. The United Kingdom lost its spot in the top three, taking fourth place. France, Australia, India, Spain, Japan and the Netherlands rounded out the top 10.
The report also ranks markets in terms of the attractiveness of renewable power procurement via offsite corporate PPAs.
“The volume of power generation committed through PPAs in 2022 is set to be less than 2021, although higher than 2020,” the report says, noting that this will be the first year-on-year reduction in signed corporate PPAs since 2013.
Key factors in the reduction include uncertainty around government policy and rapidly changing cost profiles, according to EY. Spain remained the most attractive PPA market in 2022, with Germany overtaking the United States for second place. The United Kingdom, Australia and France completed the top five.
EY also introduced a new renewables attractiveness ranking, normalized to countries’ gross domestic product. It highlighted Morocco, Chile and Portugal as markets performing above expectations for their economic size.

It won the supply order after a reverse auction conducted by BHEL.
BHEL will use Saatvik modules for PV projects at two thermal power plants in Uttar Pradesh, which it is setting up on an EPC basis. Saatvik will deliver half-cut, multi-busbar (MBB) mono PERC modules by the year-end.
“Out of the overall tender floated by BHEL, 2.5 MW of installation is to be executed at the Obra thermal power plant in the Sonbhadra district, and nearly about 1.6 MW of installation is to be accomplished and executed at the Jawaharpur power house thermal plant in the Etah district of Uttar Pradesh,” stated Saatvik.
Currently, Saatvik has a module production capacity of 1.5 GW at its Ambala plant in Haryana. It will expand its manufacturing capacity to 3 GW by 2023 by setting up a new plant in Gandhidham, Gujarat.

The projects are to be implemented in various districts of Maharashtra. Individual solar project capacity will be 2 MW to 10 MW in size, as per the availability of substation connectivity.
MSEDCL will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement with the successful bidders.
The successful bidder shall set up the solar project, including the transmission/distribution network up to the delivery point. Broadly, it will be responsible for the design, finance, procurement of land, engineering, procurement, construction, operation and maintenance of the projects. It can develop the projects on its own land or land rented out by farmers near 33/11 kV substations owned by MSEDCL.
MSEDCL has created a land portal where farmers have applied to rent out their lands for solar projects under the MSKVY scheme. The list of these lands and their details are available along with tender documents.
“MSEDCL’s role w.r.t lands is that of a facilitator. It won’t carry out any evaluation (financial, legal, or technical) of the land being offered under the tender. The land acquisition shall be totally in the successful solar power developer’s scope,” reads the tender document. “As mutually agreed, MSEDCL will make the rent payment to farmers on behalf of the developer.”

Germany’s Schüco published a product safety warning last spring indicating that solar modules delivered between 2010 and 2012 could be affected by a technical defect related to the backsheets.
It has now extended this warning, as it has found the module defects caused by the faulty backsheets, which were sourced from various suppliers, in other module series delivered between 2010 and 2014.
“A certain type of polyamide backsheet from different manufacturers can develop fault patterns that can lead to cracks in the backsheet itself,” said the company. “As a result, the potential danger resulting from the error pattern depends on the material, the location and type of installation, and other factors.”
It said that under certain weather and environmental conditions, there could even a risk of electric shock.
“From now on, parts of PV systems that may be defective due to the fault patterns in the backsheet described above must not be touched under any circumstances without the protective measures against electric shock,” it said.
It provides specific instructions on how to proceed if the solar modules are affected by the defect. Under no circumstances should the solar modules, plugs, wiring or parts of the substructure be touched without protective measures against electric shock, it said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/15/heg-unveils-plans-to-build-247-million-li-ion-anode-plant/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION CELLS,MAKE IN INDIA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 15, 2022",HEG unveils plans to build $247 million Li-ion anode plant,"HEG Ltd, an LNJ Bhilwara Group company, has announced plans to invest INR 2,000 crore to build a facility to manufacture graphite anode for lithium-ion batteries in India. The company will build the plant in two phases. It expects the first phase to become operational by 2025 with an investment of INR 1,000 crore and cater to 10-12 GWh of cell manufacturing capacity. In the second phase, HEG plans to double the plant capacity with another INR 1,000 crore.
The investment will be executed through HEG’s newly incorporated, wholly-owned subsidiary The Advanced Carbons Company (TACC).
HEG aims to finish both phases in the next 5-7 years, leveraging its decades of experience in the graphite and advanced carbon chemistry fields.
The anode plant will have a production capacity of 20,000 metric tonnes per year.
Anode is one of the most crucial elements in the production of Li-ion battery cells, accounting for roughly 10-15% of the cost. For every GWh of Li-ion cell production, 1,100 tonnes of graphite anode is needed. Only China and Japan are the major producers of anode materials at the moment. More than 90% of the market is controlled by businesses in these two nations, stated HEG.
HEG intends to build TACC as a cutting-edge facility on more than 100 acres of land, where it would set up an anode plant. The building will have a specialized innovation centre for creating new carbon derivative materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, for use in green energy applications.
