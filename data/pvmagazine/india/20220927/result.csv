The report indicated that the Indian DRE sector employed more than 80,000 workers in 2021, after a slump in 2020 owing to the Covid pandemic. In 2021, solar home systems (52.1%) and Commercial & industrial (47.3%) sectors accounted for almost an equivalent proportion of the DRE sector employment.
Employment in the DRE sector is dominated by large companies that, on average, employ more than 100 workers.
The report expects the C&I segment to be the major driver of DRE job growth in the next few years as the demand for C&I technologies such as rooftop solar has been increasing while the total annual sales of SHS have been declining in India since 2019.
As per figures for 2021, informal workers in DRE account for only 23% of the sector’s total employment in India. Also, 71% of the DRE workforce is highly skilled. Female representation in highly-skilled DRE jobs remains low due to cultural and social norms, which prevent many women from entering and remaining in the DRE sector. The percentage of women in the DRE workforce stands at 21%. 
The study authors conducted direct surveys of over 350 DRE companies to consolidate employment data for the period spanning 2019 to 2021 and present employment and sales projections for 2022 and 2023.

The modules are available with power outputs between 650 Wp and 670 Wp, with front-side power conversion efficiencies from 21% to 21.6%. Rear-side gain is minimum 10% under standard test conditions, leading to 737 W output.
The glass-to-glass panels are built with 132 mono PERC half cells and 12 busbars.
Under standard test conditions, the open-circuit voltage is 45.2 V to 45.4 V, and the short-circuit current 18.15 A to 18.65 A.
Each panel measures 2,384×1,303×35 mm and weighs 38.75 kg. It features an IP68 split junction box. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V DC. The panel has a Pmax temperature coefficient of -0.38% per degree Celsius, and its operating temperature ranges from -40°C to +85°C.
The panels come with a 25-year linear power output warranty and a 10-year product warranty. These are BIS approved.

US-based solar manufacturer Sunpower has unveiled two new storage systems for residential rooftop PV systems.
The two devices, called SV-BASE13-C and SV-BASE19.5-C, respectively are part of the company’s Sunvault series. “With this launch, SunVault is now available in five configurations: 13 kWh, 19.5 kWh, 26 kWh, 39 kWh and 52 kWh. Some of these options include multiple inverters,” it said in a statement released.
The SV-BASE13-C storage system has a storage capacity of 13 kWh and maximum usable energy of 12 kWh. It measures 164 cm × 71 cm × 36 cm and has a weight of 217 kg.
The SV-BASE19.5-C battery features a storage capacity of 19.5 kWh and maximum usable energy of 18 kWh. It has the same size as the SV-BASE13-C system and weighs 267 kg.
Both lithium-ion systems use LiFePO4 as the cathode material and have a round-trip efficiency of over 86%. Their nominal internal voltage is 51.2 V and the maximum (AC) continuous backup output current is 28.3 A.
Both batteries can operate with an ambient temperature range of -20 C to 45 C and feature an IP54 protection level. The new products come with a 10-year warranty and, according to the manufacturer, can operate for unlimited cycles.
“With these new storage sizes and higher power output through multiple inverters, SunVault’s modular configuration allows customers to get the storage size they need today with the reassurance that they can grow their system as their home energy requirements change,” Sunpower said. “The new SunVault sizes will be available beginning early 2023.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/27/enel-unveils-680-w-n-type-heterojunction-solar-panel-for-utility-scale-applications/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2022",Enel unveils 680 W n-type heterojunction solar panel for utility-scale applications,"From pv magazine Global
Enel Green Power (EGP), a unit of Italian utility Enel, unveiled its newest solar panel at the 8th World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion this week in Milan, Italy.
The new product is a heterojunction bifacial panel for applications in utility-scale PV projects. It is based on an n-type solar cell with G12 format and a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%.
“Production will begin in September 2023 with the first 400 MW production line of our 3Sun Factory in Catania, Sicily, southern Italy,” the head of 3Sun, Eliano Russo, told pv magazine. “The cell efficiency was certified by the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany. According to our roadmap, however, we should be able to increase the efficiency to 25% efficiency in 2025 and over 26% in the second half of 2026.”
The cell has currently a thickness of 150 µm, but the company’s roadmap has set a target of 120 µm by the end of 2025.
“Our cell is flexible and, compared to TOPCon and PERC cells, has a higher resistance to mechanical stress,” Russo explained. “We conducted several tests which showed that if microcracks arise, they don’t expand as significantly as in PERC cells.”
The new panel is available in nine versions, with power outputs ranging from 640 W to 680 W and average efficiency spanning from 22.6% to 22.9%. The open-circuit voltage is between 43.3 V and 44.2 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 18.9 A to 19.8 A.
All versions of the solar module measure 2,172 mm × 1,303 mm × 35 mm and weigh in at 36 kg. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V and the bifaciality reaches 95%. The panel can be used in operating temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C, with an operating temperature coefficient of -0.24% per degree Celsius. It is enclosed between 2 mm solar glass with anti-reflective treatment, and also features a junction box with an IP 68 rating and an anodized aluminum frame.
The new products come with 30-year linear power output guarantees and 20-year product guarantees. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 93% of the nominal output power.
“The factory will start operations around September 2023,” Russo said, noting that the factory’s capacity at that time will be around 400 MW. “The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of our panel allows us to tackle the market while ensuring remarkable profitability.”
EGP will initially target the European market, where it is obliged to sell up to 60% of its products, as it has received a significant amount of funding from the European Union.
“We are also targeting non-European markets such as the United States, Latin America, and Asia, and we may also consider opening new factories abroad,” Russo said. “By choosing the heterojunction technology, we decided to bet on technology and innovation, but we are also considering increasing our scale. All the economies of scale which we can capture will only increase our competitiveness.”
Enel is investing €600 million ($579.4 million) in the expansion of its 3Sun facility. Out of that amount, €188 million euros are expected to be provided by European Commission and the Italian government through grants coming from the Innovation Fund and National Recovery and Resiliency Plan (NRRP).
EGP started production at the 200 MW facility in October 2019. It invested around €80 million in reviving the factory, which was built in 2011 with Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp and French-Italian semiconductor business STMicroelectronics. Enel took full control of the facility in July 2014. At the time, the factory was intended to produce multi-junction, thin-film silicon PV modules.
