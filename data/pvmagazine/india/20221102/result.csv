(ADNOC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to explore collaboration opportunities in renewable energy, new projects, and decarbonization efforts, in addition to liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply and decarbonization.
The agreement includes the review of joint equity investments in renewables.
Significantly, both ADNOC and GAIL are scouting for opportunities in renewables and new energy areas to align with energy transition.
GAIL is committed to reducing its carbon emissions and implementing renewables and green hydrogen projects. It is setting up a 10 MW green hydrogen production unit at Vijaipur (Madhya Pradesh). The unit will produce green hydrogen using polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) technology based on water electrolysis. It has also initiated a study on the technical feasibility of H2 blending in the city gas distribution network. The company is exploring various opportunities for increasing its renewable portfolio through organic as well as inorganic routes.
ADNOC is looking to create domestic and international hydrogen value chains, with UAE being home to some of the largest and lowest-cost solar plants in the world.
GAIL is one of India’s largest natural gas companies with integrated operations across the value chain, which is expanding its presence in renewable energies including solar, wind, and biofuels.
ADNOC was the first LNG producer in the Middle East and has over 40 years of experience in the LNG market. It is currently in the midst of a major expansion of its natural gas business, accelerating production to meet both domestic and international demand.

US-based startup Mango Power recently unveiled a 3.5 kWh battery system that can be used to meet both home backup needs and portable power requirements. The system can be expanded up to 14 kWh.
Up to two standalone or expanded units can be connected to further increase the total capacity to 28 kWh. The system provides a 3 kW output capability (expandable to 6 kW) and supports a 240 V output to power heavy-duty appliances.
Mango Power has incorporated four charging methods, as well as 16 output ports, to make the Mango Power E suitable for various scenarios. Input methods include AC wall outlets (up to 3,000 W), solar panels (up to 2,000 W, 60 V to 150 V), EV charging (EV1772), or generators. It charges up to 80% in one hour in quick-charge mode.
In terms of output, the Mango Power E includes four 20 A (AC) output ports, six 27 W USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports (65 W and 100 W), one car power output at 12 V/10 A, two DC 551 ports, and one AC RV port at 30 A.
The system features CATL’s lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. Its lifespan exceeds 2,000 cycles. The Mango Power E also comes with a five-year warranty.
Mango Power is a newcomer to the battery energy storage space. It said it launched late last year, after crowdfunding more than $1 million for its “two-in-one, home-and-portable battery system” in a matter of “minutes.”
Its latest product announcement follows the launch of the Mango Power M Series earlier this year. The product  can be used as an 18 kW PV energy system, as storage with a 15 kWh to 20 kWh battery for daily use and emergency purposes, and to provide full house power backup, including fast charging for EVs.
In addition, the M Series uses CATL LFP battery cells and comes with a 10-year warranty. It comes in different versions for the US and EU markets, and supports single- and triple-phase connections with 12 kW of output capability.
The recommended retail price for a 12 kW/15 kWh system is $19,499 ($19,899 with 9.6 kW home EV charger), and $22,999 for a 12 kW/20 kWh system ($23,399 with a 9.6 kW home EV charger).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/02/putting-bifacial-modules-to-the-test/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 2, 2022",Putting bifacial modules to the test,"From pv magazine Global
The solar industry’s adoption of bifacial cells, which is expected to represent more than half of all silicon PV cells on the market this year, required a few rapid shifts in module design, focused on maximizing the amount of light that can be absorbed from the module’s rear side. And changes to the materials used in a module, as well as to the way it operates, can affect its performance in the field. Several performance issues unique to bifacial technologies have been noted in research and in the field, and even as bifacial becomes a mainstream PV technology, understanding of these problems is still developing.
Scientists led by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have sought to gain a clearer picture of these issues. They put a range of different bifacial module configurations through a series of tests designed to mimic the most extreme of conditions the modules could experience in the field. This series of “combined accelerated stress testing” (C-AST) exposes modules simultaneously to varying temperatures, humidities and voltages, as well as mechanical stress. NREL introduced the C-AST testing protocol in 2020 and sees it is a vital way for the solar industry to understand performance loss in different technologies.
This latest work put PERC cells in both glass-glass and glass-backsheet setups, and devices encapsulated with POE and EVA, through multiple cycles of C-AST testing. The devices tested were “mini modules” each consisting of four 156 mm x 156 mm cells. The results are available in the paper “Evaluation of bifacial module technologies with combined-accelerated stress testing,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The glass-glass modules were shown to have many more breaks in the grid fingers compared to those using a backsheet – they counted on average 124 breaks in grid fingers for the glass-glass devices, compared to 42 for glass-backsheet. The group attributes this to increased rigidity of the glass.
“On the one hand, if the cell is closer to the neutral plane of the module laminate and the module is more rigid when uniformly encapsulated in glass, it may be expected that the stress on cells and cell cracking is reduced,” they said. “On the other hand, this rigidity may be a disadvantage leading to increased stress if the cell is impeded from deforming, for example, due to strain associated with thermal coefficient of expansion mismatch.”
The testing also found potential-induced degradation, which was highest in glass-glass modules encapsulated with EVA, and that similar results were seen with cells tested in the field over a longer period.
“The results of C-AST show that use of bifacial cells and modules can increase the prevalence of failure modes such as grid finger breaks and PID,” they said. “Consideration must therefore be given to the choice of packaging materials and processes for their mitigation. C-AST indicated that that use of the POE and transparent PVF backsheet reduced propensity for polarization-type PID in glass-glass modules.”
