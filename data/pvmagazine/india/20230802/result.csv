Brisbane-headquartered UV Solar has installed a 9.135 kW solar power system atop a local church in the outer suburbs of the Australian city. The installation features Goodwe’s new lightweight Galaxy 315 W solar panels, accompanied by the Chinese manufacturer’s 10 kW SDT inverters and an electric vehicle charger.
The owners of Rock’s Church had been seeking to install a rooftop solar system at the facility to counter rising electricity bills but an assessment determined the building’s ageing roof, which had undergone repairs due to leakage issues, was not suitable to host a traditional rooftop system.
UV Solar opted instead to use GoodWe’s frameless Galaxy 315 W solar panel. The panel can be adhered to the roof surface without the need for drilling, making it suitable for installing on roofs with a low load-bearing capacity and poor waterproofing.
“We’ve been working closely with GoodWe for over four years now, and we’ve built a solid trust in the quality of their products and sales service,” a UV Power spokesman said. “Even though it is our first experience with their Galaxy Series, we found the product incredibly easy to install. We secured them to the roof within just five minutes.”
Apollo Chai, head of BIPV marketing at GoodWe Australia, said the inclusion of the Galaxy series in the manufacturer’s product portfolio makes it a more comprehensive energy solution provider.
“Over 25% of rooftops in Australia cannot be installed with traditional solar panels and mounting systems, due to the risk of weather damage and structural integrity being compromised,” he said. “The Galaxy series of panels is the ideal solution for these scenarios, especially for commercial property owners who are looking for solar solutions to reduce operational costs at a time when energy prices are increasing.”
The panels measure 2,116 mm × 777 mm × 4 mm and are reinforced by 1.6 mm ultra-thin glass which provides durability and all-weather protection. The new Galaxy 315 W panel has a power conversion efficiency of 174 W per square meter. The panels have a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius, the operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The series also includes a 335 W model.
GoodWe offers a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. It said the panels are able to operate at 82% of their original performance after 25 years and at 80% after 30 years.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/02/mitigating-supply-chain-challenges-for-solar-projects/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"AUGUST 2, 2023",Mitigating supply chain challenges for solar projects ,"A reliable supply chain and stable market conditions are crucial to sustain a rapid transition to clean energy. Unfortunately, renewable energy markets have displayed increased volatility due to the instability of raw material supplies, price fluctuations, and frequent regulatory alterations.
The impact was visible during the Covid-19 crisis, specifically due to global reliance on the Chinese supply chain.
Historically, China has been at the forefront of solar PV production and distribution, commanding 80% of the global market share. This is a two-sided coin: On one hand, it results in the affordability of PV systems for many regions. On the other hand, China is a price setter for many emerging markets, including India.
Some statistics from IEA’s report on Solar PV Global Supply Chains illuminate this further:
Note that some of this data may be outdated since the imposition of duties and the PLI scheme, which are expected to have improved India’s manufacturing capabilities. At the same time, China has significantly increased its manufacturing capacity as the investment cost is three times lower than major markets.
Solar installers in India face significant hurdles in securing their supply chains.
Firstly, the sharp rise in shipping costs, particularly for containers originating in China, where the majority of solar panels are produced, has placed significant strain on the industry.
Secondly, key solar panel inputs, specifically silicon, the primary material utilized in producing solar cells, have experienced marked increases in costs, further exacerbating the situation.
Thirdly, the imposition of import duties on solar modules and cells has caused a spike in ‘made-in-India’ module prices as Indian manufacturing is still not completely independent of Chinese imports.
Additionally, the fundamental components essential for solar cell production have witnessed a notable escalation over the preceding six months, with aluminum demonstrating a hike of 40% in the antecedent 3-4 months. The cost of silicon and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) sheets has increased by 40-50%.
Notably, module prices rose a significant 50% from the end of 2019 to mid-2023 for the first time in ten years in the Indian solar market. However, since July 2023, the market has seen a stark drop in module prices, with forecasts of an increase in the following months. This uncertainty has cast a shadow on the growth of RE assets in India.
The supply chain disruptions have affected the solar project timelines and increased the overall project costs. The principal strategy developers and EPC installers adopt is taking advantage of the price drops and stockpiling modules. Smaller installers, however, suffer the most, which leads to varying EPC costs.
Companies and governments are working together to optimize supply chain strategies, diversify supply sources, and invest in local manufacturing to mitigate the impact of these disruptions and ensure the timely implementation of renewable energy projects. Around 39.6 GWp of PV manufacturing facilities are likely to be set up by 2025 or earlier by both large developers and manufacturers in India. For instance, ReNew has announced backward integration, and Reliance has entered the solar market through PLI Scheme for PV manufacturing.
Notwithstanding, the LCOE for rooftop solar may remain INR 4.5-5.5/unit for some time, even if we presume domestic autonomy is achieved through capacity building in manufacturing, solar manufacturers receive energy subsidies, and developers gain access to cheaper capital. While it is still 40-50% lower than the price of electricity from conventional sources in most state, consumers are expected to be the worst off in the shot-term as the welfare distribution from import duties have been passed to the producers and government.

Heliene, a Canadian solar module manufacturer, has ambitious plans to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint by producing 1 GW of solar modules and 1.5 GW of cells in a new facility in Minnesota. The company currently has manufacturing operations producing 800 MW of modules in Minnesota and 300 MW in Ontario, Canada.
The privately held company plans to invest about $145 million in the new facility, driven by the additional production tax credit and domestic content adder available through the Inflation Reduction Act. The investment comes from Orion Infrastructure Capital (OIC), which contributed $5 million in equity to Heliene and $150 million in credit for the new facility.
The plan is for the new factory, which is expected to be in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, to begin producing modules in 2024 and cells in 2025. Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene, told pv magazine USA that today the company is producing PERC modules, 80% of which are bifacial and 20% industrial rooftop large format. It plans to begin producing TOPcon modules by March 2024.
The new factory will be the company’s first to produce solar cells, and one of only a few that have announced plans to manufacture cells in the U.S. Pochtaruk noted getting cell production up and running requires the civil work to prepare the building, then the permitting process, which takes 6 months, then they’ll receive the equipment to start installation and testing…ultimately taking a total of 24 months. When asked how soon the company will ramp up to the 1.5 GW of cell production, Pochtaruk said that the company plans to start cells by July/August 2025, and it will take “a good 6 to 7 month to ramp up to 85% utilization”.
While the Inflation Reduction Act has a domestic content tax adder, pv magazine USA asked how much module content is currently sourced domestically. “Today we already have frames, encapsulant and back sheet, by December junction boxes and frame sealant. We still need ribbon and glass,” said Pochtaruk.
In October 2022 the company announced the opening of a 420 MW plant in Minnesota, adding to the company’s existing 150 MW operation in the state.

Australia’s Redarc has developed new lithium-ion batteries for applications in rooftop PV systems.
“Alpha150 offers up to 70% more capacity for its size and 30% more capacity per kg when compared to equivalent lithium batteries,” the company claims. “With a lifespan of over 5,000 charge cycles, the Alpha150 offers double the lifespan of most lithium batteries and ten times that of equivalent deep-cycle absorbent glass mat (MAT) batteries.”
Redarc says that the 150 Ah device has a continuous discharge rating of 200 A. It measures 353 mm x 175 mm x 190 mm and weighs 15.5 kg. The device can be charged from as low as -30 C to 45 C and discharged from -20 C to 60 C. Redarc also claims that the device can be recharged up to 80% faster than competitors with a maximum charge rate of 135 A, which reduces charging time to just 1.1 hours.
“When coupled with an appropriate inverter, is enough to power any household appliance from a single battery,” it said.
The Alpha150 Lithium Batteries come with an IP55 protection level and a five-year product warranty. They are being manufactured at an unspecified location in the Netherlands.
