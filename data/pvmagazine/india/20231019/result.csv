The downward trend in module prices across the board could not be stopped this month, but it is clearly losing momentum. Manufacturers and dealers of solar modules are still reducing their prices, but only in small steps, and seek to slowly approach the price level accepted by the market. For a long time now, nothing has been earned from products at this price level.
In China too, it’s all about minimizing damage, because unsold stocks generate avoidable costs and the risk of progressive depreciation is always present. In order not to have to pay extra for transport costs, export quantities to Europe have been drastically reduced by Asian producers in recent weeks.
Interestingly, module prices on continents other than Europe and Asia are not as affected by the price decline. The price gap is sometimes drastically different – in the United States, it is up to 100% compared to the European prices for modules with comparatively low efficiency, which means with monocrystalline PERC cells.
However, products produced in China cannot easily be redirected to America because there are strict import restrictions there. This keeps prices there high and market volume low. We will be curious to see whether the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) really has the desired and needed impact on local PV production capacity. At least with the currently very high purchase and installation costs in the United States, it is rather unlikely.
Transferring this model to other markets is risky, although some non-Chinese manufacturers are already celebrating and shifting their sales focus and scope of operations to the United States. An industry cannot be kept alive permanently through subsidies, we should all have learned that by now.
Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers cannot endure a sustained period of low prices for long and are already trying to stabilize prices again through artificial shortages. If demand picks up again towards the end of the year due to the current price situation, the downward trend could soon be stopped. There is hardly a market participant who is happy with the current situation.
Overview of the price points differentiated by technology in October 2023, including the changes compared to the previous month (as of Oct. 15):

The transmission line for evacuating this power will pass through Himachal Pradesh and Punjab up to Kaithal in Haryana, where it will be integrated with the national grid.
An interconnection is also planned from this project in Leh to the existing Ladakh grid to ensure a reliable power supply to Ladakh. It will also be connected to the Leh-Alusteng-Srinagar line to provide power to Jammu & Kashmir.
The project is targeted to be set up by FY 2029-30 with a total estimated cost of INR 20,773.70 crore (over $2.49 billion) and central financial assistance (CFA) at 40% of the project cost, i.e., INR 8,309.48 crore.
The project will entail setting up 713 km transmission lines (including 480 km HVDC line) and 5 GW capacity of HVDC terminal each at Pang (Ladakh) and Kaithal (Haryana).
“Keeping in view the complex terrain, adverse climatic conditions and defense sensitivities of the Ladakh region, Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd will be the implementing agency for this project. State-of-the-art voltage source converter (VSC) based high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system and extra-high-voltage alternating current (EHVAC) systems will be deployed,” read a government release.
This project is in addition to Intra-State Transmission System Green Energy Corridor Phase-II (InSTS GEC-II), which is already under implementation in the States of Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh for grid integration and power evacuation of approx. 20 GW of RE power and is expected to be completed by 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/19/reliance-begins-trials-of-its-swappable-batteries-for-electric-vehicles/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV BATTERIES,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,MONITORING AND CONTROL,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 19, 2023",Reliance begins trials of its swappable batteries for electric vehicles,"Diversified business conglomerate Reliance Industries, which is setting up a fully integrated battery gigafab in Gujarat, has started trial runs of its swappable EV batteries with online grocer BigBasket in Bangalore. For now, the batteries are being made in-house with imported LFP cells, the company representatives told pv magazine. 
Currently, the company is targeting the e-mobility market, especially electric two-wheelers, and has set up swappable battery charging stations in Bangalore. Using a mobile application, EV customers can locate the nearest swappable battery charging station and reserve it to swap their discharged battery with a fully charged one. Reliance is operating the battery stations. 
The batteries can be charged with grid or solar power and paired with inverters to run home appliances.
Reliance has also developed a next-generation energy management system that will allow consumers to manage their electricity consumption and lower electricity bills. The device can do energy monitoring, energy management, and energy metering using an app. “It can take in the grid, your battery, solar power generation, DG, and home loads and manage which load should be powered from where and what needs to be charged,” said the company representatives.
Reliance Industries is betting on cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology in addition to sodium-ion for its proposed fully integrated energy storage giga-factory in India. Following the acquisition of sodium-ion battery provider Faradion, Reliance Industries, through its arm Reliance New Energy Ltd, acquired Netherlands-headquartered LFP battery specialist Lithium Werks.
The Lithium Werks assets acquired by Reliance include its entire patent portfolio, manufacturing facility in China, key business contracts, and hiring of existing employees. 
Reliance’s choice of LFP battery technology aligns with the global trend towards cobalt-free cathode chemistries, as cobalt availability and price volatility pose a challenge for manufacturing metal-oxide chemistry-based batteries like NMC and LCO. About 60% of the world’s cobalt supply is believed to come from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Further, cobalt mining has been linked to human rights abuses, corruption, environmental destruction, and child labor.

The project will strengthen the national grid to ensure a seamless power flow of 4.5 GW between the Western and Southern regions. It will strengthen the southern region grid and support large-scale integration of renewable energy generation.
The project, Warora Kurnool Transmission Ltd (WKTL), provides an additional inter-regional alternate current link for import into the southern region, i.e., Warora-Warangal and Chilakaluripeta-Hyderabad-Kurnool. It involved the laying of a 1,756 ckm transmission line traversing across Maharashtra, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh and the construction of a 765 kV sub-station in Warangal on a build-own-operate-maintain basis. The project was awarded on a tariff-based competitive bid (TBCB) to Essel InfraProjects Ltd in early 2016 and subsequently acquired by AESL in March 2021 following the stressed debt restructuring undertaken by lenders.
A total of 1,03,000 MT of steel was used for erecting the towers. This equals the amount of material that would be needed to set up 10 Eiffel Towers. A total of 30,154 km of the conductor was used for the transmission lines, which is comparable to making three rounds of the moon. The required conductor material is made from a specialized alloy. An engineering and execution marvel, two mid-stream towers of 102 m height each with pile foundations, was set up on the Krishna River for the first time, shared AESL.

Queensland Hydro said geotechnical exploratory drilling which will help inform the environmental impact statement (EIS) process has started at the site of the Borumba Dam pumped hydro project. The AUD 14.2 billion ($8.96 billion) project is expected to provide 2 GW of dispatchable generating capacity and approximately 48,000 MWh of large-scale storage to the National Electricity Market.
State-owned Queensland Hydro also said the state’s coordinator-general has declared the project, being developed at the 46,000 megaliter Borumba Dam near Gympie, a coordinated project, enabling an assessment of social, economic and environmental matters to begin.
The project involves building a new dam wall at Lake Borumba that will increase the dam’s storage capacity to 224,000 megaliters. A new dam will also be created at a higher altitude with the two reservoirs connected by an underground power station. Water will be pumped to the upper dam during periods of surplus renewable energy and low demand, and then released back to generate electricity during times of high demand.
Pending successful planning and environmental approvals, the project is targeting first power in 2030.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the project, the first of two large-scale long-duration energy storage projects planned by the Queensland government, will play a key role in the state’s renewable energy transition.
“Pumped hydro is proven technology, ready to go now,” he said. “Borumba will allow us to replace expensive fossil fuels with Queensland’s sun, wind, and water, putting the Sunshine State on the map as a global renewable energy hub.”
The Queensland government is aiming to have 70% renewable energy by 2032 and 80% by 2035, up from about 25% of total power generation at present.
De Brenni said the Borumba project will be subject to Queensland procurement policy with the state government looking for Sunshine Coast companies and tradespeople to be part of the build. At peak construction, the project is expected to deliver an estimated 2,300 jobs.

Researchers led by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have fabricated a large-area perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell. They claim iz can achieve a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 25.1%.
They said they tried to overcome shunting, which is a typical issue when scaling up perovskite solar technologies from small-area cells to large-area devices. “Shunts” in PV cells create alternate pathways for a solar-generated charge, leading to power losses. Reduced shunt resistance is associated with multiple forms of module degradation and failure, including hotspots and potential-induced degradation.
The scientists built the 24 cm2 tandem cell with a lithium fluoride (LF) interlayer placed at the interface between a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA) and a wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite absorber. This interlayer is the key element that reportedly improves physical contact at the buried interface and mitigates shunting. The deposited the PTAA and WBG perovskite layers through blade coating.
“Sub-optimal interface contact with substantial voids could act as shunting pathways,” the scientists said. “A LiF interlayer was found to avoid the formation of interfacial voids, which is one possible reason for the reduced shunting of etched tandems with a LiF interlayer.”
The researchers deposited the other layers of the tandem cell by sputtering, thermal evaporation, and atomic layer deposition (ALD). They also tested three different configurations of bottom cells.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the 24 cm2 tandem cell showed an efficiency of 25.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.89 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.1 mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 0.736.
“This is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most efficient two-terminal tandem devices reported in the literature with areas of over 10 cm2,” the researchers said.
They introduced the tandem cell technology in “Shunt mitigation toward efficient large-area perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
“The strategy developed here is valuable for developing efficient, reproducible, and large-scale perovskite-silicon tandems,” the scientists said.
