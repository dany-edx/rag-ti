The bidding deadline, earlier set for May 30, is now revised to June 15. 
State-owned power generators are required to develop this capacity on a build-own-operate basis—either for self-consumption or use by other government entities—using India-made cells and modules. The solar electricity can be supplied to the beneficiary either directly or via power distribution companies on mutually agreed charges.
Under the Scheme, government producers are provided a viability gap funding (VGF) to cover the cost difference between domestic and imported solar cells and modules. 
The selection of the producer would be made using the VGF amount as a bid parameter.  
“The power produced by the government producers can be used on payment of mutually agreed usage charges of not more than INR 2.45/kWh (US$0.034/kWh) for self-use or use by the government entities, either directly or through Discoms. The maximum permissible VGF is INR 55 lakh (US$ 75,451) per megawatt. The actual VGF to the government producer will be decided through the bidding process using the VGF amount as a bid parameter to select the project developer,” as per the tender requirements.

And Siemens, with its gamut of products in this segment, is looking at making most of it.
Speaking at an investors’ meet recently, Sunil Mathur, managing director and chief executive officer, said, “[Siemens] sees much of the initial growth in the Indian electric vehicle (EV) market coming from commercial vehicles. Passenger vehicles are unlikely to be the first ones to get into e-vehicles.”
“In the next one year or two or three, [the market going to see] a lot of commercial vehicles. There are already tenders out there. The FAME program is gaining a lot more interest in the area of e-vehicles and e-charging,” said Mathur. 
In e-charging itself, Siemens sees an opportunity to bring in the entire grid connection, operation and maintenance, and charging infrastructure as well as the software to manage the whole charging station infrastructure.
“As you electrify your fleet, this fleet is going to start moving around the country, and you will need charging stations everywhere. You will need to bring electricity from the grid to the charging stations, and you will need to manage that entire fleet of e-vehicles as well as charging stations. We already have [the software to manage this] and use it in other parts of the world. [We] can implement here in the country as well,” said Mathur. 
Siemens has already signed a memorandum of Understanding with Switch Mobility, the electric vehicle arm of commercial vehicle major Ashok Leyland, to deliver cost-effective e-mobility solutions. These solutions will be available to Switch Mobility’s commercial electric vehicle customers in India. 
Under the partnership, Siemens will provide the charging infrastructure technology and the charging infrastructure management software solutions to enhance the performance of the charging stations. The infrastructure will be supplemented with a management software solution to enhance the energy-efficient operation.
Switch Mobility and Siemens will also collaborate on introducing new business models, such as E-Mobility as a service, integrated depot energy management, vehicle-to-grid, and onsite/offsite renewable energy sources by leveraging batteries from commercial vehicles.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/08/a-repair-tape-for-cracked-backsheets/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JUNE 8, 2021",A repair tape for cracked backsheets,"From pv magazine International
Backsheet failures in solar panels are a reasonably common occurrence and affected panels frequently require replacement in a process which has involved lengthy legal battles and severe engineering challenges. DuPont Photovoltaic Solutions, though, has now brought to market a solution which promises an easy fix – a Tedlar-based band-aid for modules.
The materials supplier estimates that, in Europe alone, about 6 GW of solar capacity is affected by backsheet failures. After years of service in humid or dry, hot or cold conditions, and under severe UV-light irradiation, backsheet materials can suffer from defects, with some materials more susceptible than others. If backsheet failure reaches a critical stage, the film begins to crack, exposing the rear of the semiconductor. That can lead to leakage currents and isolation faults in the system, which will trip the inverter and shut down the array. In such cases, service teams have to make site visits to switch arrays back on, adding expense and loss of income to a site owner’s costs.
In the past, modules suffering in that manner had to be swapped, which may be no easy task if the power class of the new module needs to be the same as that of the device it is replacing. If voltage or current differs on a replacement panel, it cannot simply be integrated into an existing string and new electrical layouts need to be made, which involves planning and engineering work.
DuPont has come to the rescue with its PV Rescue Tape, at a fraction of the cost of panel replacement. The material is a Tedlar-based backsheet that comes with butyl rubber adhesive. Faulty modules can be dismounted in the field by a trained service group from Sc-refit GmbH, an affiliate of Suncycle GmbH. The service crew can fit the new backsheet onto the module using a proprietary tool or there is the opportunity of sending modules to Sc-refit’s repair centers.
“We are delighted to be partnering with DuPont to support this much-needed solution for the PV market,” said Sc-refit chief executive Roberto Gacitua. “There is great demand from both module manufacturers and asset owners for repair products which can help extend the usable lifetime of solar panels. Our specialized repair process, customized for Tedlar PV Rescue Tape, reduces costs versus a full replacement of affected panels. It also helps to improve overall returns on investment of solar assets, making it a win-win solution for everyone involved.”
The solution can be applied to any type of backsheet and is designed to stick to severely cracked surfaces. Sc-refit will commercialize the solution in Europe. The partner will accredit and operate a network of service partners to accommodate rapid deployment of the product.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/08/gggi-supporting-250-mw-solar-plant-along-mumbai-nagpur-highway/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,MAHARASHTRA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 8, 2021",GGGI supporting 250 MW solar plant along Mumbai-Nagpur highway,"South Korea-headquartered Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) is supporting the development of a 250 MW solar PV plant for Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) along a 700 km superhighway connecting Mumbai with Nagpur. The project will wheel renewable energy for all future e-mobility requirement of the highway.
GGGI is a treaty-based inter-governmental organization that promotes sustainable economic growth in developing nations.
In 2018, GGGI entered a partnership with MSRDC to support the superhighway project. In the collaboration, GGGI has provided technical assistance, investment due diligence, and supported debt structuring for the project. 
Based on GGGI analysis, REC Limited has sanctioned around US$110-million loan for the project. The MSRDC board has approved up to 25% of equity investment for the project. The project is currently under power purchase agreement discussions and will likely break ground in mid-2022.
“This is the first renewable energy program that is aligned with a large road infrastructure project in India. GGGI has played a significant role in setting the foundation and paving the way for future green e-mobility infrastructure on the highway,” said Gulshan Vashistha, GGGI’s Regional Technical Lead for Asia and the Pacific.
Additionally, GGGI led the preparation of the technical and commercial studies, including the land assessment, grid study, environmental and social impact assessments, and detailed financial model that demonstrated a convincing business case for evaluating solar PV options. Beyond the design stage, GGGI’s contribution was crucial to get access to finance for the project.
The project is expected to help avoid CO2 emissions by 10 million tons during its 25‐year lifetime and create approximately 200 green jobs. It will pave the path for MSRDC’s additional plan to construct charging stations on the superhighway.
