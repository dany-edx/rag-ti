The two companies signed the partnership agreement recently. 
ReNew will build a 1.3GW hybrid renewable energy capacity supplemented with up to 100MWh of battery storage to provide 400MW of round-the-clock power to the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) under a 25-year power purchase agreement. 
The project will consist of three newly built wind farms and one solar plus battery storage farm across the states of Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. It is expected to start commercial operations in the July-August-September quarter of 2023.
ReNew, through its affiliates, will also undertake engineering, procurement, construction, operation and maintenance, and project management for the RTC project.
Under the 25-year PPA, the project will supply electricity in the first year at a tariff of INR 2.90/kWh (3.8 US cents). The tariff will increase by 3% per year for the first 15 years of the 25-year power supply deal secured by ReNew before becoming a fixed payment for the remaining period of the project. 
Sumant Sinha, founder, chairman and CEO of ReNew Power, said, “The RTC project, the first of its kind in India, provides the lowest cost and emission-free 24×7 renewable electricity. We are proud to partner with Mitsui, a leading global conglomerate, to support India’s green energy transition and look forward to strengthening this partnership in the future.”
Ryoichiro Uno, General Manager in charge of infrastructure projects in India, the Middle East, and Africa of Mitsui, said, “Our mission is to build brighter futures for people around the world through infrastructure development. We view India as an extremely promising market for many reasons, including its high economic growth and strong commitment towards decarbonization. Through this project, Mitsui will accelerate India’s clean energy transition together with ReNew, and contribute to the project’s successful development by leveraging our extensive global experience in power project development, as well as our wide-ranging business network across industries. We look forward to expanding Mitsui’s further collaboration with ReNew beyond this RTC project in India.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/07/tractor-mounted-hydraulic-cleaning-arm-for-solar-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,PV MODULE CLEANER,SOLAR PANEL CLEANING,UTILITY SCALE PV,TAMIL NADU",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 7, 2022","Tractor-mounted, hydraulic panel cleaning arm for solar farms","Tamil Nadu-based Next Automation has come up with a tractor-mounted hydraulic arm as a fast, effective, and water-efficient cleaning solution for PV modules in solar parks. The hydraulically operated cleaning arm, SolarTrack MK1, allows better control and ease of use and cleans in minimum cycle time with optimal water usage.
Kiran Kumar, founder, Next Automation, told pv magazine, “Currently, manual cleaning requires water tankers and laborers to clean panels on a routine basis. With an eight-hour working shift, it takes a month to clean a 15MW plant with six laborers and 2,25,000 liters of water. SolarTrack MK1 takes just five days to clean the entire plant with a maximum of 70,000 to 90,000 liters of water.”
The overall cleaning system contains three parts: brush, water and hydraulic system.
The water system contains a water storage tank to carry water with the tractor itself.  During the cleaning operation, a sprinkler system placed near the rotating brush sprays water on the surface of the panels. The wet cleaning gives more efficient cleaning than dry cleaning methods because the sticky particles and bird droppings cannot be cleaned with the dry cleaning methods.
The hydraulic system helps control the cleaning system’s swivel mechanism, brush rotation, and cleaning height adjustment for various inclinations of panels.
“For solar park operators, dust and bird droppings on the panels are the biggest enemy as it drastically reduces the solar panels’ efficiency. Our equipment can clean bird droppings and sticky particles, which is usually not possible with conventional panel cleaning robots. Wet cleaning is possible with the water system mounted itself,” said Kumar.
As regards ease of use, SolarTrack MK1 can easily cover the entire panel length in a single swipe. Also, unlike with conventional cleaning robots, no system changes or dismantling is required to move to the next array. The tool provides more accurate cleaning and requires no external power source or batteries as it derives the power from the tractor’s power take off (PTO) driven by customized gearbox.
SolarTrack cleaning system is externally mounted on the tractor and can be customized for various lengths of solar panels. After use, it can be folded on the right side of the carrier vehicle and safely trasported.
SolarTrack MK1 swivels up to 120 to 180 degrees. The replaceable rotating brush can be freely pivoted up to 270 degrees, helping to clean all types of inclination angles.

Germany’s Ostermeier H2ydrogen Solutions (OHS) GmbH has developed an electrolysis frame module for residential and commercial applications that allows electricity produced in sunny weather to be stored and used to generate electricity and heat again in the winter. 

The electrolyzer is sold with a compressor, a pressure storage module, and a fuel cell or a Wankel engine to produce electricity.
“Our system is specially designed to work in combination with rooftop PV power generation,” the company’s owner, Markus Ostermeier, told pv magazine. “A solar array with a battery may offer the optimal solution for the configuration we are proposing.”
OHS currently produces the system at its headquarters in Schweitenkirchen, near Munich, Germany. It is selling the system for seasonal storage starting from €160,000 ($175,400), depending on the project size and applications.
 “We sell our devices to schools, agricultural and commercial businesses, as well as to multifamily buildings,” said Ostermeier. “One electrolyzer has been recently sold to the university Hochschule Bremerhaven, two to Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany, and another one to a private company in Aalen, in Baden-Württemberg. We have other clients in Switzerland, Finland and France, and we are planning to produce around 10 electrolyzers this year and another 20 in 2023.”
The system works with tap water and is being offered together with bottles to store hydrogen and a fuel cell or a Wankel engine that OHS buys from external manufacturers. The electrolysis kit is hosted by a 19-inch “ERM” cabinet. The basic version consists of the electrolysis module, the base module, and the control module. The electrolysis module’s stacks are provided by German specialist H-TEC Systems. The system has capacities ranging from 1kW to 100 kW, which corresponds to hydrogen production of 0.2-20 Nm3/h.
As for the power supply, the system operators may choose between an AC/DC power supply with a 400VAC three-phase connection or a DC/DC power supply with a 48 VDC connection. The stack of the electrolysis module is cooled during operation by a standard cooler based on deionized water and the operating temperature is between 55 and 65 C. The heat can be used to support the production of hot water.
“The hydrogen from our system can also be utilized for laboratory applications or as fuel for cars, trucks, forklifts or other vehicles,” Ostermeier said.
Given an electricity price of around €10/MWh, the system should be able to provide green hydrogen at a cost of approximately €12 per kg. “Thanks to its modular design, hydrogen production can be individually and cost-effectively adapted to the different areas of application,” said Ostermeier.
