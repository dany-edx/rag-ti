However, compared to the preceding quarter, new non-hydro RE capacity additions fell by 27% on account of intensifying supply chain constraints.
Solar energy, at 3,072 MW, comprised 93% of the total RE capacity added during the quarter, driven partly by a 142% rise in rooftop solar installations to 700 MW. This growth in new capacity was registered despite a 40% jump in the prices of solar PV modules to INR 21/Watt-peak, over the last year, stated the report. An increase in the cost of raw materials and supply chain constraints resulted in rising solar PV module costs.
“The increase in new RE capacity addition in Q3FY22 is in line with the government’s vision of sustainable growth in the coming years. This also comes at a time when the budget speech highlighted energy transition and climate action as key pillars of future economic development. Although we have seen robust volumes of finance flow towards the transition in recent months, much more is needed simply because India’s targets are so ambitious. The budget proposal to issue sovereign green bonds can help plug this gap. If it also helps spur the development of the domestic corporate green bond market, then it could turn out to be a force multiplier,” said Gagan Sidhu, Director, CEEW-CEF.
“Despite high solar module prices and the imminent basic customs duty, the tariff discovery continued to trend downwards this quarter, with the lowest tariff discovered at INR 2.17/kWh. From an RE capacity addition perspective, the share of RE in total installed capacity is increasing continuously to reach nearly 27% during this quarter. While the pace of RE capacity addition is appreciable, it is highly dominated by solar energy and can be a threat to the power grid’s stability going forward. Exploring alternatives such as hybridising two RE technologies or blending RE with conventional resources is crucial for ensuring a stable power supply,” said Ruchita Shah, Research Analyst, CEEW-CEF.
The CEEW-CEF Handbook further highlighted that sales of electric vehicles jumped by more than 250% to over 1.3 lakh during the Q3 FY21 compared to around 34,000 units in the third quarter of last fiscal. The surge in petrol prices, introduction of new models along with incentives under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid vehicle (FAME-II) scheme contributed to the growth in sales of zero-emission vehicles, especially of electric two-wheelers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/10/solar-manufacturers-request-early-allocation-of-inr-19500-crore-pli-boost/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,INDIA",,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022","Solar manufacturers request early allocation of INR 19,500 crore boost to PLI Scheme","The Union Budget allocates an additional INR 19,500 crore to the production-linked incentive (PLI) for solar manufacturing as the Indian government seeks to facilitate energy security through domestic manufacturing and India’s global commitment of 450 GW of RE by 2030 (which entails an installed solar capacity of 280 GW). The scheme, the best-of-its-kind non-tariff measure globally, was initially allocated INR 4,500 crore in November 2020. Bids were invited last year that saw an overwhelming response of 52 GW with a demand for INR 23,000 crore. The scheme incentivizes the best technology, the extent of localization, and level of integration to ensure that the panels produced are at par with the best in the world and give a fillip to the PV deployment in the country.
To encourage domestic supply source to the solar industry, which is 85% dependent on imports, basic customs duties (BCD) of 40% on import of solar modules and 25% on cells were announced last year. The duties are set to become effective from April this year. To ensure that only domestically produced and certified high-quality modules are used, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has also strengthened the ALMM order through its circular on January 13, 2022. The ALMM certified capacity as of December end last year stood at 11.2 GW with 41 approved manufacturers. Industry sources reveal that further applications for 6 GW have been made last month.
Large project developers are comfortable in sourcing for the near term but are worried about the ramping up of domestic manufacturing capacity to keep pace with the annual deployment of 30 GW, once all tenders/ PPAs under bidding (32 GW) are awarded and several schemes/ previous contracts under various stages of implementation (50 GW) shift to on-ground execution. 
The MNRE had clearly stated after evaluation of bids, if the solar PLI allocation was enhanced to INR 24,000 crore, manufacturing commitment under the scheme can be around 55 GW. The MNRE, through the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA), the nodal agency for solar PLI implementation, had shortlisted three beneficiaries (Reliance New Energy Solar, Shirdi Sai Electricals, and Adani Infrastructure) in December, based on the initial allocation of INR 4,500 crore, against cumulative commitments for setting up 12 GW manufacturing capacities under the Solar PLI scheme.
Eighteen eligible PLI bids were received, out of which 15 are still in the fray. It is clear from among these, twelve companies, including Coal India, Waaree Energies, First Solar, Vikram Solar, Premier Energies, Emmvee, Larsen and Toubro, Megha Engineering, Tata Power Solar, ReNew Solar, Avaada, and Acme, can now be easily accommodated in the scheme. The scheme inherently facilitates bucketing or waitlisting to ensure that maximum capacity comes up on the ground. Thanks to the higher allocation, the total outgo after provisioning for the entire capacity of 48.6 GW committed by these 15 players is INR 21,600 crores, lower than the total pool of INR 24,000 crore.
All stakeholders are expecting IREDA, which has been capitalized recently, to expedite and issue letters of award to balance companies that have bid under the PLI scheme. Most players have already acquired land and some have even done the land development work and basic construction in anticipation of the award pending for the last three months. 
Sources state that if the confirmation is communicated to the Bidders, they can move with speed on ordering equipment and commissioning the plants in the next 12-18 months, allaying the fear of supply not keeping pace with demand. Some are even confident of leveraging the global scenario where most countries are looking at deleveraging their dependence on China and developing a credible second supply chain by supplying to export markets like the USA while the domestic demand ramps up to 30 GW per annum.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/10/tapping-the-off-grid-solar-market-in-india/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MAKE IN INDIA,OFF-GRID SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022",Tapping the off-grid solar market in India,"How big is the potential for off-grid solar energy in India?  
Over the last two decades, the Indian off-grid solar market has witnessed a lot of growth. Many players are coming into the picture to sell and distribute a varied range of solar products, domestically produced as well as imported ones. 
The growth in the industry started getting bigger in the late 1990s when the bigger companies took solar home systems and solar lanterns to rural India. At the same time, the Indian government also started supporting Akshay Urjaa (Everlasting Energy) outlets in all areas across the nation. At first, these outlets were under some NGOs and government agencies, and then, from 2002 onward, the government encouraged private entrepreneurs to take over.
In 2010, the industry observed a high demand and that is how the industry started to flourish. The market is growing and that is how the potential of new inventions and sales grow too.
What have been the major application areas? How have the requirements in rural areas evolved creating new markets for solar manufacturers? How are solar providers responding to the market evolution?
Our major application areas have been the places with low or no electricity. Commercial and industrial areas near highways like farms, flour mills, sugar mills, etc need our solar installations to minimize and optimize electricity. In the remote areas, we target domestic shops and places where the electricity has not reached.
In the rural areas, where electricity has not reached fully, solar plays an important role in operating the household lighting and modes of entertainment like radio and television. Women and children who stay home most of the time are the ones who need the inflow of light. Be it the household chores or studies, electricity becomes important. That is why the solar market is expanding in the rural areas, letting the manufacturers explore new demands and ways to supply more too.
With the right support by the government in this area, solar energy systems can improve many prevalent issues in rural areas like health care and education; irrigation; water supply for consumption; veterinary services; food preparation and refrigeration; and tourism. 
Before the Modi government, solar’s share in the overall electricity market was 1-2%. Then, the government worked towards making policies around solar, and now, the solar and consumable market has reached up to 15-16%. 
However, we still feel we can achieve 85% with the right government policies like Make in India and the entrepreneurial wave in the country that has encouraged innovations and startups across the nation. 
Off-grid solar products continue to be expensive. What are the alternate success models?
The more advanced the technology, the more the cost. Compared to fossil fuels, solar energy systems are easy to use, low in maintenance, and have less impact on the environment. Therefore, they are also more expensive.
The issue that comes in rural areas, is that many farmers (who earn daily wages) cannot invest in such an expensive product at once. Hence, unaffordability becomes a hindrance in solar energy use too. The product, the batteries, and a backup system – all together become a little heavy on the pocket of a farmer. 
Therefore, there should be a system of better loan providers in the rural areas, better infrastructure to retain such technology, and awareness to use the product too. 
One alternate success model is on-grid solar products. These are battery-free products, so less maintenance is needed. 
What’s the key to survival for solar providers in a rural market that’s price-sensitive and crowded with many players?  
We feel survival depends on innovation and inventions. We are different from the general market of solar brands as we have a different line of products in this segment. 
Ninety percent of the solar-related companies deal in solar panel installations, and they offer on-grid inverters and other products from Chinese manufacturers. However, we make our products in India, and we are not only about solar panel. We differ from the other companies as we cater to the solar consumer electronics market. 
In the past, we have manufactured unique solar-enabled items that can function with both AC and DC. 
Our inventions are solar air conditioners, freezers, deep freezers, and even compressors, and all of them are less power-consuming products.
Up to what extent, localization is possible in off-grid PV products? What components are yet to be imported?
With an emphasis on Make in India, most of the production and manufacturing has been done in India. We support Make in India and we feel that a lot of dependency on different countries has been minimized now. It has created more employment opportunities, more innovations, and economic growth. However, the concept is new, so there are a few things that we are importing from outside. Right now, we get semiconductors from other countries.
Our focus is on making consumer-driven products that have longevity. We do so to minimize the dependency of our consumers on us all the time.

Global solar generation capacity could hit around 3.4TW this decade, according to BloombergNEF‘s head of solar analysis Jenny Chase.
Chase published the prediction in an article surveying the current state of solar, and its future prospects, for sustainable energy journal Joule which was also published on the ScienceDirect website.
The article, View from the Solar Industry: We Don’t Need COP26 to Shine, But What Should We Worry About? included Bloomberg’s estimate for the volume of solar which will have been installed worldwide in 2030, with the analyst having estimated 183GW of photovoltaics were installed last year and this year will bring “comfortably more than 200GW.”
Chase cited the polysilicon shortage which drove up solar panel prices last year as one possible headwind, although the solar analyst expects the situation to ease with the arrival of new poly manufacturing capacity this year.
Shortages of land and grid connection points in some of the biggest solar markets could also pose problems for PV although Chase points out the industry’s biggest developers don’t seem to have been significantly slowed by those hurdles yet, with the solar expert adding: “Solar and wind deployment could not now be stopped if we wanted to.”
In terms of how much renewables are needed to hit a net zero world in mid century – with Chase remarking upon how much faster the scale of solar capacity is growing than that of wind – BloombergNEF’s renewables-focused “green” scenario would require 5.3TW of solar this decade – with 1TW of it to power green hydrogen production – and 19.7TW by 2050.
Alternative routes mapped by the analyst lean on the nuclear and carbon capture, use and storage technologies which, as yet, are not developing with sufficient speed, and Chase sounded a positive note to readers daunted by the scale of the job required by remarking, in relation to historic forecasts for clean energy roll-out: “As analysts, we are far better at seeing problems in each country than we are at imagining transformative change to world energy systems.”

Hyundai Energy Solutions, a unit of South Korean shipbuilding group Hyundai Heavy Industries, has said that it will partner with PV production equipment supplier Jusung Engineering on the development of tandem heterojunction (HJT) solar modules.
Jusung Engineering will be responsible for developing the manufacturing processes and the equipment for the production of heterojunction products based on 182 mm M10 wafers.
Via the new partnership, Hyunday Energy Solution aims to commercialize heterojunction panels with a power conversion efficiency that is purportedly 23% higher than that of conventional PERC panels.
Jusung Engineering, which supplies equipment for both thin-film and crystalline silicon solar products, said last summer that it has developed an n-type single-crystal HJT solar cell with an efficiency of 24.45%. The result was certified by the Korea Energy Research Institute.
