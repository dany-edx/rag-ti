It will use the power generated for internal needs and aluminum production at the Mahan unit.
The plant is expected to produce around 55 million units of electricity per annum.
Hindalco targets to become net-zero by 2050. It recently signed a commercial arrangement with renewables developer Greenko to set up 375 MW to 400 MW of “captive” solar and wind power capacity. The project will supply power to its Aditya Aluminium smelter in Odisha.

With this deal, Magenta formally enters the Delhi NCR. The deployment is over and above Magenta’s existing fleet for Flipkart in Bengaluru.
Magenta Mobility operates an electric fleet of more than 500 vehicles in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai, serving clients in e-commerce, grocery delivery, FMCG, food and pharmaceuticals. To date, its electric cargo fleet has traveled over 1 million kilometers, avoiding approximately 150 metric tons of CO2 emissions.
Magenta Mobility plans to deploy a fleet of more than 500 EVs in Delhi this year to meet the needs of organizations looking to transition to clean mobility.
“The electrification of the logistics fleet is a key part of Flipkart’s larger sustainability goal and in line with its commitment to the Climate Group’s EV100 initiative,” stated Flipkart. “The collaboration reinforces Flipkart’s plans to introduce more than 25,000 EVs in its supply chain to achieve 100% transition to e-mobility by 2030.”

(MSEDCL). It won 300 MW of PV capacity at a tariff of INR 2.83/kWh ($0.036).
The developer can connect the projects to the inter-state or intra-state grid, anywhere in India. It will supply the generated power to MSEDCL through the state grid in Maharashtra on a long-term basis.
Avaada recently won 25 MW win in another 500 MW solar auction (phase seven) by MSEDCL in August. It secured 25 MW at a tariff of INR 2.91/kWh.
“By winning the MSEDCL auctions for a total of 325 MWac capacity, we are well on our way to achieving our targeted renewable energy capacity of 5 GW by the end of FY 2022-23 and 11 GW by the end of 2025,” said Avaada Chairman Vineet Mittal.
The projects must be commissioned within 18 months from the date of the signing of the power purchase agreement. In addition, the projects must achieve financial closure within 12 months.
Avaada aims to reach 11 GW by 2025 and 30 GW by 2030. It has a manufacturing facility with an annual capacity of 5 GW for cells and modules, with commercial production expected to start by early next year. Avaada plans to scale up its PV manufacturing to 10 GW by 2030, with backward integration into polysilicon, ingots, and wafers.

Researchers from the University of Melbourne and the University of Manchester have designed a direct air electrolysis (DAE) module to produce hydrogen for applications in remote areas.
The device uses moisture in the air to directly generate hydrogen via electrolysis, without any input of liquid water. The module consists of a water harvesting unit in the middle and electrodes on both sides paired with gas collectors. It can be paired with both photovoltaic and wind power generators, as well as with any generator relying on renewable energy sources.
The water harvesting unit also works as the reservoir to hold the electrolyte.
“Porous medium such as melamine sponge, sintered glass foam is soaked with deliquescent ionic substance to absorb moisture from the air via the exposed surfaces,” the scientists said. “The captured water in the liquid phase is transferred to the surfaces of the electrodes via diffusion and subsequently split into hydrogen and oxygen in situ which are collected separately as a pure gas, since both electrodes are isolated from air.”
They said the reservoir between the endplate and the porous foam acts as an air barrier and a buffer for the ionic solution at the excessive fluctuation of the air humidity. They noted that it avoids the overflow of the electrolyte from the DAE module or the dry-up of the wetted foam.
“The foam filled with ionic solutions forms a physical barrier that effectively isolates hydrogen, oxygen, and air from any mixing,” they said.
The group built two prototypes relying on solar and wind power. They constructed the solar-driven free-standing hydrogen tower with a solar panel and five DAE modules stacked in parallel.
“The footprint of the tower is no more than the solar panel, meaning our DAE will not occupy extra land, which can be costly in some areas,” they said.
The proposed system configuration was tested for twelve days with an outdoor temperature varying from 20 C to 40 C and the relative humidity ranged from 20% to 40%. The device was able to produce around 1500 ml of hydrogen in a day and showed a Faradaic efficiency of around 95%. The Faradic efficiency is the measure of the efficiency with which the electrons participate in a given electrochemical transformation.
“After keeping the above DAE module unattended in air for eight months, the Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen remains around 90%, without any maintenance,” the academics said. “The prototype achieved automated steady hydrogen production depending on the solar intensity under varying weather conditions.”
The scientists presented the novel tech in “Hydrogen production from the air,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
“Further improvement of the surface-to-volume ratio by engineering channels or increasing the aspect ratios of the sponge material will guarantee the rate of water uptake which is essential to the upscaling of the DAE units,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/12/bslbatt-unveils-10-24-kwh-battery-for-residential-pv/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2022",Bslbatt unveils 10.24 kWh battery for residential PV,"From pv magazine Global
Bslbatt, a Chinese storage system manufacturer, has released a new wall-mounted storage system for use with residential PV systems.
“This home battery also features a built-in battery management system to provide overvoltage and Undervoltage monitoring, temperature control, and internal circuit short circuit protection to help keep each cell in a healthy state and extend the life of lithium iron phosphate cells,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The B-LFP48-200PW is compatible with several inverters on the market, such as Victron, Studer, Deye, Goodwe, Growatt, Sofar, and SMA.”
The battery measures 680 mm x 485 mm x 220 mm and weighs 107 kg. It has a storage capacity of 10.24 kWh, a rated capacity of 200 Ah, and a voltage of 48 V.  The lithium-ion system uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has an ambient operating temperature range of -20 C to 55 C. It comes with a 10-year warranty and can purportedly operate for more than 6,000 cycles. It also features an IP54 protection level.
Bslbatt said that up to 16 units can be stacked in series to provide additional capacity.
“The battery is fully internalized in a vehicle-grade module structure using tier-one, A+ lithium iron phosphate cell composition, a premium module structure that provides better stability and heat dissipation, so it has a longer cycle life and does not have the toxicity or fire hazards of other lithium technologies,” said the company.
