Renewable energy is one of the key elements of Huhtamaki’s 2030 sustainability ambitions. Huhtamaki India chose Amplus Solar to solarize its factories across Guwahati, Daman, Silvassa, and Taloja, moving a step further towards that aim.
The plants use polycrystalline rooftop solar panels. The use of solar power generated from the plants will help the company offset CO2 emissions by approximately 750 MT per annum. This is equivalent to planting nearly 50,000 trees. 
All installations are equipped with high-end safety systems and online performance monitoring.
Speaking on the use of rooftop solar panels, Sunil Bhagwat, Head of Operations, Huhtamaki India, said, “Huhtamaki has clear sustainability ambitions, including harnessing renewable energy. The installation of solar panels is a visible demonstration of the way we are embedding sustainability in all what we do within our operations.”

The Board of the company recently approved the proposal to set up the plant at a cost of about INR 750 crore. 
The plant is expected to be commissioned by December 2022 and generate 370 million units of electricity per annum. The power generated from the solar project will replace the high-cost thermal and grid power, and be utilized for the enhanced billet capacity in the company’s existing plant situated in the Raipur district of the State.  
The project shall be funded mainly out of internal accruals. 
The solar plant shall come up over an existing idle land parcel of 362 hectares acquired by the company in the FY 2011-12.
Currently, Godawari Power & Ispat Limited’s steel plant has a captive power generation capacity of 73 MW, including 42 MW captive energy from waste heat recovery, 11 MW from a coal-fired thermal power plant, and 20 MW from biomass power capacity. Additionally, it gets 25 MW from a coal-fired thermal power plant by its arm Jagdamba Power and 50 MW from a solar thermal power plant in Rajasthan to meet its electricity needs.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/27/adani-solar-top-performer-for-fourth-consecutive-year/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 27, 2021",Adani Solar top performer for fourth consecutive year,"PVEL (PV Evolution Labs LLP) has released its seventh annual PV Module Reliability Scorecard, the most comprehensive publicly available comparison of PV module reliability test results. It has rated Adani Solar (Mundra Solar PV) as the Top Performer in its PV Module Product Qualification Program (PQP) for its high-efficiency panels.
With this recognition, Adani Solar has emerged as the only Indian solar manufacturing company to win it for four consecutive years since 2018.
PV Module PQP at PVEL is the most comprehensive program for stringent testing of PV modules on reliability and quality parameters, with data and results publicly available.
Adani Solar is a vertically integrated cell and module manufacturer with a capacity to produce up to 1.5 GW of multi, mono-PERC, and PERT bifacial PV modules at its factory located at Mundra SEZ in the Indian State of Gujarat. The state-of-the-art factory with multi-level infrastructure is being scaled up to 3.5 GW of cell and module manufacturing under a single roof.
Ramesh Nair, chief executive officer of Adani Solar, said, “PVEL’s PV Module Reliability Scorecard is an invaluable tool that banks, IPPs, developers, and engineers use to ensure that projects are built with reliable and durable products. Four wins in a row for Adani Solar is a testament to our manufacturing excellence and reflects our commitment to producing solar PV cells and modules while ensuring the highest quality, bankability, and reliability. We at Adani Solar will continue to provide the most reliable and high-efficiency products, which pass through stringent test procedures from material selection to finished goods stage along with continual in-house reliability tests that has enabled us to create benchmarks for ourselves.”
Adani Solar is the solar PV manufacturing and EPC arm of Adani Group, one of India’s largest business houses with presence spanning across resources, logistics, energy, agri and ancillary industries.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/27/panasonic-launches-380-w-heterojunction-solar-module-compatible-with-its-evervolt-battery/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 27, 2021",Panasonic launches 380 W heterojunction solar module compatible with its Evervolt battery,"Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic has launched a new residential heterojunction panel series that is compatible with its Evervolt lithium-ion storage solution for residential solar installations.
The new module series, which will be available from the third quarter of this year, features a power output ranging from 370 to 380 W and an efficiency of 21.2% to 21.7%.
The panel’s temperature coefficient is -0.26% per degree Celsius and the manufacturer offers a 25-year product guarantee and a 25-year power output guarantee. The panels are said to be able to operate at 92% of their original performance at the end of the guarantee period.
Furthermore, the Japanese module maker launched a black version of the same module in a series with a power output of between 360 and 370 W and efficiency ranging from 20.6% to 21.2%. “The new modules are the latest technological evolutions in our roadmap of innovative solutions designed with homeowners’ and installers’ needs in mind,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, Panasonic said the cabinet of its Evervolt battery has been improved to stack more batteries and store more energy in a smaller space. “The improved cabinet will be 29x47x18 inches, 22 square inches smaller than the previous EverVolt battery storage model,” it explained. “In addition to offering both the AC- and DC-coupled options, the battery storage system can be scaled down to as little as 11kWh of energy storage or expanded to 102kWh.”
Panasonic had launched its EverVolt storage system in September 2019. The battery has a storage capacity ranging from 5.7 kWh up to 34.2 kWh. The 5.7 kWh ‘mini’ version of the storage system has an average back-up capability of three hours, the 11.4 kWh standard option six hours and the 17.1 kWh ‘plus’ product nine hours.
