The state-of-the-art gas-insulated substation (GIS) is currently capable of evacuating 300 MW and can be scaled up to 700 MW depending on the requirement. 
Backed by three different sources and diversified paths, the gas-insulated substation ensures 100% availability of power at all times, thus powering the two million square feet CtrlS Datacenter Campus spread across ten Data Centers. The campus is currently under construction, of which four rated-4 data centers are operational.
CtrlS GIS facility will help businesses collocate their high-density IT infrastructure combined with seamless scalability to address their growth requirements.
The GIS deployed by CtrlS is one of the first large-scale deployments in Asia powered by 3 line configuration (N+N+1). CtrlS facility is equipped to deliver large capacities such as 100 MW of power to any customer in 15 to 18 months.
The gas-insulated substation occupies less space than a conventional air-insulated substation. The technology originally began in Japan in the 60’s, where there was a critical need to develop substations with a greatly reduced footprint. In the US, only about 2 to 5% of new substations are constructed as GIS.
 “The deployment of 300 MW gas insulated substation scalable to 700 MW is our commitment to the industry as we continue to address the growing needs of hyperscalers, telcos, BFSI, healthcare, gaming, and new-age companies. We stay committed to adopting innovative approaches to serve the unmet needs of our customers, said Sridhar Pinnnapureddy, Founder and CEO, CtrlS Datacenters.”
With GIS technology, the clearance needed for phase-to-phase or phase-to-ground for all equipment is much less than for an air-insulated substation. The total space required for a GIS is roughly 10% of that needed for a conventional AIS facility.

Under the scheme, it shall also provide finance for EV fleet owners/operators and charging infrastructure owners—thus financing the entire value chain of green mobility.
Technologies eligible for financing include “battery energy storage systems (BESS) and batteries, projects involving production of green hydrogen (electrolyzers), fuel cells, manufacturing/ assembling plant of electric vehicles and associated components, and waste recycling units to meet the demands of the renewable energy sector, electric mobility and BESS segments.”
IREDA is already financing compressed biogas (CBG) and bioethanol production projects to meet the demand for sustainable alternatives towards mobility. The new Scheme further extends its mandate for financing the entire value chain of green mobility as accelerating energy transitions away from carbon-based fuel sources is key to achieving climate mitigation promises and energy security objectives for the nation. 
Recently, the Government of India set a target of the non-fossil energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030 and Net-Zero by the year 2070. Electricity comprises only around 16.5% of the final energy consumption at the national level and additional efforts are required to reduce greenhouse gasses (GHG) emitted by the remaining 83.5% energy sector. Accordingly, for large-scale integration of renewable energy and increasing its usage in the economy beyond scope of meeting power sector requirements only, there is a need for constant focus and investments in new and emerging technologies to integrate renewable energy usage in the industry and transport sector. 
Development of robust manufacturing and deployment infrastructure for battery energy storage systems, green hydrogen, biofuel, green mobility, and charging infrastructure shall play a major role to meet this goal.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/12/asia-pacific-solar-supply-chain-trouble-to-ease-this-year-according-to-analyst/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,INDIA,JAPAN",MAX HALL,"JANUARY 12, 2022","Asia Pacific solar supply chain trouble to ease this year, according to analyst","From pv magazine International
The supply chain problems which helped drive up the cost of solar power equipment last year will ease in 2022, according to Scottish analyst Wood Mackenzie.
A note issued by the U.S.-owned data company, which highlighted how such issues drove up the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) across the Asia-Pacific region in 2021, saw senior analyst Rishab Shrestha state: “Renewables’ supply chain bottlenecks are expected to ease in 2022 and beyond, and the respective LCOE will return to a declining trend.”
With Chinese polysilicon companies ramping up production facilities, WoodMac said an easing in supply problems, and related cost rises, would reverse a 9% year-on-year rise in the average cost of solar projects across the region recorded last year, to US$0.086/kWh – the first such rise in the history of the region’s solar industry.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
The only market not to experience more expensive PV electricity last year was solar superpower China, in part thanks to the zero-tolerance Covid policy which has attracted so much attention in western nations of late. Rampant rises in the cost of fossil fuels in China, domestic solar manufacturing, and the nation’s climate change commitments were also factors, according to Verisk-owned WoodMac.
Steepling rises in fossil fuel costs last year ensured that even with their unusual price premiums, Asia-Pacific solar and onshore wind projects – the latter rising in cost 2%, to US$0.103/kWh – gained ground in their economic business case against gas-fired power projects, which became 46% more costly in the region in 2021, and coal plants, which cost 19% more than in 2020.
While solar and onshore wind facilities are 12-29% cheaper over their project lifetime than fossil fuel equivalents in India, China and Australia, “a significant renewables premium” across the other Asia-Pacific countries ensures such clean power plants are 16% more costly over their operating life than gas and coal generation sites, across the region as a whole.
That situation will be reversed by the end of the decade, according to WoodMac, which predicted solar projects, and to a lesser extent onshore wind sites, will together be 28% cheaper than coal across the Asia-Pacific market in 2030 and will achieve at least cost parity with gas. By that stage, solar and onshore wind will be 50-55% cheaper than coal in India, China and Australia, casting into doubt the efficacy of the successful push by the former two nations to water down a desired global commitment to phase out coal use, at the COP26 climate change talks in Glasgow in November.
With gas-fired generation costs potentially set to be driven up 70-100% by the costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology this decade, according to the analyst, the current 50% price premium of renewables with energy storage against the fossil fuel could be removed by 2030.
With around 70% of Asia-Pacific power generation based on fossil fuels, WoodMac research director Alex Whitworth hit out at what he said were plans by the Japanese government to base its future electricity generation on a mix of 20% green or blue ammonia – the latter produced from nitrogen plus hydrogen powered by CCS-equipped gas facilities – and 80% coal.
“A fuel mix of 20% green or blue ammonia plus 80% coal, as proposed, will cost around US$150/MWh even by 2030,” said Whitworth in the WoodMac note. “This is more expensive than gas power while still emitting almost twice as much carbon. A combination of offshore wind and distributed solar backed up by storage and gas units would have a similar price tag. Is Japan ready for a potential doubling of the average power generation costs in 2030 compared to recent years?”

Chemical-based battery company LG Energy Solution‘s (LGES’) $10.7 billion initial public offering received bids worth around $80 billion from institutional investors, Reuters reported today. The book for the offering, the largest ever held in South Korea, will close tomorrow with deal pricing set for Friday.
The reported IPO could take the company’s value to as much as KRW70.2 trillion ($58.8 billion), which would make it South Korea’s third-biggest listed company, after Samsung Electronics and semiconductor business SK Hynix. According to a previous report from Bloomberg, the price range was set at KRW257,000-300,000 per share.
Demand for the stock was reportedly around 13 times bigger than the $6 billion on offer to institutions, according to the company’s regulatory filings for the IPO.
LGES had announced at a press conference this week it would use the proceeds from its IPO – on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index – to expand its manufacturing capacity in Europe, the Americas and Asia. The company also forecast its market share would overtake that of rival Chinese battery maker CATL thanks to a wider range of customers, and said it was aiming for a double-digit operating margin.
