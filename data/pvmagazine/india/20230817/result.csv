It had commissioned the Mishrikh PV plant recently. The plant is delivering power to JK Cement’s Aligarh Unit.
“With this 10 MWp solar offtake, we will be taking the overall RE replacement to more than 60% in our overall energy mix at Aligarh manufacturing plant, thereby reducing more than 10,780 tonnes of CO2 annually. This marks a significant milestone in our journey towards reducing CO2 emissions and driving the transition to clean energy by joining forces,” said Madhav Singhania, deputy managing director and CEO at JK Cement.
The Mishrikh PV plant is AmpIn’s fifth solar open-access project in Uttar Pradesh.
With a total investment of INR 1,337 crore ($161 million), Ampin has a cumulative solar project portfolio of 300 MWp across seven locations in Uttar Pradesh, out of which 120 MWp is operational and 180 MWp at advance stage of execution.

The story of Diu and T’au,"Diu, India’s first solar city, is one of the three districts of the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu of India. It is made up of Diu Island and two small enclaves on the Indian mainland. 
With a population of 50,000, Diu is one of the top 10 least populated districts in India. A very low population density and large barren land make it perfectly suitable for solar power generation. 
The union territory was completely dependent on the Gujarat government to provide its citizens with basic amenities like electricity. However, in 2016, Diu became the first city in India to completely run on solar energy. The island has good exposure to the Sun and has installed two solar parks and rooftop solar on almost 112 government establishments, which operate for 12 hours, from 6 am to 6 pm. 
The solar parks have a cumulative power generation capacity of more than 10 MW, against the city’s demand of around 5 to 7 MW. The plants supply power to residential, industrial, and even establishments like hospitals. The projects were done by BHEL and a private company in unison.
The parks were sanctioned in 2013 and became operational in 2015. To ensure the efficiency of production does not drop, regular cleaning is required. The excess power generated is transferred back to the grid. 
This solar success couldn’t be replicated in Daman, the neighboring city of Diu, as the city has been completely industrialized and has hardly any free space. As there is no barren land, the most deployed type of solar is rooftop solar.
T’AU is a small island in American Samoa, situated more than 4,000 miles away from the West Coast of the USA. It has a population of 600 only.  
For its power requirements, the island was completely dependent on diesel generators, which consumed more than 100,000 gallons of diesel a year. The diesel was shipped from the main island of Tutuila. The transport of fuel from Tutuila was prone to disruption because of bad weather and rough seas. 
The island switched almost entirely to solar power with the installation of a microgrid featuring 1.4 MW solar and 6 MWh of battery storage. Neighboring islands of T’au are planning to replicate this success. 
The solar and energy storage solution is not only a cleaner alternative but also offers cost savings. The batteries store the excess solar energy for use at night, and there is no longer a need for power rationing.
The project was funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
It is quite astonishing to see the whole population, on a considerable landmass, thriving only on solar energy. With these model cases to look up to, the real test now is to replicate 100% solar adoption in bigger land masses where high population density, crippling bureaucracy, and lack of space are the likely challenges.

UbiQD, Inc., a New Mexico-based nanotechnology company, entered into a joint development agreement with First Solar to further explore the benefits of incorporating fluorescent quantum dot technology in advanced solar modules.
“If successful, this application in solar modules could be a perfect example of the broad applicability of our core technology,” said Hunter McDaniel, UbiQD CEO. “With emerging applications in food and energy, these novel nanomaterials are proving to be a key tool in humanity’s urgent response to climate change and further sustainable economic development.”
Quantum dots (QD) are photoluminescent particles so small that it would take 100,000 of them to span one fingernail, said UbiQD. The company said it has applications in localized DC microgrids, smart building solutions, including integration with sensors for climate and ambient controls. UbiQD also has a UbiGro brand used in greenhouse and agrivoltaic installations.
“As we work towards developing the next generation of photovoltaics, we are exploring a range of enhancements that could allow us to convert more sunlight into energy,” said Markus Gloeckler, chief technology officer, First Solar. “We are interested in the potential use of quantum dots in optimizing the absorption of light and look forward to continuing our work with UbiQD on exploring this possibility.”
While UbiQD (short for Ubiquitous Quantum Dots) is a startup, it has much history in high-level applications. In 2021 UbiQD installed its energy-producing windows at three commercial sites. In 2022, the company’s quantum dot solar technology was used in a Small Business Innovation Research project with the United States Air Force. The Air force contract provided funding for two installations of over 20 windows and additional scale-up and development funds for the product. Also in 2022, UbiQD announced that it was developing a solution for controlled-environment agriculture in partnership with Heliene, a U.S.-based solar module manufacturer.
UbiQD also took part as a Growth Stage company earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 2023 NREL Industry Growth Forum. The forum included 40 companies that represent a range of clean and sustainable technology startups from around the world, and UbiQD was recognized as the Best Overall Venture.
