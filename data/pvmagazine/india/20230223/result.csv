S&P calculated and ranked publicly traded companies based on their asset worth, revenues, profits, and return on invested capital.
With a 17% share of the installed capacity, NTPC currently contributes 24% of the total electricity produced in India. The company strives to deliver economical, efficient, and ecologically sustainable power. To meet this objective, it offers a diversified energy mix comprising gas, wind, solar, hydro, floating solar, and coal.
NTPC targets to become a 130 GW company by 2032, with non-fossil fuel-based capacity making up nearly 50% of the company’s portfolio. The company is leading India’s energy transition with scale, efficiency, and energy generation from cleaner and greener sources. It has teamed with government think tank NITI Aayog for the net-zero effort.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/23/india-recorded-highest-ever-annual-solar-installations-in-2022/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,OFF-GRID SOLAR,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",India recorded highest ever annual solar installations in 2022,"India recorded its highest-ever yearly solar installation of 13 GW in 2022. The annual addition was 27% up from 10.2 GW installed in CY 2021, according to Mercom India Research’s 2022 Q4 & Annual India Solar Market Update.
Large-scale solar projects accounted for 87% of the cumulative 13 GW installations in 2022, a 33% surge YoY. 
Q4 2022 addition stood at 2.6 GW. 
India’s cumulative installed solar capacity reached 63 GW on Dec. 31, 2022. The large-scale solar project pipeline stood at 58 GW, with another 51 GW of projects tendered and pending auction at the end of 2022.
“Though impressive, record solar capacity additions in 2022 were barely half the 27 GW annual installations needed to meet the 280 GW target by 2030. Policies must be quickly retooled and hurdles removed to double the annual pace of installations and attract the needed investments,” said Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu.
According to the report, the growth outlook going into 2023 remains uncertain, with the pending judgment on projects stranded in the Great Indian Bustard region, the pending announcement on Approved lists of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), and expected project extensions per MNRE’s direction to Solar Energy Corp. of India, Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, NHPC, and NTPC.
The report highlights a rise in the average cost of projects throughout CY 2022 due to higher module prices and supply constraints. Average large-scale system costs in Q4 2022 increased by 7.3% YoY, making it an unprecedented ten quarters of project cost increases in a row.
In 2022, solar tenders increased 23% YoY, while auctions fell 29% compared to 2021. Implementation of basic customs duty (BCD), shortage of modules enlisted under the ALMM, and various policy announcements and amendments resulted in lower auction activity in 2022.

The latest addition will expand Emmvee’s module capacity to 3 GW.
The module and cell facilities are scheduled to commence operation in June 2023 and early 2024, respectively.
“With this integrated manufacturing facility, we would have stronger control over our supply chain, providing the latest technology that meets global standards and requirements. With the start of construction of our new facility, Emmvee will continue to fulfill the increasing demand and support its customers in business continuity by timely execution of supply,” said Manjunatha, managing director of Emmvee Group of Companies.
“The expansion of capacity is under INR 1,000-crore MoU recently signed with the government of Karnataka,” said Suhas Donthi, group director, Emmvee Group of Companies.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/23/perovskite-cigs-tandem-solar-cell-design-promises-29-7-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",Perovskite-CIGS tandem solar cell design promises 29.7% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Chitkara University in India have designed and simulated a two-terminal, monolithically stacked tandem solar cell based on a bottom cell made of perovskite with an energy bandgap of 1.68 eV. The top cell is based on CIGS, with a bandgap of 1.1 eV.
“Our patented design can significantly suppress the contact recombination and associated reverse saturation current to increase the VOC,” researcher Rahul Pandey told pv magazine.
The researchers conducted a numerical simulation to predict the device’s performance and behavior, using SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium.
They designed the bottom cell as having an indium zinc oxide (IZO) transparent conductive oxide film, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, a perovskite layer, and a layer of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz) as the hole-transport layer. For the top cell, they proposed to utilize indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a cadmium sulfide (Cds) layer, and a CIGS absorber.
“In the top cell, the perovskite layer acts as an absorber to absorb the high-energy photons. Similarly, the bottom cell uses the CIGS layer to absorb the low-energy photons,” the scientists said, noting that both cells are connected through an intermediate layer of ITO to provide the current matching for the tandem configuration.
They tested different CIGS absorber layer thicknesses from 0.5 micrometers (μm) to 5 μm and found that there was an increase in current density due to higher photon absorption, up to a 2.3 μm thick absorber layer. They also determined that there is a saturation of current density for the thickness beyond 2.3 μm.
With an optimized absorber thickness of 2.3 μm, the bottom cell showed in the simulation it may reach a power conversion efficiency of 16.26%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.64 V, a short-circuit current of 35.98 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 70.51%.
“The voltage drop across the tandem solar cell is the sum of the voltage drop across both subcells individually, the scientists said, adding that the top cell delivers less current than the bottom cell in the standalone configuration and acts as a current-limiting cell.
The tandem device top/ bottom cell thickness of 347 nm/2.0 μm showed an efficiency of 29.72%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.92 V, a short-circuit current of 20.04 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 77%.
The scientists introduced the cell technology in “Perovskite-CIGS Monolithic Tandem Solar Cells with 29.7% Efficiency: A Numerical Study,” which was recently published in Energy Fuels.
“The main limitation of the adopted filtered spectrum approach is that it ignores the interfacial reflection losses and interference effects,” they concluded. “The transfer matrix method (TMM) can be used in the future to calculate a more accurate filtered spectrum.”
