The document claims up to 28% of the electricity required by Indian Railways trains could come from the state-owned entity’s own solar panels, rather than from the grid, provided the entire rail network is electrified.
With Indian Railways planning to install 20 GW of solar generation capacity to help it to net-zero-operations this decade, the authors of the study suggested around 5,272 MW of that project capacity could directly power the company’s trains – ensuring at least one in four trains would be powered directly from company-owned PV and eliminating 6.8 million tons of carbon emissions annually.
The direct supply of solar electricity to the network’s overhead lines would be more cost-effective for Indian Railways as it would reduce energy transmission and distribution losses, the authors of the study pointed out. The deployment of energy storage trackside would enable even more of Indian Railways’ self-generated solar power to feed its trains.
“Right now, India is leading the world on two vital climate frontiers – rail electrification and solar power deployment,” wrote report author and Riding Sunbeams founder Leo Murray. “Our analysis shows that connecting these two keystone low-carbon technologies together in Indian Railways, can drive both India’s economic recovery from the Covid pandemic and its efforts to transition off fossil fuels to tackle the climate crisis.”
Climate Trends director and study co-author Aarti Khosla said: “Indian Railways plays an important role in the lives of every Indian. Not only is it the most practical mode of transportation, it is also the most famous, and the largest employer in the country. The government pumps large sums of money [in] to modernize the railways which, in turn, will play a large role in a net-zero vision of the nation. There has been analysis that converting all diesel locomotives to electric will, indeed, increase … emissions in the short term. However, this report shows the tremendous opportunity of doing it right the first time, by creating a direct connection of the locomotive system to solar PV installations, meeting more than a quarter of the total demand.”
India’s coal-dependent power system would also likely entail a rise in emissions as Indian Railways aims to electrify all routes by 2023, the researchers warned.
The report’s authors based their calculation of the amount of solar electricity which could directly power trains on the energy demand of the 16 of Indian Railways’ 18 zones for which annual consumption data were available – with the Metro zone centered on Kolkata and the new Visakhapatnam-based South Coast Railway the exceptions.
For each zone, train power requirements were matched with regional solar resource potential.
The report’s authors found the best five zones for photovoltaic-to-rail potential were the South Central Railway, which featured 394 MW of train electricity demand and the potential to host 625 MW of solar generation capacity; Central Railway (299-475 MW); Northern Railway (290-459 MW); Western Railway (280-443 MW); and West Central Railway (278-440 MW).
The North Eastern Railway had the smallest train power demand and, therefore, would only host 117 MW of solar capacity, according to the study.

In 2019, the top five solar parks had a combined capacity of 6.6 GWAC. Fast forward to 2021, and today’s top five total over 12.5 GWAC.The intervening Covid-19 pandemic has clearly done little to slow the explosive global growth of utility-scale solar.
In three blogs in the coming weeks, the top solar power plants, solar parks, and solar clusters will be identified. First, however, here’s a reminder of where the records stood in 2019; and how solar parks, individual plants, and regional clusters are distinguished.

In most cases, solar power plants are designed and built singly, with the project developer choosing a site with a suitable connection to the electricity grid. Project size may be dictated by the site area available, connection capacity, or financial restrictions. Where those factors do not impose limits, developers aim for economies of scale often by maximizing plant size.
In 2008, the largest PV project – at about 50 MWAC – was near Olmedilla de Alarcón in Spain. By 2012, the Agua Caliente solar farm in Arizona had taken the record to over 250 MWAC. When the previous list of top plants was published two years ago, the Sweihan project was about to be commissioned in Abu Dhabi with a capacity of 938 MWAC (or 1,177 MWP).
Not all solar projects are developed individually, however. There can be benefits in grouping plants together to take advantage of prime locations and strong grid connections.
By the second decade of the millennium, several national and state-level energy agencies had realized that solar power could be produced even more economically if multiple projects were co-located in one area, where they could share grid connection and other site related costs.
Probably the most notable early example is the Charanka Solar Park in the Patan district of India. When this was first opened in 2012 by Gujarat’s then chief minister, Narendra Modi, it had a combined capacity of 224 MW from 19 individual solar power plants, of which the largest were 25 MW each. It has since been expanded to over 600 MW of overall capacity. Agencies of the state of Gujarat arranged the grid connection and leased land to the project developers.
A similar approach was adopted in China most notably in the Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces. This approach lends itself particularly to centralized economies where state agencies can arrange grid connections, land allocation, and other shared services. This model is also now being adopted in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, with a few instances in Europe and America.
The Golmud Solar Park in China’s Qinghai province was the largest at 1,800 MWAC, when the previous list was published. Many of these solar parks have been progressively expanded over the years, with several now achieving combined capacities running into the multi-gigawatt range.
The co-located solar park model has not been widely adopted in Europe and America where energy markets are more deregulated. However, less formal co-location of multiple projects can sometimes be found in areas where suitable land and grid connection capacity is plentiful and solar radiation is good.
The Antelope Valley in Los Angeles County hosted the largest cluster in 2019, with a total of about 3,000 MWAC.
Press reports of the largest solar power station may refer to any of the above mentioned arrangements and may therefore ‘compare apples with pears’. Subsequent blogs in this short series will identify the world’s largest solar power stations, distinguishing between individual plants and groups of multiple co-located projects.
For consistency, the terminology solar plant will be used for an individual project that has been developed by a single developer or consortium, even if it is spread over several geographical plots or built in various phases. Where multiple plants are co-located in a discreet area under the coordination of an identified agency, this will be called a solar park. A cluster denotes several solar farms are co-located in an area without formal coordination.
Single plants are often colloquially known as solar farms. Readers should note that this terminology is not universally adopted, and that some developers and owners choose to call individual plants a ‘solar park’.
Also for consistency, all capacities are quoted in MWAC to allow direct comparison between PV and CSP plants (and other forms of generation). Readers will be aware that the DC peak capacity of PV plants is typically ~25% higher than the rated AC capacity, quoted here.
The next blog will identify the largest individual solar plants in the world, to be followed subsequently by solar parks and then clusters.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/01/cheapest-long-duration-storage-for-systems-with-high-renewables/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2021",Cheapest long-duration storage for systems with high renewables,"From pv magazine International
Researchers at the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have assessed the cost and performance of most long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies. They have also looked at flexible power plants to help electricity systems to deal with extremely high levels of renewable energy penetration and have found that, given current and future capital cost scenarios, that geologic hydrogen storage and natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) plants with carbon capture storage (CCS) technologies offer the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for 120-hour discharge applications and that pumped hydro, compressed air, and batteries are the cheapest solutions for 12-hour discharge.
“Since energy storage technologies will compete with low-carbon power generation technologies such as NG-CC with CCS to provide the grid with electricity during times when wind and solar are not producing electricity, we compare them all together within this paper,” researcher Chad Hunter told pv magazine. “This allows for a quick comparison of technologies that have not all been looked at in the same analysis before our paper.”
The techno-economic analysis considered the LDES and flexible power generation technologies in the US Western Interconnection, which is a wide-area synchronous grid stretching from Western Canada to Baja California in Mexico, with an 85% share of renewable energy in the area’s electricity mix.
“LDES requires large energy capacities so that a typical rate of charging or discharging can be sustained for days, weeks, or even longer,” the scientists explained. “In this study, flexible power plants and LDES system power generation equipment are sized at 100 MW, in the range of peaking and load-following plant sizes today.”
LDES systems are sized to supply rated power for durations from 12 hours to seven days and the LCOE is calculated for both current and future capital costs.
Through their analysis, the academics found that, for the maximum duration of seven days, NG-CC plants with CCS are the cheapest solution. For the minimum 12-hour threshold, the options with the lowest costs are compressed air storage (CAES), lithium-ion batteries, vanadium redox flow batteries, pumped hydropower storage (PHS), and pumped thermal energy storage (P-TES), which they said is mainly due to their moderate power-related capital costs and high round-trip efficiency.
“Batteries will likely play a large role in grid energy storage moving forward, especially if battery prices continue their strong decline as we have seen over the past decade,” Hunter explained. “Shorter-duration battery storage will be complemented by low-cost, longer-duration storage technologies, such as geologic hydrogen storage.”
For more than four days of storage, the least-cost solutions are diabatic compressed air energy storage (D-CAES), NG-CC, NG-CC with CCS, natural gas combustion turbine (NG-CT), and hydrogen storage in salt caverns with re-electrification in heavy-duty vehicle proton exchange membrane (HDV-PEM) fuel cells. They also determined that pumped hydro storage and the HDV-PEM fuel cells with salt cavern storage offer the lowest LCOE for the 12-hour and 120-hour durations, respectively.
“Although hydrogen systems with geologic storage and natural gas with CCS are the least-cost technology options to support high variable renewable energy (VRE) grids at durations beyond 36 h, several challenges are associated with them,” the NREL research team said. “First, neither technology offers the lowest cost for short-duration storage (12 hours), which will likely dominate the storage market until high VRE penetrations are reached; thus, market adoption and learning must be driven by other sectors or use cases, such as using HDV-PEM fuel cells in heavy-duty trucking or deploying CCS for industrial applications.”
The NREL group said that minimizing storage capital is economically convenient at durations longer than approximately 48 hours and that the LCOE is more sensitive to storage energy capacity costs than storage power capacity costs. The team presented its findings in “Techno-economic analysis of long-duration energy storage and flexible power generation technologies to support high-variable renewable energy grids,” which was recently published in Joule.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/01/winners-of-1-5-gw-solar-park-auction-to-get-letter-of-award-today/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MADHYA PRADESH",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2021",Winners of 1.5 GW solar park auction to get ‘letter of award’ today,"Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will today hand over the ‘Letter of Award’ to the developers selected for the 1.5 GW solar park capacity in the State. The plants shall come up in three districts, Agar (550 MW), Neemuch (500 MW), and Shajapur (450 MW). 
Winning developers include Avaada Power, Beampow Energy (an arm of O2 Power), Talettutayi Solar Project (an arm of Solar Arise India Projects), TP Saurya (Tata Power venture), NTPC Renewable Energy, and Saudi Arabia’s Al Jomaih Energy & Water Company. As many as 15 companies of national and international level took part in the reverse bidding.
The 1.5GW Agar-Shajapur-Neemuch Solar Park auction yielded record-low solar tariffs in the country at a time when the ALMM listing requirement for module manufacturers is in place and the basic customs duty on cell and module imports is set from April next year. 
The establishment of these projects by Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Limited (RUMSL) will draw private investment of about INR 5,250 crore in Madhya Pradesh. Not only this, the State Discom company will save about Rs 7,600 crore in 25 years. The state government has allotted the land for the projects, and the projects are scheduled to start electricity production by March 2023.
The 500 MW Neemuch auction by RUMSL landed a pathbreaking low tariff of INR 2.14/kWh. TP-Saurya won 170 MW and 160 MW capacities at INR 2.14 and INR 2.149, respectively. Aljomaih Energy & Water Company won 170 MW at INR 2.15.
Before this, the 450 MW Shajapur Solar Park auction saw NTPC Renewable Energy Limited offering the least tariff of INR 2.35 for 105 MW capacity and INR 2.33 for another 220 MW. Talettutayi Solar Projects won 125 MW at INR 2.339.
The 550 MW Agar Solar Park auction resulted in a similar remarkable success, with Avaada Energy offering the lowest tariff of INR 2.459 for 200 MW. Beempow Energy secured 350 MW at INR 2.444.
