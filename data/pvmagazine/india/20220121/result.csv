Currently, farmers in the nation irrigate their fields through over 30 million agro pump-sets. Out of these, 22 million pump-sets are connected to the grid, around 10 million pumps are diesel pumps, while 3,50,000 pumps are solar pumps, mostly deployed in the last five years. 
Grid-powered pump-sets consume over 18% of the total annual electricity consumption of India and diesel pump sets consume over 5.5% of the overall diesel import bill. In 2017-18, the annual electricity subsidy for agriculture alone amounted to over INR 1.1 trillion and the annual diesel import bill towards agro-pump sets was estimated at around INR 0.4 trillion. 
As a country, India is one of the biggest agriculture-driven economies, making our farmers front-runners in the race. The agriculture sector alone accounts for nearly 18.33% of India’s electricity consumption. The deployment of solar-powered pumps helps in reducing electricity consumption and shifting that load to green energy.  
With more than 75% of the population directly engaged with agriculture, it is safe to say that India is primarily an agrarian society. The government is taking all possible steps to support Anna Daata (farmers) of our country. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) unveiled the PM-KUSUM (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthan Mahaabhiyan) Scheme, which aimed to add solar and other renewable capacities of 25,750 MW with the total central financial support of INR 34,422 crore.  
In most cases, the grid electricity supply is erratic during nighttime. Battery-coupled solar-powered water pumps running on a renewable source of energy ensure water supply anytime water is required. Further, farmers need not visit the farm at midnight to switch on diesel power to the pump in case of a grid outage. Additionally, solar power creates employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas, and improves the standard of living of the farmers. 
At COP26, India raised the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of non-fossil energy to 500 GW by 2030 from the earlier 450 GW, which includes 300 GW of solar. It is estimated India can meet a substantial amount of its renewable target by converting agro pump-sets to solar. In line with this, the PM-KUSUM scheme aims at replacing all diesel pumps with standalone off-grid pumps and solarizing all grid-connected pump sets. 
Under the PM KUSUM scheme, the farmer benefits from the latest technology pumps powered by solar energy. Solar pump installation is aided by attractive subsidies from the Government and is a win-win solution for all stakeholders.
MNRE has envisioned the success of this program on India-made components including solar cells and modules, solar pumps and inverters, etc. The scheme design allows farmers and beneficiaries to choose among the empaneled service providers. In addition, the participation of solar module and pump system manufacturers in the PM –KUSUM program highlights the reliance on contribution from domestic manufacturers. 
With solar water pumps, farmers have access to high-quality power available for irrigation. These systems are portable and can be assembled at any preferred location. With the growing utilization of these systems, the costs have decreased substantially, making them an efficient, convenient, and cost-effective solution for grid-isolated rural areas. 
Solar water pumps are a low-cost solution that enables farmers to spend more time increasing their income by growing crops, instead of ferrying water from miles away. Adhering to Government’s vision, businesses are focused on building solar water pump solutions. Solar-powered water pump solutions help transform farmers’ lives by providing sustainable power and timely water availability, thereby increasing their yield and income. The system boosts the income of the farmers, reduces the reliance on erratic power, and increases water supply without incurring any fuel cost.
 
Tata Power Solar, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power, has a portfolio of more than 7 GW of ground-mount utility-scale, over 750MW of rooftop and distributed generation projects across the country and installed over 55,000 solar water pumps in India till date.

The plant is being developed by CSE Deccan Solar, a subsidiary of Cleantech Solar.
Apollo Tyres invested INR 93 million, for a 27.2% equity stake, to get a guaranteed supply of 40 million units of electricity per annum from the captive power plant for its Chennai facility. This will increase the share of renewable energy to more than 30% of the total for this manufacturing facility.
Sunam Sarkar, president and chief business officer, Apollo Tyres Ltd, said “This investment to secure solar power for our Chennai facility, is one of the several initiatives that we are undertaking towards a sustainable future. The solar power that we are securing with this investment, will help us become self-sufficient for our power requirements for critical equipment, and strengthen our commitment towards reduction of carbon emissions.”
The supply of solar power to Apollo Tyres’ Chennai facility is likely to begin in July this year.
Apollo Tyres has an installed capacity to produce around 900 metric tonnes of tyres per day in Chennai, which includes the passenger vehicle tyres and light, medium and heavy commercial vehicle tyres.

U.S.-owned Indian ratings agency Crisil has predicted 30-35GW of newly-commissioned module production capacity will be in place by the end of fiscal year 2024-25, helped by strong demand, favorable policy, solar panel conversion efficiency improvements, and cost-competitiveness.
The analysts’ estimate is based on capital expenditure (capex) plans announced by the top 11 Indian module manufacturers – which account for around 80% of India’s current panel production capacity – plus some new entrants to the market.
Crisil director Ankit Hakhu said: “With the government supporting domestic manufacturers, through policy measures, their competitiveness relative to the Chinese is expected to improve. The imposition of 40% customs duty on imported modules and the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme benefits will not only eliminate the existing price gap but may even make domestic modules competitive by [$] 2-3 cents per watt, at current prices.” 
Those supply-side interventions will be complemented by growing solar demand, due to a continuing government focus on renewables as well as the private sector’s focus on environmental, social and governance standards, added the ratings agency. 
Crisil expects India to add 14GW of solar generation capacity per year in the current fiscal years, and for the next two, driving demand for cells and modules.
The analyst said Indian-made products could prove more attractive than imports due to having more predictable supply chains and being unfettered by surging shipping costs, as well as being, potentially, more competitively priced.
Aditya Jhaver, also a Crisil director, said: “We estimate INR50,000 crore ($6.71 billion) of investments across the value chain for capacity building in India through fiscal [2024-]2025. Module and cell manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase by 30-35GW each while, under the government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, we may also see backward integration into polysilicon and wafer capacities.
“A portion of the capex is also moving towards newer technologies such as mono PERC [and] bifacial modules, where [conversion] efficiencies are higher, and comparable with imports. That, along with healthy demand – which is supporting order books – and favorable government policies, is expected to drive operating margins for integrated solar module manufacturers (manufacturing both cells and modules) to 12-13%. It will also result in a payback period of 4.5-5 years, assuming 50% utilization levels.”
The solar module manufacturing value chain starts with polysilicon and/or silicon ingots, which are converted into wafers. The wafers are used to produce solar cells which are then assembled into solar modules.
As of March 31, India had 3GW of solar cell capacity, mostly used for the in-house production of modules, and 8GW of effective solar panel production capacity. The nation has no polysilicon or wafer manufacturing capacity yet, according to Crisil, and the absence of the “backward integration” of those steps of the solar value chain renders Indian-made modules uncompetitive with cheaper imports.
According to Crisil, India’s 8GW of module capacity remains under-utilized, with just 20% in operation as panel imports from China retail 15-25% cheaper – or $0.04-0.06/watt – because of state subsidies and economies of scale. As a result, nearly 80% of India’s solar module demand is met by Chinese products. 
That low level of demand for Indian modules has disincentivized major investment in more advanced products and into the backward integration of polysilicon and wafer manufacturing.

Researchers from the Universiti Putra Malaysia have defined a series of fire safety practices that solar installers should follow in the deployment of residential rooftop PV systems.
“Improper installation practices have been identified as a common factor contributing to PV fire hazards,” the research’s corresponding author, Mohd Zahirasri Mohd Tohir, told pv magazine. “This human error may be due to an unintentional action or indeed a deliberate violation of procedure. The first, mainly due to inexperienced installers or simply slippery actions by experienced workers. While the latter, due to time pressure and their ignorance of the consequences of fire safety. Regardless of the reason, both can be attributed to a lack of fire safety knowledge.”
According to Tohir, the annual fire incident frequency for PV installations is 0.029 fires per MW. “While the figure does not seem alarming, however, with the surge in global demand of PV systems as a green technology, if the issue is neglected and not curbed, the failure rate is expected to increase significantly in the coming years,” he said. “That is why our work is seen as important in developing safe practices and knowledge sharing on fire safety management during PV system installation as a lack of understanding of the associated PV fire risks can lead to severe long-term consequences.”
The academics systematically reviewed the fire safety practices described in 40 PV installation guidelines that are publicly accessible. These include publications from PV manufacturers together and installation guidelines, as well as best practices handbooks. “It is worth mentioning that more than half of the selected installation guidelines reviewed are from the national agencies, regulatory bodies, and national associations and mostly are from the United States,” said the research team.
The proposed fire safety practices were categorized into 10 groups considering different factors: general practices to ensure the PV system is designed by qualified contractors only; site survey including size, shade management, accessway, tilt, orientation and location; roof structure and material; marking systems for all PV equipment including PV input and output, conduit, cabling, inverter, enclosures, combiner, box, and isolator switches; roof waterproofing and flashing; electrical cabling and grounding system; array mounting, ventilation and PV panels; combiner box and connectors; DC/AC inverter; and DC isolator and other protection devices.
“Prior to PV system installation, it is important to conduct a site evaluation to avoid the shading effect and determine the best orientation for maximum PV system output,” the scientists said. “Besides, good ventilation and airflow around the PV modules may prevent the phenomenon of a hot spot.” According to them, many fire accidents originated from DC isolators due to the water penetration into the enclosure caused by ignorant practices during installation. “However, the number of publications highlighting the installation of DC isolators, such as the dos and don’ts, is relatively small,” they also highlighted.
The best practices were presented in the paper Development of fire safety best practices for rooftops grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems installation using systematic review methodology, published in Sustainable Cities and Society.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/21/topcon-vs-perc/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 21, 2022",TOPCon vs PERC,"From pv magazine International
Researchers from Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have outlined a series of cost-driven strategies to accelerate the industrial upscale of tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar products.
“Maintaining a high conversion efficiency in mass production is a key aspect to compete with the state-of-the-art PERC cell in terms of system cost and levelized cost of electricity,” the research’s corresponding author, Bishal Kafle, told pv magazine. “Recent developments in device research have led to an increasing gap between the conversion efficiencies of TOPCon and PERC cells. Nevertheless, a standard process flow for industrial TOPCon cells is not yet established.”
According to him, although a reduction in production costs is important, the economic viability of TOPCon requires a stable 24/7 production with equivalent uptime and utilization rates to current passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cell manufacturing facilities. “Additionally, a TOPCon cells on an n-type substrate requires silver (Ag) contacts on both sides, reduction of Ag usage remains an important aspect as well for this concept, at least in the middle and long term,” he further explained.
In the paper, TOPCon – Technology options for cost efficient industrial manufacturing, published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the German research team explained that the processes and existing equipment that are commonly used in the manufacturing of PERC cells may be easily adapted to TOPCon cell production by adding two process steps: the formation of tunnel oxide and the deposition of intrinsic/doped polysilicon.
“The properties of these layers are vital towards designing the subsequent cell processing steps, aiming to achieve high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and a low series resistance promised by the TOPCon-concept,” explained the researchers, noting that n-type substrates are more expensive to integrate than their p-type counterparts, due to the higher costs of the boron emitter diffusion process compared the phosphorous diffusion process typically used in PERC cell manufacturing.
The study provides a technical route to improve the low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) process, which is currently the standard in the industry for TOPCon products, and evaluates possible alternatives to this technique, based on industrial tool availability, process compatibility, availability of all process parameters required for a cost of ownership (COO) modeling, lean process flow, and successful demonstration of the process functionality.
The LPCVD technique is still considered a valid approach by the research team as it ensures good thickness distribution along the wafer, pin-hole free layers with good step coverage, the use of relatively low deposition temperatures close to 600 degrees Celsius, a large number of wafers per batch, and the option of in-situ doping with constant doping profile. However, the LPCVD tool also has a reduced throughput due to a significantly longer process duration compared to that used in PERC cell manufacturing, which inevitably leads to higher production costs.
“Nevertheless, for the process route featuring in-situ deposited LPCVD a-Si/poly-Si layers, we identify a possibility of combining the high temperature annealing and oxidation of boron emitter in a single step, which makes this approach economically competitive in comparison to the process route featuring ex-situ LPCVD a-Si/poly-Si layers,” they continued.
Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) were considered as alternatives to LPCVD and the analysis showed that no clear winner can be identified between the three technologies. “It is observed that COO of a-Si deposition step scales down significantly with the thickness of the a-Si layer, although interestingly the cost reduction is largely dependent upon the used deposition technology,” the Fraunhofer ISE researchers said. “A much stronger reduction in COO for thinner layers is observed for PECVD and APCVD-deposition technologies, which is mainly related to their significantly higher a-Si deposition rates in comparison to LPCVD.”
The scientists also compared the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for 5MW ground-mounted PV plants relying on bifacial PERC technology and TOPCon products featuring LPCVD, PECVD and APCVD. Their analysis showed that the TOPCon techs have 13.5–18.6% higher All-in Cell costs and 3.6–5.5% higher All-in Module costs in comparison to PERC benchmark.
“The additional cost for TOPCon module is mainly related to a higher CAPEX and facility-related costs for the cell production facility, a significantly higher process consumable costs in the cell processing due to the additional process steps required compared to a PERC cell, and the higher price of n-type as to the PERC p-type wafer substrate,” they emphasized. “At LCOE level, all the evaluated TOPCon concepts under monofacial illumination show slightly lower LCOE values to the bifacial p-PERC technology, assuming a TOPCon cell efficiency advantage of 0.5% over PERC at 23.5% and 23.0% respectively.”
According to them, in order to outperform PERC in economical terms, the most conservative TOPCon concept should achieve a minimum efficiency gain of 0.55%. “For the best-case TOPCon concept, a cell efficiency gain >0.40% to bifacial p-PERC already allows cost-effective high-volume manufacturing of TOPCon solar cells,” they concluded.
