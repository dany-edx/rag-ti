The roofs of two adjacent office buildings in Sydney’s Barangaroo precinct have provided researchers a rare glimpse at the real-world effects of green roofs on solar arrays. The findings are substantial – in comparison to the conventional roof, the solar array fitted above beds of plants had an average daily power output 39 kW, or 13.1%, greater.
The study was led by Peter Irga from the University of Technology Sydney and funded by the City of Sydney Council, with research carried out on International House’s conventional array and Daramu House’s green roof array, known as a bisolar roof.
Both roofs generated substantial quantities of solar energy over the eight months they were studied, with the conventional roof yielding 59.5 MWh, while the green roof produced 69 MWh.
“Despite the similarities in build and location, the effect of urban geometry on solar irradiance on each rooftop is made evident outside of the hours during which the sun is near/at its solar peak… During these hours, the green roof produced an average energy output that was greater than the conventional roof by ~ 6 %. Prior to, and after these hours, the influence of urban geometry confounds the reportable efficiencies (-3.6 to 16 %)” the study read.
After correcting for these differences, the panels on the green roof were found to be, on average, 3.63% more efficient on any given day. Following on from that, over the eight-month study period the green roof produced an additional 9.5 MWh of green electricity, corresponding to a retail market value of $2,595.
This efficiency boost is thought to stem from the fact the green roof remained far cooler than the traditional concrete one during the day, meaning the panels did not overheat and therefore underperform. In some instances, the green roof was as much as 20°C cooler, with its temperatures also fluctuating far less in the evening.
While increasingly popular, there is currently a lack of research confirming the benefits of green roofs. Furthermore, “there is very little research that compares similar buildings which are exposed to similar environmental conditions by virtue of close proximity,” the study noted.
In addition, the significant increases in its solar array’s output, the green roof was also found to have a nine-fold increase in insect species diversity, as well as a four-fold increase in avian species diversity. It also saw reductions in some air pollutants, improved stormwater management, improved building insulation.
“For the size of the positive impacts generated relative to the costs, green infrastructure is perhaps the easiest and most efficient initiative we can make to help make our cities sustainable,” the study read.
The study’s authors described their findings as “substantial,” though they noted just two roofs were monitored.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/26/american-firm-launches-2-gw-electrolyzer-fab-in-india/,"ELECTROLYZER,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,KARNATAKA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 26, 2021",American firm launches 2 GW electrolyzer fab in India,"USA-headquartered Ohmium International has announced the launch of a electrolyzer gigafactory in India through its Bengaluru-based arm enArka India.
The gigafab, located in Bengaluru, will manufacture Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology-based electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen. Initially, it will have a capacity of about 500 MW of electrolysis equipment per annum, which is eventually planned for scaling up to 2 GW per annum.
According to a report by TERI, India would require significant investment in electrolyzers if the nation is to deploy green hydrogen as a clean energy solution for key sectors, including transport, industry, and power, by 2050.
Most hydrogen in India is produced using natural gas through steam methane (CH4) reforming and used in the refinery and fertilizer industries. The hydrogen so produced is termed ‘grey’ as the carbon byproduct leads to CO2 generation.
Green hydrogen is zero-carbon hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water (splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen) using renewable electricity.
There is significant research on the electrolysis method of producing hydrogen in India, but this low-carbon technology is yet to be deployed at scale.
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) is a much more recent electrolysis method than alkaline electrolysis. It reverses the fuel cell principle and requires no liquid electrolyte. Water is pressed through a stack of two electrodes and a polymer membrane. It only allows positively charged hydrogen protons to pass through. Platinum is usually used as a catalyst in the cell. The thin cells consisting of a membrane and a pair of electrodes can be arranged in stacks to achieve better performance.
Compared to alkaline electrolysis, PEM electrolysis has the advantage of quickly reacting to the fluctuations typical of renewable power generation. This technology is often used for distributed systems because the equipment is low-maintenance and delivers high-quality gas.
Ohmium claims it technology enables the design of compact electrolyzers, with a fast heat-up and cool-down over a short response time.
“Our stack can sustain a differential pressure across the membrane without compromise. This feature supports the optimization of the compressor design with the aid of electrochemical compression as a part of the hydrogen generation. Using a solid and thin electrolyte membrane leads to a shorter path for proton transport, thus minimizing ohmic losses. This, in turn, enables our electrolyzer to run at a very high current density and enhances cost-effective operation,” reads the company website.

The announcement will likely be made by India’s prime minister Narendra Modi on September 5. 
The Modhera village in the Mehsana district will meet all its electricity requirements 24×7 through a 6 MW solar plant, coupled with 15 MWh battery storage, set up under a scheme launched by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. The plant has been allocated a 12-hectare land, 3 km away from the village.
As part of the project, rooftop solar PV systems (1kW), smart meters, and solar EV charging stations are also being installed in Modhera.
The complete project is being set up at an investment of around INR 65 crore, with up to 50% central financial assistance (max. INR 32.50 crore) from the Government of India through MNRE and the balance 50% coming from the Government of Gujarat.

Chinese inverter maker Growatt has unveiled the SPF 3000T HVM-G2 inverter for off-grid solar power systems.
The device consists of a built-in MPPT charge controller, an AC charger, and an inverter with a low-frequency transformer. “It allows for surge power at three times of the rated power to support motor-type loads or inductive loads,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “Additionally, thanks to its optimized product design and improvements in both software and hardware, the inverter has a longer design life and comes with a five-year product warranty as standard.”
The 3 kW inverter has an efficiency of 95%, a surge power of 9000 VA, and solar input voltage up to 250 V. It can be connected in series for up to six units for single-phase or three-phase systems to expand capacity to 18 kW.
The device, which also features IP20 enclosures, measures 225 x 300 x 550 mm and weighs in at 27 kg. Its operating ambient temperature ranges from -20 to 50 degrees Celsius.
Growatt stated that the inverter enables power input from multiple sources, including any power generator, a solar array, a storage system, and the power network. “The inverter can work with or without batteries, and it is compatible with mainstream lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries, including Growatt’s Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries that are well-known for [their] safety and reliability,” it further explained. “Additionally, it is designed with Low Voltage Disconnect protection function for batteries.”
