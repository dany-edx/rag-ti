https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/22/india-needs-223-billion-to-meet-2030-wind-and-solar-goals/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 22, 2022","India needs $223 billion to meet 2030 wind, solar goals","India will require $223 billion of investment over the next eight years to meet its goal of wind and solar capacity installations by 2030, according to a new report by research company BloombergNEF (BNEF). The report says this is a tripling of investment flows into new-build wind and solar from the 2014-21 period and requires a scaling up of financing from all the different sources.
India aims to have 500 GW of non-fossil fuel power generation capacity by 2030, compared to 158 GW at the end of 2021. Out of the targeted 500 GW, close to 280 GW will be solar and 140 GW from wind, according to the 2030 optimal generation capacity mix modeled by the country’s Central Electricity Authority (CEA).
The “Financing India’s 2030 Renewables Ambition” report, published in association with the Power Foundation of India, shows that corporate commitments from Indian companies align with India’s 2030 ambition. And these could help India achieve 86% of its 2030 goals of building 500 GW of cumulative non-fossil power generation capacity.
By April 2022, 165 GW of zero-carbon generation had already been installed in the country. The Central Electricity Authority forecasts the country’s reliance on coal to drop from 53% of installed capacity in 2021 to 33% in 2030, whereas solar and wind together make up 51% by then, up from 23% in 2021.
India has consistently ranked among the leading emerging markets covered by Climatescope, BNEF’s flagship report analyzing market attractiveness for energy transition investment. In 2021, the nation ranked first in the power category among 107 emerging markets.
Transparent market mechanisms, supportive policies, and ambitious government targets have attracted many domestic and international players to India’s renewables market.
“To date, the growth of renewable energy in India has been funded by a diverse set of financiers. Debt and equity structures have evolved as the market grew and new risks emerged,” said Shantanu Jaiswal, lead author of the report and the head of India research at BloombergNEF. “India’s ambitious renewable energy targets now require further scaling up of financing with new instruments and learnings from other global markets.”
Yet the scaling up of renewables in India faces regulatory, project and financing risks, with power purchase agreement renegotiation, land acquisition, and payment delays cited as key risks by industry stakeholders surveyed by BloombergNEF. In the short-term, rising interest rates, a depreciating rupee, and high inflation create challenges for renewables financing.
“Scaling up financing to meet 2030 goals requires independent power producers to tap into new or underutilized sources of capital. These could be revolving construction debt, investment infrastructure trusts and funding from retail investors, insurance companies and pension funds,” said Rohit Gadre, analyst on BNEF’s India research team. “Higher funding requirements also need measures that can increase the availability of financing, such as de-risking renewable projects to offering contractual terms that provide greater comfort to investors.”

The batteries use lithium ferro phosphate as the cathode material.
The manufacturer offers batteries in storage capacities ranging from 1.5 kWh to 20 kWh, but it can provide other sizes according to customer requirements. The operating voltage can be 12 V, 24 V, or 48 V, meeting the needs for low-scale applications. It can go up further in the case of bigger storage systems.
The batteries provide steady output ranging from 1 kVA to 50 kVA, which makes them ideal for use as uninterrupted power supply (UPS). They are safe to keep in any setting and can last up to 10 times longer than their lead-acid counterparts.
Natural Battery Technologies also provides integrated battery systems for both residential and commercial usage. The batteries are housed in separate cabinets – the kind typically used in larger energy storage applications. The company offers smaller 1 kVA to 10 kVA grid inverters in combination with solar energy storage systems. The maximum inverter output is around 240 V AC.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/22/solar-auctions-in-india-to-attract-large-developers/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 22, 2022",Solar auctions in India to attract large developers,"Large developers in the renewable energy sector have enough options to boost returns and will compete in auctions scheduled for this year, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
The renewable energy capacity in India has jumped almost tenfold over the last decade, from 12 GW in 2010 to around 110 GW in March 2022. But the question is whether India will be able to continue its renewables growth trajectory as witnessed in the past, given fresh challenges in the sector.
The IEEFA report states the turmoil in global supply chains caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have pushed up components costs. Renewable energy developers also face higher financing costs as surging inflation has forced central banks to tighten monetary policy, pushing up interest rates.
Hiowever, these challenges will probably not have a lasting impact on India’s renewable energy story.
“We believe India will be able to continue its renewable energy capacity addition trajectory because current supply chain challenges will ease in the short-to-medium term, and the industry has enough cushion to absorb these downside risks,” said IEEFA Energy Finance Analyst Shantanu Srivastava.
The report states the rise in solar module prices is an aberration. IEEFA expects long-term average prices to revert to sub-$0.20 (before duties and taxes) levels from the current level of $0.28.
“Central and state nodal agencies should proceed with their pipeline of renewable energy auctions, given that interest from the large companies in the sector should continue, even in these unprecedented times,” said Ankur Saboo, an infrastructure finance specialist.
Equity returns
The report highlights various options before large renewable energy companies to enhance their return on equity and cushion against downward risks. According to Srivastava and Saboo, large renewable energy developers can lean on bond markets to refinance project debt at lower rates and take advantage of a non-amortization period on debt repayments.
Margins on in-house engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) also increase returns. Selling stakes in operational projects to strategic investors such as global oil and gas majors and financial investors like infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) is another avenue for developers to increase returns. Finally, selling carbon credits to developed economies is increasingly considered a viable source of additional income for developers, further enhancing their returns.
The report shows how these measures can help a solar power project and a hybrid wind-solar power project to enhance their equity returns. It finds that refinancing at a 100 basis point lower rate of interest can help add 2% to a hybrid wind-solar power project’s equity internal rate of return (IRR).
In addition, bond market refinancing can help add another 2% to the equity IRR, in-house EPC can add up to 6%, and selling operational assets can add 4%. Revenues from carbon credit trading can add 3% to equity IRR, taking the total upside potential to 17%, over and above the baseline returns.
According to Srivastava, as attractive as the equity IRRs look, it is essential to note that sensitivity towards interest rates and raw material prices is extremely high and the margins of error minuscule. In worst-case scenarios, developers with a tight grip on capital and financing costs will be better prepared to weather any storm, he added.

The China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA), reported this week that the world’s total solar cell capacity reached 423.5 GW at the end of 2021, which is 70% more than that the country had at the end of the previous year when total capacity reached 223.9 GW. China’s total cell capacity reached 361 GW at the end of last year, according to the association, and total cell production output for 2021 was 197.9 GW. Chinese manufacturers Tongwei, Longi, JA Solar, Aiko Solar, Trina Solar, Jinko, Runergy, and CSI occupy the first eight positions of the global ranking for solar cell producers, followed by the only non-Chinese company – Hanwha Q Cells – in 9th position and Chinese manufacturer UniePV, which was able to reach 10th position.
Solar cell and polysilicon maker Tongwei announced it will provide wafer manufacturer Gokin Solar with 216,100 MTs of polysilicon. The raw material will be supplied between July 2022 and December 2026 at a price that will be negotiated on a monthly basis.
Shenzhen-listed manufacturer Golden Glass announced on Thursday it will invest CNY 4.2 billion (US$627 million), for a 4.8 GW heterojunction (HJT) solar cell factory in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. The company is currently developing a 1.2 GW HJT cell manufacturing facility in Suzhou.
China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) said on Thursday that around 23.71 GW of new PV installations were installed in the country in the first five months of the year, which brought its cumulative installed PV power to 327.9 GW.
Polysilicon maker GCL Technology this week announced it will spend CNY 438 million ($65 million) more on a 100,000-ton annual capacity poly fab being constructed by China Chemical Engineering. The deadline for completion of the works has also been extended, from mid May this year until December 30. GCL said the maximum price of the contract for the granular silicon production line would rise from the previously-agreed CNY 190 million to CNY 428 million and, for the silane gas facilities, from CNY 200 million to CNY 400 million. GCL has other agreements in place in relation to the project which will earn the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor up to CNY 2.6 billion.
Developer C Smarter Energy this week announced the winding up petition lodged against it by investor Nine United has been withdrawn after a settlement was agreed. Nine United lodged the petition in December, claiming it was owed $4.52 million and HKD 5.51 million ($702,000).

Alsym Energy has emerged from stealth mode to introduce a battery storage solution that will provide the performance of lithium-ion batteries at a fraction of the cost, and without the inherent risk of fire. While we know that the cathode is primarily manganese oxide, the anode is a different metal oxide, and the electrolyte is water-based, the company has not yet disclosed the exact battery chemistry. It has indicated, however, that the battery uses no lithium, cobalt or nickel to avoid the problems associated with material supply and cost.
The company said it expects the batteries to cost less than half of current lithium-based batteries. An added benefit is that the batteries are easier to recycle because of the use of non-toxic materials.
“We’re seeing global competition to bring new batteries to market. Most companies are focused primarily on performance and put little thought into also making their batteries safer and more cost-effective – especially for the developing world where consumers are more price-sensitive,” said Nitin Nohria, PhD, chairman of Alsym Energy’s board of business advisors and former Dean of the Harvard Business School. “The team at Alsym Energy is working to ensure that their batteries not only meet performance expectations at reduced cost, but also avoid most of the supply chain challenges associated with lithium-based technologies.”
Founded in 2015, Alsym raised $32 million to date from investors including Helios Climate Ventures. The company’s team of scientists and product developers, based in Massachusetts, is currently developing a 500 kWh prototype manufacturing facility. Alsym said its batteries can be manufactured in existing lithium-ion battery factories with little to no retrofitting required and without the need for expensive dry rooms, fire locks, and solvent recovery systems.
Alsym has partnered with an automaker based in India in a joint effort to develop the batteries for EVs. The automaker is expected to contract with Alsym to supply a minimum of 3 GWh of battery systems annually, providing that key performance levels are being met. Alsym said it is in discussion with marine shipping and electric two-wheeler companies to develop similar partnerships.
