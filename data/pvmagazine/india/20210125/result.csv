GUVNL shall enter into a power purchase agreement with successful bidders for 25 years from the project’s scheduled commercial operation date.
The bidders selected by GUVNL shall set up solar power projects, including the transmission network up to the delivery point. The minimum project capacity shall be 25 MW.
Projects under construction and for which any PPA has not been signed can also be offered. 
Solar projects will also be allowed to be set up in an existing wind farm already connected to the grid, subject to the availability of spare capacity for RE integration at the corresponding GETCO/CTU substation.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/25/bangladesh-joins-hydrogen-energy-race/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 25, 2021",Bangladesh joins hydrogen energy race,"From pv magazine International
Bangladesh has joined the hydrogen energy race by setting up of a research centre and a pilot processing plant. The project is part of the government’s larger effort to diversify the country’s energy mix, which is still largely dependent on gas and coal.
Hydrogen is currently being produced at the pilot plant by using waste and biomass as feedstock. The use of water as a raw material will begin soon with the installation of another processing plant.
Following the installation of the pilot plant, the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR) has started training scientists to advance the effort towards setting up of a full-fledged Hydrogen Energy Laboratory as part of the project.
The BCSIR said it was working to start production of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in Bangladesh and taking into consideration the availability of abundant water resources in the country.
As renewable energy, hydrogen will help Bangladesh transition from costly gas and polluting coal to clean energy alongside renewables power. The expansion of the technology will accelerate the energy efficiency and the government’s target to generate 10% of the country’s electricity from renewables, the BCSIR said in a Jan. 20 press release.
The project is aimed at research, quality control related to hydrogen production, storage, supply and infrastructure development as well as at providing services in the form of a national level reference center.
“We do not have our own fuel. We are totally import dependent for fuel. The hydro energy is a blessing for us,” Abdus Salam, project director and senior principal engineer at BCSIR, told pv magazine. “We have no dearth of water,” he said, adding that even the recycled waste water and sea water could be used for producing hydro energy.
As part of the ongoing project, a hydrogen fueling station will be set up alongside the procurement of a fuel cell vehicle that also runs on electricity, Salam added.
“Hydrogen fuel will boost energy security, energy reserves and the national economy,” he stressed. “Energy from fossils and renewable sources is stored in the form of hydrogen and later it can be used by converting it into fuel and different energy if required.”
The fuel value of hydrogen (142 kJ/g) is three times greater than traditional fuel and has no harmful effects on the environment, the BCSIR added.
About 33.33 kWh energy is generated from 1 kg of hydrogen fuel, but only 12 kWh/kg and 14.7 kWh/kg from petrol and compressed natural gas (CNG), respectively. Fuel cell cars run 100 to 131 km using 1 kg of hydrogen, whereas a traditional car runs 16 km using a kg of petrol.
Salam is hopeful that hydrogen fuel can be made available for industrial and vehicular use by 2030 to 2041.

The plant is located at Dhuvaran.
The successful bidder’s work scope includes design, supply, installation, and commissioning of the module cleaning system for the entire solar plant, along with operation and maintenance for three months.  
 “The vendor shall estimate the water requirements for cleaning the photovoltaic modules. The frequency of module cleaning is a minimum of twice a month to operate the plant at its guaranteed plant performance. However, minimum consumption of three litres per solar PV module shall be considered in the estimation of the required quantity of water storage,” reads the tender document. 
To be eligible, the bidder should have completed supply, installation and testing of PV module cleaning systems or systems involving water washing or cleaning systems during the last five years. 
Or, it should have executed balance-of-system supply or operation and maintenance work for solar PV plants involving both supply and installation and commissioning.

The order value of the project is approx. ÌNR 1200 crore (US$162 million). 
The project is scheduled for commissioning in May 2022.  
With this order, Tata Power Solar has a pipeline of around 4 GWp of projects worth around INR 12,000 crore. 
Tata Power’s work scope includes the land, acquisition, engineering, procurement, installation, and commissioning of the grid-connected solar project on a turnkey basis. It shall also be responsible for three years of operations and maintenance services for the solar plant, power evacuation system and telemetry up to the interconnecting state transmission utility (STU) substation.    
Tata Power Solar has installed over 17 utility-scale solar energy projects totaling 1.5 GW across 13 states in India. Some of these projects include 150 MW at Ananthapur, Andhra Pradesh; 50 MW at Kasargod, Kerala; and 30 MWp in Lapanga, Odisha. It also has a 105MWp of floating solar under implementation at Kayamkulam, Kerala, and has won a Gujarat auction for 400 MW of projects to be built at Dholera Solar Park.
