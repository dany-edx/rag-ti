APTEL issued the order as it found curtailment instructions were issued to developers for reasons other than grid security during this period.
The TNSLDC and TANGEDCO shall pay compensation for 1,080 blocks at the rate of 75% of PPA tariff per unit within two months of the announcement of the order. The amount shall be computed separately for each developer based on the curtailment period/blocks falling in 1,080 blocks. The compensation is to be paid along with a 9% interest for the entire period.
In announcing the order, APTEL took note of an analysis done by Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) based on the grid parameters, margins available for backing down of conventional energy sources, and the status of drawal by the State from the central grid. It found the parameters were apt for deciding whether the backing down is for grid security or for commercial reasons. 
Passing the judgement, APTEL said, “It is clear that backing down was for collateral reasons and not for grid security and hence the Appellant’s members (developers) would be entitled to damages/compensation for willful losses caused by the Respondents who had acted illegally and in concert.”
POSOCO has been directed to carry out a similar analysis for the period up to 31.10.2020 and submit a report to TNERC within three months. Based on POSOCO report, TNERC shall allow compensation for the backed down energy at the rate of 75% of the PPA tariff per unit.
APTEL also ruled that replacing solar power with purchases of cheaper power from short-term power markets shall be treated as unauthorized activity. As a deterrent, the curtailment of renewable energy for reasons other than grid security shall be compensated at PPA tariff in the future, it said. 
APTEL issued these directions to all the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, DISCOMs and State Load Despatch Centres and directed the registrar to circulate a copy of this order to Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Ministry of Power as well.
Solar developers in Tamil Nadu, represented by the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI), had approached APTEL challenging Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission’s order dated 25.03.2019. In this order, TNERC had quashed developers’ request for payment of deemed generation charges for the loss of power generation units due to backing down instructions, citing the agreement signed with the Utility didn’t have any provision for payment of deemed generation charges.
During the stated period, TANGEDCO issued orders asking the solar plants to cease generation for as much as 7 to 10 hours in a day comprising the peak generation period out of 12 hours of generation in a day. However, the data available for frequency demonstrated that there was no violation of the optimum range of frequency. 
In their appeal to APTEL, the developers held that TANGEDCO and TNSLDC were acting hand in hand in the scheduling of cheaper power than the expensive solar power. They referenced the POSOCO report that indicated solar generators with a per-kWh cost of INR 7.01 were curtailed more in terms of instances of curtailment and percentage generation compared to other solar generators.
“The investments made in establishing solar projects, and the solar tariffs so determined, was premised on Must Run status as contemplated under the Act and the provisions in the energy purchase agreement. If must-run status is not adhered to by TANGEDCO and SLDC, the members of the Appellant association would be deprived of recovery of legitimate tariff. As solar power tariff is a single part and it is predominantly fixed cost in nature, unauthorized curtailment will ultimately result in solar generators failing to repay their loans,” said the developers.

A group of scientists from the University of Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, and the University of Melbourne, in Australia, has investigated, in an extensive research, the potential of liquid air energy storage (LAES), which has so far seen development for large scale energy storage, and it has been mostly developed by U.K.-based specialist Highview Power.
The company is currently preparing to deploy LAES technology in a range of locations including a 400 MWh system in the United States, a 250 MWh project in the United Kingdom, and a 300 MWh facility in Spain. “LAES has, currently, a technology readiness level (TRL) of 8,” research co-author Adriano Sciacovelli told pv magazine. The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature technologies for full commercial application.
The technology is described by the research group as a concept where electricity is stored in the form of liquid air or nitrogen at cryogenic temperatures – below -150 degrees Celsius. It charges by using excess electricity to power compression and liquefaction of the air which is then stored as a liquid at temperatures approaching -196 degrees Celsius. To discharge, the liquid air warms and becomes a pressurized gas that operates a turbine to generate electricity.
It was conceived for utility scale applications and an output ranging from 5 MW to 100 MW. “Compared to pumped-hydro storage, which is based on the same basic concept, cryogenic energy storage has the advantage that it is a technology that can be produced through an established industry and without any expensive or rare material,” emphasized Sciacovelli. “Furthermore, there are no degradation issues and no need for specific locations or the orographic conditions that are needed for pumped-hydro, or of an underground cavity, as for compressed air storage.” Compared to these storage technologies, however, LAES has the drawback of a lower cycle efficiency, for both charging and discharging, which is close to 60%. Nonetheless, cycle efficiency can be increased through integration and co-location of LAES with nearby processes, for example liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.
An LAES system produces hot and cold streams during its operation, both during air compression for charging and evaporation for discharging, and these streams can be utilized to improve the system efficiency, or in several industrial process. “Currently, all existing projects are being developed for grid support but decarbonization targets will likely push this technology closer to industrial processes that waste a lot of heat,” Sciacovelli stated.
The ideal location of cryogenic storage is at a grid node with a high share of renewables or an industrial park with large waste of heat. “Cryogenic storage is not directly competing with lithium-ion batteries as it provides storage for a longer duration, from over 10 hours,” Sciacovelli added. “By contrast, for lithium-ion storage, when it is needed for more than between four and six hours, bankability, currently, remains an issue.”
In terms of costs, the research group estimated that a LAES system can be built at between €300 and €600 per kilowatt-hour. “Investment return is estimated at approximately 20 years for a standalone system without integration with an industrial facility for use of excess heat,” research co-author Andrea Vecchi told pv magazine. “An ideal location in an industrial park, however, may significantly reduce this time frame.”
All existing projects were defined by the research team as bankable, although they stressed that these positive business cases are favored by certain conditions, including a determined price structure in the energy market and the presence of a grid unable to support high levels of renewable energy penetration. “LAES systems are, so far, conceived as strategic assets for the power network,” Vecchi further explained. “They can provide not only grid balancing but several grid services.”
Furthermore, the scientist went on to say, due to the high energy density of liquid air, cryogenic storage occupies less space than compressed air or pumped hydro. “We estimate that these systems can be smaller by at least an order of magnitude,” he stated.
More details on the research can be found in the paper Liquid air energy storage (LAES): a review on technology state-of-the-art, integration pathways and future perspectives, published in Advances in Applied Energy.
*The article was amended on August 2 to reflect that the estimated cost for a LAES system is expressed in kilowatt-hours.

A Vietnamese-Korean research group has developed a four-terminal perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell with a special bifacial configuration for albedo reflection. The cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 30.09% (taking into account the rear side performance).
The tandem device was built with a bifacial crystalline silicon perovskite-filtered heterojunction sub-cell, which the scientists described as able to absorb the solar spectrum from both the front and rear sides and achieve a significant enhancement compared with semitransparent amorphous silicon sub-cells, as it absorbs all solar spectra in the short-wavelength range.
The perovskite used in the sub-cell is methylammonium-lead (ΙΙ) iodide (CH3NH3PbI3). The hole and electron transport layers were developed with nickel(II) oxide (NiO) and PCBM, which is a solubilized version of the buckminsterfullerene C60, respectively.  The NiO was deposited through an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, while spin coating was used to coat the PCBM on the absorber layer. Commercial Czochralski-grown n-type crystalline silicon wafers with a thickness of 200 microns were utilized for the heterojunction cell. Layers of the amorphous silicon were grown on the cell via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition in a cluster system.
The researchers explained that in a traditional four-terminal perovskite/silicon configuration, the solar spectrum in the short-wavelength range is absorbed by the perovskite top sub-cell, while the remaining light is absorbed by the silicon heterojunction sub-cell beneath. “However, not all photons corresponding to bottom sub-cell’s optical bandgap can be yielded,” they further explained.
In the proposed cell configuration, the bifaciality increases the number of absorbed photons. “As a result, short-circuit current and the conversion efficiency of the crystalline silicon heterojunction bottom sub-cell improved from ~ 15.15 to 33.5 mA/cm2 and from 8.68 to 12.99%, respectively, when the albedo reflection increased from 0 to 0.5 sun,” the academics stated. “The albedo reflection intensity can be accurately adjusted in the range of 0–0.5 sun by altering the distance between the cell holder and illumination source.”
This efficiency increase was able to raise the cell’s overall efficiency (including light reflected to the rear side) from 25.78 to 30.09%. The solar cell is presented in the paper Over 30% efficiency bifacial 4-terminal perovskite-heterojunction silicon tandem solar cells with spectral albedo, published in scientific reports. The research group comprises scientists from the Incheon National University and the Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in South Korea, as well as the National University and the Ton Duc Thang University in Vietnam.
“This approach achieved a conversion efficiency exceeding 30%, which is higher than those of both the top and bottom sub-cells,” reads the study. “Notably, this efficiency is also greater than the Schockley–Quiesser limit of the single-junction c-Si solar cell (approximately 29.43%).”
