As a part of the PPA, Vibrant Energy, a portfolio company of Macquarie Asset Management’s Green Investment Group (MAM-GIG), will set up a 75 MW AC /100 MW DC interstate transmission system (ISTS) connected wind-solar hybrid project in Madhya Pradesh. 
Saint-Gobain India is the India arm of French construction material provider Saint-Gobain. It targets 100% renewable energy by 2030.
With the addition of the latest project, Saint-Gobain India will meet 65% of the electricity consumption across its facilities in India through renewables by the end of 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/17/green-hydrogen-market-could-hit-850-billion-in-2050/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 17, 2023",Green hydrogen market could hit $850 billion in 2050,"Rethink Energy predicts the green hydrogen market to reach a $850 billion valuation in 2050, driven by the installation of over 5 TW of electrolysis capacity.
The report highlights the importance of approximately 650 GW of electrolyzer manufacturing capacity and expects cumulative sales of $2 trillion, resulting in a significant return on the $111 billion investment in electrolyzer gigafactories.
The hydrogen industry is poised to follow the trajectory of the LNG market, with key players including the United States, China, Australia, Chile, and select European and African countries dominating global supply.
While certain supply chain links and scarce elements may pose challenges, overall, the price of electrolyzers is expected to continue dropping. Green hydrogen is projected to be the leading hydrogen production method by 2039.
Hydrogen Europe says that global ammonia production, led by the Asia-Pacific region, has consistently risen over the past four years, reaching 185 metric tons (MT) in 2020. The organization highlights that renewable hydrogen supply costs would break even at approximately 3.0 €/kg with natural gas prices at 50 €/MWh (2025 price forecast by the IEA). However, if natural gas prices decline to historical levels of around 20 €/MWh, hydrogen supply costs would face significant pressure, moving the break-even point to around 1.6 €/t.
Ammonia currently accounts for nearly one-third of hydrogen consumption in Europe, making it the second largest consumer after oil refining. As the importance of crude oil refining diminishes, ammonia’s role is expected to grow.

Terabase is launching Terafab, an automated utility-scale solar installation system. It describes the service as an automated “field factory” that can double installation productivity. 
The installation system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7. 
The company also announced the grand opening of a Woodland, California manufacturing facility; “a factory to make factories.” The facility is currently manufacturing the first gigawatt Terafab assembly line with capacity to make more than 10 GW of Terafabs per year.  
Terabase said its system will double labor productivity when compared to traditional utility-scale installation methods. The system offers high-throughput, 24/7 operation, and modularity to enable rapid ramp-ups and higher solar field construction speeds, significantly reducing project schedules. 
“We successfully field-tested Terafab last year, building 10 MW of a 400 MW site in Texas. Today’s launch is the next step forward to rapid commercial scale-up,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer and co-founder of Terabase. 
Terabase has partnered with developer Intersect Power, engineering, procurement and construction firm Signal Energy, tracking hardware provider NEXtracker, and solar panel manufacturer First Solar to develop the Terafab facility. 
“Not only does our partnership with Terabase bring advanced installation technology to our next-generation Series 7 solar module, but it also enables a closed-loop packaging recycling system consistent with our vision of responsible solar,” said Nick Strevel, vice president of product, First Solar. “The Terafab system is another example of how homegrown American innovation can help accelerate the deployment of solar, enabling our country’s decarbonization ambitions.” 
Terafab is pegged for commercial deployment starting in the third quarter. The company said that the automated installation system reduces the levelized cost of electricity for utility-scale solar projects. It is also scalable, built on a modular design that can be replicated and deployed quickly. 
Terafab reduces the physical safety risk of construction workers by eliminating the need to lift heavy solar panels and steel structures, often in harsh weather conditions, by using automation on a climate-controlled assembly line.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/17/tongwei-led-global-polysilicon-output-in-2022-says-bernreuter-research/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 17, 2023","Tongwei led global polysilicon capacity in 2022, says Bernreuter Research","From pv magazine Global
China-based Tongwei was the largest polysilicon producer in 2022, with around 345,000 MT of capacity last year, according to new data from Bernreuter Research.
“In view of an output of almost 160,000 MT in the second half of 2022 alone, the analyst estimates that Tongwei reached an effective production capacity of approx. 345,000 MT by the end of 2022, far above the 260,000 MT officially stated by the company,” the consultancy said in a statement.
The second largest polysilicon maker was GCL Technology, followed by Daqo, Xinte, and Wacker Chemie.
“While the top three positions in the ranking have remained unchanged compared to the previous year, Xinte Energy has relegated Germany-based Wacker Chemie from the fourth to the fifth place,” Bernreuter Research said. “Thus, all top four manufacturers are now located in China; they produced more than 100,000 MT each in 2022.”
The sixth-largest producer was China-based Asia Silicon, which has now reached an annual production capacity of 92,000 MT, followed by East Hope, which closed part of its production at one of its facilities in the Xinjiang province in June after a fire accident.
“China achieved a share of 89% in the global output of solar-grade polysilicon in 2022, and expansion continues unabated. The six largest Chinese manufacturers alone have additional capacities of roughly 1.5 million MT in the pipeline for 2023 and 2024,” the report states, stressing the dominance of the Chinese polysilicon industry. “On top of that, more than a dozen new entrants are building or ramping up new polysilicon plants in China.”
According to polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter, overcapacity will be the main consequence of these expansion plans.
“Even though the potential for growth of global photovoltaic installations is enormous, it will not absorb such huge polysilicon volumes,” he stated.
