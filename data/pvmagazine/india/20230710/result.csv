“VTA leads to compact, dense, and hard morphology while suppressing trap states at surfaces and grain boundaries, which are key culprits for exciton losses,” they stated, emphasizing the importance of the second step to produce a high quality perovskite layer. “As indoor light intensity is at least 300 times lower than that of sunlight, dense and homogeneous perovskite formation enticed by vacuum thermal annealing is valuable.”
The researchers implemented the process via a vacuum flask connected to a vacuum pump with controllable pressure and located on top of a hotplate to regulate the temperature. They used a perovskite material known as FA0.45MA0.49Cs0.06Pb(I0.62Br0.32Cl0.06)3 treated with bromide and chloride. After the treatment, its energy bandgap was 1.80 eV.
They built the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), the perovskite absorber, a hole transporting layer (HTL) made of Spiro-OMeTAD, a carbon top electrode, and another FTO layer. The device has an active area of 0.04 cm2.
Tested under indoor light at 1000 lux, the cell showed a power conversion efficiency of 27.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.93 V, and a short-circuit current of 0.16 mA/cm2, with peak efficiency reaching up to 32.0%. A reference device without VTA treatment achieved an efficiency of 25.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.91 V, and a short-circuit current of of 0.16 mA/cm2, with peak efficiency reaching 30.7%.
“VTA leads to reduced surface roughness and electronic traps both at the bulk and the surface,” the group said referring to the superior performance of the VTA-based cell. “VTA opens doors for robust perovskite formation and could practically be adapted for various perovskite compositions towards desirable optoelectronic applications for modern society.”
The solar cell is introduced in the study “Robust perovskite formation via vacuum thermal annealing for indoor perovskite solar cells,” published in Scientific Reports.

Bidders setting up electrolyzer manufacturing facilities under this program will be eligible for government incentives provided they meet the qualification criteria as laid out in the tender document.
SECI has been appointed as the implementing agency for the incentive scheme for electrolyzer manufacturing.
Out of the total capacity, 1.2 GW is tendered for electrolyzer manufacturing capacity based on any stack technology, and the balance 300 MW for electrolyzer manufacturing capacity based on indigenously developed stack technology. Manufacturers can bid for either or both categories.
To be eligible for incentives under this scheme, the electrolyzer manufacturer must commit to fulfilling certain values of electrolyzers performance and local value addition. The electrolyzer’s specific energy consumption (σ) should be equal to or less than 56 kWh/kg of H2 production. For alkaline electrolyzers, local value addition should be a minimum of 40% in the first year and at least 80% by the fifth year. For proton exchange membrane, solid-oxide, and anion exchange membrane electrolyzers, the local value addition should be a minimum of 30% in the first year and at least 70% by the fifth year.

Scientists at the University of Murcia have developed Climax, an open-source tool that uses the synergy between wind and PV to reduce the variability of their combined production. Climax identifies regions with consistent temporal resource variability and determines the optimal allocation of each technology in those regions.
The researchers have developed an approach that goes beyond considering each resource individually and focuses on their combined utilization. By strategically locating facilities where solar and wind resources can complement each other, they aim to achieve greater efficiency. According to the researchers, implementing this strategy optimally could reduce monthly anomalies in total electricity production from solar and wind sources by up to 60%.
To determine suitable locations, the researchers have combined data and patterns of solar radiation and wind speed over time in specific regions. This allows them to identify areas where favorable conditions exist for higher yields between the two energy sources.
“The target spatial domain and temporal scale (at which the temporal variability of the production is to be reduced) are eligible fields, the total shares of each technology can be fixed, forced to stay above/below certain thresholds or let free to find their optimum, and the minimum production to be guaranteed can be modified,” said the scientists. “Also, an additional code is made available on the webpage to find optimum locations for new installations given that the current spatial distribution of installations is known, which might be the most useful application of the tool for the short-term decision making.”
They presented the new tool in the paper “An Action-Oriented Approach to Make the Most of the Wind and Solar Power Complementarity,” published in Earth’s Future.
“The method, implemented in an open-access user-friendly and customizable tool called Climax (http://climax.inf.um.es/), has been proven here in an illustrative pilot study over pan-European regions for which the temporal variability of the monthly wind-plus-solar production is to be reduced,” the scientists said.

French railway operator SNCF said this week that it has set up SNCF Renouvelables, a new clean energy unit.
SNFC, with its fleet of 15,000 daily trains and its 3,000 stations and industrial buildings, is France’s top electricity consumer, using 9 TWh per year, including 8 TWh for train electrification.
SNCF Renouvelables plans to allocate 1,000 hectares of its land to develop 1 GW of PV plants, aiming to meet 20% of its electricity needs by 2030. This initial phase constitutes a small portion of SNCF’s total land ownership of approximately 100,000 hectares, making it the country’s second-largest landowner after the state.
“Energy consumption costs have more than doubled in 2022 and 2023,” said SNCF president Jean-Pierre Farrandou. “This represents more than €700 million ($764.6 million) just for the energy used for train traction in these two years.”
SNCF already produces its own electricity, with solar panels on the roofs of its stations or in shades, via its subsidiary SNCF Gares et Connexions.
Its SNCF Energie unit has also been piloting a “corporate PPA” program since 2018. It has already signed several PPAs, including one with French energy giant EDF, one with Switzerland’s Axpo, and one with French independent power producer Reden.
