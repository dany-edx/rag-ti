The platform will provide end-to-end green solutions to consumers, including connectivity to the appropriate transmission network. 
The company plans to install and commission 1.5 GW of solar and wind capacity in India in 24 months. It will build this capacity across multiple sites in the states of Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra, where it has already acquired connectivity approvals. A large part of this capacity will be used to deliver close to 600 MW of round-the-clock clean energy to various entities of the Vedanta Group. 
Hindustan Zinc, an arm of Vedanta Group unit, signed an agreement on Sept. 2 with special-purpose vehicle Serentica Renewables India for long-term delivery of up to 200 MW of renewables.
“Serentica will also participate selectively in Government tenders subject to the project having synergies with its overall focus of providing direct green energy solutions to commercial and industrial customers,” said the company.
Over the medium-term, Serentica aims to install 5 GW of clean energy, coupled with different storage technologies. Eventually, it aims to supply more than 15 billion units of clean energy per year and displace 20 million tons of CO2 emissions. 
Serentica Renewables is 100% owned by Twinstar Overseas Ltd., a unit of  Volcan Investments. Twinstar Overseas also owns controlling stakes in Sterlite Power Transmission and Sterlite Technologies.

(NSDC) to train 600 young people as solar module technicians. The goal is to impart the knowledge, skills, and training that young graduates need to enter the employment market. 
“Through this development project, Engie aims to ensure a just transition through capacity building as countries embark on their energy transition journeys … Engie aims to bridge the gap between learning and working through such programs that focus on skills and capacity building,” said the company, noting that the training will be provided in Anantapur, Kurnool, Kadappa, and Bikaner. 
The project is part of Engie’s corporate social responsibility initiative for the 2022-23 period and will continue until the first quarter of 2024. Students will be taught the basics of PV systems and their components, among other topics. 
After training, NSDC will send candidates to different companies for skills training. They will be taught how to do site surveys, assess customer requirements, procure components, and install civil/mechanical and electrical components, in addition to how to handle testing, project commissioning, and PV maintenance. NSDC will ensure that all of the training programs are in line with the Qualification Pack (QP)/National Occupation Standards set by the Sector Skill Councils (SSC).
“Engie understands there is a massive female underrepresentation in STEM. Therefore, the company intends to encourage more girls to participate in training programs like these so that they can challenge the status quo and break the glass ceiling in the future,” said Engie.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/13/shipments-of-module-level-power-electronics-could-hit-100-gw-by-2026/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2022",Shipments of module-level power electronics could hit 100 GW by 2026,"From pv magazine Global
Around 12,000 MW of module-level power electronics (MLPE) were shipped throughout the world in 2021, mostly for the distributed-generation segment, according to a new report on MLPE by IHS Markit. The global MLPE market grew by 33% between 2021 and 2019, when around 9,000 MW of MLPE were shipped throughout the world.
IHS Markit said it expects cumulative MLPE shipments to reach almost 100 GW by 2026, with the United States, Germany and the Netherlands emerging as the top three markets. The report shows that one of the drivers for rising MLPE demand is the booming distributed-generation market, which is expected to account for almost 43% of global PV installations between 2022 and 2025.
“While the booming distributed-generation segment is definitely one of the drivers for high MLPE demand, markets that are less price sensitive and have mandatory rapid shutdown requirements or advanced grid requirements tend to be key markets for MLPE compared with markets where price is a more dominating factor,” Cormac Gilligan, director of IHS Markit, told pv magazine.
Strong demand from the distributed-generation segment is expected to drive MLPE prices down in the next few years.
“Also, as suppliers enter new geographies, prices are forecast to decline in order to obtain market shares,” said Gilligan. “However, the price declines are expected to be slower in 2022 and 2023 comparing with the following years due to the higher cost inputs owing to semiconductor and electronic component supply challenges.”
The United States was the largest MLPE market in 2021, representing around 44% of global shipments. The country was the first to introduce module-level rooftop rapid shutdown requirements, followed by the Philippines. Other major PV markets such as China are reportedly also considering adopting such requirements.
MLPE is also becoming more common in areas where there are no rapid shutdown requirements.
“In recent years, the United States’ dominance in the MLPE market has been challenged by certain markets in Europe such as Netherlands and Germany, in South America such as Brazil and in Asia such as Australia,” the report said. “While consumers are not obliged to adopt these technologies, they have been persuaded by other benefits such as optimized yield, enhanced monitoring capabilities, and in certain cases, easier installation.”
