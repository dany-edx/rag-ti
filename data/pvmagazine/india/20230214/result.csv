Delivering the keynote address, Rajnath Ram, advisor-Energy, NITI Aayog, said, “In the recent budget, almost one lakh crore rupees was announced as allocations towards green growth initiatives, but the challenge for the renewable energy sector is to ensure that the community participates and gets great benefit from it.”
The Responsible Energy Initiative (REI) by World Resources Institute India (WRI India) and its partners seeks to enable the clean energy sector to adopt models and value chain approaches that are ecologically safe and socially just. By collaborating with stakeholder across the clean energy value chain, the initiative hopes to contribute to creating a shared vision of responsible energy.
Bharath Jairaj, executive director, Energy, WRI India, said, “REI was built on a set of principles that we and our partners agreed upon. These are based on lofty universal values but that’s what we need right now to ensure the RE sector is socially just and environmentally sound. Over the past few months, we’ve attempted to translate these principles into actionable pilots on land use, circularity, and financing, because these principles must not be just goals but actions for the RE sector must take forward.”
The Union Government’s recent budget allocations suggest large-scale projects like the 13 GW solar-wind hybrid in Ladakh being prioritized over distributed and off-grid renewables. However, Finding land for installations of grid-scale wind and solar energy is beginning to become a challenge. Concerns have been expressed by communities over loss of livelihoods and lands for grazing and allied activities where these RE projects are sited.
Shirish S Garud, Senior Fellow and Director, TERI, said “REI aims to set new norms and guidelines for land use and land ownerships. We are proposing pilots to evaluate the options and impacts of renewable energy projects on farmlands.”
Ensuring the RE sector is kept accountable to society and nature, requires financing institutions to build frameworks that consider social, ecological and circularity processes while taking investment decisions, be they private capital, Sovereign Wealth Funds, or international development organisations.
“Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s recent Budget announcements made clear the need to seek the RE sector to become more responsible. The RE sector must seize this opportunity to ensure it leads by not committing the mistakes that mark the fossil fuel industry, which is extraction and inequity,” said Ms. Anna Biswas, Managing Director (India), Forum for the Future.
As the RE sector grows, it will need significant natural resources, and it will generate waste at an unsustainable level, unless circularity is introduced into the production process.
The day-long event, called the Responsible Renewable Energy Summit, was led by REI’s core partners WRI India, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Forum for the Future (Forum) and supported by expert partners including BHRRC, CEEW, Consensus Building Institute, Climate Group, Landesa, WWF India. The Summit was organised by the REI with organising partners The Nature Conservancy, NSEFI and Vasudha Foundation.

The first phase will comprise the installation of a 600 MW cell line and 550 MW module line, and the second phase comprises the addition of a 1.2 GW cell line.
As part of its plan to upgrade to mono PERC and TopCon, the company scrapped its current facilities to set up the new line. Thus the new line will upgrade the company’s overall capacity completely to the new mono PERC and TopCon technology.
Websol Energy Systems reported a revenue from operations of INR 0.33 crore in the third quarter of the financial year 2022-23, a significant decline compared to INR 13.55 crore reported in the second quarter.
The company clarified that “the decline was primarily due to the 250 MW cell line being discontinued as a part of the process to graduate towards the new mono PERC technology. On account of this, production had to be discontinued, dismantle the old manufacturing equipment and redesign the shopfloor accordingly.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/14/snapnrack-introduces-solar-mount-that-attaches-to-module-before-roof/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 14, 2023",SnapNrack introduces solar mount that attaches to module before roof,"From pv magazine Global
SnapNrack has announced TopSpeed, an innovative new solar panel mount designed to be attached to the panel on the ground, before being hoisted to the rooftop for installation.
The solar racking supplier said the new product is aimed at reducing installation times and limiting time spent on rooftops. SnapNrack said the duration of time spent on rooftops can be cut by more than 50%, compared to traditional racking solutions. This is a boon to the safety of installation workers.
The mounts are attached to the roof, leveled and aligned on SnapNrack’s universal skirt. The process helps simplify materials staging and racking assembly.
The installation process involves three steps. First, TopSpeed mounts are attached to the solar modules. Next, wire management is performed, with Smart Clips and module level power electronics (MLPE) frame kits set in place. These first two steps are performed on the ground, while the universal skirt is laid out on the roof. Finally, the modules are quickly affixed to the skirt.
The product is UL certified and is rated to perform under 90 mph to 180 mph wind loads and up to 90 pounds per square foot of snow load. All mounts are secured with a proprietary half-inch head wood screw and roof sealant. The design allows for single-tool installation. The mounting system includes new features like retained fasteners and deck mounts.
The product is made of alloy aluminum and 300 series stainless steel. It is finished on the top with a black oxide bolt and bonding clip and a black anodized clamp, while the bottom has a mill finish. It is approved for installations between zero-degree and 90-degree roof pitches.
The product will be displayed at Intersolar North America 2023 in Long Beach, California, at the SnapNrack b0oth from Feb. 14 to Feb. 16.

CNMIA says Chinese manufacturers are now selling 182 mm/150μm, M10 monocrystalline wafers for CNY 6.0 ($0.88) to CNY 6.22 each, up 26.4% from the preceding week.
The association said that 210 mm/150 μm, G12 monocrystalline wafers are selling for CNY 8.0 to CNY 8.2 each, for a week-on-week increase of 34.4%.
It attributed the price increases to higher polysilicon prices and unspecified shortages in the supply chain. Polysilicon prices have risen since the start of the year, after a relatively long period of decline toward the end of 2022, according to additional data released by CNMIA last week.
