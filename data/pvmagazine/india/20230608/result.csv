The company bagged the latest contracts from Sterling & Wilson and Torrent Power following a 2.8 GW mega project last year.
The 242 MW project with Sterling & Wilson is located in Rajasthan, where the company completed the shipment of 1.7 GW of 1P SkyLine trackers by 2021. This deal marks Arctech’s third project with Sterling & Wilson after the cumulative portfolio of 191 MW in the MENA area.
Arctech landed the other 420 MW project with Torrent Power. The project is located in Surel, India.
Arctech will supply its SkyLine II solar trackers for both projects.
“SkyLine II is a flagship product with a peculiar edge in the Indian market. The first 1P (one-in-portrait) tracker designed with a synchronous multi-point drive mechanism enables a new possibility of designing the plant using trackers with identical pile configurations, overcoming the uncertainty faced in the early stage of plant design and construction,” stated Arctech.
“The synchronous multi-point drive mechanism technology rigidifies the tracker to the point of enabling 0-deg wind stow mode, hence reducing the difference of wind pressure and post loads between the exterior and interior of the PV plant. By doing so, Skyline II enables a new possibility of designing the plant using trackers with identical pile configurations, overcoming the uncertainty faced in the early stage of plant design and construction.”
In August 2022, Arctech opened its first joint venture manufacturing base, Jash Energy, in Mundra, Gujarat. Jash has an annual production capacity of 3 GW and can produce all major components for its solar tracker products.

Installations were down 37% year-over-year (YoY).
In Q1 2023, Karnataka remained the leading state, accounting for over 55% of capacity additions, followed by Maharashtra (14%) and Tamil Nadu (8%). 
As of March 2023, open-access solar projects in the pipeline stood at 6.4 GW. Over 68% of the pipeline was spread across Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Gujarat.
Open-access solar project costs decreased in Q1 2023 following the module price reduction over the previous quarter and increased imports after the government relaxed the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) mandate. The report said lower project costs made the power purchase agreement (PPA) prices attractive.
Commercial and Industrial (C&I) entities with renewable purchase obligations (RPO) also drove capacity additions during the quarter.
As of March 31, 2023, the cumulative installed solar open-access capacity reached 8.3 GW.
Karnataka remained the top state, accounting for over 37% of cumulative solar open access capacity as of March 2023. Maharashtra made up over 12% of total installations.
“Despite regulatory challenges in many states, open-access solar demand continues from industries and commercial units keen on reducing their energy costs and locking in tariffs for the long term. With most state DISCOMs raising retail tariffs and the solar project costs declining, we could see growth continuing in the next few quarters,” said Priya Sanjay, managing director at Mercom India.
The report offers a detailed analysis of the solar open access segment in seventeen states, including open access charges, retail supply tariffs, and market size.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/08/ih2a-submits-plan-for-5-billion-national-green-hydrogen-hubs-by-2030/,"ELECTROLYZER,FINANCE,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 8, 2023",IH2A submits plan for $5 billion national green hydrogen hubs by 2030,"The government can play a lead role in market development and driving the commercialization of green hydrogen, says the industry body India Hydrogen Alliance (IH2A). 
The alliance recently submitted its National Green Hydrogen Hub Economic Viability and Development Plan to the Government of India, which emphasizes public-private partnership to accelerate the hydrogen economy and build five large national green hydrogen corporations with a collective enterprise value of $5 billion by 2030.
The Plan seeks public finance support to create the necessary infrastructure for green hydrogen production and offtake in the initial 2024-30 period and publicly list the national hydrogen corporations created as a result to fund the next wave of investments to scale up the hydrogen economy.
“Hydrogen hub production, storage, and evacuation infrastructure development will require govt participation (as equity partner), inducing demand by enabling guaranteed offtake for early defined volume, and incentives for infra development over first seven years (2024-30). Large-scale hubs will be commercially viable with offtake prices between $6-4.25 between 2024-30, for delivered green hydrogen prices, i.e. at demand or offtake point, as per preliminary estimates,” states the plan.  
Speaking on the National Green Hydrogen Hub Economic Viability and Development Plan, Jill Evanko, chief executive and president of Chart Industries, and founding member, IH2A, said, “India can leapfrog other economies on green hydrogen development by sharing the risks and rewards of green hydrogen project development between public and private sectors. Sustained public finance support for national hubs is crucial for financial viability.”
“India should announce at least one of these large-scale green hydrogen hubs during the G20 Summit this year. The Indian government stands to gain significantly from this approach, which demonstrates how India can create a National Green Hydrogen Unicorn within the next seven years.”
The National Green Hydrogen Hub Economic Viability and Development Plan was prepared by starting with a reference economic model of the Green Kochi Hydrogen Hub (GKH2) as a 50:50 venture between the government and private participants with a $468 million Capex outlay over a 20-year project period. The hub comprises a 150 MW electrolyzer capacity, storage and evacuation infrastructure, renewable energy inputs, green ammonia production plants, and offtake by industrial and mobility users. The Plan recommends similar large-scale green hydrogen hubs to be developed in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.
The Green H2 Hub SPV is expected to produce an estimated 21,000 MT of green hydrogen annually. It will produce compressed gaseous hydrogen (for industrial use), green ammonia, and liquid hydrogen (for transport use).
Amrit Singh Deo, senior managing director, FTI Consulting, and IH2A Secretariat lead, said, “The economic modeling [in the plan] is based on few assumptions regarding public finance incentives, renewable energy costs, end-use offtake and project structuring on a public-private partnership format. The model is replicable and demonstrates that a financially viable green hydrogen hub can be designed and built. The model can be supported with techno-commercial studies and should accelerate project development.”
IH2A has submitted proposals for state-level green ammonia and hydrogen hubs to Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. 
Public finance support, in form of CAPEX and offtake incentives, for National Green H2 Hubs, is crucial for creating financially viable green hydrogen infrastructure, especially in the initial 2024-2030 period.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/08/german-pv-equipment-securing-orders-from-us-european-markets/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JUNE 8, 2023","German PV equipment securing orders from US, European markets","From pv magazine Germany
VDMA said this week that German PV equipment providers recorded a slight decline of 3% in incoming orders last year, with sales falling 7% year on year. All in all, this points to a demand recovery, according to the VDMA.
The pandemic’s impact has largely subsided, with fewer supply disruptions in electronic components compared to the previous year, according to the VDMA. German photovoltaic machine builders generated approximately 85% of their sales from silicon and thin-film solar cell production systems, while the remaining portion comprised module integration equipment and machinery for ingot and wafer fabrication.
Currently, China dominates photovoltaic production, with German PV equipment suppliers exporting 78% of their products, of which 57% went to Asian customers. Jutta Trube, Head of VDMA Photovoltaic Production Equipment, noted that the Asian solar market remains the largest sales contributor, while the American and European markets show increasing attractiveness.
The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is driving the establishment of solar factories, leading to an 18% export share for German manufacturers in the Americas region in 2022. European mechanical engineering companies, including those in Germany, achieved a 22% total turnover share. Both regions experienced a 7% increase in turnover last year.
“It is quite clear that solar photovoltaic production is growing in regions with high incentives,” said Peter Fath, managing director of RCT Solutions. “The United States, with the Inflation Reduction Act, has created a clear framework for supporting local production, which benefits European machine and plant manufacturers.”
Fath said that there is also a positive trend in Europe, which can be enhanced through the implementation of effective industrial policies. He noted that manufacturing costs play a crucial role in investment decisions related to solar production lines.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/08/photovoltaic-thermal-solar-panel-based-on-water-storage-tank/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 8, 2023",Photovoltaic-thermal solar panel based on water storage tank,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Dublin City University in Ireland have proposed a new design for photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) modules based on a water tank that simultaneously provides PV panel cooling and generates hot water for domestic use.
The group said its PVT water collector represents an attractive option to enhance the overall performance of a PV panel, with the storage tank working as a typical gas-powered geyser used for the production of hot water for domestic use.
“In general, gas-fired geysers are widely used in Pakistan to heat water for daily use, and in the last few years, Pakistan is facing a problem of gas load-shedding due to which production of hot water in winter is crucial,” it explained, noting that the proposed PVT solution would represent a Co2 emission-free solution for supplying hot water. “Water from the overhead tank is flown by gravity which is heated in geysers and then utilized in domestic operations.”
The system consists of a 170 W photovoltaic panel connected to a water tank placed at the backside of the PV module itself. The storage tank has a size of 150 cm × 66 cm x 4 cm and is made of wood coated with an aluminum sheet to avoid the degradation of the wood due to water.
“The circuit of the PV module was saved by using a rubber gasket to avoid contact of water with it,” the scientists explained. “Two headers, one for an inlet and one for an outlet, had been included. Five steel rods were bolted at the backside of the wooden sheet for structural support.”
The team compared the performance of the PVT module with that of a reference PV panel without the water storage tank. It ascertained that the PVT panel ensured high heat transfer between the PV surface and the tank, thus being able to considerably reduce the operating temperature of the PV unit. According to the group’s calculations, the PVT panel had a 19% higher power yield than its pure PV counterpart.
“In addition, the hybrid PVT module was capable to produce hot water which was considered to be an additional advantage,” the academics stated, noting that the PVT panel uses around 50.04% of incoming solar radiation while the PV utilizes only 11.4%. “So, it can be concluded that hybrid PVT can be effectively utilized to produce both electrical energy and hot water from a single system.”
They introduced the system in the paper “Energy and stress analysis of a hybrid photovoltaic thermal module,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
An international research group led by the Imperial College London recently conducted a comprehensive review of all photovoltaic-thermal system designs developed to date at both the research and industry level.
