This is more than double the 529 MW grid-scale capacity added in the previous quarter (July-September).
Rooftop solar addition during the quarter was 289 MW. 
Overall, the nation added 1414 MW of solar from utility-scale and rooftop projects combined, compared to 928 MW installed in the previous quarter (July-September).
Solar continued to dominate, accounting for 73% of the 1.9 GW RE capacity (grid-scale solar, rooftop solar, wind and biomass/other RE sources) added in Q3 FY21.
Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive officer, CEEW, said, “India offers one of the largest renewable energy markets operating on market principles. The performance of the RE sector in this quarter has further reiterated the promise the sector holds. To meet the 450 gigawatts renewables target, India needs investments worth more than USD 200 billion for generating capacity alone. Significant additional funds will be required for supporting infrastructure such as storage and transmission. The focus must now be on reducing the cost of finance and embracing innovative financing models such as a time-bound credit enhancement scheme to accelerate the growth of the sector.” 
The report also indicated a decline in quarterly capacity auctioned, with 2.97 GW RE capacity auctioned in Q3 FY21, compared to 4.4 GW in Q1 FY21 and 3.2 GW in Q2 FY21. 
“This might be due to challenges faced by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) in finding adequate buyers for the previously tendered (higher tariff) capacities in the face of rapidly declining tariffs and discoms’ grid integration,” it reasoned.
Nikhil Sharma, Associate, CEEW-CEF, said, “SECI needs to ensure power purchase assurance with discoms to attract bidders and provide an upside of the rapidly declining tariffs to discoms to regain momentum in the quarterly capacity auctioned.”
On the discom payables front, there was only a 1% increase in overdues in Q3 FY21, compared to a 30% spike in Q1 FY21. As of December 2020, the amount overdue by discoms was INR 1.43 lakh crore.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/18/new-approach-to-automating-peer-to-peer-renewables-distribution/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",New approach to automating peer-to-peer renewables distribution,"From pv magazine International
LF Energy and Sony Computer Science Laboratories have developed a novel approach to automating the peer-to-peer distribution of renewable energy through microgrids.
Their Hyphae initiative aims to make microgrids more resilient. It envisions doing that by adapting the Sony business unit’s Autonomous Power Interchange System software to work with AC grids.
The partners said that enabling resilient, peer-to-peer microgrid energy trading will allow even the most remote communities to store and distribute energy without connecting to large-scale power stations or distribution networks.
As envisioned, Hyphae will enable the connection of buildings, homes, and energy-consuming devices to energy-producing devices like storage, EV batteries, and PV. At the core is physical peer-to-peer (P2P) trading.
The energy sector is a “complicated beast” that is shifting from centralized fossil-fired generation to distributed resources, said Dr. Shuli Goodman, executive director of LF Energy, in a recent interview with pv magazine USA. She said that the grid of the future likely will not be a grid at all, but something closer to the mass of branching, threadlike organisms known as hyphae that underlie forest structures. That means the future grid would be made up of cloud, data, artificial intelligence, 5-G communications, and edge computing, which brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed.
LF Energy is a Linux Foundation nonprofit seeking to accelerate the energy transition of the world’s grids and transportation systems through open source. The organization was recently invited to take part as the government of U.S. President Joe Biden worked to develop its climate plan. Goodman gave the incoming administration a number of recommendations, including the following:
Open source gained an advocate in the new administration when Biden named David Recordon – who has a background in open source, open standards, and security – to serve as the new White House director of technology.
The partnership with Sony that was announced on Feb. 16 is expected to bring LF Energy closer to its goal of building an interoperable AC- and DC-ready microgrid that is self-contained, operational off-grid, and able to connect to an electrical distribution network with utility oversight.
“I think we are at the very beginning of being able to harness, control, and optimize both supply and demand,” Goodman said.

The joint venture will first establish a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility in India, then in North America.
As part of the venture, Barrel will become a majority stakeholder in Roshan Energy Technologies, allowing Roshan Energy the platform for expansion into the Indian market and laterally into international markets. Roshan Energy Technologies will extend its technical resources and expertise. At the same time, Barrel will organize funds and international marketing abilities. 
Both organizations will work together to design, plan, and develop customized green energy solutions for customers worldwide.
Plans for the India manufacturing facility with a three-phase rollout of powerful products have been in development by Roshan’s CEO and engineering team leader, S.A. Gaffoor. 
A joint R&D division will be developed in conjunction with Barrel’s recently opened Nevada Tech Center as part of the partnership. The Nevada center is the locus for Barrel’s efforts into lithium-ion battery metal recycling and potential battery development and direct metal-ion extraction.
Roshan’s Ashok Shukla, a professor emeritus from the Indian Institute of Science with 40 years of research experience in specialized batteries and over 350 published technical papers, will lead the team with the aim of designing customized solutions for battery development, improvement, and recycling.
This joint venture is facilitated by ArcgenConsulting, a management consulting firm based in Hyderabad, India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/18/hinduja-renewables-commissions-75-mwp-solar-plant-for-vehicle-manufacturer-ashok-leyland/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,TAMIL NADU",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",Hinduja Renewables commissions 75 MWp solar plant for vehicle manufacturer Ashok Leyland ,"Ashok Leyland, the flagship company of the Hinduja Group and India’s leading commercial vehicle manufacturer, has announced that its 75 MWp solar plant in Tamil Nadu is now operational. Now 75% of its energy consumption in Tamil Nadu and 60% throughout India is met through renewable energy generated from the solar rooftop, solar ground-mount, and wind-based plants.
The plant—located in Sivagangai district—was built by Hinduja Renewables, another firm from the Hinduja Group. It is one of India’s largest ‘group captive‘ solar plants serving a single client and is expected to generate over 120 million units of power annually.
Shom Hinduja, president, Alternative Energy & Sustainability Initiatives at Hinduja Group said the Hinduja Group is evaluating its operations globally and has planned similar ESG initiatives across the different companies. 
“Sustainability is paramount to us at the Hinduja Group. Hinduja Renewables was set up to be the bridge between nations and companies to achieve their sustainability targets. Its mission is to positively impact humanity and conserve the environment through sustainable energy and mobility solutions. This project will enable Ashok Leyland to significantly reduce its carbon footprint, thereby helping it achieve its sustainability goals,” he added. 
Vipin Sondhi, managing director and chief executive officer, Ashok Leyland, said, “As we march towards our vision of being among the Top 10 global commercial vehicle makers, it is equally important that we do this sustainably. Ensuring that our energy requirements come from renewables, is a critical part of this vision. 
“With the start of operations of the Vepancolum Solar Plant, we have taken a massive leap in reducing our carbon footprint – of the total energy requirement, we will achieve renewable energy consumption of 75% in Tamil Nadu and 60% throughout India. Sourcing energy from this captive solar power plant will ensure abatement of 85,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, which is equal to planting 157487 trees, annually.”
The plant 
Hinduja Renewables started constructing the solar plant in May 2020. Set up through its subsidiary, Prathama Solarconnect Energy, the plant has solar panels in a fixed-tilt mounting arrangement for peak energy production. Drones were used to relay back real-time information and progress. The plant was commissioned in nine months. 
The company has implemented smart maintenance using data analytics and claims preventive and predictive maintenance systems will ensure best-in-class capacity utilization factor during the plant’s entire lifecycle. This project generated 500 direct jobs during the development phase and 20+ permanent jobs for plant operations.
The plant uses robotic cleaning technology for regular cleaning of solar modules, which is estimated to conserve 9 million liters of water annually. Additionally, in partnership with the Hinduja Foundation, Hinduja Renewables is implementing a slew of socio-economic measures to uplift communities surrounding the plant.
