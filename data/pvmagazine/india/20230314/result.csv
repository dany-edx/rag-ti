N-Side accelerates the transition towards renewables and electrification by enabling grids and market players to make better, faster, and safer decisions with machine learning and mathematical optimization technologies.
The partnership with N-Side is a part of PTC’s long-term strategy to position itself as a technology-enabled solutions provider in the electricity value chain.
PTC is building a portfolio of forecasting tools across various tenors to forecast demand and prices in the electricity markets. This is in addition to the in-house PTC Analytics Lab that had been recently set up to generate proprietary analysis and insights for use by PTC and its clients. 
The evolving Indian power market in which the behavior of the market participants resulted in heightened volatility recently has validated the need for market makers to equip themselves with tools and solutions to support their decision-making.
“The participation in the markets of the future would require a core competency of data analytics in all aspects involving descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, and PTC is well on its journey to reposition itself as a technology-enabled market maker,” said Rajib K Mishra, CMD (addl. charge), PTC India Ltd.
The Government of India has also mandated PTC to trade electricity with Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The trading activities undertaken by PTC include long-term trading of power generated from large power projects, including renewables, and short-term trading arising from supply and demand mismatches, which inevitably occur in various regions of the country.

It will arrive at the estimated value of lithium in Jammu & Kashmir upon completion of further exploration.
GSI carried out a G3 stage mineral exploration project during field season 2020-21 and 2021-22 in the Salal-Haimna areas of the Reasi district in Jammu & Kashmir and estimated an inferred resource (G3) of 5.9 million tonnes of lithium ore. 
As a follow-up of lithium exploration in the Salal-Haimna areas of the Reasi district, GSI has taken up another reconnaissance G4 stage exploration program on lithium and associated minerals in Panasa–Dugga–Baldhanun–Chakar-Sangarmarg (Saro-da-Bas) area of the Reasi district during current field season 2022-23. The work is in progress.
Based on the mapping outcome, GSI will take up more exploration programs on various mineral commodities, including lithium, in the future in different parts of the country, including Jammu & Kashmir.
GSI generates baseline geoscience data through geological, geochemical, and geophysical mapping, which is a prerequisite for identifying the potential area for systematic mineral exploration. Based on the mapping data, GSI conducts systematic mineral exploration activities for various major mineral commodities, including lithium.

Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE, Freiburg University, and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have developed solutions to retrofit heat pumps, heat transfer systems, and ventilation systems in multi-family homes as part of the “LowEx in the Building Stock” project. The team has also developed a multi-source heat pump with Germany-based heating manufacturer Viessmann. The device uses air and geothermal as heat sources.
“In city centers, there is often not enough space to drill boreholes for geothermal probes and the use of outdoor air as a heat source is comparatively inefficient and has a higher noise emission,” Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “The multi-source heat pump system combines the advantages of the two heat sources: outside air and ground. With this combination, a smaller drilling area is achieved yet the high efficiency of a brine heat pump is still achievable.”
The researchers installed the solution in a 160-unit apartment building in Karlsruhe-Durlach, Germany. The system was paired with a peak-load gas boiler and a 60 kW PV system on the building’s rooftop.
“To achieve low-CO2 heat generation in these buildings, the heat pumps were designed to have the maximum possible coverage rate with the gas boiler operating correspondingly seldom,” said Fraunhofer.
In the first six months of operation, between February and July 2022, the multi-source heat pump achieved source temperatures of 8 C on average, according to Fraunhofer ISE. Its coefficient of performance (COP) during that period was reportedly 3.2. The gas boiler accounted for 31% of the heat supplied to the building. This “is primarily due to the high-temperature requirements for hygienic domestic hot water,” the research institution claimed. Overall, the retrofit system reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 42%.
“The demonstrator multifamily houses in this project have proven the feasibility of retrofitting multifamily houses with heat pumps and low exergy technologies,” said Manuel Lämmle, a researcher from the University of Freiburg.
“To achieve optimal operation, it is important to consider the given situation, including the heat distribution systems and the amount of space in the heating cellar,” he said. “During the retrofit, it is also essential to perform a hydraulic balance of the heating system and check if flow temperatures can be further reduced, e.g., by replacing individual radiators.”
The project included other technological developments such as hybrid heat pumps, heat pumps with propane as the refrigerant, and high-temperature heat pumps. The other technologies partners included German manufacturers Bosch, Beck+Heun, and Kermi.
