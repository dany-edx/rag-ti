This signals enhanced appetite from companies to invest in climate-friendly technologies, and opportunities for investors to book profits and re-invest proceeds in new projects, or even exit completely.
The growth in acquisitions was supported by conducive global financial conditions and accommodative monetary policy maintained by the Reserve Bank of India. Adani Green’s takeover of SB Energy India, in October, at a reported enterprise value of US$ 3.5 billion was the biggest deal in the sector. 
However, the ‘Clean Energy Investment Trends 2021’ study highlighted that solar PV capacity awarded in the first six months of 2021 fell sharply to just 2.6 GW from 15.3 GW (including 1.6 GW solar-wind hybrid capacity) reported in the corresponding period in 2020. This was largely as a result of a backlog of unsigned power sales agreements (PSAs) amounting to around 20 GW with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) at the end of 2020. 
“A healthy level of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity signals continued interest to invest in Indian renewables, facilitating the entry of financial investors and allowing developers to exit at attractive returns. However, market uncertainty stemming from delays in signing power sales agreements, the timely availability and pricing of modules, and the persistent risk of retrospective contract renegotiation could prevent the flow of new investments rising to a level consistent with India’s 500 GW target,” said Arjun Dutt, Programme Lead, CEEW-CEF.
“Our analysis indicates that sectoral risks associated with the Indian market are higher than in other large renewables markets. However, if challenges related to reliability of power purchase and timely availability of land and transmission infrastructure can be addressed, financing costs could be considerably lowered, translating into even lower tariffs,” said Pablo González, Investment Analyst, IEA.
The study also highlighted that India’s renewable energy sector will face headwinds in the near term. An increase in prices of PV modules, driven in turn by rising raw material and shipping costs, could result in lower realized returns than those priced into tariffs at the time of bidding. Further, the Indian government’s decision to levy a basic custom duty of 40% and 25% from April 2022, on imports of solar modules and cells, respectively, is expected to increase module prices in the near term as well, as buyers advance their purchases to avoid the extra cost. 
The study estimated that an increase of 20% in realized module prices, from those assumed in the most competitive tariffs (INR 1.99/kWh discovered in December 2020), could lower equity returns by around 45%.

In fact, it needs to contribute in ways that enhance grid safety and overall energy security.
In India, the need of the hour is implementing demand-oriented approaches for integrating variable renewable energy (VRE) such as wind and solar energy into the electricity grid.
At COP 26 in Glasgow, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India aims to achieve 500 gigawatts (GW) of installed power capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030 and meet 50% of its energy requirement from renewable sources by 2030.
India’s rate of renewable energy (RE) installation over the past decade has been commendable. As of September 2021, the share of RE was approximately 26% of the country’s total installed capacity (~391GW). However, RE’s representation has been disproportionately smaller (~10%) in the context of share in overall electricity generation.
In states with relatively high VRE capacity, such as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) often instruct RE developers to back-down solar and wind power generation, citing concerns for grid safety and power supply reliability.
VRE’s intermittent and infirm nature is a challenge for maintaining the grid balance – fluctuations in feed-in substantially stress the grid.
Capacity addition of renewables must follow the trajectory required to fulfil the country’s RE target and the power that is generated must have unrestricted access to the grid.
Lately, there has been uncertainty over existing coal-based thermal power. In several parts of India, there were power outages due to coal shortages in coal-fired power plants. The huge surge in import prices for coal (from $50 per tonne in August 2020 to more than $200 per tonne in October 2021) led to a sharp rise in demand for local coal, disrupting the domestic supply chain operations.
Further, the cost per kWh of new thermal power is already significantly higher than even that of renewable-plus-storage power.
Consolidating 24/7 VRE-integrated firm power can ensure reliable generation and supply.
In India, the evolution of RE tenders – from plain vanilla solar/wind to hybrid to assured peak power to round the clock (RTC) – highlights the increasing focus on firming of VRE-integrated power. Discoms are now driving the next set of tenders and auctions to manage their RTC requirements with renewable energy sources meeting 80-85% annual capacity utilization factor (CUF) conditions in peak and off peak hours alike. Reducing intermittency of VRE by blending power (from varied primary sources) with or without integrated energy storage systems (ESS) makes the best use of energy and infrastructure.
In October 2019, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) issued the first-ever RTC tender for 400 MW (RTC-1). In May 2020, the RTC-1 auction set the lowest bid (L1) tariff for the first year of the power purchase agreement (PPA) at Rs2.9/kWh (3% annual escalation for the first 15 years).
In March 2020, the SECI 5 GW RE-plus-thermal (RTC-2) tender was announced (the capacity was reduced to 2,500 MW in December 2020). For the RTC-2 auction conducted in October 2021, the L1 tariff was Rs3.01/kWh.
These tenders are nominally “RTC” as they mandate minimum annual CUFs of only 80% or 85%. Stiff tender conditions, such as the high penalty fee of 300%-400% of the tariff for energy supply shortfall, calls for a more meticulous project design.
It is critical to employ creative techno-commercial strategies using a mix of renewable power, thermal/conventional power and ESS.
Based on financial modelling by JMK Research and IEEFA, in the short to medium term, a RE-plus-thermal model for RTC power supply would qualify as the best solution. Long-term, a RE-plus-battery energy storage system (BESS) would most likely be the go-to RTC model.
And for a future 100% CUF-mandated project, a RE-plus-BESS model would be the key to the most economical and assured supply of firm power.
India also should explore options beyond physical aggregation of generation resources and storage technologies. Among other options, it could adopt suitable system-friendly power supply models practised in other countries, such as virtual power systems. In parallel, India’s renewables industry also needs to focus on the indigenisation of value chains linked to solar photovoltaics and lithium batteries as a means of enhancing the cost-effectiveness of future “pure RTC” power supply projects.

“This will be India’s first green hydrogen-based energy storage project. It would be a precursor to large-scale hydrogen energy storage projects and would be useful for studying and deploying multiple microgrids in various off-grid and strategic locations of the country,” stated NTPC. 
The hydrogen would be produced using the advanced 240 kW solid oxide electrolyzer by taking input power from a floating solar PV project on the reservoir of Simhadri thermal station. The hydrogen produced during sunshine hours would be stored at high pressure and electrified using a 50 kW solid oxide fuel cell. The system would work in a standalone mode from 5 PM to 7 AM. 
The project configuration is designed in-house by NTPC. This unique project for India would open doors for decarbonizing the far-off regions of the country like Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), etc., hitherto dependent on costly and polluting diesel-based energy generator systems. 
The project is in-line with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for making India carbon neutral by 2070 and making Ladakh a carbon-neutral territory.

Toronto-based Hydrogen Optimized, a subsidiary of Key DH Technologies, said it has demonstrated the capability of its patent-pending RuggedCell high-current unipolar electrolysis system to ramp from 0 to 50,000 amperes in less than 10 seconds. “This breakthrough shows that RuggedCell technology can be used to stabilize electrical grids and optimize energy recovery from intermittent renewable power sources such as solar and wind,” the company wrote on Wednesday, referring to its alkaline water electrolyzers. “To this point, the consensus among Green Hydrogen experts worldwide has been that only PEM water electrolysers could rapidly absorb and shed electricity and thereby be used to stabilize variable electric power sources. We have now proven that RuggedCell alkaline technology, which is uniquely scalable to individual system deployments in the hundreds of megawatts, equals or betters PEM technology’s capability to handle variable power levels,” commented Hydrogen Optimized CEO Andrew Stuart. According to the company, the technology is a significant development away from low-current, low-power bipolar alkaline technology in the market. “These systems are inherently limited in their range of power variability and take several minutes or more to ramp up and down. Furthermore, like PEM technology, individual bipolar alkaline modules are limited to smaller scale output.”
French multinational utility company Engie and UAE-government-owned renewable energy company Masdar signed a strategic alliance agreement last week to explore the co-development of a UAE-based green hydrogen hub. “The two companies are looking to develop projects with a capacity of at least 2 GW by 2030, with a total investment in the region of US$5 billion,” reads the press release. The two companies will initially target local markets. They aim to expand capacity to create a giga-scale green hydrogen hub for the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). In September, Masdar, also known as the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company, teamed up with Abu Dhabi Nation.
Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries and German energy company RWE are planning to install a hydrogen-fueled gas turbine based on renewable green hydrogen in Lingen, Germany. “At the site of its gas-fired power plant in Lingen, RWE intends to generate green hydrogen with electrolysers powered by renewable electricity. The company is planning to build a first 100-MW electrolysis plant in Lingen by 2024, which is to be expanded to 2 GW by the end of the decade,” the two companies wrote on Wednesday. Kawasaki wrote that it has developed two different types of combustion systems to achieve 100% hydrogen operation. “One is a diffusion flame, the other a Dry-Low-Emission (DLE) combustor. In the beginning, the diffusion flame combustor will be used for the H2GT- Lingen project. The diffusion flame combustor will use water injection to achieve low emissions. In a subsequent phase, the installed diffusion flame combustor will be replaced by a Micro-Mix DLE combustor (MMX-combustor).” In its group vision, Kawasaki wrote that it aims to achieve “standalone carbon neutrality in 2030 through independent initiatives centered on hydrogen power generation.” Kawasaki wants to transport 225,000 tonnes of liquefied hydrogen from abroad to Japan in 2030.
German engineering conglomerate ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions and Australian listed minerals company Infinity Lithium are collaborating to test out the feasibility of green hydrogen to power the lithium chemical conversion process. “The Memorandum of Understanding highlights the intention of both parties to apply technological advancements for green hydrogen energy applications for pyrometallurgical equipment relevant to lithium chemical conversion processes. The advancements have the potential to be integrated into both the San José Lithium Project and the Infinity GreenTech novel lithium hydrometallurgical conversion processes,” reads a press release published on Monday. The San José is located in the Extremadura region of Spain. “This global first application to an integrated lithium project will see pilot scale activities using the new tk BU Mining Hydrogen Burner installation in Germany to assess San José feedstock and the use of green hydrogen to power a rotary kiln.”
British gas distribution company SGN, Macquarie’s Green Investment Group (GIG), and ExxonMobil affiliate Esso Petroleum have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore the use of hydrogen and carbon capture to help reduce emissions in the Southampton industrial cluster. “An initial feasibility study by SGN and GIG shows the annual hydrogen demand from the cluster, which is home to ExxonMobil’s Fawley complex, could rise to as much as 37 TWh by 2050, including the heating demand of 800,000 homes across the South of England,” wrote ExxonMobil on Wednesday. The feasibility study estimated that carbon capture facilities could initially capture approximately 2 million tonnes of CO2 per year, including from initial hydrogen production of around 4.3 TWh of hydrogen per year.
The government of South Australia, Swiss multinational commodity trading company Trafigura, and Euronext-listed multi-metals business Nyrstar, announced a joint investment to construct a commercial-scale green hydrogen manufacturing facility in Port Pirie, a regional city north of Adelaide. “The AU$5 million Front End Engineering Design study for the Port Pirie Green Hydrogen Project, jointly funded by Trafigura and the South Australian State Government, will commence immediately, with a final investment decision to be made by the end of 2022. If approved, construction will commence in 2023,” Trafigura wrote on Thursday. The AU$750 million project, if approved, would initially produce 20 tonnes per day (tpd) of green hydrogen for export in the form of green ammonia. The full-scale plant should produce 100tpd of green hydrogen at full capacity from a 440MW electrolyzer. At that stage, the project would target both the export and domestic markets. The oxygen produced would be utilized by the Nyrstar Port Pirie smelter. Nyrstar said that the Port Pirie Green Hydrogen Project would enable its business to take a significant step in improving its competitiveness in the international market for zinc, lead, and other metals. Trafigura said it would source 100% renewable energy.
The hydrogen hype is helping green hydrogen to become cost-competitive in the long run, wrote consultancy group Wood Mackenzie in its “Hydrogen costs 2021: getting ready to scale”, adding that the fall in electrolyzer prices will allow green hydrogen to “be competitive in 12 markets – those with the highest utilization rates and lowest renewable electricity prices – by 2030.” Bridget van Dorsten, a research analyst on Wood Mackenzie’s hydrogen research team, explained that Brazil and Chile are amongst the front-runners of harnessing cheap renewables to produce green hydrogen off-grid. “By 2050, 20 of the 24 countries in our analysis see very competitive green hydrogen costs,” she said. The analysis includes Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. Wood Mackenzie expects a significant drop in electrolyzer CAPEX by 2025. Costs are being driven down by economies of scale, new entrants to the market, greater automation, and increased modularity. Van Dorsten argued that cost drivers differ for different electrolyzer types. “Reductions for solid oxide electrolysers are set to be the most dramatic in the next six to eight years; but alkaline and polymer electrolyser membrane costs are forecast to fall between 35% and 50% by 2025.” Van Dorsten also noted that the global estimated electrolyzer manufacturing capacity was just 200 MW in 2019, but with 1.3 GW additional capacity in Q1 2021, it now stands at around 6.3 GW.
The “first” independent and voluntary hydrogen coalition was launched on Thursday by a group of scientists, academics, and engineers based in the U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands. “Policy-makers in the UK and EU are placing big bets on hydrogen’s role in the energy transition. While hydrogen has an important part to play, we’re concerned that an over-reliance on hydrogen will delay existing, cheaper and scalable solutions like electrification” said David Cebon, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, University of Cambridge, England. Members of the coalition aim to bring “concrete evidence back into the hydrogen debate, free from industry bias.” This will primarily be through briefings, access to data, and media events.

German engineering association the VDMA (Verbandes Deutsches Maschinenbau Anlage) recorded a higher order intake and a slight increase in sales in the third quarter of 2021. Compared to the previous quarter, new orders rose by around 40% and sales by approximately 9% and, compared to the third quarter of 2020, revenue climbed by 20%.
The ratio of orders to sales was two-to-one for the second quarter in a row, the association stated. “The growing orders in the field of photovoltaic production equipment and plant construction point in the right direction. In comparison to the previous year in particular, there is a clear growth and a new dynamic,” explained Jutta Trube, head of VDMA photovoltaic production equipment.
According to the new figures, PV equipment suppliers would be in line with the trend registered for general mechanical engineering in Germany, which recorded a double-digit increase in orders in October.
New orders for the German PV suppliers come mainly from China. For the first time this year, China’s share was 80%. By contrast, orders from Germany fell below 10% in the third quarter and orders from North America were also lower than in the previous quarters. Nevertheless, German companies also see new market opportunities outside of Asia. The forecasts for the current quarter, however, remain rather cautious, which is due to the existing delivery bottlenecks and the ongoing uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which could drag on well into next year.
“Despite the positive developments in incoming orders, the equipment and system manufacturers are confronted with the uncertainties of the global pandemic situation and the tense situation on the procurement market. A relaxation is expected in the second and third quarter[s] of 2022,” explained Peter Fath, managing director of RCT Solutions GmbH and chairman of the board of directors of VDMA photovoltaic production equipment. The challenge for the German suppliers is to “deal with the bottlenecks and uncertainties in a precise manner.” Nevertheless, Fath rates the general development of projects for photovoltaic production worldwide as good.
