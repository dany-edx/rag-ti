GEAPP’s mission is to help catalyze a just energy transition by mobilizing public and private capital.
With the funding, ISA will strengthen its programs, build capacities in the least developed countries and small island developing states (SIDs), and bolster its analytics and advocacy efforts.
ISA has been engaging with GEAPP since Glasgow COP 26, as part of its ongoing mission to solarise the world by 2030. Through this partnership, ISA will support its 110 member and signatory countries in developing a vibrant solar energy ecosystem and creating a viable and bankable solar energy project pipeline, building capacities, mitigating risks, creating innovative financing instruments, mobilizing investments, and promoting technologies.
“In all of ISA’s activities, risk reduction is the unifying theme: whether it is for the reduction of risk to investors or reduction in policy risk due to new policies or users due to vulnerabilities of international fuel prices and to climate impacts. Through initiatives progressing from this partnership, we hope to cut these risks and ease solar deployment globally,” said Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General of International Solar Alliance.
Simon Harford, CEO of GEAPP, said: “Energy-poor countries represent about half of the global population. Yet only six percent of all solar PV and wind deployed in 2021 went to these countries. In fact, only one percent of all wind and solar capacity ever deployed has been installed in Africa. This is a trend GEAPP is determined to reverse. We are proud to work with partners such as the ISA to deliver clean energy solutions in cooperation with the government, helping tackle climate change and powering more equitable economic growth and sustainable livelihoods.”
The ISA-GEAPP partnership also covers the exchange of information and best practices, quality assurance of solar products, steps to advance training to strengthen capacities in the technological and financial deployment of solar, building awareness for solar energy, and further deploying innovative technologies.
Headquartered in India, the International Solar Alliance works with governments to improve energy access and security worldwide and promote solar power as a sustainable way to transition to a carbon-neutral future. It aims to unlock $1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030 while reducing the technology and financing costs. It promotes the use of solar energy in the agriculture, health, transport, and power generation sectors.

The modules are built with 120 half-cut cells based on an M10 wafer and offer a power conversion efficiency of up to 21.28%.
The company said its 450 Wp M10 modules are particularly suited for rooftop solar installations. The modules are compact in size and lightweight and therefore easier to handle and carry on the stairs. This also results in reduced breakage.
The modules save on module mounting structure costs too as they require only two purlins to install compared to the standard four purlins for higher-wattage M10 modules, stated Gautam Solar.
Each module has dimensions of 1,923 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm and is packed with a power density of 206.4 W/m2. The modules incorporate multi-busbar technology for reduced internal resistance losses and round ribbons for better light utilization.
The modules will be available in both monofacial and bifacial variants, stated Gautam Solar.
Gautam Solar is manufacturing the new modules at its 400 MW factory in the Haridwar district of Uttrakhand.

Solar generation also avoided the need for 19.4 million tonnes of coal that would have further stressed an already strained domestic supply, according to a new report.
The report was jointly developed by Ember, CREA, and IEEFA. It explores the growth of solar power in seven key Asian countries, the potential for future growth, and the avoided fossil fuel costs due to solar electricity generation between January and June 2022.
The report states solar generation in seven key Asian countries together (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Thailand) avoided potential fossil fuel costs of approximately $34 billion from January to June 2022. This is equivalent to 9% of total fossil fuel costs during this period.
The majority of the estimated $34 billion savings were in China, where solar met 5% of the total electricity demand and avoided approximately $21 billion in additional coal and gas imports from January to June 2022.
Japan saw the second-highest impact, with $5.6 billion in avoided fuel costs.
The analysis shows that in the wake of soaring fossil fuel prices, solar power is already contributing to meeting electricity demand in Asia and enhancing energy security.
“In the last few months, reliance on imports of coal and gas has proven to be expensive and unreliable. Transitioning to renewable energy such as solar can help reduce the overall system costs and also reduce the burden on consumers by lowering tariffs. For energy security and economic reasons, it makes sense for India and the rest of Asia to redirect investments towards building the renewable energy ecosystem,” said Vibhuti Garg, director-South Asia at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
The report also analyzed the growth of solar power over the last decade, finding that five of the top ten countries with the largest solar capacities are now within Asia, including China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Viet Nam.
India has seen incredible growth, increasing its solar capacity from 0.07 GW in 2010 to 50 GW in 2021.
Ember’s Asia Electricity Analyst Dr Achmed Shahram Edianto said, “Asian countries have shown that rapid solar deployment is possible, setting a remarkable example and providing valuable lessons learned for their peers in the region. As the prices of solar and storage plummet, and the potential cost savings have started to materialize, solar dominance in Asia now looks to come much sooner than previously expected.”
The report authors estimate solar power capacity in China, India, the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia to grow at an average annual rate of 22% between 2021 and 2030, based on the existing national targets of these economies.
CREA’s Southeast Asia Analyst Isabella Suarez said, “The potential savings from existing solar alone are enormous, and expediting their deployment alongside other clean energy sources such as wind, will be crucial for energy security in the region. While ambitious targets are important, follow through will be the key thing to watch moving forward.”

Renewable energy corporate PPAs in the Asia-Pacific region are set to reach a record 7 GW of capacity in 2022, according to a new report by energy research company Wood Mackenzie. That corresponds to an 80% increase on 2021. In the second half of 2022, corporate renewables procurement is on pace to increase by about 4 GW.
Solar dominates renewable corporate PPAs in the region, accounting for 57% of contracts.
“However, wind has been catching up since 2020 and accounted for 44% of new contracts in the region in the first half of 2022,” the report says.
In Australia, solar and wind account for 45% and 43% of PPA contracts, respectively. Solar dominates in India, with 82% of contracts. Wind – particularly offshore wind – accounts for 89% of total capacity in Taiwan.
“For the remaining countries in southeast and east Asia, solar accounts for nearly all contracted capacity,” said Wood Mackenzie.
As of the first half of 2022, India, Australia, and Taiwan were the top three markets in the Asia-Pacific region’s cumulative corporate PPA procurement capacity, accounting for 89% of the total, or 18.6 GW. India leads the charge, with 8.1 GW. Australia has 5.2 GW, while Taiwan has 3.2 GW.
Other countries account for the remaining 2 GW of contracted capacity, with Singapore, China, and Thailand completing the top six. South Korea, Cambodia, and Pakistan contracted the least capacity in the first half of 2022.
“In most Southeast Asian countries, including Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and the Philippines, PPAs are rooftop solar projects,” the report explains. “These are of limited size, reducing their contribution to capacity.”
The top developers in Asia’s corporate PPA market are Amp Energy, Amplus Solar, and Cleantech Solar. They have the vast majority of their capacity in India, according to the report. Most developers in the region are domestic and regional players. The key clients for PPAs are large energy users in the industrial, retail, and technology sectors.
“In Australia, companies including BHP and Newcrest use PPAs to power their mining operations,” says the report. “Other big users include supermarket chains and telecoms providers who use renewables to power their data centers.”
The Asia-Pacific region’s renewable corporate PPA capacity accounts for 15% of the global PPA market. The main barrier for further growth in corporate PPAs in the region is lack of regulation permitting large-scale procurement of renewables, according to Wood Mackenzie.
“Countries including South Korea, Japan, and China are all gradually easing regulations surrounding offsite corporate PPAs, which should open up opportunities in the coming years,” it says. “However, we expect Australia, India, and Taiwan to continue to lead future growth.”

France’s VSB Energies Nouvelles has started building a 9 MW solar power plant on a former gravel and sand pit, clay and kaolin extraction site in Druelle Balsac, southern France.
The project was originally supposed to have a capacity of just 5 MW.
“The project participated in a tender held by the CRE in 2016,” Jérémie Baccar, PV development manager for VSB Energies Nouvelles, told pv magazine France. “Then, during the development phase between 2016 and 2021, technological developments allowed us to almost double the installed power of the park, without changing the surface area.”
He said that about 30% of this increase resulted from the evolution of the solar modules, which reached higher power outputs.
“The Soleil de Balsac project was initially planned to have around 26,500 modules with each a power of 300 W,” said Baccar. “In its final configuration, it will have approximately 40,000 modules with each an output of 550 W, which will be provided by Chinese manufacturer GCL.”
In its final configuration, the project also benefited from its optimized layout and the inter-row spacing of the modules – a densification that facilitated a power gain of 55%.
“Important work has been carried out by our development teams to find the optimum between the shading resulting from the bringing together of the modules due to narrower rows and the gain in production obtained thanks to the increase in the number of panels on the park,” said Baccar.
VSB currently has 2 GW of solar under development. Its projects include floating arrays, agrivoltaic installations, PV carports, and large rooftop solar projects.
