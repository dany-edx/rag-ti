The park will consist of three projects of 300 MW each and one of 900 MW. The entire project, purportedly the largest in the country, is estimated to be worth INR 9,140 crore ($1,118 million). 
The solar park will provide plug-and-play infra for developers to set up C&I and utility-scale projects.
Rays Power Infra has a commissioned portfolio of 1.30 GWp. It has initiated the development and execution of solar parks and solar plants aggregating to 2 GWp with expected commissioning in the next 24 months. It is developing large-scale solar parks in Rajasthan.
The company has a global presence having installed large-scale solar projects in Vietnam and Bangladesh.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/31/india-surpassed-one-million-ev-sales-in-2022/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION CELLS,MARKETS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 31, 2023",India surpassed one million EV sales in 2022,"EV sales in India touched 10,75,859 units in 2022, 212% up from 3,45,067 units sold in 2021. This stupendous growth was led by states of Uttar Pradesh (15.2%), Maharashtra (12.7%), and Karnataka (8.8%), according to a new report by JMK Research.
High-speed electric two-wheelers (E2Ws) accounted for the largest share (63%) with sales of 6,81,336 units. This segment recorded a 297% increase in sales y-o-y. Electric three-wheelers – passenger (E3W-P) constituted 28% with 3,05,889 units sold in 2022. Electric four-wheelers (E4Ws) registered sales of 50,305 units, which implies a 236% increase in sales over 2021.

The report attributes the domestic EV industry’s sales growth to an increase in the availability of products in the market, high prices of conventional fuels (petrol, diesel and CNG), and state subsidies and incentives offered under the FAME-II scheme. “The growing consumer awareness about the need to use eco-friendly transport is also helping to drive the sales. The prompt action taken by the government, to implement safety standards for EVs after the fire-related incidents last year, has been another reason that has increased confidence of apprehensive customers again in EVs,” it added.
The report stated 23 states in India and three union territories (UTs) have rolled out EV-friendly policies. Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Haryana, and Ladakh introduced their EV policies in 2022. In addition, 4 states and one UT also came up with a revised EV policy in 2022 with additional incentives.
The introduction of PLI scheme for advanced chemistry cells has instilled confidence among manufacturers that sooner or later India will be a hub of EV components including batteries and hence their import dependency may reduce, stated the report.

Ltd (THDC) and Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corp. Ltd (RRECL) have agreed to form a joint venture with a shareholding of 74:26, respectively, to set up 1.8 GW of renewable energy projects in Rajasthan. RRECL is the nodal agency for promoting and developing non-conventional energy sources in Rajasthan. It signed a joint venture cum share-holding agreement with THDCIL for RE development recently.
The JV will set up 10 GW of RE projects with an estimated investment of INR 40,000 crore ($4,883 million). The projects will provide employment to around 10,000 people. The JV will develop RE projects in different locations of Rajasthan, in a phased manner. In the first phase, it will build 2 GW of solar parks by 2025.
The JV partners also plan the development of floating solar and pumped hydro storage projects in the state.

With 1,000 tpd capacity, it can supply solar glass for 6 GW of solar module production per annum.
“The trial production from our SG-3 solar glass furnace with the capacity of 550 tpd commenced on January 26, 2023, in its first rolling line. The trial production from the second rolling line also commenced today, i.e., January 27, 2023,” stated the company in a stock exchange filing. 
Borosil Renewables’ other two furnaces in India, located in Bharuch, Gujarat, have production capacities of 240 tpd and 210 tpd, respectively.
The manufacturer now has a cumulative solar glass capacity of 1,300 tpd in India and Germany, which includes 300 tpd in Germany added through the acquisition of Europe’s largest solar glass manufacturer Interfloat Group.

Spain’s Abora Solar has launched new PVT products with overall efficiencies of around 89%. The aH72SK modules combine solar panels with power conversion efficiencies of 17.8% and a thermal efficiency rating of around 70%. ”
With this new product, we achieved a certified world record,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. 
The modules measure 1,970 mm x 995 mm x 107 mm and weigh 50 kg.
“The modules must be installed by at least two persons,” said the spokesperson.
The monocrystalline PERC photovoltaic modules have power outputs of 350 W, an open-circuit voltage of 48.82 V, and a short-circuit current of 9.73 A. Their temperature coefficient is -0.33% per degree Celsius and they can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V.
The PV panels feature 72 solar cells measuring 156 mm x 156 mm, with a total area spanning 1.96 square meters. The thermal panels have an optical yield of 0.7 and a flow rate of 60 L. 
The company is offering the panels with its aHMonitor monitoring system, which allows system owners and installers to visualize information such as CO2 emissions. The Zaragoza-based photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panel manufacturer said that depending on the size and type of project, the new modules can ensure an investment return of around four years.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/31/china-mulling-restrictions-on-polysilicon-wafer-exports/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JANUARY 31, 2023","China mulling restrictions on polysilicon, wafer exports","From pv magazine Global
China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) have announced that they plan to revise the country’s Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted for Export.
In a joint statement, the two ministries said that three technologies related to the PV manufacturing industry could be included in the catalog – wafers, black silicon, and ingot casting.  If the three categories are added to the restrictions list, manufacturers will need technology export licenses from the respective provincial departments to export such products.
China accounted for more than 98% of global wafer production for the solar industry in 2021, according to reports from the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA). Although the plan is still in a phase of public consultation, this attempt shows the country’s efforts to protect its most advanced solar technology and maintain the competitiveness of its solar industry.
“Such technology-related export restrictions are nothing new,” Frank Haugwitz, senior adviser of Apricum Cleantech Advisory, told pv magazine. “The last version of this list was published in August 2020 but it took a good two years to come into effect after the consultation process was completed.”
Haugwitz said the intention is clear – China plans to keep its lead in this part of the value chain.
“At the same time, if you take into account the years of significant investment in wafer R&D, this may not be surprising,” said Haugwitz. “On the one hand, it affects plant manufacturers, but also producers who may be considering setting up wafer production in other regions. In other words, such a technology transfer abroad would also be subject to such restrictions.”
