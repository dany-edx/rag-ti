https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/08/making-india-a-manufacturing-hub-for-solar-based-decentralized-energy-products%e2%80%a8/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MAKE IN INDIA,MARKETS,OFF-GRID SOLAR,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOLAR PUMPS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2022","Making India a manufacturing hub for solar-based, decentralized energy products","A new report by GOGLA says India has the potential to become a hub for the assembly and manufacturing of decentralized renewable energy (DRE) products for the global market. The demand for solar DRE products is thriving in Africa, South Asia, and East Asia. India, which ranks second in the world for its attractiveness as a manufacturing hub, has the opportunity to cater to this demand.
The report covers solar lanterns, solar home lighting system, solar streetlights, solar water pumps, and solar-powered DC fans.
Making the case for scaling up local manufacturing, the report highlights products made in India are increasingly being favored in the international market [for their quality] over the products from conventional suppliers. These are also cost-competitive with that of products manufactured in other countries. While India’s key manufacturing costs for land and electricity are higher than in China, it offers the advantage of up to 175.5% lower labor costs than China.
The national and international demand together may be able to solve the challenge of economies of scale that has been often cited as a challenge to cost reduction by manufacturers in India.
Potential areas
India lacks the production of base components (like semiconductor wafers and ingots required for solar panels) due to the unavailability of raw materials. Given that, the report highlights the assembly of intermediary components and finished products provides the largest opportunity for manufacturing in India. Intermediary components include solar panels, luminaires, charge controllers, and batteries. Finished products include solar lanterns, streetlights, and solar fans.
Further, the rising cost of freight and longer lead times make India a more attractive market for local manufacturing of these products. 
Freight charges have increased by five to eight times from 2019-20 to 2021-22. This has increased the cost of imported products and reduced vendor margins. For example, the increase in freight costs resulted in a $16/kW increase in the price of solar modules imported to India during this period.
The report says India can become more competitive with China in manufacturing solar and solar DRE products by addressing the higher cost of land and achieving favorable economies of scale. 
In 2021, China’s solar module manufacturing capacity was around 500 GW, compared to 15 GW in India. The Indian government can help increase the scale of DRE manufacturing with measures to drive up local demand and export DRE products and parts to other countries. Further, DR manufacturers can be provided land at subsidized costs and/or land in special economic zones.
“While the local manufacture of most base components for solar cells in India is a long-term ambition due to the lack of raw materials, the potential to increase the direct import of base components to expand the manufacture of solar cells and modules is more feasible,” says the report. 
Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are an essential component of most solar DRE products.
The expected growth in the manufacture of li-ion batteries in India due to the development of the EV market could benefit the manufacture of Li-ion batteries for the assembly of DRE products. Further research is needed to explore specific actions that could enhance the local production of li-ion batteries for the assembly of DRE products.
The report also analyses the policy environment for manufacturing DRE products in India and makes recommendations to maximize available opportunities. It highlights challenges such as lack of incentives, low-cost financing, and R&D support to improve the cost competitiveness of Indian DRE manufacturers, among others. Gaps also exist in skills and standards enforcement.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/08/hydraulic-robotic-cleaning-solutions-for-ground-mounted-solar-plants/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROBOTIC CLEANERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2022",Hydraulic robotic cleaning solutions for ground-mounted solar plants,"From pv magazine Global
AX Solar Robot, a French PV cleaning specialist, is offering two new hydraulic-powered solutions for ground-mounted solar installations.
“The technology behind them is 100% mechanical and hydraulic. You have to pressurize the water with a pump, which allows our customers to stay in operation all day long without interchanging the batteries, as you have to do with the other robotic solutions offered on the market,” Grégoire Demeestere, responsible for development at AX Solar Robot, told pv magazine. “Because it is a 100% mechanical solution, the maintenance and support are clearly facilitated.”
The WetSlider, which was first launched at Intersolar Europe in October 2021, is a 1P tracker dedicated cleaner. With a tilt capacity of +/- 50 degrees, the company claims there is no need to interrupt the tracking during cleaning. Its traction wheels can be manually adjusted to the exact dimension of the solar modules’ frames, fitting modules with total height from 1.570 mm to 2,130 mm.
The robot measures 2,610 mm x 725 mm x 335 mm for a 2150 mm brush, and weighs in at 51 kg. Its hydraulic motor works at a minimum 60 bar pressure and consumes 0.25 liters of water per square meter at a standard cleaning speed of 18.85 meters per minute.
“An efficient cleaning can be provided on rows up to 450 m length, and with two robots working in parallel on the same pump,” the company said. “This represents a cleaning capacity of up to 3 MW per day, with no battery limitation, allowing around-the-clock operations.”
The WetSlider XL completes the offering range of the company, as it allows for the cleaning of tables with lengths of up to 6.5 meters. Its patent-pending architecture brings a vertical translation capability for the brush system along the tables. The product will be available in the market by the end of 2022, according to the company.
“This solution brings more flexibility thanks to a unique double adaptation,” said Demeestere. “You can adapt the robot to the size of the panel, and you can adapt a second sliding frame to the size of the table. So, one single tool can be used to serve multiple PV operations with the same brush size, while avoiding terrain degradation and simplifying he logistics considerations compared to vehicle-mounted systems.”
Both versions of the robot are manufactured by the company in Lille, France, and are distributed throughout the world. AX Solar Robot is also the sole distributor in France of the new hyCLEANER solarROBOT, which was developed by Germany’s TG hyLIFT. The battery-powered modular cleaning solution comes with an auto-drive function and a steering assist system. It is suitable for rooftop, carport, ground mounted, and floating installations.
The robot measures 575 mm x 685 mm x 270 mm. It can be used on slopes of 0 degrees to 45 degrees. The solution has a cleaning capacity of 1.100 square meters per hour to 2.400 square meters per hour, and is powered by a 36 V ion battery, to a maximum of 42 V.
