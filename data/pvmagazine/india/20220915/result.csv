It launched the first of these EV chargers for the four-wheeler and two-wheeler segments in Bengaluru, Karnataka, today. India is the first market where Shell is launching chargers for two-wheelers. The power supplied at the Shell Recharge chargers is 100% green. 
Initially, Shell will set up charging stations in Bengaluru across its fuel stations in Yeshwantpur, Marathalli, Old Madras Road, Brookefield, and Kanakpura. The company plans to expand its EV charging infrastructure beyond its existing retail markets of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telangana, Assam, and Andhra Pradesh. 
Shell will provide customized charging solutions at on-the-go locations such as Shell fuel stations, standalone EV hubs, home charging, and destination locations. For on-the-go and standalone EV hubs, the company will deploy 100 kW and above direct-current (DC) fast chargers to enable fast charging and the lowest possible dwell time.
Customers can operate these chargers through the Shell Recharge India app, available on Android and iOS operating systems. The app allows customers to locate the nearest available charger, pick a charging method (by unit, time or percentage), and then make quick payments. 
Customers can also view the EV charging status on a real-time basis.
Shell is one of the most diversified international energy companies in India with over 10,000 employees and presence across upstream, integrated gas, downstream, renewable energy, and deep capabilities in R&D, digitalization, and business operations. It has a retail presence across six states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Assam) and is expanding its network of fuel stations across the country.

Mindtree built the state-of-the-art solution using its Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics platform Insights NxT. The solution enables remote monitoring and control of all services at the plant to help optimize operational and energy costs and drive effective utilization of resources such as solar energy and battery energy storage systems.
The solution is equipped with preventive and predictive data analytics capabilities to provide real-time insights into plant performance and support data-driven decision-making. This will help reduce the plant’s carbon footprint and improve operational agility by increasing electrolyzer efficiency and reducing downtime.
“We are committed to providing innovative and sustainable solutions to meet the energy needs of tomorrow while reducing our environmental impact,” said Derek M. Shah, senior vice president and head of green manufacturing and development at L&T. “At our heavy engineering unit in Hazira, we use natural gas for welding and heat treatment operations. The solution developed by Mindtree will help us effectively reduce the plant’s carbon footprint by mixing green hydrogen with natural gas, facilitating swifter adoption of cleaner fuel and alternative energy sources.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/15/sjvn-awards-100-mw-solar-project-to-tata-power/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",SJVN awards 100 MW solar project to Tata Power,"Tata Power today announced that its EPC arm, Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd., has received a “letter of award” to set up a 100 MW ground-mounted solar project for state-owned hydropower producer SJVN.
Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd. will build the project at the Raghanesda solar park in Gujarat, with an estimated investment of INR 612 crore. It won the project through tariff-based competitive bidding. It is scheduled for commissioning within 11 months from the award of contract.
SJVN is a joint venture between the government of India and the state government of Himachal Pradesh. The company, which has a core strength in hydropower projects, is looking to expand its wind and solar energy project portfolio as it aims to reach 5 GW by 2023, 12 GW by 2030, and 25 GW by 2040.
Tata Power Solar Systems has commissioned several large-scale, ground-mounted solar projects in the country. With this win, its total ground-mount utility-scale portfolio will touch 9.9 GWp. To date, its total order book stands at INR 15,520 crore.
Tata Power Solar Systems also has more than 1.2 GW of rooftop PV and distributed-generation projects across the country, in addition to more than 76,000 solar water pumps installations. It is also one of the largest solar manufacturers in India, operating a manufacturing unit in Bengaluru with a production capacity of 635 MW of modules and 500 MW of cells.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/15/husk-power-systems-secures-6-million-from-eu-funded-edfi-electrifi/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,SOLAR PANEL CLEANING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",Husk Power Systems secures $6 million from EU-funded EDFI ElectriFI,"Husk Power Systems, which operates the largest fleet of solar-hybrid microgrids in rural Asia and Africa, said this week that it has secured $6 million of new debt financing from the EU-funded impact investor Electrification Financing Initiative (EDFI ElectriFI).
EDFI ElectriFI invests in early-stage companies and projects in the energy access sector. The long-term, low-cost debt financing to Husk is one of the largest investments in the microgrid industry by EDFI ElectriFI.
Husk said it would use the $6 million funding to electrify 80 additional communities in India with solar microgrids, offsetting more than 11,000 tonnes of CO2 by displacing a significant number of diesel generators. These 80 microgrids will benefit an estimated 60,000 people and connect nearly 10,000 new customers. It will allow Husk to double its customer base of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), which drive rural economic activity but still rely heavily on polluting and expensive diesel generation.
This investment complements Husk’s largest-ever local-currency debt financing in the microgrid industry from the India Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), raised earlier this year. Husk raised this debt, amounting to INR 310 million ($4.2 million), also for India.
Husk Power already has about 150 net-zero microgrids in operation in India. It is also present in Nigeria and plans to expand further in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Manoj Sinha, co-founder and CEO of Husk Power, said, “The EDFI ElectriFI debt will enable Husk to become EBITDA positive before the end of 2022…More importantly, we will achieve a net zero, broad-based economic impact on businesses and households in rural India and help MSMEs double their income through reduced energy costs.”

The two companies recently signed a power purchase agreement for the power generated from the plant. 
Tata Motors’ Pune plant has 15 MWp of solar capacity already deployed at its passenger and commercial manufacturing facility, generating 21 million kWh of renewable electricity. Over the next few years, the company plans to expand the solar capacity of its Pune plant to meet the growing demand for renewable energy.
The 4 MWp installation is expected to generate 5.8 million units (kWh) of electricity, potentially mitigating over 10 lakh tons of carbon emissions. This is equivalent to planting more than 1.6 million teak trees over a lifetime, the group said.
