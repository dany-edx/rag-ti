https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/22/wind-solar-storage-hybrid-offers-cheaper-electricity-than-new-coal/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 22, 2021",Wind-solar-storage hybrid offers cheaper electricity than new coal,"A new report demonstrates renewables coupled with battery storage as a technically and financially viable option to building new coal plants in Tamil Nadu.  
The report finds the levelized cost of electricity generation for a hypothetical hybrid solar-wind-lithium-ion battery storage system for the state to be INR 4.97/kWh in 2021, which falls to INR 3.4/kWh by 2030. In comparison, the cost of electricity produced from new coal power plants in Tamil Nadu is between INR 4.5-6/kWh.
The report was prepared by JMK Research and Climate Trends based on the modeling of such a hybrid system and techno-commercial analysis. For the study, the hybrid system was designed for 1 GW of solar and wind capacity in 2021 with two hours of battery backup, which was increased step-wise over ten years to a four-hour backup by 2030. 
“Our analysis found that the cost of hybrid RE with battery storage system is at parity with new coal power plants in Tamil Nadu. Moreover, in ten years’ time, incremental capacity addition would further drive down the cost by over 31%” said Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research and Analysis. 
The research further highlighted that adding lithium-based battery storage would help reduce the curtailment of renewable energy in the State. 
Close to 50% of solar power generation in Tamil Nadu was curtailed since the lockdown in March 2020. Similarly, its curtailment of wind power in 2019 went up to 3.52 hours per day from 1.87 hours per day in 2018.
Modeling
The analysis tracks the system from an initial capacity of 800MW of solar and 200MW of wind along with 500MWh of storage that would cater to Tami Nadu’s average annual power demand for two hours per day from 2021-23. Its capacity was augmented to three hours of daily backup for 2024-26, and then four hours per day for 2027-30.
The study found that in the last year, the hybrid system would meet 29% of Tamil Nadu’s average annual power demand at a competitive LCOE of INR 3.4/kWh.  
The report considered that Tamil Nadu has five new thermal power projects in its pipeline over the next three years. The Cheyyur ultra mega coal power plant is the biggest of these projects with a tariff of INR 5-6/kWh, which would be 32-43% more expensive than the system modeled in the analysis.
 “Tamil Nadu has got the largest installed renewable energy capacity and it leads India’s energy transition efforts, yet it also has the largest coal power pipeline in the country. Since RE with battery storage works out to be cheaper than coal, perhaps TANGEDCO and other state power generation companies need to reconsider the coal pipeline,” said Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends. 
Also, if this hypothetical, solar- and wind-powered storage system were to wheel all of its energy to Delhi, even after accounting for ISTS charges it could cover 100% of Delhi’s average yearly electricity demand by 2030 at an LCOE of INR 4.4/kWh, the report stated.

The capacities—to be developed in RESCO mode ((capital expenditures covered by the installer)—shall come upon the buildings of different government departments and private institutions.
These capacities have been grouped into different projects as follows: municipal corporations 10,970 kW, municipal councils 6000 kW, public health engineering institutions 2620 kW, MP Jal Nigam 7500 kW, central government institutions 3600 kW, state government institutions 3200 kW, MP power utilities 3000 kW, private institutions/organizations (with site capacity>100 kW) 1630 kW and private institutions/organization (site capacity<100 kW) 750 kW.
Bidding is allowed for a minimum of one project group up to all of the project groups.
The ceiling tariff for each project group is INR 5/kWh.
“The departments have agreed that they will make timely payment of electricity bills to solar power developer and DISCOM. They will also submit payment security to solar power developer to cover any type of future risk to the developer,” reads the tender document.
The work scope includes design, engineering, supply, financing, installation, testing and commissioning, and comprehensive operation and maintenance for 25 operational years.
Only domestically manufactured solar modules are allowed for the projects.

The revised deadline—earlier set as January 15—is February 15.
The SECI had invited bids for the project in July last year, which has seen bidding extensions and amendment since then.
The plant—to be set up in build-own-operate mode—shall come up at Nangal Pond, near village Neilla, in the district Bilaspur. 
The power generated from the project has been provisioned to be sold to the hydropower generator Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB). The BBMB shall sign a power purchase agreement with the successful bidder for a period of 25 years
The maximum levelized tariff payable to the project developer is fixed at INR 3.41/kWh for 25 years.
Bidders must quote a single tariff for the project, which shall be applicable for all 25 years.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/22/woodmac-predicts-30-drop-in-asia-pacific-front-of-meter-battery-costs-by-2025/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,SOUTH KOREA",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 22, 2021",WoodMac predicts 30% drop in Asia-Pacific front-of-meter battery costs by 2025,"From pv magazine International
According to a new report by Wood Mackenzie, front-of-the-meter (FTM) battery storage systems costs in the Asia-Pacific region could decline by more than 30% by 2025, with Australia, China, and South Korea leading the way. 
An acceleration in FTM battery storage systems of this magnitude lends added credence to the 7 GW of storage capacity that analysts from Cornwall Insight Australia say is currently in the pipeline.  Wood Mackenzie’s report argues that battery price reductions, along with improvements in battery density, contributed to a fall in storage system prices that exceeded expectations in 2020. The latter improvements contributed to a lowering of balance-of-system (BOS) costs and other considerations. 
Moreover, a less conspicuous but nonetheless important contributor to the lowering of costs is the streamlining of hardware prices between countries and regions. 
“As batteries are expected to represent shrinking portion of all-in system costs, there will be heightened focus on BOS cost reductions moving forward,” said Wood Mackenzie senior analyst Mitalee Gupta. “Manufacturers will continue to innovate and produce BOS components that help reduce labour costs, and installation crews are implementing more efficient labour practices as they gain more experience on job sites. Competitive markets will drive system efficiencies, product standardisation and cheaper batteries as we progress toward 2025.”
Australia is expected to see costs decline by 34% to US$658/kW in 2025 for a 2-hour duration all-in FTM system. At the end of 2020, that price was US$990/kW. Wood Mackenzie foresees the installation of FTM systems accelerating nationwide. 
The Asia-Pacific region is the world’s largest manufacturer for lithium-ion batteries, says Gupta. This trend is likely to continue “as the region’s storage industry takes off, every component across the value chain will play a role in bringing down system costs. Fire risks and safety standards, tariffs and trade policies, and safe-guarding the supply chain amidst Covid-19 uncertainty are factors that could make or break the industry.”  
Indeed, in recent months we have already witnessed the acceleration of FTM projects in anticipation of continuing price declines. From a 100 MW battery storage facility proposed just this week near Rockhampton, Queensland. Other projects announced just in the first two weeks of 2021 include Origin Energy’s plans for a 700 MW mega-battery in the Hunter region of New South Wales, as well as Neoen’s 500 MW battery planned west of Sydney. Australia’s largest power producer, AGL, also remains on track to add at least 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to its portfolio by 2024.
