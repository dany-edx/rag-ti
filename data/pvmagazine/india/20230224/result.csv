https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/24/husk-power-surpasses-200-minigrids-across-asia-and-africa/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MINIGRID,AFRICA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",Husk Power surpasses 200 minigrids across Asia and Africa,"Husk Power announced this week it has become the first company to own and operate more than 200 community solar minigrids in Asia and Africa. It also averaged a rollout of 16 minigrids per month.
The two achievements follow closely on Husk’s announcement in January 2023 of being the first minigrid company to achieve corporate profitability.
Husk expects to double its portfolio to 400 minigrids by the end of 2023. “At the same time, Husk’s excellence and know-how in project deployment is being transferred to its operations in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, where the company already has 12 sites in operation, with plans for up to 100 by 2023 and 500 by 2026,” stated the company.
In 2022, Husk became the first and only minigrid company to sign a UN Energy Compact, which included a commitment to building 5,000 minigrids by 2030 and displacing 700 million gallons of fuel for diesel generators, which currently dominate economies in Asia and Africa.
According to a Minigrid Industry Roadmap released in 2022, the rate of deployment “may be the most daunting challenge” for the industry, noting that 10 companies with 10 times the current maximum rate of deployment are needed to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) – access to modern, affordable, clean, reliable energy for all.
Since 2019, Husk has raised $40 million ($25 million in equity and $15 million in low-cost, long-term debt) and grew 10X despite being hit by Covid and other global market disruptions.

This factory will manufacture primary and secondary GIS. It will serve customers across various industries including power distribution, smart cities, data centers, transport (metro, railways), tunnels, ports, highways, and other infrastructural developments.
“Spread over 78,000 sq. ft., the new site is equipped with smart and lean manufacturing capabilities. It deploys advanced robotics for manufacturing which connects people, processes, and assets, and is capable of relaying real-time data for enhanced productivity. Developed as per the norms set by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), this green factory building optimizes the use of water and energy,” stated ABB.
“The factory uses carefully selected materials to minimize the life cycle environmental impacts. In line with ABB’s Sustainability Strategy 2030 targets, it has also realized its RE100 (100% renewable electricity) commitment to achieve low carbon operations,” it added.
Present in Nashik across three locations since 1978, ABB India has been manufacturing a wide range of electrical distribution products and solutions, catering to the increasing domestic and export demands from over 100 countries.

The 12-meter low-floor bus has a customizable seating capacity of 32 to 49 passengers plus one driver seat. It can travel up to 400 km on a single hydrogen fill. Hydrogen fill for this range coverage takes just about 15 minutes. 
“Regarding emissions, these buses generate only water as tailpipe emissions. This is the main unique selling proposition for phasing out old diesel and petrol systems and replacing them with these green buses,” stated Olectra. 
Type-4 hydrogen cylinders are established on the top of the bus. These cylinders can withstand temperatures between -20 and +85 degrees Celsius. 
Olectra aims to launch these buses within a year commercially.

A US-Canadian research team has fabricated an inverted perovskite solar cell by using Lewis base molecules for surface passivation. Lewis bases are generally used in perovskite solar research to passivate surface defects in the perovskite layer. This has positive effects on energy level alignment, interfacial recombination kinetics, hysteresis behavior, and operational stability.
“Lewis basicity, which is inversely proportional to electronegativity, is expected to determine the binding energy and the stabilization of interfaces and grain boundaries,” the scientists said, noting that the molecules proved to be highly efficient in creating strong bonding between the cell layers at the interface level. “A Lewis base molecule with two electron-donating atoms can potentially bind and bridge interfaces and ground boundaries, offering the potential to enhance the adhesion and strengthen the mechanical toughness of perovskite solar cells.”
The scientists used a diphosphine Lewis base molecule known as 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino) propane (DPPP) to passivate one of the most promising halide perovskites – the formamidinium lead iodide known as FAPbI3 – for use in a cell’s absorber layer.
They deposited the perovskite layer on a DPPP-doped hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx). They observed that some DPPP molecules redissolved and segregated at both the perovskite/NiOx interface and the perovskite surface regions, and that the crystallinity of the perovskite film improved. They said this step enhanced the mechanical toughness of the perovskite/NiOx interface.
The researchers built the cell with a substrate made of glass and tin oxide (FTO), the HTL based on NiOx, a layer of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz) as the hole-transport layer, the perovskite layer, a thin layer of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60), a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, and a metal contact made of silver (Ag).
The team compared the performance of the DPPP-doped solar cell with a reference device that didn’t go through the treatment. The doped cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V and a fill factor of 82%. The undoped device reached an efficiency of 22.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V and a fill factor of 79%.
“The improvement on fill factor and open-circuit voltage confirmed the reduction in defect density at the NiOx /perovskite front interface after DPPP treatment,” the scientists said.
The researchers also built a doped cell with an active area of 1.05 cm2 that achieved a power conversion efficiency of up to 23.9% and showed no degradation after 1,500 h.
“With DPPP, under ambient conditions – that is, no additional heating – the overall power conversion efficiency of the cell stayed high for approximately 3,500 hours,” said researcher Chongwen Li. “The perovskite solar cells that have been previously published in the literature tend to see a significant drop in their efficiency after 1,500 to 2,000 hours, so this is a big improvement.”
The group, which recently applied for a patent for the DPPP technique, presented the cell tech in “Rational design of Lewis base molecules for stable and efficient inverted perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science. The team includes academics from the University of Toronto in Canada, as well as scientists from the University of Toledo, the University of Washington, and Northwestern University in the United States.

The BPDB has announced a plan to build three solar power plants in different parts of the country. It aims to develop a 50 MW project in Rangunia, a 20 MW array on a pond at a coal mine in Dinajpur district, and a 7.6 MW installation in Rangamati district, in southeastern Bangladesh.
The state agency published advertisements on Feb. 16 announcing that it is seeking international partners for the construction of the power plants, which will be financed from “cash foreign exchange under power sector development fund of BPDB.” The agency wants to commission the grid-tied plants within 12 months of signing contracts. The government will provide land for the plants.
According to BPDB officials, the 20 MW solar power plant will be set up in a polluted zone, on a pond that was created after extracting coal for years. The pond, according to a recently conducted feasibility study, has the capacity to host a floating solar power plant with 40 MW to 50 MW of capacity.
The 7.6 MW solar power plant will be set up on a plot of land near the 230 MW Karnafuli hydropower station, about 50 kilometers from the port city of Chattogram. The BPDB said it wants to build the new power plant near another 7.4 MW PV array that went online in 2019.
Bangladesh currently has the capacity to generate 958 MW of power from renewable sources, including 724 MW from solar.
