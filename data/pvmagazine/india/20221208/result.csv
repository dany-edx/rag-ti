Founded in 2015, Sunsure has built solar plants for commercial & industrial (C&I) customers and third-party renewable power producers in India.
“Under Partners Group’s ownership, Sunsure will be transformed into a next-generation independent power producer that will build and own utility-scale solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid, and battery storage renewable energy projects,” stated Partners Group.
The platform is targeting over 3 GW of operational capacity and will focus on selling power directly to C&I customers through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The platform also plans to help customers meet decarbonization and energy cost reduction targets by expanding the scope of existing client relationships to provide additional value-added services, such as energy-as-a-service and carbon credit management.
Partners Group, which has extensive experience in the renewable energy and decarbonization sectors, will work closely with the Sunsure founding team and management on achieving the Platform’s vision and delivering value creation initiatives.
The Sunsure founding team includes Shashank Sharma, Shantanu Faugaat, Manish Mehta, Kartikeya N. Sharma, and Tarunveer Singh.
Partners Group’s Private Infrastructure business has $21 billion in assets under management and has made over 130 investments in 18 countries globally.

Singh, has launched a plan to develop the transmission system for the integration of over 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. The plan envisages an additional transmission system and the installation of battery energy storage capacity.
As per the plan, India will need to develop additional transmission systems including 8,120 ckm of high-voltage direct current transmission corridors (+800 kV and +350 kV), 25,960 ckm of 765 kV AC lines, 15,758 ckm of 400 kV lines, and 1,052 ckm of 220 kV cable to integrate 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity planned by 2030. The estimated cost for these systems is INR 2.44 lakh crore.
The plan also includes the transmission system required for the evacuation of 10 GW off-shore wind located in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, which is estimated to cost INR 0.28 lakh crore. “With the planned transmission system, the inter-regional capacity will increase to about 1.50 lakh MW by 2030 from 1.12 lakh MW at present,” stated the ministry.
Considering the availability of renewable energy-based generation for a limited period during the day, the plan also envisages the installation of 51.5 GW of battery energy storage capacity to provide round-the-clock power to end-consumers.
The Ministry of Power had constituted a high-level committee under the Chairperson of Central Electricity Authority, with representatives from the Solar Energy Corporation of India, Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd, Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd, National Institute of Solar Energy, and National Institute of Wind Energy for planning the transmission system required for having 500 GW of non-fossil fuel based installed capacity by 2030.
The Committee prepared a detailed transmission plan in consultation with states and other stakeholders.
In outlining the transmission system requirements, the plan considered Fatehgarh, Bhadla, and Bikaner in Rajasthan, Khavda in Gujarat, Anantapur and Kurnool RE Zones in Andhra Pradesh, locations for offshore wind potentials in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, and RE park in Ladakh as potential RE generation centers.
“The planned transmission system projected will provide visibility to the renewable energy developers about the potential generation sites and scale of investment opportunity. Further, it will also provide the transmission service providers the vision of growth opportunity available in the transmission sector along with investment opportunity of about INR 2.44 lakh crore,” said the ministry.
At present, India has installed an electricity generation capacity of 409 GW comprising 173 GW (about 42%) from non-fossil fuel sources. For evacuation of power from the planned renewable capacity by 2030, a robust transmission system needs to be in place in advance as the gestation period of wind- and solar-based generation projects is much less than that of the associated transmission system.

NREL scientists have developed a mesoscopic building energy model to compare next-generation building glazing technologies. They have found that PV glazing technologies can be easily integrated into existing double- or triple-glazed substandard windows to significantly reduce building energy use and carbon emissions.
The team created glaze units using three types of PV window technology: a non-wavelength-selective technology using perovskite-based thin-film; a wavelength-selective technology, or so-called transparent PV; and dynamic PV technology, which is a recent innovation combing dynamic glazing technology with PV conversion.
They reportedly translated the nanoscopic glazing unit simulations to large-scale building energy simulations using the EnergyPlus and OpenStudio physics-based building energy simulation tools. They used weather data inputs from the Typical Meteorological Year database to simulate the energy consumption profiles of buildings in terms of heating, cooling, and lighting in 15-minute intervals over the course of a year.
The results showed that “PV glazing with a power conversion efficiency as low as 6% reduces energy use by more than 30%,” according to the researchers. They said increases in efficiency translate into additional energy use reduction. At efficiencies of 12.5%, perovskite thin-film and transparent PV technologies reach 42% energy-use reduction when integrated into double- or triple-glazed windows.
Dynamic PV glazing reaches almost 50% energy savings and “has the highest potential savings amongst PV technologies,” according to the researchers. However, they noted that the technology has only achieved an efficiency of 11% in a lab setting, so it needs further development to reach its full potential.
The results also showed that dynamic PV glazing generates more electricity in hotter months, with more than 1,200 gigajoules (GJ) of generation in June and September, but less than 200 GJ from December to January.
“In contrast, static wavelength-selective PV consistently generates more than 500 GJ each month but never exceeds 1,000 GJ for any single month,” said the researchers, who shared their findings in “Photovoltaic windows cut energy use and CO2 emissions by 40% in highly glazed buildings,” which was recently published in One Earth.

Sembcorp, a Singapore-based renewables developer, plans to deploy 409 MW of solar capacity in Matarbari, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, where 1.4 GW of coal power plants are currently under construction.
“Sembcorp has expressed interest to sign a memorandum of understanding with us for these projects,” Mizanur Rahman, a representative of state-owned Coal Power Generation Company Bangladesh Ltd., told pv magazine. “Now we have sent a draft document to the power division for approval.”
Rahman also said that Sembcorp will now conduct a feasibility study for the solar projects.
In November, a Singapore government delegation visited Bangladesh and met with Minister of Power Nasrul Hamid to discuss the proposal. 
Sembcorp currently operates 1,531 MW of solar power assets in Singapore, Vietnam, India, and China, according to its website.
