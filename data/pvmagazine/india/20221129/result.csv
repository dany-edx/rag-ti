The company has secured £194,000 from the UK Government’s Ayrton Fund to find a demonstration site in India suitable for its gravity energy storage technology. The Ayrton Fund, part of the UK’s International Climate Finance commitment, aims to give developing countries access to the latest cutting-edge tech to help reduce their emissions and meet global climate change targets.
Gravitricity has developed a gravity-based energy storage system that works by raising heavy weights (totalling up to 12,000 tonnes) in a deep shaft and then releasing them when energy is required. In India, the firm has partnered with India energy specialist Panitek Power in the 12-month project to identify and shortlist sites for a demonstration scheme.
The gravity storage technology could be ideally suited to India, which aims to install over 500 GW of renewables by 2030, up from 100 GW in 2021, to supply its fast-growing economy.
Chris Yendell, project development manager at Gravitricity, said, “With the introduction of renewable energy generation at this scale, new flexible storage services will be essential to ensure the grid continues to operate in a stable manner. Gravitricity’s versatile technology is ideally placed to deliver the balancing services required to achieve this stability.”
Gravity storage is a relatively simple technology. It doesn’t rely on any rare earth metals, and has a very long lifespan, meaning it can be manufactured and deployed locally alongside vast amounts of new grid infrastructure which will also be required to meet the rapid growth in demand.
Parag Vyas, chief commercial officer at Panitek Power, told pv magazine, “Pumped hydro schemes have traditionally been the main long-duration electrical energy storage option in India, and 900 MW of solar+pumped hydro projects were awarded over the last year in the nation. Project developers are currently developing several solar+lithium-ion projects and are experimenting with sodium-sulphur batteries. Alternative options are vanadium flow batteries, compressed air energy storage, and flywheels. However, limitations range from high cost, performance degradation, and lack of ability to offer both long duration and fast response.”
“South Asia does not have a well-developed lithium-ion or flow battery supply chain capability and import tariffs of 28% make these solutions particularly expensive. Access to the rare-earth minerals needed for chemical batteries is also limited. These are currently supplied by China, and geo-political concerns are leading the Indian government in particular to pursue technologies dependent on readily available materials, such as cement and steel.”
Gravitricity claims its system can operate for up to 50 years and store energy at half the cost of lithium-ion batteries. 
Gravitricity will rely on the in-country expertise of energy specialists Panitek Power, who will work with local partners to identify sites and supply chain firms to deliver a specific proposal which could be built in the near term.
“India has an immediate and growing need for energy storage technologies. In many locations there is little or no grid, and it makes sense to integrate energy storage within their evolving infrastructure to cope with intermittent generation,” stated Vyas. “In addition, as a country’s share of renewables rises, this can cause frequency and voltage disturbances in the existing grid due to mismatch of load demand and generation. Gravitricity’s technology has a response time of less than one second and can be cycled thousands of times, making it ideally suited to grid balancing and rapid frequency response services.”
Green tech pioneers are already planning to install Gravitricity’s invention in decommissioned mineshafts and custom-built shafts in the UK and mainland Europe.
Gravitricity has trialled a 250 kW technology demonstrator in 2021 and is now developing MW-scale plant using underground shafts in the UK and Europe, to be constructed in 2023.
“The Gravitricity system is highly configurable, and an optimal region-specific design needs to be developed, adapted directly to end-customer business models, and the types of revenue streams that can be accessed. This includes identifying local supply chain capability, particularly to meet technical and quality specifications, and any adaptations in the design that may be needed. Cost savings can also be made over European suppliers,” stated the company.
Gravitricity’s solution can be built in existing mineshafts or in purpose sunk shafts with a 50-year design life.

Scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Indore have proposed a new way to fabricate thin-film solar cells based on kusachiite (CuBi2O4), an extremely rare binary copper(II) and bismuth(III) oxide that was recently discovered in Okayama prefecture, Japan.
“There are two previous reports on using kusachiite as a light harvester,” researcher Vishesh Manjunath told pv magazine. “In the first report, CuBi2O4 is sensitized over photoanodes to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells, and the in the second report, CuBi2O4 light harvester is modeled with a complex device architecture. However, for the first time, we have modeled the kusachiite solar cells akin to the simpler perovskite solar cell device architecture.”
He said the cost of kusachiite solar cells could be much lower than that of conventional crystalline silicon cells, owing to the well-established synthesis protocols of CuBi2O4.
“The synthesis of various nanostructures of CuBi2O4 is well-established,” he said. “However, synthesizing thin films of CuBi2O4 with low defect density should be experimented with, and the best and most cost-effective process can be scaled up for manufacturing kusachiite solar cells.”
The researchers designed the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, different types of buffer layers, a CuBi2O4 absorber, and a metal contact based on gold (Au). Through a series of simulations, they evaluated this design for variation in thickness, accepter/donor defect, and doping density of subsequent thin-films, counter electrodes, and operating temperature. 
“An increase in the thickness of CBO absorber film beyond the charge diffusion length will lead to charge recombination resulting in low short-circuit current density (JSC), subsequently restraining the power conversion efficiency,” the scientists explained. “Importantly, the CuBi2O4 thin films deposited by spin-coating and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) showed a carrier diffusion length of around 50 nm. Moreover, the thickness of the absorber layer controls the carrier absorption of short-wavelength photons and considerably reduces the electrical losses associated with charge carrier recombination at the interface.”
In the proposed cell configuration, blue light and other high-energy light are absorbed at the interface, while low-energy light like red light is absorbed when the thickness of the absorber is on the higher side. For this reason, the thickness of CuBi2O4 absorber films should be properly optimized to achieve maximum efficiency, said the research group. 
They found that the highest efficiency of 27.7% was achieved with a cell design featuring a buffer layer made of tin sulfide (SnS2). Another device with a tungsten disulfide (WS2) buffer layer – as well as an optimized CuBi2O4 light absorber with a thickness of 900 nm and an acceptor doping density of 2 cm × 1,018 cm – achieved an efficiency of 22.84%.
The scientists presented the solar cell design in “Futuristic kusachiite solar cells of CuBi2O4 absorber and metal sulfide buffer Layers: Theoretical efficiency approaching 28%,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.

It is always dubious to state something is happening “for the first time,” and regardless of whether Enerparc was the first – as one press release claims – or the second or third to build a solar plant marketed primarily as baseload electricity in Germany, the development indicates an emerging trend. We are likely to see that business model more often and it will carry higher risks for operators because baseload means continuous power supply, regardless of whether the sun shines.
Marketing solar via PPAs signed by power companies or industry has established itself in Germany in the last three years, as it has elsewhere. Today, the model is enjoying heady times. “High electricity prices are an additional boost for project planners looking for security in the form of a PPA,” says Thomas Kott, head of portfolio management at Axpo Deutschland.
Under such agreements, operators provide power and receive either “pay-as-produced” or “pay-as-forecast” returns. The customer receives electricity when the sun shines. That means lots of power at midday in summer, much less in winter, and nothing at night. Unless the power is used solely for air conditioning, consumers usually require a different profile and have to consider how to fill the gaps.
The approach is more established in markets outside of Germany. In Spain, 10% to 20% of solar PPAs are already baseload-plant driven, according to David Willemsen who, as head of risk consulting at Pexapark, advises generators on supply contracts. For wind PPAs in the Nordic states the model has a firm foothold. In Spain, “it was long seen as standard practice for contracts to run for 10 years, like in the USA,” says Jan Knievel, head of origination at Enerparc electricity trading subsidiary Sunnic Lighthouse. In Germany, however, contracts typically only lasted around four years.
What does marketing solar with a baseload PPA entail when, as Knievel points out, “no solar plant can deliver baseload.” Swiss energy supplier Axpo takes delivery of electricity from the 39 MW solar plant in Büttel, which Enerparc holds as an investor. With a 4 MW baseload band agreed, and 8,760 hours in a year, that means 35 GWh of electricity annually, a figure close to the expected yield of such a site. But the sun does not shine continuously with the same consistent intensity.
While the solar output of German sites in August is around 60% above the annual average figure, in December it is only a quarter of the mean. For baseload supply, all fluctuations must be balanced. “If the plant produces less than 4 MW, we have to buy power and if the plant produces too much, we have to sell,” says Knievel. The contract lasts 10 years so running the numbers involves assumptions about electricity buying and selling prices for a decade. With pay-as-produced contracts, buyers bear the risk, but with baseload contracts the risk is initially with the seller.
Securing project development via the so called “innovation” tender ensures every kilowatt-hour is remunerated with a fixed, single-digit euro-cent amount, even if sold via a PPA. The power plant must be equipped with a battery, however, which can help supply baseload power but is never going to be the complete solution.
“The capacity is not enough for that,” says Knievel. “With the 8 MWh battery, we can supply the 4 MW for two hours.” Planning a battery large enough to balance out the energy supply from solar, including seasonal shifts, is unrealistic, so electricity trading has to be a factor.
Utilities such as Axpo have in-house trading expertise – and the financial clout to bear price risk. Generally, though, PV plants are built and operated by limited liability special purpose vehicles (SPVs) which have to take the risk of a baseload PPA. Although, the bank lending to the SPV is given access to the assets – the PV plant – as collateral. The lender must ensure the SPV’s other obligations, included in the baseload contract, don’t jeopardize the collateral, and that it generates sufficient profits. The fewer risks covered, the lower the loan – and thus, investor return-on-equity – will be.
For the power plant in Büttel, a consortium led by Deutsche Anlagen Leasing (DAL) – with the involvement of savings banks as shareholders – provided the loan financing. “The question baseload contracts address is how to structure the risk of having to buy an unknown amount of electricity at an unknown price,” says Peer Günzel, head of infrastructure and supply sales at DAL.
Germany is often described as an immature market in terms of PPAs and risk appetite, compared to the Nordic nations, Spain, and the US. The approach to solar development in Spain altered after the government drastically cut subsidies a decade ago. That shock left generators looking for new business models, says Günzel.
“PPA structures exist for utility-scale projects – both pay-as-produced and baseload – as a basis for long-term bank financing for projects,” he says, pointing out PPAs are now the bedrock of big renewables.
Market maturity is tied to the ability to assess and manage risk and Büttel is a case in point. Enerparc’s Knievel had worked for a wind-energy electricity trader and Günzel had PV project experience. “It helps when the people involved have experience,” says the latter. At Büttel, Sunnic Lighthouse has assumed the risk of the difference between baseload and actual production. For a fee, the Enerparc subsidiary will meet the project company’s supply obligations.
Demand for baseload PPAs is due in part to the history of the electricity market. They constitute a standardized product and “traders know how to deal with that,” says Pexapark’s Willemsen.
Another advantage is that baseload deals take the pressure off electricity buyers: currently the big energy companies. “Even the big, creditworthy buyers have to price in the risks when they do a pay-as-produced PPA and hold risk capital,” says Axpo’s Kott. “At some point, even a big offtaker like Axpo, or another creditworthy buyer, will say: ‘I’ve had enough of pay-as-produced risks, now I’ll just stick with baseload deals.’”
One of the biggest market price risks is the “cannibalization” effect. The theory that solar generation, during peak sunlight periods for photovoltaics, proves so effective in driving down the price of electricity that it affects its investors’ business case is nothing new, and the phenomenon can now be quantified.
Last year, the average German market value of solar power was €0.07552 ($0.07443)/kWh, some 22% lower than the annual average exchange electricity price of €0.09685/kWh. Solar generators that sold electricity on a baseload contract received less for the surplus during the day, and in summer, than they had to spend at night and in winter to balance the supply. Traders buying power to cover shortfalls and selling surplus power would have lost 22% of the baseload value in 2021. This is what experts call the capture factor, market value factor, or profile factor.
If the future capture factor were known, it could be accounted for and baseload contract pricing would be less challenging. But how the price will develop over 10 years is one of the great unknowns. Capture factor projections, which also reflect the expected expansion of renewables, for Germany range from 40% to 70%.
The shift to baseload contracts does not have to be negative for investors, however. Market price risks come with a price tag. If a generator today earns around €0.165/kWh over a 10-year pay-as-produced PPA, they might charge €0.20/kWh for a baseload PPA, according to Willemsen. Bespoke deals are also an option, he points out, such as monthly baseload contracts that take into account average four-week solar generation.
It can even be profitable for investors to retain the risks and conclude higher baseload contracts, under certain circumstances, according to a recent brochure published by Pexapark. When selling to an energy company, that can include managing “settlement” – the purchase and sale of shortages or surpluses.
It may be possible in future for solar plant operators to mitigate energy supply risks directly by using batteries or combining PV with wind turbines. “Co-location with other technologies can not only save grid costs but also increase the profile value,” says Willemsen. “Depending on the design of the storage system, you can achieve a market value that is higher than the baseload.”
To that end, Pexapark this year began calculating hybrid capture factors for systems with battery storage. “For a PV-storage combination where the storage has 25% of the capacity of the PV plant, we see a market value for the next few years that is 3% to 12% above the baseload,” adds the risk consultant.
First, though, in Germany at least, baseload PPAs need to put down roots. “It works in other markets,” says Willemsen. “A clean assessment of the risk is important. When in doubt, it’s better to hedge a few per cent less than a few per cent too much.”
While rocketing electricity prices are ensuring PPAs are a seller’s market right now – “you can take these extremely high prices on the futures markets for 2023, 2024, and 2025,” says Axpo’s Kott of a situation in which three-year to five-year baseload contracts are popular – longer term prices are currently expected to fall back again.
If that proves to be the case, it will be some time before the market turns around to the point where risk-averse operators have to move away from pay-as-produced deals. However, Kott suspects the German PPA market will evolve as it has elsewhere. “We will also have to move in that direction that there will be more, or perhaps at some point almost exclusively, baseload PPAs for operators,” he says.
Not that operators or energy traders should have to shoulder all the risk, he adds. Industrial energy users can play their part, too. “They can’t expect to get green power for a small premium, from super-nice plants with additionality, without taking on any risk at all,” Kott says. If energy users secure finance by taking on the market price risk of a clean energy plant, they can truly say the generation project was built due to their commitment to renewables – so called “Additionality.”
Andreas Loh, managing director of Enovos Energie Deutschland, agrees. Enovos’ PPA concept is that the large industrial power buyers will structure the PV generation and assume the associated risks.
At one time, Loh explains, industrial companies signed PPAs on a fixed forecast basis but now “this is changing in the course of the energy transition, when the volatility of energy trading prices is increasing significantly due to the much less predictable power generation of renewable plants.”
The risk of selling or buying at a certain point is now on the consumer, and big companies have the market knowledge and the capability to adjust loads in tandem with spot market prices. “Many companies and start-ups, like Enovos itself, are now developing automation logic for this,” says Loh, adding that also leads to technical solutions to deal with fluctuating solar insolation.
Google, a major energy consumer, is pursuing a different approach, explained Marc Oman, the search engine’s head of energy and infrastructure in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Speaking at this year’s pv magazine Roundtables Europe event, Oman said Google’s goal is not only to supply its data centers with renewable energy, on a balance-sheet basis over the year, but to also cover hourly consumption.
As part of that drive, the US giant is supporting efforts by firms such as Energytag to time-stamp electricity. Baseload contracts are not part of the picture because Google believes generators should not be using gray power from the electricity exchange to enable a shift from pay-as-produced arrangements. Clean power plants should instead deliver just what they produce, with the consumer – Google – developing extra generation facilities and storage as required.
That approach would certainly tackle price cannibalization, but dissenting voices say having individual companies time stamping just their own green power would be more costly than optimizing the whole system. They maintain that price signals from the electricity market, which determine the difference between baseload and pay-as-produced PPAs, are enough to motivate the construction of storage and electrolyzers and could also motivate much-needed flexibility in energy consumption.
