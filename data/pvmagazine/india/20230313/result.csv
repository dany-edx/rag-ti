It provided the panels for solar PV systems in the states of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh over a period of four months. 
Gautam Solar’s 545 Wp ten-busbar mono solar modules are built with M10 cells for higher power generation, multi-busbar technology for lower electrical losses, and round ribbon connectors for better light utilization. The bifacial PERC technology allows power generation from both sides. Non-destructive laser-based cell cutting leads to higher reliability and lower chances of micro-cracks, and half-cut cell technology allows for better low-light performance.
Gautam Solar is based out of New Delhi, with four factories in Haridwar. It has a solar module capacity of 400 MWp and is expanding to 1 GWp.
