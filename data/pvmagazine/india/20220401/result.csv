https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/01/ireda-to-lend-inr-268-crore-to-blusmart-mobility/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 1, 2022",IREDA to lend INR 268 crore to BluSmart Mobility,"Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (IREDA), State-controlled renewable energy and energy efficiency lender under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, has sanctioned a loan of INR 267.67 crore to integrated EV ride-hailing and charging company BluSmart Mobility for the purchase of 3,000 all-electric cars.
Out of the sanctioned amount, IREDA has already disbursed the first tranche of INR 35.70 crore to BluSmart Mobility to expand its EV fleet.
In January this year, IREDA had launched a scheme to finance new and emerging technologies that promote and increase the usage of renewable energy in the transport sector. Under the scheme, it shall also provide finance for EV fleet owners/operators and charging infrastructure owners—thus financing the entire value chain of green mobility.
The loan to BluSmart marks its first investment in this space.
Pradip Kumar Das, chairman and managing director, IREDA, said, “We at IREDA believe that electric mobility has huge growth potential in India. BluSmart has been providing its services in the national capital region of India, and we support their team behind this good work. This is our first major investment in this space and towards making India a cleaner and greener country.
IREDA is looking forward to financing more EV projects to speed up the progress of moving transportation to clean sources in the country. This is part of the company’s endeavor to help reduce emissions in the National Capital Region.”
Anmol Jaggi, co-founder and CEO, BluSmart Mobility, said, “EV is going to be the new sunrise sector that will help transition India to a cleaner future. We are excited with this fundraise and heartily thank the Government of India for taking sturdy steps in the EV sector and IREDA for putting trust in us.”
Since its inception in 1987, IREDA has financed the largest share of renewable energy projects in India. It has sanctioned loans to projects in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sector aggregating to around INR 1,20,522 crore, disbursed INR 77,946 crore (approx.), and supported more than 19,453 MW of RE capacity in the country till March 31, 2022.

Rajasthan led in solar installations by adding 4.4GW during the year, followed by Gujarat (1.3GW) and Uttar Pradesh (0.8GW).
As of December 31, 2021, the nation’s cumulative installed utility-scale solar capacity reached around 42.2GW. Another 45.5GW is under pipeline with auctions for these projects already completed. Rajasthan has a maximum installed solar capacity of 9.6GW as of December 31, 2022, followed by Karnataka (7.7GW) and Tamil Nadu (4.2GW).
JMK analysts expect a record 14GW of new utility-scale solar addition and 3.5GW of rooftop/onsite PV in the year 2022.
Leading suppliers
China’s Sineng ranked as India’s biggest central inverter supplier, commanding a 40.2% share of the overall 7.8GW of central inverter shipments in the nation from January till December in 2021. It was followed by Sungrow and Fimer, with a 21.3% share each.
Huawei led in string inverter, supplying 29.7% of the overall 10,146MW AC capacity commissioned in the nation. It was followed by Sungrow (25.6%) and Solis (11.4%).
Five Chinese manufacturers together supplied 67.7% of the overall 17,105MW DC module shipments in India during 2021. The rest of the lot came from Indian manufacturers (30.7%) and US-based Renesola (1.6%). Longi Solar ranked first, accounting for 24.3% of the overall module shipments in India during the year. Jinko ranked second with a 20.5% share of the overall module shipments, and Trina third (9.9%)

Chinese module manufacturer Trina Solar claims to have set a new world record efficiency of 25.5% for its 210×210 mm monocrystalline n-type i-TOPCon solar cell.
The result was certified by the National Institute of Metrology of China.
The manufacturer said it will further develop the solar cell by using its production equipment from commercial manufacturing.
“We are very proud of these recent achievements,” said Chen Yifeng, head of Trina’s Research and Development Center for High Efficiency Cells and Modules. “Trina Solar is deeply involved in cutting-edge research and development and is a pioneer in technological production and manufacturing, which contributes to the company taking a leading position with its efficient products.”
In June 2019, the efficiency of Trina’s TOPCon solar cell stood at 23.22%. The record-breaking 247.79cm² bifacial device was manufactured using a low-cost industrial process, said Trina in a statement released at the time, on a large phosphorus-doped, cast-mono silicon substrate. That result was independently confirmed by ISFH CalTeC in Germany.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/01/french-consortium-develops-self-cleaning-solar-module-coating/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PV MODULE CLEANER,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 1, 2022",French consortium develops self-cleaning solar module coating,"From pv magazine Global
French chemical company Axcentive and solar module manufacturer Photowatt, a unit of France-based energy giant EDF, are jointly developing a self-cleaning coating for solar panels under the umbrella of the European project PV Impact, which is being coordinated by the Association of European Renewable Energy Research Centers and is aimed at stimulating the private sector to spend more on PV research, development and innovation in Europe.
The coating will be based on photoactive nanotechnology and commercialized under the brand name Exocoat. It is described by the two companies as a self-cleaning coating for glass substrates, activated by light. “Under light radiation, the coating creates radicals which breakdown any organic soil or contamination,” they said in a joint statement. “Airborne particles such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitric oxide (NOx) are also eradicated.”
The coating relies on a super-hydrophilic surface that makes the water spread out on the module surface immediately, thus avoiding light scattering effects upon rain. Furthermore, this surface is said to increase the self–cleaning effect by letting water flow under the dirt and remove it by gravitational forces. “A more practical method to follow the effects on the surface is its response to a powdered substance that would cause fouling, and the effect to water spray. The hydrophilic surface of the coating will be less statically charged and, as a result, will attract less dirt,” the statement reads.
Scientists from the two companies tested the coating on a carbon powder against a plate that was half coated with Exocoat itself. They sprayed water on the plate and found that the coated side showed full wetting and self–cleaning due to the water sheeting effect. “A vital point for the performance of Exocoat as self-cleaning coating is its correct application on the glass/solar panel surface,” said Arno Schut, innovation manager at Axcentive. “Incorrect application can lead to inferior technical performance. Axcentive has written application protocols based for hand and automatic spray application that were developed in the lab and need to be tested on site.”
The two companies are currently seeking to improve their technology by seeking spray equipment manufacturers.
