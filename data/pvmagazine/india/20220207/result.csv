https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/07/additional-pli-funds-will-push-solar-sector-to-achieve-2030-target/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 7, 2022",Additional PLI funds will push solar sector to achieve 2030 target ,"The additional allocation of $2.6 billion to the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme will play an important role in shaping up the domestic solar manufacturing industry and putting the sector on the path to achieve the 2030 target of installed PV generation capacity, says a new report by data and analytics company GlobalData. 
India targets to achieve 500 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 before reaching zero carbon emissions by 2070. This includes 280 GW from solar PV. The Union Budget 2022-23 allocates an additional $2.6 billion to the PLI scheme for solar to promote and push domestic PV module manufacturing. 
Mohit Prasad, Practice Head of Power at GlobalData, comments: “India is the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US. To reduce this, India has been pushing for renewable energy development, especially the solar sector. In line with this, India’s solar sector is heavily dependent on the imports of solar equipment. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the supply chain as solar equipment could not be imported, thereby affecting the solar PV capacity additions. 
The imports of components used in the solar industry increased substantially since the target under the National Solar Mission was revised to 100 GW of solar PV by 2022. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM), or the National Solar Mission, was launched in 2010 to achieve 20 GW of installed solar capacity by the year 2022. The target has since then been revised twice and now boasts the 100 GW target. 
Prasad continues: “According to GlobalData, India witnessed a sudden spurt in its annual solar PV installations in 2015 when 3 GW of new solar installations were added to the grid, which used to be around 1 GW in previous years. However, the subsequent two years witnessed new highs in the annual installations, which were driven primarily by solar components’ imports from countries like China, Malaysia, etc at a lower cost. This caused many domestic producers to stop their production, resulting in heavy losses thereby crippling the domestic industry.”
  
In April last year, the Government of India introduced the PLI scheme for solar components. The scheme, with an outlay of $603 million initially, offers funding support to bidders who commit to setting up fabs to produce everything from polysilicon to PV modules in India. The effect of PLI is evident from more than 11 GW of capacity addition by the nation from January-November 2021. 
Prasad concludes: “As India has set a net-zero climate target by 2070, investment in renewable energy is required. This can be addressed if there are policies to promote investments in the sector. With a target of 280 GW for solar PV by 2030, India not only should rely on imports but must also promote the domestic manufacturing sector.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/07/virescent-renewable-energy-trust-raises-inr-650-crore-via-domestic-bonds/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 7, 2022",Virescent Renewable Energy Trust raises INR 650 crore via domestic bonds  ,"US investor KKR-backed Virescent Infrastructure today announced its renewable energy-focused infrastructure investment trust (InvIT), Virescent Renewable Energy Trust (VRET), has raised INR 650 crore (US$87 million) through non-convertible debentures issuance.  
VRET raised the amount across 7.33-year (INR 150 crore/US$ 20 million) and 10-year (INR500 crore/US$67 million) tranches. 
“This transaction marks the largest single series issuance of INR 500 crore in 10-year tenor by a Renewable Energy Company. This bond issuance establishes a new yield curve for VRET, while also achieving significant elongation of average tenor as compared to the earlier INR 1,000 crore bond issuance of VRET in November 2021 (4.8 years to 9.4 years),” Virescent stated. 
The average quarterly coupon rate of the bonds is 7.93%, fully fixed for the entire tenor.  
VRET will primarily use the bond proceeds to fund its immediate acquisition-related debt requirements as it scales up its portfolio from the existing 450 MW (peak) of operational solar projects. 
The bonds are assigned the highest domestic rating of AAA (Stable) by CRISIL and India Ratings.  
Virescent said the success of the transaction highlights the faith of the investor community in the strength of KKR as the Sponsor and the presence of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for the entire capacity, a diverse portfolio of underlying assets in terms of geography, counterparty, operators and equipment suppliers, demonstrated track record of stable operations, timely receipt of payments from the offtakers for a majority of the projects, strong debt coverages as well as robust debt protection features as per the India Ratings credit rationale. 
The bonds were subscribed by the government-backed India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited as well as the NIIF-promoted Aseem Infrastructure Finance Limited 
Sanjay Grewal, CEO, Virescent Infrastructure said “This bond issuance is a significant achievement in VRET’s journey, demonstrating our debt raising capabilities to achieve competitive pricing and longer maturity profiles. With VRET being a recently established entity in September 2021 and only five months into our journey, we are pleased to have issued such long tenor bonds and attracted marquee institutional lenders.”  
Grewal added, “It is very encouraging to see specialized lenders and development finance institutions such as Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) and Aseem Infrastructure participate in the long-term debt markets as it will go a long way in creating much-needed capital for infrastructure funding.  
The investment marks India IIFCL’s first transaction into long-term infrastructure project bonds. 
Padmanabhan Raja Jaishankar, Managing Director, IIFCL said “Keeping in mind country’s infrastructure needs and development of bond markets, IIFCL has embraced these objectives by investing into Infrastructure Bonds, thereby boosting the availability of longer-tenor bond finance. This step will propel the new financial architecture wherein financial institutions and banks fund the construction phase and later re-financings are funded through the bond market and IIFCL is accelerating this proposition.” 
This issuance also marks Aseem Infrastructure Finance’s first fixed investment in a significantly longer tenor (10 years) Infrastructure Bond. Virender Pankaj, CEO, Aseem Infrastructure Finance Ltd, said, “[this investment] is in line with our aspiration to become one of the leading players in infrastructure financing by providing focused and customized solutions to clients.”

While there is so much work going into developing new and existent battery chemistries and system designs, a pair of researchers from UC San Diego has proposed a new battery system that involves no physical device.
The team dubbed their concept information batteries, in which energy is stored in the form of information—specifically, the results of completed computational tasks. The idea is to speculatively perform computations in large, energy-intensive data centers when solar and wind energy is available in excess and stored the results on servers for later use, when there is less renewable energy on the grid.
In other words, information batteries would provide storage through speculative load shifting, anticipating computation that will be performed in the future.
The most likely candidates for implementing this concept are energy-hungry data centers – from Google and Facebook to Hollywood movie rendering. For instance, every day, YouTube data centers transcode more than 700,000 hours of videos to different resolutions and many of these computations are predictable and can be performed at a time when there is excess green energy.
In addition to taking advantage of task predictability, the system is also flexible: the computations that are completed in advance do not need to match exactly with the computations completed at a later time.
“We support pre-computing many fragments of computation and then later can pick and choose small pieces of computation done before, like puzzle pieces, and assemble them together to quickly compute a totally new computational task,” said Barath Raghavan, an assistant professor in computer science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
Challenges
While the idea itself is relatively simple, the challenge, said the researchers, is determining what computation to perform, where and when, and how these computations should be done to efficiently retrieve the results later.
In the paper Information Batteries: Storing Opportunity Power with Speculative Execution, the researchers describe their proof-of-concept implementation of information batteries, which includes recurrent neural networks for predicting the upcoming tasks in data centers, a cache where functions are stored enabling fast retrieval of precomputed results, and a modified compiler to automatically modify code to store and retrieve results.
However, as with all technologies, there are certain limitations to this concept. For instance, it is only possible in some workloads and in some contexts, which the researchers further explore in their study. But Raghavan believes with improved prediction and integration into large systems, the technology points towards a promising future alternative for storing green energy. “In the civilization-scale challenge of sustainability, we need every tool we can get,” he said.

Spanish architectural firm Ignacio Borrego Arquitectos has built a photovoltaic shading structure on the outdoor rest area of a commercial building located in the northern part of Madrid.
“The structure rests on the only four possible points that had been planned on the roof for future installations and is made with light galvanized steel profiles for plasterboard partitions,” Ignacio Borrego told pv magazine. “For its assembly, it was necessary to weld two curved circular tubes of 70 mm steel that support the wind load and transfer it to the four support points.”

He also explained that the rest of the structure is lightweight profiles bolted on site and assembled without the need for any auxiliary means. “The whole set is reversible,” the architect further explained. “All joints are removable and the interior furniture of the pergola is also made with the same profiles and recycled furniture.”

The PV system deployed on the structure has a nominal power of 8 kW and relies on JAM72S20 MR 455W solar panels provided by Chinese manufacturer JA Solar. The entire structure comprising the solar array has a footprint of 55 m2, offers a shade area of 25 m2 and weighs 57kg/m2. The modules were deployed by Lodeal Green and Tasvalor was the project developer.
“The project was built at a cost of €12,500,” Borrego stated.
