The agreement will see Cleantech Solar develop the PV plant at its solar park in Tamil Nadu. Saint-Gobain India will procure power on a captive, open access basis to power its manufacturing facilities in Sriperumbudur and Perundurai.
The PV plant is expected to generate around 28 million units of clean energy per year during the project’s lifetime, avoiding over 20 kilotons of CO2 emissions annually.
Saint-Gobain Group has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Procuring power from the solar PV project will contribute to its goal of limiting its environmental impact, countering climate change, preserving natural resources, and reducing waste and atmospheric emissions.
“Aimed at fulfilling the ambitious target of 100% green power by 2027-28, the agreement with Cleantech Solar is also another step in our continued efforts to add more green capacity through collaboration with green power generators and to meet our sustainability targets,” said AR Unnikrishnan, managing director-Glass business, Saint-Gobain India.
By the end of 2022, Saint-Gobain India will replace nearly 68 million units of its electricity requirement with solar power. And by 2025, it will have 65% of its electricity consumption coming from renewables.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/17/ev-sales-to-grow-slower-than-expected/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,EV BATTERIES,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 17, 2022",EV sales to grow at slower-than-expected pace,"A new report by CareEdge says electric vehicle (EV) demand in India over the next three years will grow much more slowly than previously estimated. The analysts expect the domestic EV sales volume to grow moderately at 75% annually over the next three years, after registering a massive 205% jump in two-wheeler and 149% in four-wheeler EV categories during the three years between fiscal 2019-20 to fiscal 2021-22.  
“The large-scale transition to EVs across various categories, which was earlier expected to happen post-2023, is likely to be delayed by at least three years. Two-wheeler EVs will continue to account for over 90% of demand in the interim [given their cost parity with ICE vehicles in this segment],” said the analysts.
The analysts said the switchover to EVs in the car segment will continue to be hampered by relatively high car prices, as well as the lack of charging infrastructure across India. They said EV demand would suffer due to the sharp increase in prices of key battery raw materials, including nickel, lithium, and cobalt, arising from supply constraints.
Australia, Chile, and China are the world’s largest suppliers of lithium, with Chile having the largest reserves. In the case of cobalt, the top three producers are the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Russia, and Australia,. For nickel, the top producers are Indonesia, the Philippines, and Russia.
The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has triggered volatility in cobalt and nickel prices in recent months. Whereas mining of lithium in Chile and cobalt in DRC has come under criticism due to the adverse environmental impact of the same. CareEdge analysts estimate that increasing the mining capacity for lithium, cobalt, and nickel in these regions would take at least three years. During the interim, battery prices would remain firm at around present levels.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/17/amended-energy-conservation-bill-to-drive-renewables-adoption/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 17, 2022",Amended Energy Conservation Bill to drive renewables adoption,"ICRA Research analysts say the major amendments in the Energy Conservation Bill are a step in the right direction to decarbonize different sectors in India. The amended bill, recently passed in the lower parliament (Lok Sabha), sets a minimum usage clause for non-fossil fuel in high-emission sectors like power, industry, transport, buildings, and agriculture.
The bill also introduces carbon trading to ensure faster decarbonization of the Indian economy and help achieve sustainable development goals. It specifies the details regarding issuing authorities, entitlement, and trading details for carbon credits. ICRA Research said carbon trading can open up opportunities for India, which is the fourth largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world.

Many states are making significant efforts to adopt the Energy Conservation Building Code and are front-runners in energy saving in commercial and public buildings. The scope of the bill has been expanded to include residential buildings, which account for 4% of carbon dioxide emissions. It also covers vehicles (as defined under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988) and vessels (ships and boats).
“Heavy penalties and widening the scope of the types of vehicles and buildings covered would help restrict carbon emissions. The Bill has also increased the manpower of the governing council and empowered the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERC)s for better control over energy transition goals. Overall, the amendment is a step in the right direction, but the execution of the same and quantifying the results to meet the climate goal vision will be a key monitorable,” said Rohit Ahuja, head of research and outreach for ICRA.
The Energy Conservation Act of 2001 provides regulations for the efficient use of energy and its conservation. It lays out regulatory, operational, legal, and financial obligations for energy-consuming equipment, appliances, buildings, and industry, to help India achieve its climate goals. To abide by India’s commitment, a policy push mandating non-fossil fuels will be critical, especially for high-emission sectors. The Energy Conservation Act Amendments are a step toward reforming the energy sector and ushering in a climate-friendly energy transition.

University College London researchers have said in a new study that the pumping of hydrogen into gas networks poses risks and requires a rethinking of usual blending techniques. 
“The strongly inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen within the pipe flow and on the pipe walls could indicate the location of potential pipe material degradation, including embrittlement effects of gas pipelines,” the researchers said in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.
They focused on the common blending method, based on the injection of hydrogen through a side branch into a main gas header pipe (T-junction).
“The low molecular mass of hydrogen reduces the penetration of a side-branch flow and increases the buoyancy forces leading to stratification with high hydrogen concentrations on the upper pipe surface, downstream of the branch,” the team said.
“Top-side injection leads to the hydrogen concentration remaining >40% for up to eight pipe diameters from the injection point for volumetric dilutions less than 30%. Under-side injection promotes mixing within the flow interior and reduces wall concentration at the lower surface, compared to top-side injection.”
