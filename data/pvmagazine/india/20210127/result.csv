Corporations bought a record amount of clean energy in 2020, despite the devastation of the pandemic, with the US market maintaining its lead and new markets driving growth, according to a new report from BloombergNEF (BNEF).
The 2020 figure is up slightly from 20.1 GW in 2019 and more than 10 GW above the 13.6 GW seen in 2018. BNEF noted that the 2020 increase came despite the pandemic, global recession, and uncertainty about US energy policy ahead of the presidential election.
“To not only maintain, but grow, the clean energy procurement market under these conditions is a testament to how high sustainability is on many corporations’ agendas,” said Kyle Harrison, BNEF senior associate and lead author of the report.
BNEF found in its H1 2021 Corporate Energy Market Outlook that clean energy contracts were signed by more than 130 companies in sectors ranging from oil and gas to big tech.

The fleet of 40 e-buses has been provided by state-owned power producer NTPC’s arm NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited (NVVN Limited), which also provides complete solutions for e-vehicles, including related services such as charging stations.
In addition to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands project, NVVN has emerged as a successful bidder for providing a turnkey solution for 90 electric buses in Bengaluru, Karnataka, under the Smart City project. These buses will provide last-mile connectivity to the metro network serving the city of Bengaluru.
Nation-wide installations
India’s electric bus market has gained momentum owing to aggressive government push through the FAME India [Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India] scheme.
In a report issued last year, Haryana-based JMK Research & Analytics expected India to add 6,490 electric buses in the next two years (1850 units in FY2020-21 and 4640 in FY2021-22).
It stated that by March 2020, the country had added about 1,031 electric buses (e-buses)—600 in FY2019-20, 400 in FY2018-19, and 31 in FY2017-18—across different State and State undertakings.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/27/sterling-and-wilson-commissions-25-mw-solar-project-in-oman/,"GROUND MOUNTED,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA,OMAN",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 27, 2021",Sterling and Wilson commissions 25 MW solar project in Oman,"In a release issued today, Mumbai-based Sterling and Wilson Solar Limited (SWSL), one of the largest solar EPC solutions providers globally, has announced the commissioning of its second project in Oman. The 25 MW solar project was awarded to SWSL by global energy company Shell. 
“SWSL commissioned this project on time with more than 300,000 safe manhours during the pandemic by following all the necessary safety protocols and measures set by the local authorities,” read the company statement.  
Bikesh Ogra, director and global chief executive officer, Sterling and Wilson Solar Limited, said, “Oman is experiencing a rapid rise in domestic energy demand as more urbanized populations are consuming greater amounts of power. The country wants to expand its electricity generation capacities through renewable independent power projects and aims to derive 30% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.
“It gives us immense pride to commission our second project in Oman during such difficult times. We feel honored to have the opportunity to support Shell and contribute to Oman’s journey of a clean and sustainable future.” 
The project, located on a 50-hectare site within Sohar Freezone, will save 25,000 tonnes of carbon emissions annually, thus reducing the dependency on natural gas resources and unlocking large-scale solar opportunities for the country. 
Previous Oman project
Last year, SWSL became the first Indian company to commission a solar photovoltaic (PV) project in Oman. The Amin Solar Project, with an installed capacity of 125 MWp, is Oman’s first renewables-based independent power project. It was also claimed to be the biggest single-unit solar park in the world to use bifacial modules.
The project—commissioned for Amin Renewable Energy Company—was supported by the Japanese-Omani consortium comprising Marubeni Corporation, Oman Gas Company, Bahwan Renewable Energy Company, and Nebras Power.
Sterling and Wilson Solar Limited has a solar portfolio of more than 10.6 GWp (including commissioned and under-construction projects) in various geographies. This portfolio includes a 1,177 MWp solar PV plant in Abu Dhabi—the world’s largest single-site solar plant. The company also manages an 8 GWp portfolio of operation and maintenance projects globally.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/27/coal-miner-singareni-collieries-mulling-300-mw-floating-solar/,"FLOATING SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,TELANGANA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 27, 2021",Coal miner Singareni Collieries mulling 300 MW floating solar,"Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), a state-owned coal miner, is planning to establish a 300 MW floating solar plant on Manair Dam reservoir in the Karimnagar district of the Indian State of Telangana.
SCCL chairman and managing director Sri N. Sridhar said recently that the company would set up the floating solar plant after getting permission from the government. 
A detailed investigation regarding the feasibility of the floating solar power plant project has reportedly been conducted already.
Sridhar added that the floating solar plant would be in addition to the ongoing 300 MW solar plants in SCCL areas. 
300 MW in execution
The first phase of the erection of solar power plants throughout Singareni areas is almost completed. 
Out of the 129 MW capacity planned in the first phase, 85 MW Singareni solar power has already been synchronized with the grid.
As per the CMD instructions, the balance 44 MW in the first phase will be completed by the end of next month. Erection of 90 MW plants in the second phase will be completed by May 2021.
The 300 MW solar plants [in SCCL areas], when completed, would generate about 500 million units of solar power. With this, the coal miner needs to purchase only 200 million units of power from the State electricity department. When compared with the present power charges, Singareni would be saving almost INR 120 crore.
