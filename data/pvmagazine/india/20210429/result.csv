The scheme, which provides an INR4,500-crore outlay over a five-year period, has been approved by the president of India and will be implemented by the MNRE through the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA).
IREDA will have the right to inspect the manufacturing units and offices of applicants and can call upon the National Institute of Solar Energy for help determining the efficiency and temperature co-efficients of modules manufactured by applicants for the incentive. If required, the MNRE can designate National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories-accredited labs for measurements. 
Beneficiaries of the PLI scheme will be selected through a bidding process after applicants are shortlisted based on parameters such as their proposed manufacturing capacity and module performance, and the extent to which operations would be integrated by manufacturing different elements of the module supply chain, from polysilicon down to finished panels.
Shortlisted applicants will lodge bids based on the level of PLI funding they will require for five years after their planned factories are commissioned.
Preference will be given to fully-integrated manufacturing plans, whether based on silicon, thin-film or a rival technology. The production of cells, as well as modules, is the minimum scale of integration required to be shortlisted, and a minimum annual production capacity of 1 GW for each step of the supply chain is also necessary.
The modules to be produced must offer a minimum efficiency of 19.5% with a Pmax temperature coefficient of better than -0.3% per degree Celsius, or a minimum module efficiency of 20% with a Pmax temperature coefficient equal to, or better than, -0.4% per degree Celsius.
Successful applicants to the PLI scheme will receive a maximum incentive tied to 2 GW of annual production capacity or half of the planned output of their facility, whichever is lower. That cap ensures at least three solar manufacturers can benefit from the INR4500 crore pot.
PLI cash will be paid out linked to actual production and sales of modules. If a manufacturer sells more product than the production line capacity they bid for, state backing will be limited to that latter figure.
If a successful applicant falls short of the integration-level or manufacturing capacity they bid for, no incentives will be paid until the shortfall is remedied.
The incentive will be tapered down over the five-year disbursement period, with the first year paying out the equivalent of 1.4 times an annual reference amount, the second year offering 1.2 times the base amount, the third year the standard baseline figure, the fourth 0.8 of that amount, and the final year 0.6 of that baseline annual figure.

The company will infuse an aggregate INR 150-crore fund into Revolt.
Revolt, promoted by Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma, has introduced India’s first artificial intelligence-enabled electric motorbike. Headquartered in Gurgaon, it has a manufacturing facility in Manesar, Haryana. Spread over 100,000 square feet, the facility boasts a production capacity of 120,000 vehicles commissioned for the first phase. The company’s turnover as of March 31, 2021 stood at INR 26.47 crore.
As part of the deal, RattanIndia Enterprises will have a 50% board presence in Revolt Intellicorp. Rajiv Rattan, founder and chairman of RattanIndia Group, will also serve as the chairman of the board of Revolt.
This deal happens to be RattanIndia Enterprises’ first investment in a new age manufacturing business. Revolt Intellicorp will leverage this collaboration to expand its footprint pan India.
Revolt will deploy the fresh capital to expand the distributor and service network pan India across 35 cities. In addition to this, the company will be leveraging Al to upscale and provide a 100% in-house developed world-class contactless experience for its customers.

The grant has been awarded to India’s Shivman Wind Energy, which chose EverGreen Power as the contract partner.
EverGreen, with its headquarters in Chicago (USA) and Mumbai (India), began operations in India in 2014. So far, it has executed and sold an aggregate 304.5 MW of renewable energy projects (wind 281.5 MW and solar 23 MW). Besides, it has a 1400 MW pipeline comprising 1100 MW hybrid, 200 MW wind, and 100 MW solar.
Battery Storage can be an attractive model for India in reducing carbon emissions, dispatching renewable energy during peak demand, enhancing energy security and contributing to the vision of clean and sustainable India.
The USTDA is funding the Gujarat project as part of its mission to promote sustainable infrastructure projects and foster economic growth in partner countries like India.
“Gujarat is one of India’s most promising states for wind and solar power generation. USTDA’s study will help Shivman tap into this significant potential by planning a new wind and solar power plant that will store energy using battery technology,” said Enoh T. Ebong, USTDA’s Acting Director. “Our support for this project puts into action a broader U.S. government policy to work with our overseas partners to set the world on a sustainable climate pathway. Moreover, this project has the potential to support significant exports of U.S.-based clean energy solutions.”
USTDA’s feasibility study will provide Shivman with critical wind and solar resource assessments and conceptual designs for energy storage, ensuring that the project will be a source of reliable, clean energy. The project’s hybrid design will mitigate renewable energy variability to help stabilize Gujarat’s regional electricity grid, increase overall efficiency, and lower electricity costs.

French cooperative Céléwatt has completed construction on a 250 kW solar park in Carayac, a commune in the Lot department in southwestern France.
The ground-mounted array was built with mounting structures made of raw oak wood, that was not processed in a sawmill. To optimize the mechanical characteristics of the rough wood and to avoid any discontinuity in the fibers, 600 oaks were cut, out of the growing season.
A first in France and in the world, this mounting structure concept was developed by French engineering company Mécojit. “After the final checks carried out by Mécojit, an Enedis technician made the connection at the end of the morning,” CéléWatt said in a press release. Enedis is France’s grid operator.
Less than 18 months elapsed between the filing of the project approval request and the first kilowatt-hour being produced which, according to Céléwatt, proves the feasibility of community and regional renewable energy. The project was also supported by French energy cooperative Enercoop, which will buy power from the plant at a price of €0.08/kWh.
“Our original idea was to promote local employment and natural resources,” Bertrand Delpeuch, the president of Céléwatt, told pv magazine in November. “As we had no room for maneuver on the origin of our 746 monocrystalline panels, which are delivered to us from China by the company Talesun, we decided to focus on the poles.”
The stability of the panels will be checked every three years with a visual inspection of the resistance of the wood and a general overhaul will be carried out during the ten-year maintenance work. Céléwatt stated that everything was done to maximize the array’s duration over time. “This is a very resistant and endogenous wood species, which will not fear weather fluctuations,” it added.

AirTouch’s water-free robotic cleaning systems will be deployed for three of ReNew Power‘s new solar PV plants in Rajasthan, India, which are scheduled to be commissioned by early 2022.
The contracts include the supply, erection, testing, commissioning, operation and maintenance of Airtouch robotic cleaning systems for 25 years.
The robotic cleaning systems for ReNew’s solar plants will be supplied from Airtouch’s production plant in Israel and the company’s manufacturing plant in India that is currently being established.
In January, AirTouch Solar, traded in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, completed a targeted fund-raising of over US$ 7 million from existing and strategic investors. In order to serve the fast-growing demand for its products, coming from new and existing customers, the company intends to double its manufacturing floor area and increase its capacity to achieve its fast-growing business goals.
