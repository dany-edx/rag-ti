Under the agreement, Cleantech Solar will construct 150 MW of photovoltaic (PV) solar and 16.8 MW of wind-generating assets in Tamil Nadu, India, supplying around 7.3 GWh of clean electricity to First Solar’s new 3.3 GW vertically integrated solar manufacturing facility, also located in Tamil Nadu.
When fully commissioned by the third quarter of 2024, the solar and wind generation assets are expected to meet up to 70% of the facility’s anticipated electricity needs. They are expected to displace almost 7,000 kilotons of CO2 emissions over the PPA duration.
Cleantech Solar will procure 150 MW of advanced, India-made Series 7 thin-film solar panels from First Solar, for use in the PV component of the PPA project. The modules are expected to be delivered in the first half of 2024.
First Solar’s cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film modules have among the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV module today. The modules are included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) registry for sustainable electronics, signifying strong performance on metrics evaluating the management of substances in the product, manufacturing energy and water use, product packaging, end-of-life recycling and corporate responsibility.
“Our new manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu sets a high benchmark for responsible and sustainable vertically integrated solar manufacturing, not just in India, but globally,” said Sujoy Ghosh, vice president and manging director, First Solar, India. “By powering our operations with clean, renewably-generated electricity, we are working to further reduce our environmental footprint, which is already the lowest in the industry.”
First Solar’s Tamil Nadu plant, located in an area of high baseline water stress, is purportedly the world’s first net-zero water withdrawal solar manufacturing facility. The facility is designed to minimize its impact on local water resources and will rely entirely on tertiary treated reverse osmosis water from the city’s sewage treatment plant and have zero wastewater discharge. Additionally, the factory is home to India’s first photovoltaic (PV) solar recycling plant. The company pioneered high-value solar recycling, which provides closed-loop semiconductor recovery for use in new modules, while also recovering other materials including aluminium, glass, and laminates.
“This collaboration extends beyond powering First Solar’s flagship manufacturing facility in India; it involves leveraging their advanced, ultra-low carbon thin film solar panels to energize our solar assets,” said Sachin Jain, chief executive officer, Cleantech Solar.
With this latest agreement, Cleantech Solar’s total portfolio in Tamil Nadu now stands at nearly 500 MW (including solar, wind and hybrid power projects under operational and construction stages).
Headquartered in Singapore, Cleantech Solar has numerous solar and wind projects across India and Southeast Asia, with around 1.2 GWp of assets in operations, construction and development stages. The company is backed by long-term strategic shareholders – Keppel Corporation, Keppel Asia Infrastructure Fund and Shell Singapore.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/04/bangladeshs-solar-project-approvals-hit-2-1-gw-in-2023/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,BANGLADESH",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 4, 2024",Bangladesh’s solar project approvals hit 2.1 GW in 2023,"Power-hungry Bangladesh approved 2.19 GW of large-scale PV projects in 2023.
In December alone, Bangladesh’s Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase (CCGP) approved tariffs for seven solar power plants totaling 630 MW. Approvals were granted for 200 MW in November, 310 MW in October, 570 MW in September, 300 MW in August, 66 MW in April, and 120 MW in January 2023. Most of these projects secured a fixed tariff of around $0.10/kWh.
The largest solar plant given approval last year was a 300 MW array, to be set up by a consortium of Saudi-based ACWA Power and locally owned Comfit Composite Knit, Viyellatex Spinning, and Midland East Power.
The second-largest solar power plant secured approval in December. The 240 MW facility will be set up in Mymensingh in northern Bangladesh by a joint venture between Energon Renewables (BD) and PWR Energy Trading LLC.
In September, the government approved a 200 MW floating and ground-mounted solar power plant near the Barapukuria coal mine in Dinajpur district. A consortium of China’s Hangzhou Boiler and Max Infrastructure secured approval in October to jointly set up a 180 MW facility in Jamalpur district.
This increase in projects is likely due to new measures that were recently introduced to help domestic independent power producers build and operate new renewable energy plants.
Dipal C Barua, chief adviser of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, expressed high hopes that green power will have a significant share in country’s total energy mix.
“The government is providing utmost importance to renewable energy in changed global economic scenario,” Barua told pv magazine.
Barua said that the recently approved solar power plants are well-prepared, and sponsor companies must submit applications for government approval, ensuring successful commissioning.
