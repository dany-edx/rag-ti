The Group’s priority in the new energy business is to deliver a fully integrated end-to-end solar PV manufacturing ecosystem. “This will be one of the world’s largest, most technologically advanced, flexible, and cost-competitive solar gigafactory globally and will be converting sand into solar PV modules,” said Ambani while addressing RIL’s 46th Annual General Meeting. 
The solar PV gigafactory will manufacture modules, cells, wafers, ingots, polysilicon, and glass at a single location in Jamnagar. It will deploy heterojunction technology (HJT) to manufacture one of the highest-efficiency solar PV cells and modules globally for utility-scale and rooftop power generation.
Ambani said they target to bring this factory on stream in a phased manner by the end of 2025.
Further, the Group will leverage its engineering and construction capabilities and giga-scale manufacturing ecosystem to accelerate and enable the installation of at least 100 GW of renewable energy generation by 2030.
Ambani added that RIL is concurrently focused on setting up a battery gigafactory by 2026. The battery gigafab will manufacture battery chemicals, cells and packs, leading up to containerized energy storage solutions, and will include a battery recycling facility to deliver an integrated ecosystem. 
“We will start with lithium ferro phosphate (LFP) technology, which has been proven at scale for safety, stability, and life, targeting to produce LFP-based solutions at world-beating lifecycle costs,” said Ambani.
“Simultaneously, RIL is focused on fast-tracking commercialization of sodium-ion battery technology. We will build on our technology leadership position by industrializing sodium-ion cell production at megawatt level by 2025 and rapidly scale up to gigawatt scale thereafter.”
RIL will deploy energy storage at megawatt scale with wind and solar power generation in the next few quarters at Jamnagar. This will be followed by grid-scale deployment of batteries to make power available round-the-clock for the company’s captive requirements and for India’s growing energy needs.
RIL is also setting up a fully integrated, automated giga-scale electrolyzer manufacturing facility. “This will enable us to establish large-scale green hydrogen production at Jamnagar, gradually transition our captive requirements, and simultaneously integrate with green ammonia and green methanol production for domestic and international markets,” said Ambani.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/28/multi-day-energy-storage-increases-grid-capacity-by-factor-of-10/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",,"AUGUST 28, 2023",Multi-day energy storage increases grid capacity by factor of 10,"From pv magazine USA
Boston-based startup Form Energy recently announced it has been awarded a $12 million grant from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to deploy a 10 MW/1000 MWh pilot battery project in New York by 2026. This will be Form Energy’s first grid-scale project in the state following similar announcements in Colorado and Minnesota.
Form Energy’s iron-air battery technology can deliver 100 hours of discharge at system costs competitive with conventional power plants. The multi-day duration positions it well to help New York meet its ambitious clean energy targets – a clean grid by 2040.
NYSERDA awarded the grant as part of its $17 million long-duration energy storage program, intended to accelerate commercialization of promising long-duration technologies. New York has set a goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 and will need technologies like multi-day storage to ensure reliability during extended lulls in wind and solar generation.
“Our analysis indicates that multi-day storage has significant potential to help New York meet its decarbonization and grid reliability goals,” said Mateo Jaramillo, CEO of Form Energy. “This grant allows us to accelerate deployment of our first multi-day battery system in New York and sets the path for us to deliver further multi-day storage projects in the State in the future.”
An analysis recently released by Form Energy provides further evidence that multi-day energy storage like its iron-air technology can substantially reduce the costs for New York to achieve its ambitious decarbonization targets.
The analysis used advanced modeling techniques to compare multiple scenarios with varying availability of energy storage durations. It found that including both long-duration (10 to 24 hour) and multi-day (>24 hour) storage in the mix of resources available to meet New York’s goals reduces total system costs in 2040 by 29% compared to relying solely on short-duration lithium-ion batteries.
In the models with only short-duration lithium-ion batteries available, over 60 GW of battery capacity is built by 2040 to shift renewable generation and meet peak demand. However, this capacity only provides 538 GWh of energy storage.
Whereas when long-duration and multi-day storage are available, total storage capacity needs drop to around 40 GW. But critically, total energy storage capacity grows nearly 10x to over 5,000 GWh. These large energy reserves allow the grid to smooth multi-day variability in renewable generation. The emphasis on iron-air storage also avoids the potential fire-hazard of lithium batteries. According to Julian Spector at Canary Media, three separate fires at lithium battery facilities in New York owned by Nextera and Convergent Energy have left the state’s Governor Hochul scrambling to assure local residents that the transition to a clean grid is safe and healthy.
Models show 35 GW of multi-day storage capacity is optimal by 2040. This includes 19 GW of iron-air batteries (or equivalent) plus 16 GW of hydrogen storage. In tandem with 4 GW of lithium-ion batteries and pumped hydro storage, this diverse portfolio of storage durations provides the flexibility to shift renewable energy across multiple timescales.
Multi-day storage charges during periods of excess renewable generation and then discharges steadily for days or weeks during extended lulls, effectively firming the variable output. For example, during one modeled offshore wind lull, wind generation was only 33% of average for a full week. Multi-day storage supplied 16% of total demand that week by drawing from its vast energy reserves.
This ability to firm renewable generation translates into major cost savings. With multi-day storage available, models show New York’s 2040 electric system can be decarbonized with 22% less lithium-ion storage capacity, 36% less nuclear generation, and 6% less solar capacity. The 29% cumulative cost reduction underscores the value provided by long-duration and multi-day storage.

The analysis shows long-duration storage begins providing significant value as early as 2030. Including 4.8 GW of multi-day storage in 2030 resource plans reduces costs by 6% annually, while avoiding the need for 5 GW of <10 hour batteries and 5 GW of solar generation. This demonstrates near-term policy support will be crucial to accelerate deployment of emerging long-duration storage technologies in the next 5-7 years.
Overall, the white paper provides compelling evidence that long-duration and multi-day energy storage can cost-effectively firm New York’s growing renewable generation, ensuring a reliable grid during the transition to 100% carbon-free electricity. Form Energy’s iron-air battery is well-suited for this application and the NYSERDA grant will facilitate demonstration of a pilot system by 2026.
Looking ahead, Form Energy projects New York will require at least 3 GW per year of new multi-day storage capacity between 2030 and 2040. Near term policy action to establish incentives, market mechanisms and contract structures will give the private sector needed market signals to invest in manufacturing and project development for emerging technologies like iron-air batteries. Then these resources can be deployed at scale to maximize cost savings and grid reliability as New York pursues its ambitious decarbonization timeline.

Japanese researchers, led by the University of Tokyo and the Artificial Photosynthetic Chemical Process Technology Research Association (ARPChem), claim to have achieved a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency above 10% in a water-splitting system. They used a photoelectrode with a tantalum nitride nanorod structure and a dual copper-indium-selenium (CuInSe2) solar cell with a platinum-nickel electrocatalyst for hydrogen generation. The system’s tandem configuration achieved a reproducible STH efficiency of approximately 12% – the highest among photocatalytic materials. Although promising for commercialization, the researchers said that further work is needed to enhance the photoanode’s stability and protection.
NewHydrogen has partnered with UC Santa Barbara to research an efficient thermochemical water splitting process for green hydrogen production using heat. CEO Steve Hill noted the cost-effectiveness of renewable heat sources like concentrated solar and geothermal, including waste heat from various industrial processes and power plants.
University of Warwick researchers, in collaboration with scientists from the University of Manchester, have demonstrated the unexpected permeability of graphene to protons, proving that its crystalline structure accelerates proton transport. They outlined their findings in “Proton transport through nanoscale corrugations in two-dimensional crystals,” which was recently published in Nature. They said that their use of scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) revealed proton currents accelerated around nanoscale wrinkles, providing greater permeation space through the crystal lattice.
Schmid Group has secured n equipment order from an undisclosed green hydrogen company. The German specialist said it will provide equipment for one of the world’s largest electrolysis factories. Wet chemical plant systems will be supplied under the contract, which is scheduled for installation in the first half of 2024. “The machines play an important role in the production of central components made of stainless steel, which are subsequently assembled into stacks during further processing,” said Schmid Group. “These stacks will in turn be integrated into the electrolysers used to produce green hydrogen.”
