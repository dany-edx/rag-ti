Scientists from the Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology in Bangladesh have designed a lead-free titanium-based inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on a cesium titanium (IV) bromide (Cs2TiBr6) perovskite absorber.
The scientists optimized a perovskite solar cell using SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent. The cell features a hole transport layer (HTL) of copper and antimony trisulfide (CuSbS2). It also has various electron transport layer (ETL) configurations, including indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), zinc oxide (ZnO), CeOx, tungsten disulfide (WS2), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and cadmium telluride (CdTe).
The researchers fine-tuned the cell by analyzing factors such as thickness, carrier density, defect density, bandgap, temperature, and resistance.
The optimized cell used a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a ZnO ETL, and achieved a 26.96% efficiency with an open-circuit voltage of 1.0478 V, 31.6486 mA/cm2 short-circuit density, and an 81.35% fill factor under standard illumination.
“Results also indicate that the IGZO and CeOx are showing a similar performance as compared to ZnO,” the scientists said in the paper, adding that the ideal energy bandgap of the perovskite absorber layer was 1.4 V. “Due to its decreased ability to absorb sunlight, a device with an absorber bandgap that is larger or lower than the optimal value of 1.4 eV is undesirable for solar cell applications.”
They described the new cell design in “Numerical investigation of lead free Cs2TiBr6 based perovskite solar cell with optimal selection of electron and hole transport layer through SCAPS-1D simulation,” which was recently published in Results in Optics.
“It is expected that this study’s results will play a role in the development of reliable and highly efficient PSCs that are free from the use of lead or any other type of toxic materials,” the paper concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/01/how-are-solar-panels-made-and-how-are-they-recycled/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RECYCLING,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023","How are solar panels made, and how are they recycled? ","Gigawatts of solar farms are being installed throughout the world. But have you ever wondered how solar panels are manufactured? 
Solar panels are made of solar cells, connected using metal connectors, and these cells are made of silica-extracted sand. The sand has to be purified to 99.99%. Silicon, after oxygen, is the second most abundant element present in the crust. Despite the abundance, what limits us is the high cost and the high energy required for converting sand into high-grade silicon. The high-purity silicon is produced in an arc furnace by heating the sand at temperatures of around 2000 degrees Celsius. 
After this process, the silicon is obtained in the form of rocks. These rocks are then melted to form ingots. Boron is added to give silicon a positive electrical polarity. After the ingot has cooled down, it is ground and polished, leaving it with flat sides.  
Monocrystalline cells are manufactured from one crystal of silicon. Whereas polycrystalline cells are made by melting multiple silicon crystals together. Monocrystalline panels have higher efficiency than polycrystalline panels, therefore having a higher price.  
The ingots are then sliced into thin disks called wafers, after which an anti-reflective coating is put on the wafer to reduce the shininess; otherwise, it would reflect rather than absorb. Thereafter metal conductors are added to each surface. Phosphorus is then put as a thin layer over the surface, charging it with a negative electrical orientation. The boron-phosphorus duo gives the panel a p-n (positive-negative) junction.   
After the cells are put together, a thin layer of glass is added on the front side, and a durable back sheet made of polymer is attached at the back, which safeguards the panels from electrical harm and moisture. The panels are then attached to solar frames or solar support using adhesives. Finally, modules are tested to assess their power, efficiency, power output, etc. On an average, solar panels have a life of 25 years. But what after 25 years? 
There have been many narratives floating around about how too many panels, at the end of their lifetime are going to cause an overload of toxic trash. Stating there are no challenges whatsoever would be a gross oversimplification of things. There is a fundamental mismatch between the sheer volume of solar installations versus the recycling facilities existing today. The renewable future is not just about rampant installations, it is also about assessing what catapulting effects such changes can have. 
So what exactly happens in a recycling facility? First, the panels are separated from the aluminium frames and electric boxes. Then the glass is detached from the panels. Then valuable materials such as silver and copper are extracted from them. Advancements in robotics and AI have made the disassembling of panels quicker and more cost-effective.   
Panels contain toxic materials like lead. If dumped in landfills, they can cause environmental pollution. And recycling is much more expensive; to counter this what could be done is the cost of recycling should be factored in formulating a budget, to appropriate the price at which panels are sold. It has been only recently that governments across the world are focusing on building recycling capacities. 
In India, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has added the treatment of solar waste under electronic waste (e-waste) management. Even in the USA, recycling of panels wasn’t mandated until very recently. The volume of decommissioned PV panels across the world is predicted to rise to 5 million metric tons per year. 
The demand for recycled materials derived from the panels is set to skyrocket. The recycling market is touted to be worth 2.7 billion dollars by 2030. If by 2050 we manage to develop an efficient system of recycling worldwide, we could produce 2 billion new panels, just by using recycled materials.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/01/investigators-still-uncertain-about-cause-of-30-kwh-battery-explosion-in-germany/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023",Investigators still uncertain about cause of 30 kWh battery explosion in Germany,"From pv magazine Germany
Around three weeks ago, the explosion of a 30 kWh battery storage system caused a stir in Lauterbach, in the central German state of Hesse. The system owner is an electronics technician specializing in energy and building services, with 20 years of professional experience.
His home was destroyed in the explosion and it has not been habitable since. It is now in acute danger of collapsing, which is why police and insurance investigators do not dare to enter. This makes it impossible to determine the cause of the explosion with 100% certainty. The house will soon be demolished.
The homeowner told pv magazine that the battery energy storage system consisted of three battery packs from Shenzhen Basen Technology. He bought two in June 2022 and an additional one in June 2023 via the Alibaba platform. They are the “BR-48200B” and “MY-381” models, each with 10 kWh of capacity based on LFP technology housed in a 19-inch cabinet.
The battery system was coupled with a 15.47 kW photovoltaic system, which the homeowner was about to expand to 19.565 kW, and two different inverters: Victron’s Multiplus II 5000 and Solax X1 4.2. The cause of the explosion has yet to be clarified, and there were no electrical clues, according to the homeowner. Right before the accident, the battery’s state of charge (SOC) was 90.2% and the voltage stood at 52.41 V.

After the explosion, the basement – which housed both the boiler and the battery system – was filled with white smoke. However, there were “hardly any signs of fire” near the battery storage unit, according to the homeowner. “The inverters on the other side of the room look like new,” he said.
Long after the incident, the homeowner noticed an odor that he described as the smell of lithium. He is now trying to determine whether it is makes sense to carry out safety tests outdoors for outdoor-use devices, as the smoke can evaporate and be overlooked. Now, the question is which gas caused the explosion, whether it originated inside or outside the battery, and how it happened.
pv magazine contacted two scientists, but the were unable to comment on the specific incident due to the ongoing investigation. Egbert Figgemeier, chair of aging processes and battery lifetime prediction at RWTH Aachen, said that it is conceivable that the electrolyte in the cells broke down and an internal short circuit ignited the gases.
“An external ignition source is not necessary,” said Figgemeier.
He described the white smoke as the decomposition products of the electrolyte, which can also contain dangerous gases. Soot formation is not necessarily to be expected, as many components of the cells could burn without leaving any residue at high temperatures. So-called thermal runaway could have preceded the explosion and may have been the trigger.
Axel Durdel, a researcher at the Technical University of Munich, told pv magazine that in a “worst-case scenario,” an LFP battery could leak hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ethene, methane and other gases. There has been a lot of discussion about the possible formation of hydrogen with a subsequent explosion. In principle, this is possible, but whether the conditions for spontaneous combustion have been reached cannot be estimated, according to Durdel.
He said it is not known that batteries could cause such an explosion without a thermal reaction. In the case of thermal reaction, the internal pressure could increase due to undesirable side reactions, leading to an explosion and the release of hot gases.
“In the case of batteries with a lower energy density or a low state of charge, it is entirely possible that the gas does not ignite directly when it exits the battery, but that the ignition occurs through external ignition sources,” said Durdel.
In that case, there should be traces on the battery. However, this can no longer be verified because no one is allowed to enter the home due to the risk of collapse.
The storage owner has noted the problem of carrying out safety tests with lithium-ion storage devices outdoors. Figgemeier confirmed that such experiements are carried out in semi-open bunkers, rather than in closed rooms.
Durdel said that the standard-compliant safety tests for the lithium-ion cells are carried out almost exclusively in test rooms with appropriate filter systems. In principle, it is conceivable that gases could accumulate in the basement without an appropriate exhaust system. However, the scientist from the Technical University of Munich could not say whether this was sufficient for self-ignition.
Battery storage is generally safe when professionally installed and certified, with compatibility between systems ensured through testing and approval by inverter and battery manufacturers.
For integrated systems, this is done by the system integrator. The safety of these systems is evident in the low number of accidents reported among more than 1 million home battery storage installations in Germany. Monitoring systems, common among established manufacturers, further assist in the early detection of critical conditions.

Gasunie said this week that the authorities in the Netherlands have started building a national hydrogen network. Contractor Visser & Smit Hanab will build the first section of the national grid. From 2030, the national hydrogen network, which will cost around €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) to build, will connect major industrial areas across the country, as well as points in Germany and Belgium. Last year, the Dutch government contracted Gasunie to develop the hydrogen network. The first section, stretching over 30 kilometers, will be built in Rotterdam and will connect the Tweede Maasvlakte industrial park to Pernis. It is expected to be operational in 2025. Around 85% of the Dutch hydrogen network will feature repurposed natural gas pipelines.
Fortescue has invested close to NOK 100 million ($8.96 million) to acquire a 12.5% stake in Norwegian Hydrogen, making it the third largest shareholder. Norwegian Hydrogen is now building its first hydrogen plants in Hellesylt, Norway, and in Hjørring, Denmark.
ABB has supplied low-harmonic insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) rectifiers and DC-DC converters for the HyPilot project to achieve precise voltage and current control for simulating different operating regimes. This project aims to demonstrate Hystar’s 1MW containerized PEM electrolyzers and validate their patented technology in real field conditions. The demonstration will conclude by the end of 2023 at the Kårstø Gas Processing Plant in Rogaland, Norway, with ABB collaborating alongside Equinor, Yara, and Gassco.
Germany has started talks with Nigeria to import hydrogen. “Germany has a considerable demand for natural gas and, going forward, hydrogen to fuel its economy and energy transition,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a recent interview with Nigerian daily The Punch. “Concrete amounts should be agreed on in negotiations between Nigerian gas producers and German gas traders.” At a recent press conference, Scholz noted that Germany operates a hydrogen office in Nigeria and wants to support renewable energy expansion in the African country.
Duke Energy has announced plans to build and operate the first system in the United States to produce, store, and combust 100% green hydrogen in a combustion turbine. The system is the result of collaboration between Duke Energy, Sargent and Lundy, and GE Vernova. It will be located at Duke Energy Florida’s DeBary plant in Volusia County, Florida. The end-to-end system will begin with the existing 74.5 MW DeBary solar plant, providing clean energy for two 1 MW electrolyzer units.
