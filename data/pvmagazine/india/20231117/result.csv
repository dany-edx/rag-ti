The new approach uses a multi-string PV system with a converter control strategy that utilizes a direct duty cycle to track the maximum power point (MPP) under shade.
“This study proposes a reconfiguration of the PV system to suppress the negative impact of partial shading on the PV-system performance by dividing the PV system into multiple parallel strings,” the scientists explained. “In this work, the proposed system comprises four strings, with each string comprising three paralleled sub-strings.”
The proposed multi-maximum power point tracking (MMPPT) approach involves connecting each string to a DC-DC converter, optimizing power extraction from individual strings of PV solar panels. This differs from the tested single-MPPT (SMPPT) arrangement in a PV system, where a single converter is connected to parallel strings of solar panels.
The MMPPT approach uses a direct duty‑cycle control strategy to find the duty cycles of desired converters. Then, using direct duty-cycle control (DDCC), it adapts the duty-cycle of the DC-DC converter to the calculated results, regulating the produced power.

Calculating the desired duty cycle involves using the PV system’s existing sensors to estimate radiation, derived from changes in PV cell current and voltage.
“The proposed technique minimizes the overall system cost by reducing the number of the required sensors by utilizing a radiation estimation strategy,” the researchers said. “The DDCC technique boosts the overall system efficiency by the steady-state oscillations elimination, hardware simplification, and ease of implementation. Additionally, the DDCC has a fast-tracking speed for global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) extraction during partial shading conditions.”
The researchers presented the results of the comparison between the MMPPT and the SMPPT system in “Investigation of single and multiple MPPT structures of solar PV‑system under partial shading conditions considering direct duty‑cycle controller,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. The systems were simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK software, under three shade conditions.
All four PV strings were subjected to uniform irradiance of 1,000 W/m2 in the first shading pattern. In the second pattern, however, the first two strings had a constant irradiation profile of 1,000 W/m2, while the other two had a uniform irradiance profile of 1,000 W/m2 for half a second, and then stepped down to 500 W/m2 for another half a second.
In the third pattern, the first two strings were again under a uniform irradiance profile of 1,000 W/m2, while the remaining two started with 1000 W/m2 for 0.3 seconds, changed to 500 W/m2 for another 0.3 seconds and decreased to 250 w/m2 for 0.4 seconds.
“Under these conditions, the average efficiency of the SMPPT system is found to be 98.98%, while the MMPPT system achieves an efficiency of 99.81%. These findings validate the proposed approach,” the researchers concluded. “A real radiation dataset from Benban, a location in southern Egypt, is used in MMPPT configuration. The results demonstrate that the proposed control system enhances overall system effectiveness while reducing installation costs.”

FNB Gas says Germany’s hydrogen core network, spanning 9,700 km, will cost around €20 billion ($21.6 billion) by 2032. The transmission system operator said that repurposing existing natural gas pipelines for the hydrogen network will be a cost-effective and rapid approach. The privately financed project has support from the German government through various programs, including subsidies to expedite planning procedures.
Tree Energy Solutions has presented the $4 billion Projet Mauricie in Canada, featuring an electrolyzer and 1 GW of renewable energy assets. The Belgian startup said that, upon commissioning in 2028, the project will produce 70,000 tons of green hydrogen exclusively for end users in Quebec. Approximately one-third of the green hydrogen will target long-haul transportation, with the rest to be used for electric renewable natural gas (e-NG) production.
H-TEC has delivered a 1 MW PEM electrolyzer to Hydrogen Lab Bremerhaven (HLB), a Fraunhofer Institute research project in Germany. The electrolyzer is part of a test field focusing on wind energy for hydrogen production. The test infrastructure at HLB allows scientists to explore the interaction between wind turbines and electrolyzers under real-life conditions. It said that PEM electrolysis is selected for its adaptability to fluctuating energy sources like wind energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/17/residential-pv-for-urban-loads-as-an-antidote-to-solar-curtailment/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 17, 2023",Residential PV for urban loads as an antidote to solar curtailment,"A group of researchers at the Netherlands’ Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) has proposed the use of power generated by residential PV systems for traction substations and nearby residential loads, in an effort to reduce curtailment.
Residential PV curtailment is on the rise in the Netherlands, due to increasing grid capacity issues, as recently reported by Dutch power and gas supplier Liander. The company said there was an increase in curtailment events from 1,074 in the first half of 2022 to 3,476 in the same period this year, with Gelderland and Noord-Holland being the most affected regions. Liander said it also expects curtailment to rise further as more PV systems are installed, particularly with the phase-out of the net-metering scheme in 2025.
The scientists said the integration of PV systems in urban traction grids such as trams or trolleybuses poses a series of challenges. One major issue is represented by the fact that these loads are stochastic and unpredictable due to the movement of the vehicle. Then, when a vehicle moves from one substation to another, the load disappears abruptly from the first substation.
“Traction grids are particular grids with no base loads and with high, unpredictable power peaks caused by vehicle acceleration,” they explained.
In residential loads, by contrast, a base load is present, although there are no load peaks during peak PV power generation periods.
“Therefore, there is an expected synergy in coupling traction substations and nearby residential loads in increasing the overall matching between load and generation,” the academics stated. “Furthermore, rooftop PV systems can offer physical installation space otherwise, which is otherwise scarcely available in urban environments for the transport grids.”
In the proposed system configuration, traction substations and nearby households form a single load entity via the low-voltage AC grid. The residential PV systems of a given area supply first the closest residential loads and then send surplus power through the low-voltage connection to the nearby traction loads.
Through a series of simulations, the research group found that the system has a positive effect on both low and high-traffic substations when sharing a PV system with any number of households.
“This means that a shared, multi-stakeholder system offers less of a need for storage, curtailment, and grid exchange, as well as a net benefit in the direct load coverage per installed capacity,” the researchers said. “This meant that the return on the investment in a share of a combined system brings more load coverage than having installed a dedicated PV system to one stakeholder of the size of that share.”
Looking forward, the scientists said they have to identify an optimal sizing method to the number of connected households and PV system size at a traction substation. They presented their findings in “A shared PV system for transportation and residential loads to reduce curtailment and the need for storage systems,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
In 2019, UK-based climate change charity 10:10 developed a demonstrator solar array in partnership with Community Energy South and national rail infrastructure operator Network Rail. According to its developers, a solar plant can theoretically be connected to any traction substation and supply from five to 10 km of the track in either direction.
In March 2022, the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) unveiled a plan to deploy photovoltaic power solutions for the Gautrain system – an 80 km rail system in Gauteng linking Johannesburg, Pretoria, Ekurhuleni, and the O.R. Tambo International Airport.
In related solar train news, the Swiss South Eastern Railway AG (SOB) commissioned a feasibility study from Swiss CMT AG a few years ago, with the aim of reducing its energy requirements and operating costs. It found that solar PV is “well-suited” for installation on the roofs of train stations, halls, and the soundproofed walls along railway lines.
Another recent study by Indian NGO Climate Trends and UK green-tech startup Riding Sunbeams suggested self-generated solar power would be an optimal way of helping Indian Railways meet its 2030 net-zero target, given the rapid cut in carbon emissions and cost advantages it would offer.
