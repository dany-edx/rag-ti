Greenko is developing the Gandhisagar pumped storage project with a storage capacity of 10,080 MWh.
A consortium led by Larsen & Toubro will execute the civil and hydromechanical works of the project under a timeline of 30 months.
“Upon completion, the project will be one of the largest clean energy projects of its kind in India,” stated Larsen & Toubro.
The project will comprise two reservoirs, the existing Gandhi Sagar reservoir as the lower reservoir and an upper reservoir to be constructed near Khemla block village (about 75 km from Neemuch).
“The project involves constructing an upper dam (to form the upper reservoir), intake structure with approach channel, steel lined buried penstock/pressure shaft (vertical and horizontal), surface powerhouse, draft tube tunnel, tailrace outlet structure, tailrace channel, etc,” stated Larsen & Toubro.

The company claims its robotic solution leads to up to 10% more generation output than biweekly wet cleaning.
The robot uses ultra-soft microfiber cleaning fins that combine airflow and a controlled impact to flick off the dust particles from the panels without any damage to their anti-reflective coating.
Besides cleaning dust and debris, the robot can also clean off bird dropping deposits. The robot can achieve 80-90% reduction in bird dropping deposits in four cleaning cycles, as per the company.
The robot is powered by an on-board lithium battery and can complete a single cleaning cycle of a 1 MWp solar plant under 2.5 hours. The robot battery takes less than two hours to charge fully.
For battery charging, a solar charging-based docking station is provided at the end of the solar row. The docking station houses a self-executing charging connector that automatically latches when the robot arrives after cleaning.
The machine’s dual-drive system with real-time orientation control helps to overcome panel-to-panel irregularities up to 40 mm.
The robots are equipped with automotive-grade components and 4G based communication system. These are centrally managed and controlled via the company’s proprietary web application to ensure peak performance, zero downtime, and predictive maintenance.
The robots come with a standard battery size of 12Ah/25.6V, which supports up to three hours of cleaning time. These are also available with extended battery range of 18 Ah/25.6V, which supports up to 4.5 hours of cleaning time.
The machine has dimensions of 4,500x660x370 mm and weighs 45 kg (for the standard range).

Ltd (APDCL) has invited bids from consultants to provide services for 1 GW of grid-connected solar power project in Assam. It is implementing this project at Karbi Anglong district under Mukhya Mantri Sauro Shakti Prokolp through Asian Development Bank (ADB) funding.
The prospective consultant will prepare detailed project reports, with land topography data provided by APDCL. The consultant will grade the land and quantify the requirement of land filling/levelling/excavation for the development of solar power plant. Based on the land area available and suitable technology assessment, it will suggest installation capacity of the solar power plant in the proposed land.
The consultant will also work out the detailed technical specification, rating and capacity of the various project components like solar PV modules, PCUs, mounting structures, and balance of systems required for execution of the project.
“The scopes of services include study, investigation and preparation of report of the available characteristics of land topography, soil and sub soil environment, ambient conditions, water and preparation of a detailed master plan to suit the requirement of the solar project, complete with all the infrastructure facilities including solar PV modules, mounting structures, and PCUs, transformers,” as per the tender document.

Comunidad de Regantes de Águilas, a Spanish irrigation community, recently completed the installation of a floating PV plant on one of its irrigation ponds in the municipality of Águilas, in the southern Spanish region of Murcia.
The 786 kW floating array features 4,256 Isifloating 4.0 floats from Isigenere. The floating structures support 1,728  solar panels, each with a nominal power of 455 W.
Due to the dimensions of the pond, a flexible joint has also been designed along the entire floating platform. In addition, the PV installation is directly attached to the outer slopes of the pond via aluminum profile supports. This installation, together with the floating one, provides electricity to the pumps to lift the pond and part of the desalination plant.
The installation is the second floating PV project to support water pumping in Spain. In September, the Sur-Andévalo Irrigation Community in the southern province of Huelva completed the installation of a 1.6 MW floating solar plant for this purpose. The system, which was built on a pond in the municipality of Cartaya, features floats provided by Isigenere and 3,584 solar panels, each with a rated power of 450 W.
In March, the Spanish government submitted a royal decree to regulate the installation of floating PV plants. According to its estimates, around 7.5 GW of floating solar capacity could be deployed on public bodies of water.
