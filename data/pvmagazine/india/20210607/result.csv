Each of the railway zones which will host solar capacity will sign 25-year power purchase agreements with the successful solar developers.
The projects—to be set up on a build, own, operate basis—will be constructed in Gujarat (which will host 317 MW), Bihar (109 MW), Rajasthan (84 MW), Madhya Pradesh (83 MW), Chhattisgarh (71 MW), West Bengal (38 MW), Maharashtra (19 MW), Uttar Pradesh (15 MW), and Punjab (4 MW).
Successful bidders in the tender will be responsible for securing grid connections for their projects.
The procurement exercise mandates the use only of Indian-made solar cells and modules and developers must ensure the panels are eventually disposed of in line with the “e-waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011” notified by the government.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/07/solex-orders-1-2-gw-solar-module-production-line/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 7, 2021",Solex orders 1.2 GW solar module production line,"Gujarati company Solex Energy has signed a deal for 1.2 GW of solar module production equipment from China’s Jinchen Machinery as it plans to expand output. 
The 600 MW first phase of the fab will be commissioned by October, according to the manufacturer. A memorandum of understanding signed with Jinchen stipulates the installation of phase two will begin as soon as the initial production capacity goes into operation.
The production line, which is being installed near Surat, will be fully automated and capable of manufacturing panels based on wafers up to 210mm in size and featuring multi-busbar cells and micro-gap technology.
Solex intends to take a ‘backward integration’ approach to expanding its production capacity as it will develop a solar cell production facility after the module line is completed.
The company is one of India’s oldest PV module manufacturers and has had a production plant at Anand, in Gujarat, since 2007. Solex is listed on the National Stock Exchange.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/07/longi-achieves-25-21-efficiency-for-topcon-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 7, 2021",Longi achieves 25.21% efficiency for TOPCon solar cell,"From pv magazine International
Chinese PV module maker Longi announced it was able to improve the efficiency of its tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cell by 0.12% in just one month.
According to the manufacturer, the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH), Germany, has confirmed that the efficiency of its commercial-sized monocrystalline, n-type, bifacial product has been raised from 25.09% to 25.21%. No technical details were disclosed on how the result was achieved.
Longi also announced it achieved two more efficiency records.
It claimed to have reached a power conversion efficiency of 25.02% for a p-type monocrystalline bifacial TOPCon solar cell and explained it is the first time that a cell based on this technology surpasses the 25% barrier. Furthermore, it said to have achieved a 25.26% efficiency for a monocrystalline heterojunction solar cell.
The manufacturer added that both results were confirmed by the ISFH and did not give an explanation for the technical improvements.
“With the ambitious goals we have set for ourselves, our approach is to stay close to the essence of technology by selecting the best technical route, maximizing product performance potential and proactively ushering in the changes needed to achieve the technical transformation,” said Li Hua, head of the company’s Cell R&D Center.
Longi is currently the world’s biggest solar manufacturer, by market value and sales revenue, and shipped 24.5 GW of panels last year to generate revenue of RMB54.58 billion ($8.43 billion). At the turn of the year, the company boasted annual production capacities of 85 GW, 30 GW and 50 GW for its mono wafers, cells and panels, respectively.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/07/solar-powered-cold-storage-as-a-service/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,OFF-GRID SOLAR,BIHAR",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 7, 2021",Solar-powered cold storage as a service ,"Oorja Development Solutions, a decentralized solar solutions provider, has launched solar-powered cold storage as a service in the Muzaffarpur district of Bihar. The cooling service, called “Oonnayan,” allows small and marginal farmers to store their perishable horticulture produce on a per-crate-per-day basis without paying the high upfront cost of technology acquisition. 
To deploy this service, Oorja teamed up with Ecozen Solutions, a supplier of ‘Ecofrost’ range of decentralized solar cold rooms. Ecozen installed and commissioned the system and also provided training to run and operate the system. Oorja owns and operates the cold room and is responsible for farmer mobilization, customer acquisition, daily operations, repairs and maintenance, and payment collections for the service. 
Cooling-as-a-service is quite significant for India, where around 20-30% of produce is wasted after harvest due to the non-availability of nearby cold storage facilities. Running cold storage facilities requires regular electricity but grid electricity in rural areas is often unreliable. 
Solar-powered cold storage systems provide a solution, but these have found limited adoption among farmers as these systems require an upfront investment of typically around INR 12–15 lakh (US$ 16,000 – 20,000) per unit for a 5 MT solar-powered cold storage. 
“While the government provides capital subsidies, these subsidies are generally available only to individual farmers up to 35-50%. The remainder of the project costs must be met by the farmer, making them inaccessible to most of the farming population,” said Clementine Chambon, Oorja Development Solutions co-founder and chief technology officer.
“Under “Oonnayan”, cooling is available as a service: farmers can buy access to refrigerated space within a cold room installed conveniently at the market gate. They pay according to the amount of produce stored, usually for several days or weeks. Cooling as-a-service will allow farmers to store their produce without spoilage, extend the shelf life and the visual appearance of produce, and enable them to fetch a higher market price instead of making a distress sale immediately after harvest,” Clementine added.

The Ecofrost solar-powered micro cold storage can accommodate about 5-6 metric tonnes of perishable produce. It relies on a polycrystalline solar panel array of 5 kWp capacity mounted on the container roof and stores power using phase-change-material-based thermal energy storage rather than conventional batteries or diesel. The thermal energy storage system can provide cooling backup for up to 36 hours in cloudy weather. 
The system can also operate off the grid or generator set. In extended cloudy periods, the solar cold storage room will automatically switch to the available alternative power supply. Oorja has opted for grid backup as the most low-carbon backup power source. 
Ecofrost charges itself completely with just 5-6 hours of grid power. The system can be operated and monitored remotely via an Android App. The Internet of Things (IOT)-enabled app provides real-time data on the produce stored in the system and predictive maintenance alerts, reducing downtime. 
The system maintains a controlled interior temperature of 4-13°C and high humidity up to 85-95% to prevent the perishable produce from any rapid degradation.
