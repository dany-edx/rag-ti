In our first article of our Solar 101 series, (Is my roof ready for solar?) we discussed the age of our roof and how it affects the finances involved in a solar installation.
Now, we’ll consider the roof’s physical characteristics. After all, the roofing material type and its underlying structure, as well the various angles of its faces and layout, will affect many aspects of the installation.
Most rooftops in the United States are built up from plywood and finished with asphalt shingles. However, depending on your region and neighborhood aesthetic, the top layer of the roofing type can vary greatly. We often find Spanish tiles in the south, metal seam roofs in the far north, and clay, slate, and concrete tile products peppered all over the map.
All of these roof types will require a mechanical attachment.
QuickMountPV offers up an installation guide – with a very nice series of images – for those installing solar power on top of tiled roofs.
In this installation tweet from Sunrun, you can see how to attach to the plywood base layer of a roof. Underneath the metal flashing, you can see a series of lag bolts and silicon that cures and seals the attachment.
A metal seam roof will also require a hard attachment to the roof, but via a less obtrusive tool, perhaps by someone like S-5!. This quick video by S-5! gives an idea of how that attachment occurs.
But most installations won’t be like these three examples. They will use standard flashing and lag bolts drilled through the existing asphalt shingles.
All major racking manufacturers provide this hardware. Quickbolt offers a unique – almost cute – “microflashing” unit. This is as simple as it gets: drill hole, install sealant, tighten fastener.
Racking hardware connects your panels to the L-feet and the flashing connections mentioned above. All of this hardware is built to engineering specifications and are ready to hold up to the worst that Mother Nature can deliver.
In South Florida, the local building code requires some rooftop solar systems within a mile of the ocean to be able to withstand uplift generated by winds greater than 180 miles per hour. In the northern United States, snow loads greater than 50 pounds per square foot must be accounted for.
Wind and snow loads dictate a lot about how your solar system is designed. Racking manufacturer Unirac includes general solar panel setback from the edge of roof requirements in its installation manuals.
In the images below, the areas where wind forces are highest are represented in gray. Thus, engineers suggest we ‘”set back” our solar panels from these areas, or pay extra for hardware to strengthen the attachment points.

The strength of a solar racking system is determined in part by the metal racking, but it also depends on the roof’s underlying structure. Specifically, rafters (or trusses) and any supporting structures must be strong enough to withstand your region’s maximum wind loads.
The lag bolts noted above are generally drilled into the wood beams underneath the base layer of your roof’s plywood. As a rule of thumb, in most homes we’re looking for a minimum of two-inch-thick wood beams spaced no more than 36 inches apart.
Your installer will most likely consult with a state-certified structural engineer to determine if your home’s construction is appropriate for solar. While most homes are deemed structurally sound, proving that to some building departments can sometimes be a bit costly.
Now that we’ve covered the basics of connecting solar panels to a roof, it’s time to find a place for the panels. The most obvious feature we’re looking for is large, uninterrupted roof space. Bigger chunks of roof are easier, and cheaper, to install solar panels.
Keep in mind that a standard residential solar panel is roughly five and a half feet tall by three feet wide. Pictured below, this 290 to 320 watt solar panel from URE represents a standard residential product. Panel sizes vary by manufacturer and model. For instance, Solaria’s 400 W PowerXT high efficiency panel is an extra six inches wider.

Using these approximate sizes of the panels and our roof, we can determine roughly how many panels will fit on our roof, and where.

The developer received a letter of intent for the project from Surat-based Anupam Rasayan India, a company engaged in the custom synthesis and manufacturing of specialty chemicals in India.
The entire capital expenditure of INR 43 crore will be funded from Anupam Rasayan’s recently concluded IPO proceeds. The plant will cater to the energy requirements of Anupam Rasayan’s major units. The company operates six manufacturing facilities in Gujarat.
Speaking about the planned investment in renewable energy, Anand Desai, Managing Director of Anupam Rasayan, said, “Environmental sustainability is high in our priority, and we will constantly look into opportunities in this space. It is important for industry players like us to be price-sensitive as well as minimize carbon footprints. The proposed solar plant will help us rationalize our energy costs through an estimated saving of around INR 10 crore per annum for the next 25 years. This is a significant step in terms of ensuring undeterred power supply and transitioning towards cleaner source of energy.”
Captive solar power plants make a lucrative proposition for growing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Most manufacturing units in the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) segment have poor infrastructure and small roof size, which allows them to meet barely 5-10% of their energy consumption from solar installation, whereas energy consumption accounts for 25-40% of their total manufacturing cost (excluding raw material cost). Some MSMEs involved in the business of foundry, forging and dyeing have even higher energy cost of up to 50%, according to Faruk Patel, Chairman and Managing Director, KPI Global Infrastructure.
By going for captive solar plants, MSMEs can not only contribute in addressing the challenge of global warming but also generate additional cash flows to their business. Ample funding is available for them to make the switch.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/03/gautam-solar-starts-new-manufacturing-line-doubles-capacity/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MONO PERC,POLYCRYSTALLINE,UTTARAKHAND",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 3, 2021",Gautam Solar doubles capacity with new production line,"New Delhi manufacturer Gautam Solar has started panel production from a new manufacturing line at its Haridwar factory in Uttarakhand.
The INR200 crore group has more than doubled its annual solar panel manufacturing capacity, from 120 MW to 250 MW, at Haridwar—a boost that makes it the third-largest solar manufacturer in North India.
Speaking to pv magazine, managing director Gautam Mohanka said the bigger capacity at the Haridwar plant has already become operational. The plant is producing mono PERC and polycrystalline solar panels with power outputs of up to 400 W. The company’s move to mono PERC is in line with the global trend.
“The global market at the moment is witnessing some fluctuation in rates, perhaps due to the shortage of raw materials as the supply chains aren’t functioning properly,” said Mohanka. “We are also seeing that the poly panel is being phased out and the mono PERC wafer is becoming more popular and we might see the same trend catch in India as well, in the near future.”
The MD said the company may consider producing 500 W-plus solar modules in future.
Gautam Solar has four factories in Haridwar manufacturing solar panels, batteries, electronics, and other structures. The panel production capacity expansion has been driven by rising demand from solar projects which mandate domestically manufactured components. 
“We have been witnessing a steady increase in demand for our solar panels for a while now, hence increasing the manufacturing capacity became vital,” said the Gautam Solar boss. “The same has been executed at our Haridwar facility. If things go according to plan, we will soon increase the production capacities at our other facilities as well. This has been made possible in the wake of the government’s decision to make India a solar manufacturing hub and reduce its dependency on other countries for importing solar equipment. We appreciate this decision and firmly believe that it will help create a powerful, self-subsisting, and aatmanirbhar Bharat.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/03/graphene-aluminum-ion-batteries-with-ultra-fast-charging/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 3, 2021",Graphene aluminum ion batteries with ultra-fast charging,"From pv magazine International
Researchers from the University of Queensland and Brisbane-based Graphene Manufacturing Group (GMG) are teaming up to develop faster-charging, more sustainable battery prototypes with lifespans three times the length of current lithium-ion batteries. 
GMG, which was recently listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada, has reached a research agreement with scientists from the University of Queensland’s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) to build batteries for anything from watches to grid storage and everything in between, including phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. 
The University of Queensland technology, which sees an aluminum ion battery paired with graphene electrodes, was designed by Professor Michael Yu, Xiaodan Huang and postdoctoral student Yueqi Kong as a way to make graphene into more efficient electrodes for powering batteries. The technology has already been patented and licensed by UniQuest, the University of Queensland’s commercialization company.
Graphene is the wonder material of the age. It’s the thinnest and strongest material known to science, and, if that wasn’t enough, it is also a great conductor of electricity – better even than copper. Or at least, it would be the wonder material of the age if the so-called “graphene revolution” promised less and delivered more. 
It was more than a decade ago that scientists from the University of Manchester won the Nobel Prize for Physics thanks to some simple tape that proved to be a breakthrough in extracting graphene from everyday graphite. 

In essence, graphene is just good old carbon, but it is tessellated in such a way to produce a bogglingly strong bond between atoms. Of course, like anything with so much promise and hype, the graphene revolution has taken longer than expected, but that is only because people don’t have much patience for the things they’ve been promised, especially when it is something as potentially ubiquitous as graphene. 
Nevertheless, the University of Queensland and GMG are not the only parties making progress. In March, scientists at China’s Dalian University of Technology and the University of Nebraska in the United States collaborated to fabricate a battery consisting of a pure aluminum anode, a graphene cathode, and an organic electrolyte. The batteries are described in “Ultra-fast charging in aluminium-ion batteries: electric double layers on active anode,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
Back in 2019, scientists at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) demonstrated a laser printing process that enables graphene supercapacitors to be embedded directly onto textiles, creating a fabric that can store energy and be integrated with a solar cell and used to power smart fabric applications.
“Testing showed rechargeable graphene aluminium ion batteries had a battery life of up to three times that of current leading lithium-ion batteries,” said AIBN Director Professor Alan Rowan. “And higher power density meant they charged up to 70 times faster.” 
AIBN has been working hard on the technology for several years, and the research team is excited to be shifting into a commercial prototype development stage, especially as the promise on the cards is more efficient and greener batteries. 
“The batteries are rechargeable for a larger number of cycles without deteriorating performance and are easier to recycle, reducing potential for harmful metals to leak into the environment,” said Rowan. 
UniQuest CEO Dean Moss said he believes aluminum ion batteries with graphene electrodes “could transform the existing rechargeable battery market. Lithium-ion batteries demand the extraction of rare earth materials using large amounts of water and are processed with chemicals that can potentially harm the environment.” 
GMG CEO Craig Nicol agrees, noting that the possibility for the energy storage market included far-reaching benefits in safety, efficiency, sustainability. He points to the ability of aluminum ion batteries “to use local raw materials to manufacture battery cells at a competitive cost to replace imported lithium-ion cells is a massive opportunity for GMG and Australia to reduce supply chain risks and create local jobs.” 
University of Queensland scientists were awarded a AUD 390,000 ($303,600) grant over three years from the Australian Research Council’s Linkage Project in 2020 to develop graphene aluminum ion technology.
