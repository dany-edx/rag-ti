https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/25/harnessing-solar-power-for-railways/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,INDIA",,"JULY 25, 2023",Harnessing solar power for railways,"Indian Railways is the fourth longest railway network in the world, carrying more than 20 million daily. And now, is envisioning to become a green transporter, making railways eco-friendly. This would be equivalent to the elimination of 15 million tons of CO2 each year.
The first station in the country to be fully solar-powered was the Guwahati railway station in the state of Assam, with a capacity of 700 kW.
The largest solar power plant on a railway station is being installed in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh. It has a capacity of 50 MW and is spread over more than 200 acres of area. The project is being done by BHEL (Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited), a public-sector undertaking. 
A year back the count of railway stations already solarized stood around 1094. Some of the major ones include stations at Varanasi, Jammu & Kashmir, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, etc. And the result has been savings of crores of rupees for the government.
Technical aspects
There are two types of energy systems, traction-based and non-traction-based requirements. Traction-based means electrical energy generated for the movement of a vehicle. The difficult thing in such projects is to turn the DC power produced by the panels into usable AC current. This requires the development of high-capacity inverters which are not readily available in the market, they are specially designed and made for such special systems.
Initiatives taken for solar plants
1) No objection certificate for open access- with this a third party can purchase energy from the producers 
2) Banking provisions- to make the adoption of clean energy hassle-free
3) Unrestricted net metering regulations- this allows the export and import of electricity to the grid at the same price, further boosting the savings in electricity bills
Possibility of solar power trains
The first 100% solar train in the world is actually a tourist attraction in Australia, made 70 years ago. It has a supply of 6.6 kW of power and runs at a very low pace of 18 km/hr.
 The enthusiasm around such technologies is always high because it is not restricted to a particular sector, industry, or strata of society. It is something that will be universal soon, just like how ubiquitous computers and the internet are today. 
Trains could potentially be completely or partially powered by the sun. A solar train is an electric train that runs on energy derived from photovoltaic cells, installed either on the roof of the train or next to the railway lines.
If implemented on a large scale in our railways, this can very well translate to savings of 17,000 crores in fuel cost. This energy can be used for locomotion or to power the lights and fans in the coaches. The energy produced by the panels will be transmitted to the electric lines above the trains.
From a technical point of view, it is a feasible prospect, but the implementation of this level of infrastructure where simultaneously trains are operating, running strictly on solar is a distant reality as of now.
Future of Railways
The Indian Railways is working towards reducing its carbon footprint by employing renewable energy to power its operations. The scope of installation, whether in the form of solar rooftop coaches or solar on the railway stations, is immense. Unoccupied areas amass around 51,000 hectares of area where solar can be installed.
These plans are in line with the ‘Atma Nirbhar’ mission, an economic development policy to make India a self-reliant economy. Around 100 MW of projects have already been commissioned to accomplish the ambition of being the first transport organization to be energy self-sufficient.

Rooftop PV installations saw significant uptake. In H1 2023, around 2,294 MW of rooftop solar capacity was added, which is higher than the entire rooftop PV installations in 2022, according to a new report by JMK Research.
In H1 2023, wind power installations surged 166% y-on-y to 1,878 MW.
“The installed capacity in wind in H1 2023 has already surpassed overall calendar year 2022 installation figures. Removal of reverse auctions and declaration of annual 50 GW tendering trajectory by the government will further reinvigorate the wind sector,” stated JMK Research. 
According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), India’s cumulative installed capacity of renewable energy generation reached 129.6 GW by June 30, 2023. Solar energy contributes around 54% of the total installed RE capacity.
In terms of state-wise solar installations, Gujarat led with 1.6 GW capacity installed in the first half of 2023. Owing to its attractive Wind Solar Hybrid policy, Gujarat also leads in wind capacity installations with 1.039 GW installed during H1 2023. 
JMK analysts expect India to add 7-8 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of wind in H2 2023. “Significant fall in solar module prices over last few months as well as relaxation in ALMM implementation until FY2024 will be the key drivers to augment solar capacity addition in second half of the year,” said the analysts.

Singh, union minister for power and new and renewable energy, in a written reply to a question in the lower parliament recently.
Against the sanctioned capacity, eleven solar parks aggregating 8.521 GW have been completed and seven solar parks totaling 3.985 GW partially completed. In these parks, 10,237 MW of solar projects have been developed, said the minister.
The Solar Park Scheme currently has a timeline up to March 31, 2026. Under the scheme, MNRE supports the States and union territories in setting up solar parks at various locations in the country to create the required infrastructure for setting up solar power projects. 
The solar parks provide suitable developed land with all clearances, transmission systems, water access, road connectivity, communication network, etc. 
Land for setting up the solar park is identified by the State Government. It is the responsibility of the State Government to make the land available.
The MNRE supports solar park development with a grant of up to INR 25 lakh per solar park for the preparation of the detailed project report and central financial assistance of up to INR 20 lakh per MW or 30% of the project cost, including grid connectivity cost, whichever is lower.

The IAF has developed special power electronics for electrocaloric heat pumps to considerably raise their electrical efficiency.
With the electrocaloric effect, electrical voltage is applied to an electrocaloric material made of special ceramics or polymers, and the material heats up. As soon as the stress is removed, the material cools again, with the entire process being almost completely reversible.
The IAF scientists claimed to have created an ultra-efficient circuit topology for voltage converters with an electrical efficiency of 99.74%. Today’s heat pumps are limited to about 50% of the physical Carnot limit due to technology, but the electrocaloric heat pump could theoretically reach 85%.
These solid-fuel heat pumps are to be brought to market as an alternative to those based on the prevailing compressor technology, as they promise greater efficiency and do not require refrigerants.
The scientists are now researching components based on the semiconductor gallium nitride (GaN) for higher power density and efficiency. They have succeeded in developing an ultra-efficient circuit topology for voltage converters based on GaN transistors, with an electrical efficiency of 99.74%. The GaN-based multilevel DC/DC converter far surpasses the current state of research of less than 90% recharging efficiency for the electrical control of these new heat pumps.
The increase in the efficiency of the power electronics also has a direct impact on the performance of the entire system, directly leading to a higher coefficient of performance for the entire heat pump system. However, there is still a great deal of research to be done in order to make solid-fuel heat pumps a more efficient and completely emission-free solution for heating and cooling.
“Essential for the realization of a high coefficient of performance of electrocaloric heat pumps is a very high efficiency in the materials, the electronics and the heat transfer,” said Kilian Bartholomé, manager of the ElKaWe project. “If you get all this under control, electrocaloric technology has enormous potential.”
Six Fraunhofer institutes were involved in the ElKaWe project. They have published their results in the IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics.

Switzerland-based heterojunction solar panel maker Meyer Burger AG says it intends to set up a 2 GW solar cell factory in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Meyer Burger plans to start manufacturing at the cell factory in the fourth quarter of this year. The solar cells manufactured in the new plant are intended exclusively for the company’s own module production, which is currently being built in Goodyear, in the US state of Arizona.
The modules are intended for sale in the North American market. Meyer Burger originally wanted to supply the module plant in the United States with heterojunction solar cells from Germany.
The investment will benefit from the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit and related policies, as well as support from the state of Colorado and the city of Colorado Springs.
Meyer Burger expects tax credits of up to €1.4 billion ($1.6 billion) from the IRA alone for the 2024-32 period.
