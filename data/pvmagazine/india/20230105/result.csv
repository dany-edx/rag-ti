Floatovoltaics, floating solar plants, or FSPV (floating solar photovoltaics) as they are acronymed, are panel structures that are installed on water bodies like lakes, basins, and reservoirs instead of solid structures like roofs or terraces. The biggest impetus behind the rise of large-scale FSPV has been that it doesn’t take up any land space, which could be then used for construction and agriculture.
The world’s first large-scale FSPV system was installed in 2011, in Napa Valley, California. Since then, there has been no turning back. It is predicted by 2025 we would have 10 GW of capacity installed.
In recent years, floating solar power plants have become part of India’s plans for solar expansion. According to a 2020 study by TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute), reservoirs cover 18,000 sq km in India and can generate 280 GW through floating solar panels.
Currently, less than 1% of solar installations are floating!
The largest floating solar power plant in India is currently the Ramagundam in the Peddapalli district of Telangana, with a capacity of 100 MW.
Currently, a 600 MW floating solar plant is being built on the Omkareshwar Dam in Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, which, when operational, will purportedly be the largest floating solar power plant in the world. The project is touted to be worth INR 3,000 crore.
One exciting thing about floatovoltaics is that it doesn’t occupy land, which could be used for other purposes. But it is much costlier than land-based solutions, about 15 to 30% more than its terrestrial counterparts. And it is usually done for government projects, corporates, and commercial entities.
The water beneath the solar modules provides a cooling effect to the modules, resulting in much more improved efficiency than their terrestrial counterparts.
But one of the pitfalls is that the algae and other aquatic life get affected, because of the lack of direct sunlight that they thrive upon.
There are also a lot of maintenance issues associated with floating plants. Special care must be taken to ensure electrical safety.
The major impediments are the high cost of materials and the complex installation involved.
In the near future, you’ll definitely see a surge of this out-of-the-box, creative way of energy generation. The global market of floating solar is expected to grow by a fifth to $180 million by the year 2050.

Ltd (HPCL) and NTPC Green Energy Ltd have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the field of renewable energy and storage.
Under the MoU, HPCL and NTPC will cooperate and collaborate in the fields of renewable energy, energy storage projects, round-the-clock (RTC) power, electric mobility, solar-wind value chain, and meeting HPCL’s green power requirements by leveraging each other’s expertise.
The MoU is part of HPCL’s strategy to rapidly expand into the renewable energy domain to take up business opportunities in the RE sector and meet its internal requirements of RTC green power for its refineries, locations, retail outlets, and EV charging stations.

The process of setting up these projects would be expedited by identifying suitable sites in the state. 
The chief minister said that storage projects will be encouraged under the Madhya Pradesh Renewable Energy Policy 2022. Concession will be given in registration-cum-facilitation fee, electricity duty, energy development cess, stamp duty on the purchase of private land, wheeling fee, and purchase of government land as per rules.
The chief minister also said that pumped hydro storage sites will be allotted based on a competitive tender process. Upon receiving the request to develop pumped hydro storage on reservoirs owned by the State Government, the Central and State entity will be considered for allocation and development on a case-to-case basis.

The arid, dusty regions of the world present a great opportunity for solar energy – often pairing consistently high irradiation with large areas of land that have few other practical uses. But such regions also present a challenge in the form of harsh weather conditions and dust particles that can badly affect the performance of a PV system.
Soiling has been well studied as an issue affecting PV performance, and project operators today have a wealth of tools available to clean modules in the field and to calculate the best time to do this, based on the balance between lost energy yield and the cost of a cleaning cycle. While these mostly focus on the direct losses caused by dust blocking light from the module, however, soiling is also known to play a role in some mechanisms that cause more permanent performance loss to PV systems in the field.
A group of scientists led by Mohamed First University in Morocco conducted a one-year study of soiling on modules in the field. The group installed crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride PV modules at a site in Ben Guerir, Morocco. The installation consisted of two modules for each technology, one of which was cleaned daily, and one which was left to accumulate dust and dirt.
As expected, the study showed that soiling effects are most damaging during the driest periods of the year. The group also found that the cadmium telluride modules were less affected by soiling related losses – they peaked at a 13% daily performance loss, while silicon modules reached 15%.
The scientists described the results of the study in “Experimental study on the impact of soiling on the modules temperature and performance of two different PV technologies under hot arid climate,” which was recently published in Heliyon. They also found that the modules affected by soiling ran at higher temperatures. The group suggested a module to calculate soiling effects on module temperature and efficiency at a given location, and said that conducting further studies in different climates would help to further increase the accuracy of the module.
