Initially, the company will manufacture electrolyzers but plans to offer installation and turnkey services to generate green hydrogen from its products. “We eventually aim to solve all bottlenecks that the world faces in the use of green hydrogen – be it in terms of production or storage, GreenZo Founder and Chairman Sandeep Agarwal told pv magazine.
The company aims for an overall 1 GW electrolyzer capacity. To this end, it will initially invest up to INR 400 crore ($51.5) by the end of 2025 to set up a 250 MW electrolyzer factory. After expanding the production capacity of electrolyzers from 250 MW to 1 GW, it will move to the production of high-pressure tanks and cryogenic vessels necessary for hydrogen storage, said Agarwal.
GreenZo electrolyzer factory is expected to start production in the fourth quarter (Oct.-Dec.) of 2024. The company officials are in discussion with the Indian government to finalize the location and are also exploring the options, incentives, and benefits provided by the government for green hydrogen.
GreenZo plans to be the incumbent player within green hydrogen space for years to come, said Agarwal. And the company’s shift to green hydrogen is based on the demand it observed from its existing renewable energy clients and the core technological competencies it accumulated along with major domestic and international players in green hydrogen, he added.
“GreenZo‘s sister concern Kushal Projects executes renewable projects in Asian countries. So, projects executed by Kushal Projects have all been designed by GreenZo.”
GreenZo has not tied up with any technology partner from abroad for its proposed electrolyzer production. The company is developing an indigenous technology with an in-house team of ex National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) officers and young brains of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Agarwal said. It is, however, open to joint ventures in the future as the need arises.
GreenZo has set aside INR 7 crore (around $1 million) for hydrogen electrolyzer R&D in 2022-23. The R&D team, Agarwal said, will focus on polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) materials, anode and cathode reactions, electrolysis, durability parameters, and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation.

The 250 MW PV project is located in the Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan.
The project was commissioned in two phases through April and May. It will supply electricity to Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) at a fixed tariff of INR 2.50 ($0.032)/kWh for 25 years. SECI, in turn, will sell the power to Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd to meet the state’s power demand.
The project uses Longi, Talesun and Chint bifacial modules.
O2 Power is owned by Swedish private equity firm EQT Infrastructure and Singapore’s state-owned Temasek. Headquartered in the Gurgaon district of the Indian state of Haryana, it focuses on developing utility-scale renewable projects across solar, wind, and hybrid via both greenfield project development and mergers and acquisitions. Parag Sharma leads the platform as chief executive officer.

Hungary-based Platio Solar launched new solar modules for PV pavement applications at the recent Smarter E event in Munich, Germany.
“They rely on a new frame structure that provides better protection for the glass surface,” Marketing Manager Helga Ruscsák told pv magazine. “They can be used for pavement, terraces, driveways, sidewalks, parks, bicycle roads, marinas, and low traffic roads, as well as for other industrial and off-grid applications.”
The modules come in variants featuring conventional monocrystalline and polycrystalline cells, with a choice of clear or opal glass. All of the products measure 359 mm x 359 mm x 41 mm and weigh 6.5 kg.
The polycrystalline products feature 156 mm x 156 mm 18.6%-efficient solar cells, with a nominal power of 18.2 W. It has an open-circuit voltage of 2.56 V and a short-circuit current of 8.9 A.

The monocrystalline panels have a power conversion efficiency of 22.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.72 V, and a short-circuit current of 8.89 A. They are fabricated with four cells measuring 158.7 mm x 158.7 mm.
The panels are covered by 10 mm of tempered glass treated with an acid-etched pattern. They are also equipped with a frame made of a polymer composite based on low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with matrix-forming material.
“The frame is made out of 100% recycled plastic,” Ruscsák said.
All the modules have a maximum allowed vehicle wheel load of 2 tons per module. The manufacturer claims a vehicle with a maximum weight of 8 tons could drive on the modules.
“We do not intend to build solar highways or solar roads with our products,” said Ruscsák.
Platio Solar said the solar cells have the same lifecycle of those used in conventional panels, despite being exposed to mechanical stress.
“Several tests have been performed at this regard during the CE certification process,” Ruscsák said, noting that the modules have a low-voltage system, which makes walking on them a safe option.
