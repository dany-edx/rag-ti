The scheme also expands the market for PV installers and PV component manufacturers.
“Through rooftop solarization, one crore (10 million0 households will be enabled to obtain up to 300 units [kWh] free electricity every month. The scheme will save up to INR 15,000-18,000 annually for households from free solar electricity and selling the surplus to the distribution companies,” said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
Rooftop solarization will open entrepreneurship opportunities for a large number of vendors in supply and installation; and employment opportunities for the youth with technical skills in manufacturing, installation and maintenance.
Neeraj Kuldeep, Senior Programme Lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), and Gagan Sidhu, Director – CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF), said, “An analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) suggests that 20-25 GW of rooftop solar capacity would be supported through solarisation of one crore households. Further, given that residential consumers receive subsidized electricity from discoms, solarisation of the demand from these households will save about INR 2 lakh crore for discoms over the next 25 years (the solar plant’s life).”
“All states can leverage this opportunity as rooftop solar potential exists everywhere, unlike utility-scale solar, which is primarily restricted to seven RE-rich states. CEEW analysis has already established the 637 GW of technical potential in India for rooftop solar.”
Ishver Dholakiya, founder and managing director, Goldi Solar, said the promotion of residential rooftop solarization will catalyze new opportunities in the growing solar sector. He anticipates major announcements, especially in areas like manufacturing, imports, and technological advancements, when the full budget is presented in July following the elections.
Subrahmanyam Pulipaka, CEO of industry body National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI), said, “India’s ground-based, grid-connected solar proliferation story is an inspiration for developed and developing countries. Through the Suryoday Yojana [for residential rooftops] a clear message has been sent that India is serious about not just growth but spread. Every citizen of the country will be an integral part of India’s fight against climate change while saving up to 18 thousand rupees on electricity bills.”
The finance minister also announced viability gap funding for offshore wind energy projects for an initial capacity of one giga-watt. Coal gasification and liquefaction capacity of 100 MT will be set up by 2030. This will help in reducing imports of natural gas, methanol, and ammonia. Also, blending of compressed biogas (CBG) in compressed natural gas (CNG) for transport and piped natural gas (PNG) for domestic purposes will be mandated in a phased manner.
The viability gap funding for offshore wind will support the expansion of the wind power capacity. As per CEEW’s analysis, while 65% of the $10 trillion of investments required for India to achieve net-zero by 2070 can be mobilized from conventional sources, the balance 35% will need interventions. “Further, wind as a generation source is also critical for our nearer-term energy ambitions. In fact, per the Central Electricity Authority’s own assessment, wind capacity would have to grow 1.9x from its current 44.7 GW to 100 GW by 2030 to meet the expected increase in power demand in the country by then,” said Sidhu.
Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president & group head – Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd, said, “The VGF scheme for offshore wind energy will improve its cost competitiveness, and further aid the renewable capacity addition in the long run. Further, measures for the promotion of roof-top solar remain positive for the renewable sector.”
Amit Jain, CEO and country manager India, ENGIE, said, “The introduction of viability gap funding for harnessing offshore wind energy potential, with an initial capacity of 1 GW, aligns with the expectations of the renewable energy sector and contributes to the overall vision of sustainable growth. The budget now presents the roadmap to explore the wind energy beyond the coastline.”
Sharad Pungalia, managing director and CEO, Amplus Solar, said, “The initiatives aimed at promoting rooftop solarization signal a strategic framework to leverage India’s substantial residential market for renewable energy adoption. Additionally, the provision of viability gap funding for offshore wind energy projects, with a focus on capacities up to 1 GW, addresses a critical need in propelling the growth of offshore wind energy which had gone on a flat trajectory in the last few years.”
“While the demand market has been incentivized,” Pungalia said, “relaxations in import taxes would have parallelly helped the generators achieve the targets associated with the rise in energy demand till local manufacturing stabilizes.”
Among other budget highlights, the government will support EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure and introduce the payment security mechanism for greater adoption of e-buses for public transport networks. A corpus of INR 100,000 crore will be established with fifty-year interest-free loan to encourage the private sector to scale up research and innovation significantly in sunrise domains. The corpus will provide long-term financing or refinancing with long tenors and low or nil interest rates.
“The push for an EV ecosystem creation and the large-scale roll-out of e-buses through payment security mechanisms will decarbonize the mobility sector while propelling India as a potential EV manufacturing hub. The announcement of the INR 1 lakh crore corpus is a remarkable step to attract private investment in innovation, research and development in the clean energy sector,” said Saurabh Kumar, vice president – India, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP).
Nitin Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Attero Recycling, said, “The government’s focus on strengthening EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure in the interim budget is a positive signal towards sustainable mobility. With such initiatives, the government is laying a strong foundation for a greener and more resilient transportation sector. The push for e-buses adoption backed by a payment security mechanism will help in accelerating the transition to cleaner and more sustainable public transportation systems. The rooftop solarization scheme, enabling one crore households to receive up to 300 units of free electricity every month, marks a crucial step towards the adoption of renewable energy.”
“This transition necessitates the use of lithium-ion battery packs for energy storage, indirectly promoting technological innovation and sustainability in the energy sector. Such initiatives align with global efforts to combat climate change and promote a greener, more sustainable future. While we hoped for provisions addressing the recycling of critical minerals, we are optimistic about the government’s overarching commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2070.”
The finance minister also announced INR  11,11,111 crore capital expenditure outlay for infrastructure development, which would be 3.4% of the GDP. Further, three major economic railway corridor programmes will be implemented. These include energy, mineral and cement corridors; port connectivity corridors; and high-traffic density corridors. The minister said projects have been identified under the PM Gati Shakti Scheme for enabling multi-modal connectivity to improve logistics efficiency and reduce cost.
Bikesh Ogra, managing director and chief executive officer of Jakson Green, said, “The substantial infrastructure investment marks a significant stride in accelerating the renewable ecosystem. We anticipate dedicated allocations for crucial elements such as port infrastructure, renewable energy integration, and specialized infrastructures for green hydrogen.”
Ogra said, PM Gati Shakti’s railway corridors will be a game-changer for green hydrogen and its derivatives, fostering dedicated transport links between production hubs, ports, and markets. This strategic move will help reduce costs, enhance accessibility, and expedite India’s transition towards clean energy.
“Furthermore, the government’s decision to reduce borrowing from markets is a pivotal development, unlocking opportunities for increased private investment, particularly in sectors like renewables…Additionally, the viability gap support for offshore wind and bio-based solutions holds immense promise, presenting opportunities to lower the levelised cost of green hydrogen and its derivatives.”
“In a seemingly neutral yet strategically significant move, the budget’s stable tax and duty regime ensures a steady flow of foreign investments, particularly in critical sectors like renewable energy. This commitment to continuity prioritizes investor confidence and predictability, serving as essential pillars for fostering long-term commitments and accelerating growth in key sustainability sectors.”
S.K Gupta, chief financial officer at AmpIn Energy Transition, said, “Extension of viability gap funding for harnessing offshore untapped wind energy potential and take it to 1 GW+ in the initial phase along with schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana set the direction for the government’s final budget proposals for the renewable industry, post elections in April 2024. Commitment to expand and strengthen the EV ecosystem will further give boost to the growth of renewable green energy demand and help government meet its target of 500 GW of green energy by 2030.”
With this positive framework in the interim budget, Gupta said, the industry feels confident that the final budget proposals of the government will favorably reconsider and implement its long pending demands of:

Researchers from Spain’s University of Jaen have developed a novel technology for wastewater disinfection and the production of PV energy.
The Open SoWat system is designed for tertiary treatment – the third and final process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). It is an upgrade of SolWat technology, which consists of a photochemical technology integrating PV modules and water disinfection reactors.
“To extend the system to commercial use, preliminary experimental studies need to be carried out using a large-scale prototype. Optimization of this technology will involve the use of energy-efficient water pumps. In addition, a study of their energy consumption and an economic analysis of the system will be carried out,” researcher J. Torres told pv magazine. 
The research group said that the technology harnesses various wavelengths of solar radiation for distinct purposes. It uses ultraviolet (UV) and far infrared (FIR) radiation to disinfect water, significantly reducing the presence of harmful microorganisms. Additionally, visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) radiation are used to generate electricity through the photovoltaic module.
The Open SolWat system operates dynamically with water recirculation to reduce the operating temperature of the solar module. It consists of a PV module over which a 1 mm thin film of water flows thanks to a pumping system. The water is spread across the front side of the panel and is then collected in an external water tank made of aluminum L-profiles, with a funnel transferring the water to the tank.
“The tank is exposed to solar radiation and functions as a solar water disinfection reactor,” the scientists said, noting that in the classic SolWat closed configuration, an 18 mm thin film of wastewater is applied to the PV module, enclosed with borosilicate glass.
To test the feasibility of the system, the scientists have built two prototypes – the Small Open SolWat system and the large Open SolWat system.
“The first reactor consisted only of an L-shaped aluminum profile on top of the PV module, which was equipped with a perforated tube with 53 microtubes for the water outlet, spaced 1 cm apart,” they explained. “The second reactor was an open, translucent water tank measuring 62 cm x 45 cm x 18 cm.”
The largest prototype uses a 45 W module from UK manufacturer PV Logic, two water reactors and a magnetic coupling water pump with an average flow rate of 8.9 L/m manufactured by Germany’s Flojet Corporation. The smaller system uses a module with a nominal power of 5 W.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/01/reducing-pv-module-temperatures-with-graphene/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-01,Reducing PV module temperatures with graphene,"Scientists at Monash University Malaysia have looked at how graphene and graphene derivatives could be used as materials to reduce the operating temperature of solar panels.
In an in-depth review published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, the researchers explained that graphene has attracted the interest of the scientific community as a medium to enhance heat transfers in cooling systems since 2004.
When used for PV cooling applications, graphene can be used in different ways. For example, it can be used as a selective absorber coating or embedding it into a working fluid as a nanofluid. Graphene nanoparticles can also be added to thermal interface materials (TIMs) or phase change materials (PCMs) used for solar module cooling.
The group divided all graphene technologies applied to PV into two categories, passive and active cooling.
The first category was split into pre-illumination and post-illumination techniques. The latter involves all methods that use a heat receiver to dissipate heat generated from solar cells, while the former includes all approaches that decompose the sun spectrum before it reaches the PV cells.
The pre-illumination category is represented by all types of graphene-coated neutral density (GCND) filters used as selective absorber coating.
“The application of the GCND filter as a pre-illumination passive cooling technique is highly advantageous, particularly in cooling CPV systems,” the academics said. “This pre-illumination cooling technique attenuates the solar radiation before it reaches the PV panel, thus reducing the amount of heat generated at the PV panel.”
They also recommended using GCND filters only for small-scale domestic applications, due to their high costs.
“Rather than coating graphene across the entire substrate, focusing the graphene coating specifically at the focal spot area could contribute to reducing coating costs,” they added.
As for the post-illumination category, the list includes using graphene as a thermally conductive filler in TIMs and PCMs.
“While both TIM and PCM present advantages and disadvantages of their own, there is no universal answer to whether TIM or PCM in passive cooling of PV panels is better,” the group said.
The active cooling category includes all techniques based on graphene nanofluids configured as working fluids. These techniques, like all active cooling methods, require the construction of pumps and pipes to circulate the nanofluid around the modules, which the scientists said raises significantly production costs.
“The challenge of using graphene nanofluid is the costly and complex fabrication process, which prevents graphene nanofluid from being adopted in common industry practice,” said the researchers.
The group acknowledged that more research will be required to reduce costs and improve cooling efficiency. The researchers also said that synthesizing graphene nanofluid and hybridizing graphene nanofluid and graphene-enhanced PCMs are the main technical challenges to overcome.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/01/budget-expectations-for-solar-energy-storage-and-ev-sectors/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,2024-02-01,"Budget expectations for solar, energy storage, and EV sectors","The ‘Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana’ announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been widely welcomed by the solar sector. The scheme targets solar installation on 10 million residential rooftops in a year.
Capt. Ishver Dholakiya, founder and managing director, Goldi Solar, expects an announcement on the fund allocation under this residential rooftop solar scheme, in the interim budget for 2024-25 to be tabled in the Parliament today.
“The Indian government has played a significant role in accelerating the widespread installation of solar power and cultivating awareness regarding the advantages of renewable energy. A recent stride in this direction is the announcement of the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana, which is geared towards making solar power accessible to the masses at an affordable rate. With this in mind, the industry awaits the Finance Minister’s announcement in the upcoming interim budget, particularly regarding dedicated funds for the said residential rooftop scheme,” said Capt. Ishver Dholakiya, Founder & Managing Director, Goldi Solar.
Tanmoy Duari, CEO of AXITEC Energy India, calls for increased incentives for MSMEs in the Indian solar manufacturing sector. “In the upcoming budget, there should be increased incentives for MSMEs in the Indian solar manufacturing sector. Currently, the PLI scheme predominantly favors large Indian solar manufacturers. It should also extend its benefits to MSMEs to level the playing field; otherwise, competing with neighboring Asian countries will pose a challenge,” he said.
Electric mobility players want the government to continue incentives and subsidies for manufacturing and purchasing EVs, and offer incentives for developing the charging infrastructure.
Niranjan Nayak, managing director, Delta Electronics India, said, “The electric vehicle (EV) industry in India has gained momentum thanks to the government’s efforts in promoting EV adoption through various initiatives. However, we see untapped potential, and the upcoming budget could further boost the industry’s development.
“Firstly, we expect the government to continue offering incentives and subsidies for manufacturing and purchasing EVs. These measures effectively drive demand and lower upfront costs. Extending these incentives and reducing import duties on EV components can make electric vehicles more affordable for everyone.
“Additionally, a critical focus should be on establishing a widespread charging infrastructure network nationwide. Insufficient charging stations are a concern for potential EV buyers. Allocating budget funds for strategically locating charging stations on highways, in cities, and in residential areas is essential.”
Nayak said the government should also prioritize research and development in the EV sector. Continued investment in advanced technologies, like battery technology and energy storage solutions, is crucial for long-term growth and sustainability. Provisions in the budget supporting innovation and collaboration between industry players and research institutions would be beneficial.
The production-linked incentive scheme for advanced-chemistry battery cells (PLI-ACC Scheme) was launched to boost domestic manufacturing of battery storage for electric vehicles and stationary storage. As players set up battery gigafabs under the scheme, it’s important to develop a complete domestic supply chain.
Nitin Gupta, co-founder and CEO Of Attero Recycling, says, “There is a need for building a robust lithium battery recycling system in India. We need to consider the inclusion of battery recycling within the PLI scheme, which can reduce the export of depleted batteries by promoting domestic enterprises. The government can build a dedicated financial support system to encourage the growth of the circular economy. Critical metals recycling, along with GST rationalization and the implementation of a reverse charge mechanism for e-waste and Li-ion batteries, has the potential to enhance transparency and foster an encouraging recycling environment.”
