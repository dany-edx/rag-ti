Argonne’s new manufacturing technology, shown here, can simplify the production of nanomaterials in high volumes. The benefits include faster production rates and reduced material waste, compared to standard wet chemistry processes.
For the first time, scientists at Argonne have shown that artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced statistical methods can improve the way some nanomaterials are produced in the laboratory, via flame spray pyrolysis, and then scaled up to manufacturing. This discovery, described in the journal Materials & Design, is the first step toward producing vast amounts of next-generation materials for energy storage quickly, automatically, and efficiently.
Scientists are drawn to flame spray pyrolysis in part because it helps solve a common problem – scaling new chemicals made in the laboratory, typically a gram or two, to industrial sizes of a kilogram or more. Scaling up new materials is more complex than, say, doubling your casserole recipe. While new materials may perform well in the lab, performance may slip when you try to create them at larger industrial scales.
Fortunately, flame spray pyrolysis can crack this code by producing large amounts of advanced nanomaterials in a single step. Yet one problem remains. Engineers must accurately tune dozens of variables – for example, flame temperature, the shape of the spray nozzle, how fast to pump chemicals and oxygen – to produce the material with the exact target properties.
In other words, “how do you optimize the process to get a material that you’re happy with,” says Noah Paulson, a computational materials scientist at Argonne.
Until recently, researchers struggled to answer this question, relying on inefficient trial-and-error experiments. Yet new AI-driven methods have shown that results can be automated, according to the Argonne team, which also includes Marius Stan, the intelligent materials design lead, and Joe Libera, a principal materials scientist who operates the laboratory’s flame spray pyrolysis.
The Argonne team applied a novel artificial intelligence technique, known as active learning, to 17 flame spray experiments. As a demonstration, they sought to minimize the variety in particle sizes for silica, a mineral commonly found in sand. Silica has many industrial uses, including filtering water and manufacturing glass and concrete. But the team chose silica for the demonstration because the compound is easy to study via computer simulation. In each experiment, AI picked the best values for the flame spray machine’s settings, based on all previous experiments, to get the silica particles to a more uniform size.
“The AI asked to run the next experiment with specific conditions that it thought it would learn the most from. Whether it is the location of the optimal point, or the best point to improve the model to reduce uncertainties,” explains Paulson.
Each time, the material produced inched closer to the team’s goal. In the end, the team found three benefits of their new AI approach:
“We got the most bang for our buck in terms of data,” says Paulson, referring to the third benefit. “There’s a misconception that AI always requires millions of data points to be successful.”
Stan agrees, adding that “in fact, rather than being large, it is more important that the data set is representative of the real system, that it covers a broad domain of compositions and process parameters.”
These advantages stem, in part, from the team’s use of Bayesian optimization. This relies on a powerful statistical rule, inspired by the work of 18th-century English minister Thomas Bayes, that combines assumed probabilities of events occurring and actual measurements to model reality. In 2011, a similar method, known as Bayesian search, helped a group of statisticians find Air France flight 447 at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, where it had lain since crashing two years earlier en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris.
With Bayesian optimization, the more accurate the starting data, the more accurate the results. With that rule in mind, Paulson plans to improve results by starting with data from simulations of the fluid dynamics within flame spray pyrolysis. This will give scientists a head start, before their AI algorithms see any experimental data.
Solid-state batteries
The team’s discovery may help find ways to make other materials that enable vital technologies. Take, for example, lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide, which, while expensive and hard to produce, could act as the electrolyte in solid-state batteries. But it might be made cheaply via flame spray pyrolysis, according to Paulson and his colleagues, leading to safer batteries with twice the energy density of today’s lithium-ion counterparts.

The company has signed a 50-50 joint venture (JV) with Enel X—an Enel Group subsidiary—to launch and create electric charging infrastructure in the Indian sub-continent. 
“The JV intends to give a boost to the fast-evolving private e-mobility ecosystem by providing world-class products and software platforms to support the electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure build-up across the country. Consumers can access Enel X’s vast range of cutting-edge electric vehicle chargers”—read a Sterling and Wilson statement.
Under this partnership, SWPL will introduce Enel X’s Juice family of high-tech, digital, and smart DC as well as fast AC electrical vehicle chargers that already have worldwide recognition, adjusted to the needs of the Indian consumers. 
Customers will have the opportunity to choose how, where, and when to charge their car, potentially selecting the most efficient time for charging, thus making the charging experience fully controllable, easy, and convenient. This platform also facilitates asset operators and owners to track the performance of charging stations and networks and troubleshoot systems in real time.  
Sanjay Jadhav, chief executive officer, Sterling Generators, said the joint venture would provide end-to-end services for electric vehicle charging stations across India. “The quick electric charger will be a game-changer for the EV sector in the country and is in line with the national vision to combat fossil fuel pollution and associated climate change through accelerated electrification of private and public transportation as a prime lever,” he added. 
Francesco Venturini, Enel X chief executive officer, said, “We are leading the spread of electric mobility in several global markets, including Europe and North America and we are thrilled to work with Sterling and Wilson, marking our entry into the Indian market. Joining forces allows our teams to leverage our extensive market knowledge and technical experience, helping to deliver effective results, as well as making important steps towards a clean and sustainable future.”
The joint venture between Sterling and Wilson and Enel X will be incorporated on April 1, 2021 and will start operating from the second quarter of 2021.
