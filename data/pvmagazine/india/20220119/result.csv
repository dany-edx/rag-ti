The R&D partnership between Ohmium and IITMRP will accelerate the implementation of PEM technology enhancements into production at Ohmium’s electrolyzer gigafab in Bengaluru.
Hydrogen finds industrial use in oil refining, ammonia production, methanol production, and steel production. Most of this hydrogen is produced using fossil fuels, leading to significant carbon emissions.
In comparison, green hydrogen is zero-carbon hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water (splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen) using renewable electricity.
Ohmium International, through its suite of electrochemical products, enables industries to deploy green hydrogen for a sustainable future.
“This partnership will enable Ohmium to rapidly translate technology advances in performance and cost reduction into actual production at our Bangalore Gigafactory. The synergies created are very powerful,” said Arne Ballentine, CEO of Ohmium International.
Professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala, Founder and Director of IITMRP, said, “We can make use of Green Hydrogen in cement and steel plants and for manufacturing of Green Ammonia. Ohmium’s presence at IITMRP will help India move towards net-zero early.”

The solar parks will be spread across 175 locations in the island nation’s 15 provinces. Cuba is a member of the Gurugram-headquartered International Solar Alliance (ISA) of 121 tropical nations.
The Cuban government, through its Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM), has sought support from the ISA for development of the solar generation capacity.
NTPC has power generation capacity of 67.9GW across coal, gas, hydro, solar, and wind plants and is an ISA corporate partner. The energy company was chosen as preferred partner to help with implementation of the Cuban solar project last year. 
India’s former National Thermal Power Company and state-owned Cuban utility Union Electrica de Cuba will work together to bring the Cuban solar capacity to fruition.
Under the auspices of the the International Solar Alliance, implementation partner and ISA project manager NTPC will help the Cuban power company and ministry of energy with the selection of solar project developers and the signing of project agreements and will oversee overseeing project implementation.
With Cuba aiming for 2.1GW of solar capacity under its current national ambition, it has been estimated the 900MW of solar will generate 2.16TWh of solar power per year.
The request for qualification process, to be considered as a developer, is expected to run from March until May.
The 900MW of solar envisaged in Cuba would take the volume of capacity NTPC is helping to install under its ISA role to more than 1.8GW as the power company is already helping bring about 500MW of photovoltaics in Mali, 100MW in Malawi, 285MW in Togo, and 50MW in Niger.
The utility is aiming to assist the development of around 10GW of solar in ISA member states and is also working on providing community-centered solar to such nations.

A group of researchers from the PSG College of Technology in India and the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom has developed a spraying water system to reduce the operating temperature of photovoltaic modules.
The active cooling system, which consists of a water tank and a spraying unit made with flexible PVC tubes with appropriate holes for water flow, is designed to spray water onto the module front surface.
The system is activated by a temperature sensor fixed on the back of the solar module that is connected to a microcontroller producing a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal. This signal, in turn, triggers a Mosfet acting as a switch between the system’s solenoid valve, which is placed between the water tank and the spraying unit, and the power supply.
The system was tested on a 36 W solar module and its performance was compared to that of a reference panel without the cooling technique. “This PV module has already completed a lifetime of 10 years,” the scientists specified. “It is tested with and without water spraying throughout the day at regular time intervals.”

The experiment showed that the module’s voltage and current values varied with respect to solar radiation after water spraying. “The voltage increases with the increase in solar radiation unless the temperature exceeds 45 degrees Celsius,” the academics emphasized. “The current increases gradually with a rise in solar radiation, and there are small changes with the increase in temperature, which is negligible when compared with the voltage variation.”
According to them, spraying water over the panels increased the voltage at higher temperatures, while the current dropped slightly. The voltage increase was between 1.5 V to 2.0 V and the current varied from 0.01 A to 0.03 A.
Through the cooling system, the scientists achieved a maximum module temperature decrease of 20 degrees Celsius and an average temperature decrease of 10 degrees Celsius. They also reported an average increase of 0.5% for the panel’s power yield and a maximum increase of 1.0%.
The research group sprayed around 15.6 liters/day of water over the modules at temperatures beyond 45 degrees Celsius, which in turn raised the water temperature to an average of 30 degrees Celsius. “The water with increased temperature is fed into the solar water heating system, which improves the water heating system performance,” they emphasized. “In the future, the proposed methodology can be used for the domestic PV power system with an integrated water heating system.”
The system was presented in the paper Design and Implementation of Automatic Water Spraying System for Solar Photovoltaic Module, published in Mathematical Problems in Engineering.
