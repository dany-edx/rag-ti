https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/25/indias-transition-to-net-zero-emissions-presents-12-7-trillion-investment-opportunity/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EVS,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,RESIDENTIAL PV,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 25, 2023",India’s transition to net-zero emissions presents $12.7 trillion investment opportunity,"India’s transition to a net-zero economy by 2050 presents an investment opportunity amounting to at least $12.7 trillion, according to the New Energy Outlook: India report published by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BloombergNEF). 
The report details two scenarios for India’s energy system and the implications of the country’s transition opportunities and challenges. The baseline Economic Transition Scenario describes an economics-led transition without emission constraints. Under this scenario, the country makes significant progress toward energy independence and decarbonization but does not achieve either goal by 2050. 
The second, the net-zero scenario, envisages enhanced government support and private-sector investment. It is consistent with net-zero emissions by 2050 with no reliance on unproven technologies. It enables India to achieve its mid-century energy independence goal at the lowest cost.
India added 53 GW of solar and wind between 2018 and 2022, of which 16 GW of utility-scale solar was installed in 2022 alone. Yet, solar and wind still account for less than a quarter of India’s power generation capacity, with coal dominating the rest. As a result, India’s electricity generation remains the country’s largest source of emissions. 

BloombergNEF’s analysis finds that maximizing the deployment of solar and wind, supplemented by additions of nuclear, energy storage, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) for thermal power plants, is the cheapest way for India to increase electricity access while decarbonizing its power supply.
New wind and solar power plants in India have already achieved a lower levelized cost of electricity generation than new thermal power plants. The cost of electricity generation from new solar and wind power plants will become cheaper than the running cost of existing coal plants by the mid-2030s.
In the net-zero scenario, the total installed capacity of wind and solar power undergoes a 30-fold expansion, from 99 GW in 2021 to 2,998 GW by 2050. Together, wind and solar generation account for 80% of electricity supplied in 2050, while nuclear provides 9%. The remainder is met by hydro, biomass, hydrogen-fired thermal plants, and thermal power plants equipped with CCS. 
Even under the economic transition scenario, BloombergNEF’s baseline scenario, least-cost power system modeling shows that solar and wind become the dominant source of electricity supply, accounting for 67% of electricity generated in 2050.
“India needs to double down on increasing flexibility in the grid to integrate the large capacities of variable wind and solar,” said Rohit Gadre, India Research Senior Associate at BNEF. “Our modeling shows that multiple solutions can co-exist, including batteries, pumped hydro storage, and peaker gas plants.”
Under the economic transition scenario, investment in energy supply and demand will reach $7.6 trillion over 2022-50, with an annual average of $262 billion. 

To stay on track for net zero, according to BloombergNEF’s net-zero scenario, investment levels are 1.7 times higher at an annual average of $438 billion and a total of $12.7 trillion to 2050. Total investment in fossil-fuel power drops from $317 billion in the economic transition scenario to $142 billion in the net zero scenario. To abate emissions from the remaining use of fossil fuels in the net-zero scenario, India needs $870 billion in investment for CCS. Electric vehicle sales account for the largest share of investment for energy demand in both scenarios. In the net-zero scenario, $3.9 trillion is spent deploying EVs.
“Transitioning to a zero-emission vehicle fleet by 2050 will require bold policy efforts by the state and national governments. Falling battery costs are set to accelerate EV adoption post-2030 which will also spur local manufacturing from automobile and battery makers,” said Komal Kareer, India Research Associate at BloombergNEF.
“India can all but eliminate dependence on fossil fuel imports by 2047, its centennial,” said Shantanu Jaiswal, Head of India Research at BloombergNEF. “By accelerating deployment of mature clean technologies such as solar, wind and electric vehicles, India could create more domestic economic opportunities while reducing emissions and strengthening its energy security.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/25/german-consumer-group-debunks-residential-battery-misconceptions/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"AUGUST 25, 2023",German consumer group debunks residential battery misconceptions,"From pv magazine Germany
As electricity markets fluctuate and energy prices rise, German households are increasingly seeking self-sufficiency with rooftop PV systems and batteries. About 70% of new residential systems in Germany now include home storage. However, not all claims about battery storage use are accurate.
In order to counter false expectations, Verbraucherzentrale NRW has clarified the five main mistakes that could be made when buying a residential storage system.
1: Battery storage cannot be installed at a later stage
This is not true. Verbraucherzentrale NRW said that integrating battery storage later is achievable with a hybrid inverter in a PV system. Retrofitting is also feasible with a conventional inverter, even after many years of PV system operation.
2: The larger the battery, the better
“This is wrong,” the consumer group said. Although battery storage systems are still expensive, they should not be oversized for economic purposes. As a rule of thumb for the appropriate size of storage, they said that every 1,000 kWh of annual electricity demand justifies 1 kWh of storage capacity. In other words, with an annual electricity demand of 5,000 kWh, a storage system should have a capacity of 5 kWh. Consumers should also consider the size of a PV system and remember that rather small systems rarely produce enough surplus power to charge large battery storage.
3: You can always save money by using battery storage
“This is another misconception,” the association said, noting that residential batteries still have high upfront costs. This is only the case if the sale of excess solar power into the grid over the estimated service life is higher than the purchase cost of the battery. Verbraucherzentrale NRW offers calculations and estimates as to whether the savings to be expected are higher than the purchase price.
4: With a battery storage system, electricity can be stored in the summer for the winter
Some battery providers use this narrative to advertise their products. Verbraucherzentrale NRW said that the residential batteries that are currently available on the market can only be used to shift excess solar power for consumption in the evening or at night, with no seasonal storage being possible.
5: With battery storage, users always have electricity and are independent of the power grid
Verbraucherzentrale NRW, which is based in in North Rhine-Westphalia, provides a resounding “no” in response to this. Households remain reliant on the technical connection to the public grid, even with PV systems and storage. In cases of power failure, standard photovoltaic systems and home storage systems cease to supply energy unless equipped with an emergency power or backup system, an addition that Consumer advocates estimate to cost between €500 ($540) and €2,000.
“It is important to be aware of the personal goals of using photovoltaics in conjunction with battery storage and then to obtain comprehensive information,” said Stefan Hoffmann, an energy analyst at Verbraucherzentrale NRW.
In March, Verbraucherzentrale NRW warned about a series of myths that consumers should know when buying residential PV systems.
“It is important to be aware of the personal goals of using photovoltaics and then to find out more. In this way, disappointments can be avoided and solar power can be used really efficiently,” said Sören Demandt, a digital energy transition analyst for Verbraucherzentrale NRW.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/25/monolithic-perovskite-perc-tandem-solar-cell-with-23-7-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 25, 2023",Monolithic perovskite-PERC tandem solar cell with 23.7% efficiency,"A research group in the Netherlands has fabricated a monolithic perovskite-PERC tandem solar cell that utilizes a new type of tunnel recombination junction (TRJ) based on indium tin oxide (ITO), nickel(II) oxide (NiO), and carbazole (2PACz).
They explained that usually TRJs are based on ITO and 2PACz alone, and that the addition of the NiO layer is intended to reduce electrical shunts in the perovskite top cell, due to the inhomogeneity of the 2PACz layer on ITO.
The group deposited the NiO layer through atomic layer deposition (ALD), which they claim largely improves the uniformity of coverage of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of the TRJ.
The researchers built the top perovskite cell with the proposed TRJ, a perovskite absorber, an electron transport layer based on buckminsterfullerene (C60) and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, an ITO electrode, a silver (Ag) metal contact, and an antireflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2).
“The SnO2 is fabricated on a C60 layer, which is needed to prevent the direct interaction between the ALD precursor and the perovskite layer that can reduce the device performance,” they explained.
The academics tested the performance of the cell under standard illumination conditions and compared it with that of a reference device with a TRJ based only on ITO and 2PACz.
The test showed that the reference cell was able to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.689 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.6 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 76.9%, while the device based on the novel TRJ reached an efficiency of 23.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.705 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.0 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 77.2%.
The Dutch team explained that, despite the slightly lower efficiency, the cell using the new TRJ technology offers the advantage of the uniform coverage of the SAM and narrower device efficiency distribution, which it said will be highly beneficial when scaling up to larger cell sizes. “When ALD NiO is introduced between ITO and 2PACz, the spread of the device performance decreases, and the cells operate uniformly across different devices within a batch and from batch-to-batch,” it stated.
The solar cell tech is described in the study “Atomic layer deposition of NiO applied in a monolithic perovskite/PERC tandem cell,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The researchers come from the Eindhoven University of Technology and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).

(APGENCO) to implement pumped hydro storage and renewable energy projects in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
In the first phase, NHPC and APGENCO will implement two identified pumped hydro storage projects with a total capacity of 1,950 MW through a joint venture. The projects are Kamlapadu (950 MW) and Yaganti (1,000 MW). 
“The MoU seeks to harness pump storage projects as energy storage solutions to achieve the national objective of clean and green energy, i.e., of achieving 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel (renewable energy + nuclear) sources by the year 2030 and of realizing net zero by 2070,” stated a power ministry release.
A pumped storage system utilizes surplus grid power available from thermal power stations or other sources to pump up water from the lower to the upper reservoir and reproduces power during peak demand when power is scarce.
