It could also signal the realization of “One Nation, One Grid, One Price” ambition, promising uniform pricing and facilitation of efficiency and renewable energy integration. 
We are referring to the recent market-based economic dispatch (MBED) draft regulations, which propose a reengineering of the day-ahead scheduling and operation of the electricity market towards enabling a national merit order and a countrywide balancing area.
MBED aims to establish a uniform pricing framework that prioritizes the least cost and most efficient generators while backing down more expensive ones, thereby creating a national merit order. Unlike the current framework, where distribution companies (discoms) submit individual schedules from their portfolio of contracts to meet the expected load, under MBED all generators and discoms will submit their offers and bids on the power exchange on a day-ahead basis. Finally, a single market clearing price will be discovered for each unit of time of the upcoming day across the country.
This change allows for downward pressure on current power procurement costs, as nationally pooled prices are expected to be lower given the larger volume of generators competing in a common pool. 
With MBED, discoms can procure power beyond their existing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) based on a national merit order instead of the current siloed approach. Introducing MBED is expected to save around 4 percent of current power generation costs. As power procurement costs across the country have continued to rise steadily from INR 3.48 to INR 3.85 per unit over the past four years, optimizing power procurement costs is the need of the hour.
Although discoms currently purchase almost 90 percent of their power through long-term PPAs, many are hesitant to sign up for new PPAs, given the high growth in low-cost renewables coupled with surplus generation capacity. This has created a growing movement towards short-term power (especially with market instruments like the real-time market), with the advantages of dynamic price discovery and flexibility. This transition is in line with the draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2021, which aims to more than double the penetration of short-term power markets by 2023–2024. 
Further, given that power procurement will be conducted over an exchange on a day-ahead basis, generators stand to realize payments against the power sold on the same day. This will help address one of the biggest conundrums of the PPA regime, in which discoms usually struggle to provide timely payments to the power generation companies (gencos), negatively impacting the finances of both entities. Dues to generators had grown to more than one trillion rupees as of October 2020. 
Beyond financial savings, MBED could herald more efficient power generation.
As MBED prioritizes the dispatch of the cheapest generators across the country, it can unlock the dispatch of any existing low-cost, underutilized generators. The proposed market mechanism also incentivizes more expensive generators to optimize their cost efficiency to offer their generation to the market at the least cost. 
MBED can also enable pit-head (close to mines) coal plants to run at higher capacity due to superior economics, which will help reduce the cost and requirement of transporting coal to generators that are distant from mines. 
Power companies in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra pay close to INR 5,000 crore a year to transport coal from Chhattisgarh. With MBED, close to 7,000 MW of idle thermal generation capacity can be enabled in Chhattisgarh. From a larger economic standpoint, this also entails efficiency savings, as transporting electrons will be more efficient than transporting coal.
In the current siloed approach of scheduling, states rich in renewable energy struggle with grid balancing within their state boundaries due to the variability of renewable generation and are forced to curtail unexpected surplus. Meanwhile, regions with limited renewable potential are struggling to meet their Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs). This problem is bound to worsen with the expected growth of renewable energy.
A centralized marketplace established by MBED will expand the coverage of balancing areas from a state level to a national level, facilitating increased renewable integration and reducing the risks of renewable curtailment. 
A larger balancing area enabled by MBED would transfer the responsibility of balancing the grid from the host state to the state procuring renewable generation. The state would have to consider the supply of renewables in its schedule and manage its conventional generators to balance the grid. 
A wider balancing area would also reduce solar and wind variability due to geographic diversity. Hence, MBED can unlock regional integration and offset the disparity between renewables rich states and those lacking in renewable potential.
Given the significant overhaul needed to implement MBED, the Ministry of Power has proposed rolling out the first phase of MBED in April 2022 with the fleet of NTPC thermal stations. This first phase would help identify the challenges faced by discoms and generators before a nationwide rollout. Few lingering challenges can be foreseen as MBED becomes universal.
First, sector governance hurdles may emerge that could challenge the transition. Of chief concern are state generating units, many of them coal-based, which run the risk of idling, given that most plants are older and might not be able to compete based on their variable costs.
Second, the larger question of idle plants also raises the issue of continued capacity payment (fixed charges for having the plant online), given that MBED bidding is based purely on variable cost. This has dual concerns for discom finances going forward and for manging incentives for fresh capacity, given the poor track record discoms have had as financially reliable customers. There will be policy questions on reducing this capacity payment for existing plants while also reducing the financial risk for future plants.
Lastly, as renewable energy continues to outcompete coal, the future role of coal will become more challenging under MBED. If the technical capabilities of coal plants improve and grid services are properly rewarded (such as envisaged under the draft ancillary services regulation), there is still room for coal as a flexibility and grid support asset. But even that role will be challenged as the price of battery storage gradually drops.
While challenges exist, the promises of MBED are compelling. It stands to herald the much-needed transformation of India’s electricity market while becoming a crucial enabler for the clean energy transition.

German storage system manufacturer Hager has unveiled two lithium-ion batteries with capacities of 5.8 and 11.6 kWh, respectively.
Although the company calls the devices “flow energy storage systems,” the two batteries have nothing to do with the flow battery technology. In its view, “flow” refers rather to the ability to record energy flows in one’s own home and to steer them optimally in the energy management controller.
In addition, the storage does not come alone, but is already equipped with appropriate inverters for the photovoltaic system. The system also includes an electric vehicle charging station, which is optional. There is also a Smart Grid-Ready interface, which can also be used to integrate an intelligently controllable heat pump. Hager states that the system can be charged and discharged in advance, as it has access to various Internet services such as the weather report. The manufacturer describes it as intelligent charging planning.
The system’s main aim is to increase self-consumption. To do this, the controller registers the residents’ energy consumption habits and recognizes the electricity tariffs of the energy providers. This data flows into the consumption planning along with weather report information. Installation and operation are regulated by a company-owned app.
On the technical side, the battery can handle a maximum DC input power of 18 kW and 1000 V. The MPP trackers search for the best working point from a voltage of between 250 and 850 V. The strings find their way into the inverter via MC4 connectors. The system has an output of 20 amps per phase, with three phases.
The efficiency of the inverter and the battery are indicated at 95%. The efficiency of the overall system is 88%. The depth of discharge is estimated at 100% for both models. The weight of the unit is 196 kg for the 5.8 kWh product and 240 kg for the 11.6 kWh version.
The company states that the system is only sold through specialist companies that have been certified by Hager.

The manufacturer will add a 1.2 GW mono PERC (passivated emitter and rear contact) line to its existing 300 MW state-of-the-art facility in Gujarat. The capacity addition will complete by December end.
Rayzon Solar’s existing facility is equipped with an automated stringer and laminator having the capacity to produce 335Wp polycrystalline and up to 400Wp monocrystalline modules.
Kamlesh Gohil, international business development head at Rayzon Solar, told pv magazine the new 1.2 GW production line will be equipped to produce mono PERC solar panels with wafer sizes up to 220 mm. It will have the capacity to produce panels with up to 600Wp output and an efficiency of 21.4%. 
“It will change the industry scenario and help to get the maximum output from a small area for big-scale PV projects,” said Gohil.
The production line will be equipped with the latest technology like a half-cut cell bussing system with a multi-busbar stringer from Wuxi Lead.
With this addition, Razon Solar will join the list of Indian manufacturers embracing mono PERC technology in line with the global trend and increased domestic demand for these panels. 
JMK’s quarterly solar reports show 2020 was the first year when shipments of high-efficiency monocrystalline PERC modules in India overtook multi-crystalline modules.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/19/micro-inverter-for-balcony-solar-modules/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 19, 2021",Micro-inverter for balcony solar modules,"From pv magazine International
Greenakku, a German provider of solar modules for applications in balconies, has begun selling a micro-inverter that German manufacturer Bosswerk has specifically designed for balcony PV panels.
The BW-MI300 and BW-MI600 inverters were developed for plug-in photovoltaic systems and allow monitoring via WiFi connection. The BW-MI300 costs €149 in the Greenakku online shop and the BW-MI600 €259. Bosswerk grants a 12-year product guarantee.
The only difference between the two products is the output power: while the BW-MI300 feeds up to 300 W into the household power grid, the BW-MI600 supplies up to 600 W. The recommended input power from the solar panel to the BW-MI300 is between 210 to 400 W, with the BW-MI600 the output power can be almost double.
According to Greenakku, the two products have the highest efficiency in this device class. From a module voltage of 20 V, they generate the 230 V alternating current required for the household supply. As soon as the starting voltage is applied on the photovoltaic side, the microinverter feeds the electricity into the domestic power grid. The module output can be displayed, saved and statistically evaluated by the user via a WiFi connection on a tablet, smartphone or PC. A quick shutdown function ensures safety in the event of a power failure.
Greenakku calculates that a solar module with 360 W of power delivers up to 400 kWh of electricity per year, depending on the location and orientation. At an electricity price of €0.30 per kWh, it may result in savings of up to €120 per year. According to the PV product distributor, the price for a complete system with micro-inverter, a 360 W module and mounting system is around €400. In the best-case scenario, the small system therefore pays for the investment again after four years.
