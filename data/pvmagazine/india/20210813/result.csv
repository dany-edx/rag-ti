https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/13/lithium-sulfur-battery-with-shorter-charging-time-longer-lifespan/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,JAPAN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 13, 2021","Lithium-sulfur battery with shorter charging time, longer lifespan","From pv magazine International
One of the main issues with lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is that they cannot be recharged enough times to make them commercially viable. This is due to the formation of lithium polysulfides during the fabrication process and is the reason for the rapid deterioration of their capacity.
Scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan claim to have overcome this issue by using two new materials – titanium oxide (TiO2) and titanium nitride (TiN).
During the fabrication of a lithium-sulfur battery, the lithium always reacts with sulfur, they said, noting that initially this combination produces lithium polysulfide, which can easily dissolve into polysulfides and negatively affect device performance. To improve the batteries, the lithium polysulfide should immediately begin to transform the final product into either lithium sulfide (Li2S) or lithium persulfide (Li2S2).
In the new battery configuration, the use of TiO2 is designed to absorb undesired polysulfides, while the TiN accelerates the absorption process. The scientists developed the best-performing battery by coating a carbon nanotube framework (CNT) with 10 nm of TiN and 5 nm of TiO2 and adopting an annealing post-treatment, which resulted in a uniform TiN-TiO2 heterostructure with high catalytic ability.
“The corresponding lithium-sulfur battery shows enhanced electrochemical performance with high specific capacity of 1289 mAh g−1 at 1 C and capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles at 2 C,” the Japanese scientists stated.
This performance translates into shorter charging times, longer life between charges, and greater overall lifespans, they claimed. They described their battery and the related manufacturing process in “Long-life lithium-sulfur batteries with high areal capacity based on coaxial CNTs@TiN-TiO2 sponge,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
The University of Maryland and the Argonne National Laboratory have also recently conducted research on the polysulfide issue for sulfur-lithium batteries.

But as electricity use grows, which it does exponentially, the grid strains. The use of renewable energy sources and new regulations can add to the complexity and strain.
Without the implementation of new technologies and models, we’ll be stuck with an unreliable power system where technical, as well as non-technical parameters, will be neglected. It can lead to significant chaos, harming the interests of various stakeholders. That type of neglect could make commonplace incidents like a 2012 blackout in India that left 230 million without power.
Smart grids are, undoubtedly, the definitive solution for managing electricity distribution in a world dependent on renewable energy.
But what makes them smarter? And why do we need them?
At a core level, the challenges of the grid come down to a simple fact. It needs to produce exactly as much electricity as is demanded. If demand exceeds supply, brown- or black-outs are possible. When supply exceeds demand, power plants may be forced offline to help stabilize frequency and voltage.
Demand fluctuates all the time, from day to night, and from hour to hour. Those demand shifts can be largely predicted based on historical data. Power plants may go on and offline in response to demand. But renewable energy sources change the calculus. They produce power based on factors like weather, which may not match demand.
That’s where smart grids come in. As the smart grid is a two-way system, it will act as a safeguard, automatically rerouting power in case of equipment failure and power outages. They integrate information technologies with renewable energy sources, creating a two-way conversation between suppliers and consumers. This conversation is enabled with smart metering devices, which accurately monitor power consumption at a granular level.
Smart grids enable the efficient transmission of electricity, better restoration of electricity after fluctuations, lower peak demand and power costs for consumers, provide better integration of renewable energy systems with the power grid, improved security and much more.
Smart architecture for a complex world
Smart metering offers substantial benefits like reduced commercial losses, effective monitoring of energy (real-time or near real-time), energy theft detection, enhancements in grid reliability and better revenue management. Furthermore, it enables customers to keep track of their energy consumption, allowing them to adjust their usage as required.
Presently, researchers are more focused on the deployment of more complicated information, communication technologies and control in a multi-layered architecture. The two-way communication between a smart meter and the grid may allow an automated building, for example, to detect when consumption is high. It could, for example, turn off power to uninhabited parts of the building in response, or adjust heating and cooling settings in response.
But that two-way communication adds another layer of complexity, because demand may shift again because of reactions from smart meters, just as the grid brings more power sources online.
Power generated by renewable sources and corresponding action taken by business layers is not predictable. So it’s imperative that the latest controls are leveraged in the service of smart grids. As the smart grid evolves, it will undoubtedly transform grid operations in the same way the internet did.
The smart grid shows an unmatched scope to move the electrical energy industry into a new milestone of reliability and efficiency that will enhance our environment’s health. Undeniably, this transition period is crucial. The adoption of sophisticated testing and control technologies, raising consumer awareness and implementing regulations and standards for the same would require robust engineering and management protocols.

German PV module manufacturer Bauer Solartechnik GmbH has unveiled two new PV modules for residential and commercial rooftop solar projects.
Its new BS-M10 panels series includes two PV modules with outputs of 400 W and 405 W. The panels became available for sale from this month, the manufacturer said.
The two modules feature 10-busbar half-cells with efficiencies of 21%. A total of 108 half cells have been used for the modules, which measure 1,723 mm x 1,133 mm x 35 mm and weigh 21.7 kg.  The panels are available with black aluminum frames and white or black backsheets.
Bauer Solartechnik said the use of half cells reduces power losses due to lower cell resistance. The cells also increase total reflection, it said, noting that the increase in the number of busbars to 10 helps to improve module performance.
It also claimed that the cell arrangement will reduce performance losses when the modules are shaded. The hollow chamber frames, which are made of anodized aluminum, are torsion-resistant and corrosion-free. They are also compatible with all common mounting systems, the company said.
The new solar modules are immediately available to buy. However, due to high demand, the company has been unable to make any statements about delivery volumes thus far.
Bauer Solartechnik has a global production capacity of more than 500 MW.
