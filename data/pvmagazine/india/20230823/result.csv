Q2 2023 additions stood at 1.7 GW, almost 58% down from 4 GW installed in Q2 2022, according to the newly released Q2 2023 India Solar Market Update by Mercom India Research.
Large-scale solar projects accounted for 77% (over 1.3 GW) of capacity added in Q2 2023, with rooftop solar making up the rest (23%). 
India’s cumulative installed solar capacity, including total rooftop solar installations, surpassed 66 GW as of June 2023.
The country’s utility-scale project development pipeline stood at over 67 GW as of June 30, 2023, with an additional 62 GW of projects tendered awaiting auction.
“Delays, extensions, and postponements have led to a substantial number of solar projects being deferred to the next year, making 2023 a year of setbacks for solar in India. Consequently, 2024 looks extremely robust. Rapidly declining solar component and project costs will be a catalyst for additional growth,” stated Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/23/new-research-shows-renewables-are-more-profitable-than-nuclear-power/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MARIE BEYER,"AUGUST 23, 2023",New research shows renewables are more profitable than nuclear power,"From pv magazine France
A group of researchers from the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE), and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) have published new research questioning recent efforts to increase investments in nuclear power, especially in the European Union and the United States – a political choice justified by the desire to decarbonize economies as quickly as possible.
However, the researchers show that in terms of cost and speed, renewable energy sources have already beaten nuclear and that each investment in new nuclear plants delays decarbonization compared to investments in renewable energies. “In a decarbonizing world, delays increase CO2 emissions,” the researchers pointed out.
The researchers considered all planned nuclear capacities and said the increase in costs from the original project proposals is significant.
For example, they found that the delayed Flammanville project in France saw its budget increase from €3.3 billion ($3.6 billion) to €13.2 billion, noting that these figures don’t even include the financing costs, which the French Court of Auditors estimated at €4.2 billion against an initial €1.2 billion.
Another example comes from Finland, where the Olkiluoto plant, which was originally planned to cost €3 billion, ended up costing around €11 billion. And this is nothing new. Already in 2014, a study on the comparative costs of electricity infrastructure found that 97% of the 180 nuclear reactor investment projects analyzed experienced cost overruns, with an average cost increase of 117% per project.
“Historically high default risk translates into higher interest rates,” the scientists emphasized. “These two factors make the profitability of nuclear projects highly dependent on financing conditions.”
In France, the national network operator RTE estimates that an electricity system including nuclear will be slightly cheaper than a system based solely on renewable energies in 2050, it is however necessary to take into account its optimism on the projections of investment. “In its calculations, RTE assumes that the investment costs for new nuclear power plants are less than two-thirds of the estimated costs of European pressurized reactor (EPR) power plants in Finland and France,” explained the researchers. “This optimism about cost reduction does not reflect the evolution of the costs of old nuclear reactors in many countries.”
According to the researchers, given the latest EPR projects and investment trends, nuclear costs will tend to increase over the next few years.
“Despite its low profitability, nuclear energy is presented as a good investment to fight against climate change. However, today, the competition for the profitability of nuclear does not come from coal or gas, but from renewable energies,” the scientists stated.
The study also questions the reliability of the nuclear fleet, particularly given the dramatically low availability of French power plants this year – nearly half of the 56 nuclear reactors were closed even though the EU was in a complicated period of electricity supply with frequent peaks in the price of electricity above €3/kWh.
The availability of this electrical source is also questioned in view of the increasingly frequent droughts expected in the coming years, causing, in particular, low river flows and therefore associated problems of cooling power plants.
“Flexibility rather than baseload generation is needed to balance a renewable energy-based power system,” the research team highlighted. “However, the ramp-up of a nuclear power plant is slow and the composition of the cost of nuclear energy does not correspond to the role of a backup technology for electrical systems with high shares of wind and solar energy.”
On a large scale, both renewables and nuclear power will have low electricity prices for much of the year, but very high prices for hundreds of hours, resulting in uncertain and highly variable revenues. According to the researchers, the backup technology in a sustainable energy mix should be a low-capital-cost, high-variable-cost power generation technology, the opposite of a nuclear power plant, which has very high upfront costs. They instead suggest the integration of storage in the form of hydrogen, using batteries or pumped hydroelectricity, based in particular on the Bloomberg analysis, which reports a price of battery storage down from $1,220 to $132 per kWh between 2010 and 2021.
“Given enough time, it may be possible to build a nuclear power plant to the highest safety standards and remain economically relevant, even taking into account the costs of storing nuclear waste for thousands of years,” the scientists concluded. “However, building nuclear power plants requires many years of planning and construction and is expensive, while the climate crisis demands urgency and requires such large investments that profitability is paramount.”

Perth-based ClearVue is claiming a win, with its clear solar windows delivering positive peer-reviewed results following a two-year study.
The ASX-listed West Australian company notes that its fully transparent solar windows, set up in a BIPV construction for a greenhouse at Murdoch University in Perth, delivered 19 kWh/day, offsetting nearly 40% of energy costs. In addition, the windows performed through all conditions, and occasionally outperformed traditional PV modules during periods f rain, including installation across a range of angles, and in dusty areas. The paper, titled ‘Field Performance Monitoring of Energy-Generating High-Transparency Agrivoltaic Glass Windows’ was published in MDPI’s Technologies journal.
ClearVue specializes in solar windows that allow up to 70% of visible light transmission through optically clear glass, simultaneously harnessing the entire spectrum of light, including UV rays. A noteworthy aspect of these windows involves directing long-wavelength light to the window’s edge, where solar panels capture the energy.
While the paper does not extensively emphasize the overall window efficiency, it highlights that each window, measuring 1.2m by 1.1m, produced a range of 30–33 W per m2. The paper calls for additional research to better ClearVue’s latest iteration boasts improvements such as reduced weight, enhanced thinness, accelerated manufacturing capabilities, and higher efficiency approaching 5% overall.
Now as a proven technology, following decades of attempts to make conforming products over the years, ClearVue has an advantage with a scalable and mass-produced product, sized to industry standards, and has reached a second-generation BIPV glass window product following research and development progress.
This peer-reviewed data substantiates ClearVue’s aspirations. As a publicly listed entity, the company continues to provide investors with quarterly and occasional updates regarding revenue, income, and outflows incurred due to ongoing investments in technology and customer acquisition. The company posted a $2 million loss without revenue in the last reported quarter, with just over $5.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Aside from R&D efforts and revenues from customers, a $2 million grant was awarded in May 2023 for the local manufacturing of its core technology, providing a boost outside of sales.

University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers have showcased a promising avenue to adapt hydrogen fuel cell technologies for greener chemical production. Collaborating with Merck & Co, the researchers employed hydrogen as an external electron source for electrosynthetic reductions. By using a specific organic compound called quinone to draw electrons from hydrogen, the system becomes more sustainable by eliminating the need for zinc as the electron source. The researchers said this quinone-mediated H2 anode system supports cross-electrophile coupling (XEC), a type of cross-coupling reaction catalyzed by nickel, amplifying electrons’ energy through electricity. The researchers aim to enhance the technology for industrial-scale use across various chemical processes.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul has unveiled a substantial initiative of nearly $14 million to drive advancements in clean hydrogen research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) projects. The initiative allocates up to $8 million for projects addressing the challenges of decarbonizing industrial process heat and advancing clean hydrogen production and renewable energy integration. This effort, led by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), encourages entities or teams to compete for funding under two technical challenge areas, encompassing hydrogen applications to decarbonize industrial process heat and clean hydrogen production integrated with renewable energy.
The Indian government has introduced standardized green hydrogen criteria, delineating emission thresholds necessary for categorizing hydrogen produced via electrolysis or biomass as green. The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy has defined Green Hydrogen as having a well-to-gate emission not exceeding 2 kg CO2 equivalent per kg H2.
BPH Energy has announced a plan, pending shareholder approval, to invest an additional $250,000 in Clean Hydrogen Technologies Corporation. This decision would boost BPH Energy’s stake in the company to 17.5%, alongside investee Advent Energy.
Fives, a French industrial conglomerate, has unveiled its pioneering 100% hydrogen duct burner – the Hy-Ductflam. This innovative solution allows customers to seamlessly transition from 100% natural gas to 100% hydrogen without necessitating any equipment modifications.
