Tata Power’s generation mix is dominated by coal-based thermal power capacity even as it makes impressive gains in expanding its renewables assets.
As of March 31, Tata had a total power generation capacity of 12,808 MW, with thermal accounting for 69% (8,859 MW) and the near-4 GW balance accounted for by 1,762 MW of solar, 932 MW of wind, 880 MW of hydro and 375 MW of blast-furnace gas waste-heat recovery.
To switch to clean energy, the company will not develop new coal-based capacity or acquire coal-based stressed assets. The existing thermal fleet will be retired upon the end of plant life or the expiry of power purchase agreements, Tata has announced.
As a staging post to net zero, the company intends to have 80% of its generation assets ‘clean and green’ this decade, up from 31% at the end of March, with Tata considering its gas-related waste heat capacity under that definition.
The Mumbai-based electric utility – part of the global manufacturing conglomerate Tata Group – said it will add 2 GW of solar and hybrid-technology capacity annually to hit 25 GW this decade, up from 4 GW three months ago. Microgrids will form an important part of the strategy, with Tata having commissioned 161 of them to date, with more 4.8 MW of total generation capacity.
The electric company also intends to bring in a portfolio of renewables technologies, including hybrid clean energy plants, offshore wind, floating solar, and hydrogen fuel and has said it will strengthen its battery storage partnerships.
Tata’s current renewables activity encompasses utility and rooftop solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC); floating solar; microgrids; and hybrid systems; as well as solar products such as pumps, modules and cells, and reverse-osmosis water purification devices.
The power company’s Tata Power Solar Systems unit is India’s largest utility scale solar EPC and had a presence in 11 states and an order book of more than 2.8 GW worth around INR8,700 crore at the end of March.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/01/a-solar-pavilion-for-indias-rooftops/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,INDIA",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JULY 1, 2021",A solar pavilion for India’s rooftops,"From pv magazine International
Anyone who has visited India will know roof terraces are a common focus of residential life, a fact which hinders rooftop PV use and renders the nation’s ambitious solar targets even more daunting to achieve.
To overcome the hurdle, Germany’s international development agency – the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)– has developed a rooftop system designed for the Indian market.
The ‘PV Port & Store’ system is a ready-to-use array that, according to the GIZ, can be bought, installed, and switched on within two days and takes the form of a pavilion with two benches and a solar module roof to offer shade. The benches are hollow plastic bowls filled with water and have three functions. Their water-filled weight is 1.5 tons, anchoring the system even at wind speeds of 200 kilometers per hour; the water can feed a sprinkler, for module cleaning; and it also cools a battery and hybrid inverter stowed inside the benches in drawers surrounded by water.
Designed for the Indian market, the pavilion is aimed at 100% self-consumption of the solar power generated. By means of its own dynamic energy measurement of household consumption, the inverter determines whether, and how much, valuable power should be used by the household to avoid electricity flowing to the grid. Smaller systems of that nature, which only cover household electricity demand, do not have to be registered with local energy suppliers, reducing paperwork.
Similar systems have encountered problems when the final circuit load is too high and, as a result, can cause household cabling malfunction. In such cases, the electricity fed into the house network from the roof is added to the electricity consumed, causing cables to heat. To prevent this, the inverter in the German-designed pavilion has a protection fuse and measuring sensors. Another feature of the PV Port & Store is an emergency power capability, a useful precaution, given power outages are particularly common in India. In addition, grid operators could access pavilion batteries to use any stored electricity for grid-related services.
The price of the pavilion varies depending on the size and location of each installation. A GIZ spokesperson estimated a target price for a 2 kW system with a small lead-acid battery, at around €2,500. A system with a large lithium iron phosphate battery would cost around €5,500.
The 2 kW devices will be available in five versions. For storage capacity, customers can choose between 2.4 and 4.8 kWh. Buyers can opt for lead-acid batteries, whose service life is estimated at around three years, or ten-year lithium iron phosphate devices. There is also a 1.6 kW pavilion, which does not offer energy storage.
Although such systems could be used by multiple tenants, even the model with the largest battery storage capacity would find the power generated consumed by the requirements of a single air-conditioned room.
The pavilion is manufactured by the home-pv business controlled by India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energies. With regards to manufacturing, the ministry says it has already tasked three companies with branch offices in India to roll out the systems, namely: Servotech, Kosol and Enphase.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/01/fraunhofer-ise-unveils-68-9-efficient-iii-v-solar-cell-for-laser-energy-transmission-systems/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 1, 2021",Fraunhofer ISE unveils 68.9%-efficient III-V solar cell for laser energy transmission systems,"From pv magazine International
Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE claims to have achieved a 68.9% conversion efficiency rate for a III-V solar cell that can be used in laser energy transmissions systems.
“In this new form of energy transfer, called power by light, the laser energy is delivered either through the air or via an optical fiber to a photovoltaic cell whose properties match the power and the wavelength of the monochromatic laser light,” the scientists explained. “Compared to conventional power transmission via copper wires, power by light systems are especially beneficial for applications which require a galvanically isolated power supply, lightning or explosion protection, electromagnetic compatibility, or completely wireless power transmission, for example.”
Laser energy transmission systems are not very different from energy transmission systems based on microwave technology. These systems convert the power source into an emitter that generates a directional electromagnetic radiation, which is subsequently absorbed in a receiver. The latter can then convert this energy into electricity, heat, or hydrogen. These systems can be used for the monitoring of wind turbines and high-voltage lines, as well as fuel sensors in aircraft tanks and passive optical networks, among other things.
The cell was built with layers grown on gallium arsenide substrate, which was then subsequently removed, and a highly reflective mirror applied to the back surface of the ultra-thin remaining semiconductor structure. The reflector was optically optimized through a combination of ceramic and silver and the cell’s absorber was based on nitrogen-doped gallium arsenide and p-type aluminum gallium arsenide.
“This thin film approach has two distinct advantages for the efficiency,” explained the head of the Fraunhofer ISE research team, Henning Helmers. “First of all, photons are trapped in the cell and the absorption is maximized for photon energies close to the bandgap, which simultaneously minimizes thermalization and transmission losses, making the cell more efficient. Secondly, the photons additionally generated internally by radiative recombination become trapped and effectively recycled. This extends the effective carrier lifetime, thus additionally increasing the voltage.”
Other Fraunhofer ISE researchers achieved in April a 35.9% conversion efficiency for a III-V monolithic triple-junction solar cell based on silicon. In August 2020, the research institute announced a 25.9% conversion efficiency rate for a III-V tandem solar cell grown directly on silicon. This cell is a modified version of a 34.5%-efficient III-V solar cell that is manufactured through a process known as direct wafer bonding, where the III-V layers are first deposited on an aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate and then pressed together.
Researchers at the Tampere University in Finland have recently developed a III-V multi-junction solar cell which is claimed to have the potential for reaching a power conversion efficiency of close to 50%. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States announced last year a 32.9% efficiency for a tandem cell device utilizing III-V materials.
