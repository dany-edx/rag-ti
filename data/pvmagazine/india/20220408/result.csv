https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/08/offgrid-energy-labs-unveils-zincgel-battery-technology-for-stationary-and-low-powered-mobility-applications/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 8, 2022",Offgrid Energy Labs unveils ZincGel battery technology for stationary and low-powered mobility applications,"IIT Kanpur-incubated startup Offgrid Energy Labs today announced its ZincGel battery technology for stationary and low-powered mobility applications. ZincGel batteries are non-flammable, durable, and cost-efficient, fostering the growth of both low-powered mobility and renewable energy globally. These batteries can be easily manufactured, even in India, at scale as the raw materials are commonly available.
Offgrid Energy Labs has designed ZincGel on a modular platform that can be modified to suit different application requirements and plans to commercially launch ZincGel products in India by next year. The startup will be targeting mobility partners to bring forth solutions for fleets operating low-powered electric vehicles like two-wheelers and three-wheelers.
“ZincGel battery technology is a highly efficient alternative to the costly imported batteries currently available in India. It will balance the performance and pricing of batteries with the introduction of zinc-based non-toxic materials. The first-of-its-kind technology has promising concepts and designs to address most of the issues faced by Li-ion batteries, especially in the battery swapping sector,” stated the company release.

Offgrid Energy Labs aims to establish ZincGel as a commercially viable and sustainable technology for battery swapping applications in the low-powered electric mobility segment. It works on a partnership model that leverages the ecosystem while the company will primarily focus on technology innovations within ZincGel Battery for different applications. Offgrid Energy has already partnered with Shell in the segment. It is also in talks with established brands in battery manufacturing, battery swapping, and other ecosystem enablers to create a financially viable network.
Offgrid Energy Labs’ ZincGel Battery Technology boasts energy efficiency at par with lithium-ion batteries but with twice the lifecycle and negligible operational cost, leading to significant savings for two-wheeler EV operators. ZincGel batteries can be a viable option to conventional batteries as these can handle performance and thermal stress, ensure zero flammability and ease of manufacturing, and are made from recyclable materials.
Rishi Srivastava, Co-founder, Offgrid Energy Labs, said, “We are here to reduce the dependency on Lithium-Ion battery packs and move to sustainable battery storage serving both the stationary as well as specific mobility applications. The demand for batteries is set to skyrocket soon not just in India, but across the globe. What differentiates ZincGel technology is innovative chemistry, design, and democratized materials.”
“We look forward to announcing further strategic pilots that solve vexing problems in the energy storage space. For electric three-wheelers, ZincGel will offer at least three times the life, reducing the frequency of battery replacement. Because of all these features, ZincGel is going to be cost-efficient and safer than any other battery technology used in these applications,” said Rishi Srivastava, co-founder, Offgrid Energy Labs.
“We are super-excited to tweak ZincGel for battery swapping application. We have designed ZincGel as a modular platform that can be modified basis application requirements. With the ability to prioritize between charging speed, temperature stability, and energy density, our innovation is focused on addressing a wide variety of stationary and low-powered mobility applications. Clearly, the amount of renewable energy that is being injected into the grid is increasing around the world. As a result, we require extremely powerful storage mechanisms to enable the power of renewables. This is where we would drive the new revolution by bringing ZincGel battery technology in priority stationary and mobility applications,” said Tejas Kusurkar, co-founder and CEO, Offgrid Energy Labs.
Siddharth Mehta, Principal Shell Ventures, added, “India needs a robust energy storage mechanism to empower the capacity of renewables being injected into the framework. The demand of the hour is to revolutionize the battery technology for the efficient energy storage segment. Offgrid Energy Labs is engaging in this new energy storage ecosystem by inventing a ZincGel battery that is meticulously designed to decarbonize and face the larger challenges which are being faced by several incumbents within the energy storage market.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/08/aluminum-nickel-molten-salt-battery-for-seasonal-renewables-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 8, 2022",Aluminum-nickel molten salt battery for seasonal renewables storage,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed an aluminum-nickel (Al-Ni) molten salt battery that, under thermal cycling, exhibits high retention of cell capacity over periods of weeks.
The scientists described the small prototype as a “freeze-thaw battery” that cuts off the self-charge function when a battery is idling. “It’s a lot like growing food in your garden in the spring, putting the extra in a container in your freezer, and then thawing it out for dinner in the winter,” explained researcher Minyuan Miller Li.
The battery is charged by heating it to around 180 C, with its ions flowing through the liquid electrolyte. The device is then restored to room temperature and the electrolyte becomes solid, thus trapping the ions that transport the stored energy.
“The freeze-thaw phenomenon is possible because the battery’s electrolyte is molten salt – a molecular cousin of ordinary table salt. The material is liquid at higher temperatures but solid at room temperature,” the scientists said.
They noted that the battery can be heated again, as the ions restart flowing through the electrolyte when energy is needed. They built it with an aluminum anode and a nickel cathode, immersed in a sea of molten-salt electrolyte.

They added sulfur to the electrolyte to increase the battery’s storage capacity. A ceramic separator was embedded between the anode and the cathode to avoid breakage during the freeze-thaw cycle.
“The PNNL battery uses simple fiberglass, possible because of the battery’s stable chemistry. This cuts costs and makes the battery sturdier when undergoing freeze-thaw cycles,” said the scientists.
They claimed that the battery can retain 92% of its initial capacity over a period of 12 weeks. They said it has a theoretical energy density of 260 W/hours per kg.
“The battery’s energy is stored at a materials cost of about $23 per kilowatt-hour, measured before a recent jump in the cost of nickel,” they said. “The team is exploring the use of iron, which is less expensive, in hopes of bringing the materials cost down to around $6 per kilowatt-hour, roughly 15 times less than the materials cost of today’s lithium-ion batteries.
The scientists described the battery in “A freeze-thaw molten salt battery for seasonal storage,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
