https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/14/coal-a-heavy-burden-on-indian-railways/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,SUSTAINABILITY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 14, 2023","Coal, a heavy burden on Indian Railways","A new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) finds Indian Railways can better utilize its resources and serve the Indian economy more effectively if policymakers focus on accelerating renewable energy generation rather than expanding coal freight by rail.
The report analyses various forecasts by different agencies of the Indian government and finds that there are plans to increase coal freight transported by rail by at least 400 million tonnes in the next eight years. To meet the target, a range of rail infrastructure projects, including the recently opened Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, are imminent or ongoing. The authorities are actively considering more such projects.
“The prioritization of coal freight presents opportunity costs for the Indian Railways and the nation more broadly. A renewed focus by policymakers on generating more electricity from renewable sources and moving it over wires rather than in the form of coal would help the Indian Railways play a more effective role in India’s changing economy,” says the report’s author, Charles Worringham, Guest Contributor, IEEFA.
The report recommends that railway infrastructure planning should be continuously updated to take account of new renewable generation goals and improved electricity demand outlooks to better forecast actual future coal freight requirements.
Further, the report highlights that apart from financial resources, developing coal evacuation infrastructure diverts the Indian Railways’ human and physical resources. The sheer number of projects centred on coal, as well as the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, reduces the availability of planning, design, project management, engineering, equipment and materials for basic maintenance and upgrade work on the general network.
This is particularly concerning as network congestion issues are cropping up again for the Indian Railways, according to the report’s analysis of recent data.
“In an expanding and changing economy, transporting raw materials, refrigerated food and finished goods, and enhanced passenger services require network capacity. These services could face significant constraints due to coal freight expansion, which would also worsen the trend of roads increasing their modal share,” says Worringham.
The report recommends prioritizing and incentivizing new renewable energy generation projects in regions where thermal power plants are far from India’s coal regions.
“Long distances have a disproportionately negative effect on railway network congestion and make a far larger call on railway resources,” says Worringham.
The report also highlights stranded asset risk as one of the key concerns of Indian Railways’ investments in coal evacuation projects.
“Most of the coal evacuation infrastructure is coming up in India’s least populated areas. As electricity generation from renewable sources ramps up further and the demand for coal declines in the coming decades, there may not be enough new freight in the coal-bearing regions to justify the Indian Railways’ capital expenditure outlay,” says Worringham.
“To minimize stranded asset risks, all specific potential new railway infrastructure called for in the Integrated Coal Logistics Plan should be re-evaluated, using realistic estimates of project completion timelines and probable project costs, and take account of India’s energy transition progress in coming decades,” he adds.

Swedish zinc-ion specialist Enerpoly has secured a SEK 88.5 million ($8.4 million) three-year grant from the Swedish Energy Agency, enabling it to demonstrate its patented technology with the world’s first megafactory to manufacture zinc-ion batteries.
The grant marks the first step toward financing the production plant. Enerpoly will raise additional private capital through a Series A funding round, which will come on top of $13.8 million the company has raised to date.
“Enerpoly’s current production line is 100 kWh a year,” Enerpoly CEO Eloisa de Castro told pv magazine. “We plan to have the factory up and running in 2026 and aim to have the production scaled to 100 MWh a year by the end of that same year.”
Enerpoly’s goal is to demonstrate that zinc-ion batteries can be “affordably and profitably mass-produced at scale, with attractive returns for investors.”
The project roadmap for the grant includes developing automated manufacturing systems to streamline processes, improving energy efficiency in cell production, and ensuring optimal productivity and safety at the plant, according to the company. Enerpoly will also work to build a sustainable European value chain, strengthen intellectual property protection, and further expand its workforce in Sweden.
Enerpoly has developed its zinc-ion battery technology from abundant materials. Specifically, it uses zinc metal as the anode and manganese dioxide as the cathode, with a water-based electrolyte. Its proprietary battery cells are built with a prismatic form factor.
Enerpoly’s batteries are best suited for medium to long duration applications for stationary energy storage with two- to 10-hour discharge durations.
The modular battery technology is said to be non-flammable and non-explosive properties and therefore well-suited for use in challenging applications, such as critical infrastructure and densely populated urban areas. Enerpoly batteries have been tested against the UL 9540A standard.
Its 3 kWh battery packs weigh 60 kilograms and measure 800 mm x 177 mm x 432 mm. They operate in the temperature range of -10 C to 50 C. The nominal voltage stands at 48 V, with a nominal capacity of 60 Ah. The battery packs have a maximum charge/discharge power of 2.8 kW, with 1.4 kW of continuous power.
In February, Enerpoly announced plans to develop prototypes of a residential plug-in storage system with rechargeable zinc batteries in Europe, under an EU-funded collaborative project with Austrian startup EET.
Under the “ZincMate” project, the partners will produce prototypes of a plug-in storage system with rechargeable zinc batteries. The technical basis for ZincMate is EET’s on-grid technology, in combination with Enerpoly’s cost-effective batteries.
EET makes photovoltaic systems with energy storage that can be set up on a balcony and plugged into a wall outlet. Founded in 2017, EET is said to be the only company producing storage devices that can be installed by amateurs, without the help of technicians.
EET’s innovation core for the SolMate device is an integrated and patented measurement technology that can assess the energy demand of a household via a power outlet connection. This eliminates the need for further installation or connection to a household’s electric grid.
“Currently, EET’s SolMate device is equipped with a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery and it’s obvious that battery technology needs to improve,” EET CEO Christoph Grimmer said earlier this year. “Moving to zinc-ion technology for residential applications is the next step in the right direction.”
