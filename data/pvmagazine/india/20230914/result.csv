Bhalla said the government has made significant efforts towards building a solar manufacturing ecosystem through the production-linked incentives (PLI) Scheme and other policy measures.
Over 48 GW of new PV manufacturing capacity will be supported through the production-linked incentives (PLI) Scheme, which has a budgetary outlay of INR 24,000 crore. These capacities are coming up in different buckets of integration: poly-to-module, ingot-wafers-to-module, and cells+modules. Currently, India has a solar PV module manufacturing capacity of 28 GW and cell capacity of 6 GW per year.
Bhalla said many of the companies are not only producing the quantum allocated [under the PLI Scheme] but setting up much bigger capacities.
“Therefore, we estimate that by 2026, after the PLI Scheme is fully implemented and other manufacturing capacities also come up, we should be in a position to have 100 GW of solar PV module manufacturing capacity,” he added.
India targets 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based electricity generation capacity by 2030, including around 300 GW from solar. With 71.6 GW of solar capacity installed as of Aug. 31, 2023, the nation will need to add 30-40 GW per year of solar power capacity to reach the 2030 target.

The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for agrivoltaic bifacial systems based on single-axis trackers is 23% lower than that of agrivoltaic bifacial facilities built on fixed structures, a new study from KU Leuven in Belgium has shown.
“Our cost estimations for this pilot study, revealed similar expenses for both fixed and tracked systems,” the research’s lead author, Brecht Willockx told pv magazine. “However, due to the significantly higher specific yield (kWh/kW), the solar tracker exhibited a lower LCOE.”
The researchers conducted a comprehensive comparison between the two system configurations at a testing field located in Grembergen, Belgium, with both systems using the pile drilling technique for their foundations.
The system with the fixed structures was deployed with a row-to-row distance of 9 m to maintain appropriate spacing for crop growth and accessibility. The solar modules have each a nominal power of 455 W and are placed at a maximum height of 2.6 m to minimize any visual impact.
As for the system relying on trackers, the same module types were placed at a height of 2.3 m. “To enhance bifacial gain, the structural elements at the backside are minimized by increasing the gap between the torque tube and module (50 cm) and ensuring longitudinal module spacing (1 cm),” the scientists explained.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the facility based on trackers outperformed the fixed structure setup in energy yield, resulting in approximately a 35% increase in monthly electricity production. Furthermore, the system using tracking showed improved results in land use efficiency, which takes into account both electrical and agricultural yields.
The Belgian group found that, in the rain-fed 2021 season, the tracking system has achieved 15% more total yield. In the same season, the fixed system achieved a 5% lower yield, meaning it was no better than separate production sites. In the dry 2022 season, the tracked system displayed a 47% increase in total yield and the fixed one an increase of 21%, compared to the reference point.
Throughout the rainy growing season of 2021, a smart tracking algorithm, taking into account a trade-off between energy yield and crop yield, was employed, while in the hot and dry season of 2022, the system switched to a traditional full energy tracking algorithm, taking into account only energy yield.
The LCOE for the fixed system constructed by the researchers was found to be €0.10/kWh ($0.107/kWh), while the system with tracking algorithm was €0.077/kWh.
According to the research, those prices hike a bit when considering the crop yield losses that are due to the installation of the PV systems on the field. An additional €0.02/kWh is to be added to the LCOE of the tracked system therefore, while a €0.035/kWh is to be added in the case of the fixed system.
“We believe that the best business model for farmers, investors, and off-takers are power purchase agreements (PPA) contracts, where prices of interspace agrivoltaics are in line with ground-mounted PV,” Willockx added. “However, there is still a significant premium due to the lower installed capacity per hectare and fixed costs.”
The scientists presented their findings in the paper “Performance evaluation of vertical bifacial and single-axis tracked agrivoltaic systems on arable land,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy. “Practical insights and limitations of agrivoltaic systems have been incorporated into the evaluation,” Willockx said.

Days after a number of European solar associations urged the European Commission to protect the bloc’s PV industry from “unfair” Chinese competition, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, provided a series of statements that appear to indicate that the union is now ready to take a completely new stand toward China when it comes to the energy sector.
“We have not forgotten how China’s unfair trade practices affected our solar industry,” she said. “Many young businesses were pushed out by heavily subsidized Chinese competitors. Pioneering companies had to file for bankruptcy. Promising talents went searching for fortune abroad. This is why fairness in the global economy is so important – because it affects lives and livelihoods.”
Von der Leyen did not say which specific measures might be adopted to avoid market distortions in the PV sector. However, she said that the European Union will not accept that prices will be kept “artificially” low by state subsidies.
“And as we do not accept this from the inside, we do not accept this from the outside,” she said. “So I can announce today that the Commission is launching an anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles coming from China.”
SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger praised the commissioner’s “commitment to critical industry made in Europe.” However, Hemetsberger noted that “this promise must translate into action. Solar project developers face inflation-driven headwinds. Europe’s solar manufacturers are at risk of bankruptcy.”

The nation imported 2.3 GW of modules from China in H1 2023, compared to 9.8 GW in the corresponding period of 2022. This followed the imposition of tariffs as India shifted away from imports to focus on building and utilizing domestic manufacturing capacity.
The report states India is the only country to see a significant fall in PV panel imports from China. As India focused and prioritized domestic solar manufacturing, Asia became the only region to see fewer solar imports from China over the first half of 2023 than in the same period.

Neshwin Rodrigues, India Electricity Policy Analyst, Ember, said, “India’s dependence on China for solar module imports is well and truly reducing post-2022 with domestic manufacturing now starting to ramp up as a result of the recent policy interventions. As India gets closer to being self-sufficient in solar manufacturing, overreliance on Chinese modules and cells is no longer the limiting factor. What’s needed now is an effective policy environment to ensure solar installations also ramp up commensurately to not fall behind the National Electricity Plan targets.”
The Ember report analyses Chinese export data and releases a new dataset providing up-to-date monthly data for every destination country. China has at least 80% of the global market share in solar manufacturing capacity. Given the capacity, the growth in Chinese exports has global implications for the scale-up of clean power.
The analysis finds China’s solar panel exports grew by 34% in the first half of 2023, with 114 GW shipped worldwide, compared to 85 GW in the same period last year.
Europe accounted for 58% (66 GW) of China’s solar module exports in H1 2023. The region also saw the greatest absolute growth worldwide, with a 47% YoY growth in solar panel imports from China.
Brazil was the next biggest importer after Europe, receiving 9.5 GW of Chinese solar panel exports in the first six months of 2023.
The report also finds India is now the second largest importer of China-made solar cells after Türkiye.

According to the IEA, the global solar PV manufacturing capacity has increased by over 70% to reach almost 450 GW in 2022. It is expected to double again and reach nearly 1,000 GW capacity per year in 2024. Most of the growth is still in China, although 70 GW per year of capacity will come online spread across the United States, Europe, India, and other countries in Asia.
“We have enough solar panels, we just need to get busy installing them,” said Sam Hawkins, data lead at Ember. “Policies should focus on ensuring installation and grid integration can ramp up as fast as global module supply.”
