The plant will produce high-purity (99.999%) green hydrogen for commercial use.
The scope of work includes the supply and installation of a water electrolyzer system, supply and erection of the balance of plant and commissioning of the entire green hydrogen plant, and comprehensive operation and maintenance for ten years.
The water electrolyzer system can be based on either alkaline water, anion exchange membrane, proton exchange membrane, alkaline membrane solid, or solid oxide electrolyzer technology. The capacity of the electrolyzer modules to be supplied must be minimum 17 kg/hour.
The projection completion period, including supply and execution, is 18 months.
Previously, OIL has commissioned a green hydrogen pilot plant of 100 kW capacity in Jorhat, Assam.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/22/renewsys-launches-encapsulant-for-n-type-topcon-solar-pv-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",RenewSys launches encapsulant for n-type TOPCon solar PV Cells,"RenewSys has introduced India’s first POE (polyolefin elastomer) encapsulant specifically designed for n-type TOPCon PV cells.
The manufacturer said its encapsulant, Conserv E–NT, contains a free radical scavenger that effectively shields TOPCon cells from irreversible damage caused by free radicals generated during the day-to-day PV module functioning. Some common causes of these attacks include fluctuating temperatures, high heat, water ingress, and chemicals from other components of the module.
Conserv E-NT features a wider lamination processing window, allowing for a larger range of acceptable operating conditions during lamination. This directly translates to increased throughput and higher productivity in module manufacturing plants by minimizing module rejections due to lamination issues.
Conserv E-NT is compatible with both one-side and two-side heat laminators. Its use in glass-glass TOPCon PV modules renders the modules bubble-free. The encapsulant also effectively restricts string shifting, a long-standing challenge in module production. These factors further contribute to a reduction in module rejection rates, ensuring a streamlined and efficient manufacturing process, stated RenewSys.
Conserv E-NT suits both glass-glass and glass-backsheet n-type TOPCon solar modules.
Avinash Hiranandani, vice chairman and managing director, RenewSys, said, “This encapsulant will help manufacturers reap many rewards as more and more Indian Module manufacturers introduce their TOPCon offerings. It also ensures that deterioration of TOPCon modules in the field during day-to-day operations is prevented, providing confidence to end customers—homes and businesses adopting solar power.”
Headquartered in Mumbai, RenewSys is an integrated PV module manufacturer with 2.5 GW of panel production capacity, 6 GW of encapsulants, 4 GW of backsheets, and 130 MW of PV cells. It has produced and supplied over 22 GW of encapsulants and backsheets worldwide.
RenewSys is the ‘renewable energy’ arm of the Enpee Group, an international conglomerate established in 1961.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/22/solar-bike-paths-go-online-in-netherlands/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",Solar bike paths go online in Netherlands,"France’s Colas and Dutch construction contractor BAM Royal Group have commissioned two cycle paths equipped with photovoltaic modules in the Netherlands.
The bike paths each span 1,000 square meters in the provinces of North Brabant and North Holland.
The PV module tech offers an efficiency of 21% per square meter. The solar cells are protected by a multilayer of resin and the electrical architecture has been designed to reduce the amount of wiring.
The two cycle paths will produce 160 MWh/year of renewable energy during the first year. The two projects are part of an initiative launched in 2018 by Rijkswaterstaat, which is part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment.
Solar roads in the Netherlands are not an unfamiliar concept. In 2016, a bike path near Amsterdam was equipped with solar panels and another one was built in 2020 in Utrecht. However, the feasibility and economic viability of solar roads remain controversial.
The Dutch government is also developing “Zon op Infra,” a plan to test the viability of solar power production on road infrastructure. The plan includes the deployment of solar installations along highways and on noise barriers. 
The Dutch authorities are struggling to identify surfaces on which to deploy large-scale PV plants due to the scarcity of land. In recent years, research institutes and private companies have tried to prove the feasibility of solar projects on non-agricultural land, including dikes, rooftops, onshore and offshore water surfaces.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/22/isc-konstanz-claims-24-efficiency-for-tunnel-back-contact-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",ISC Konstanz claims 24% efficiency for tunnel back contact solar cell,"From pv magazine Global
German research institute ISC Konstanz has claimed a power conversion efficiency of 24% for a TBC solar cell. The researchers said their new IBC4EU solar cell was designed in accordance with the polyZEBRA concept.
“The polyZEBRA concept is an n-type tunnel back contact (TBC) solar cell featuring polycrystalline silicon TOPCon contacts on both polarities,” ISC Konstanz researcher Jonathan Linke told pv magazine. “The entire process is compatible with industrially established tools, in particular the patterning of the IBC structure is done by laser processes and the metallization by screen-printing. The process is compatible with copper screen printing.”
According to the researchers, the mean efficiency of the cell in a batch of 16 cells was 23.7% efficiency. These results have so far not been confirmed by an independent third-party entity.
The previous maximum efficiency of the device was 23.4%.
“Our goal is to reach soon an efficiency of 25% and an open-circuit voltage of 735 mV,” said Radovan Kopecek, the co-founder and director of ISC Konstanz. “We are working with FuturaSun on industrialization.”
In a recent interview with pv magazine, Kopecek said that interdigitated back contact (IBC) cell tech could account for half of the global market for solar modules by 2030. He says IBC will start to dominate once TopCON and HJT get stuck at certain efficiency limits, and he believes that TOPCon will be the first to fall.
