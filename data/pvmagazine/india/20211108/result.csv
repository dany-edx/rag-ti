The projects are to be set up in 0.5 MW to 2 MW (AC) sizes on a build-own-operate basis. These shall come upon barren/uncultivable land, pasturelands, and marshlands of farmers falling within a 5 km radius from the existing 33/11 kV, 66/11 kV, or 110/11 kV KSEB sub-stations.
Individual farmers, groups of farmers, water user associations, or project developers to whom land has been leased by the farmer for setting up of the solar plant are eligible to bid.
Bidders are not allowed to bid for more than one single solar power plant for a particular substation. The maximum individual project capacity to be developed in each substation shall be 2 MW per bidder, depending on the capacity of the substation.

An engineer in India has developed a handheld drycleaning tool that is cost-effective and can be operated easily by unskilled labor with little training. 
“The panel cleaning tool runs on a 12V, 20Ah lithium battery that provides enough power to run the motor for 6 to 8 hours on a single charge and clean around 800 solar panels daily without water,” tool developer Hariram Sharma told pv magazine. 
As the tool is manually operated, it can be used in any type of solar project, whether rooftop (on RCC and tin shed) or ground-mounted. 
The tool weighs less than 3 kg. It is equipped with a 12V permanent magnet DC motor with > 200 RPM. The brushes are made of 340gsm soft-spun microfiber cloth to safely clean the panels.

Being able to accurately forecast the energy yield of a PV system is important in convincing investors of the returns solar can achieve, as well as providing a benchmark for owners and operators to better understand how a project is performing.
And as PV technology continues to diversify, with more differentiated products making their way to market, understanding how each will perform under certain conditions is an increasingly important consideration. And when a project does not meet expectations, it can cause big problems for all involved, and even harm solar’s wider reputation.
This was on the minds of a group of researchers led by Shoolini University and India’s National Institute of Technology in Hamirpur, who set out to develop a new model to predict the output of solar cells and modules over time. A key consideration for their model was accounting for the often unavoidable performance loss that PV systems experience over time. By working this into the model, the group estimates it is able to increase the accuracy of yield forecasts by as much as 26%.
The model is described in full in the paper A power prediction model and its validation for a roof top photovoltaic power plant considering module degradation, published in Solar Energy. The researchers measured the output and degradation of various solar cells in the lab under a sun simulator, and then validated these results with data from a PV installation on the institute’s rooftop. The paper also identifies different parameters to include in the model under different climate conditions, finding that a simpler model with only three parameters offered the most accurate forecast under low irradiance conditions, while four and five parameter models were more precise as the level of irradiation increased.
“Our model could be useful for developing PV power forecasting software capable of predicting daily, monthly, and yearly solar power generation, which is a crucial parameter for calculating the electricity supply and demand distribution, as well as for marketing PV systems,” said Shoolini University Professor Shyam Singh Chandel. “Being able to predict the output power of different PV technologies will help interested parties decide for the best option available in the market for a particular location. Based on the foreseen energy generation and the selected technology, one can estimate the total expenditure and payback period for a given project.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/08/210mm-wafer-achieves-highest-energy-yield-finds-trina-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 8, 2021","210mm wafer achieves highest energy yield, finds Trina Solar","From pv magazine International
The introduction of larger wafer/cell formats has been one of the biggest recent trends in module technology. With two different sizes – the 210mm ‘G12’ introduced by Zhonghuan Semiconductor, and the smaller 182mm ‘M10’ format produced by Longi – now well established in manufacturing, the industry is looking for ways to differentiate between the two.
Results from various field tests published throughout this year have been able to demonstrate an advantage for either format. New findings published this week by Chinese manufacturer Trina Solar reveal that the 210mm format, used in the company’s Vertex module series, achieved an energy yield as much as 1.6% higher than products based on the 182mm product, over a six month period.
The modules were tested at a site in Yinchuan, China, which has a dry, temperate climate,  and a second site in Changzhou, China, where conditions are subtropical with hot, rainy summers and high humidity. At the Yinchuan site, data from April to September 2021 showed a 1.2% energy yield advantage for the Vertex modules, based on monofacial modules installed on fixed-tilt racking at a height of 1 meter. For bifacial modules, the advantage increased slightly to 1.3%. And at the Changzhou site, the Vertex modules reached a yield 1.6% higher than the 182mm products.
Trina Solar’s analysis of the results found that better performance in low-irradiance conditions (200 watts per square meter) was key to the Vertex module’s advantage.
Higher currents in the larger format products are one of the key differences between the two products, and earlier results presented by JA Solar (which is backing the 182mm format) found that this resulted in a higher operating temperature, and therefore lower energy yield, for the 210mm products. This was not the case in Trina’s field testing, however, with no measurable temperature difference between the two at either site.
Closer analysis of the two test system layouts and components would be needed to understand the reasons for the different operating temperatures (the JA Solar test site is also located in Yinchuan, with similar conditions). For the time being, modules based on both wafer formats will be available on the market. Further field testing, as well as standardization and the development of other system components to suit the characteristics of either format and optimize costs, will show whether either has a real advantage overall or in particular applications.
