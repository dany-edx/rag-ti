The study, supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies, also found that Indian developers have raised more than INR 78,200 crore (US$ 11 billion) since 2014 through green bonds issued in international markets. A total of eight developers have raised green bonds in international markets, with Greenko and ReNew Power accounting for nearly 70% of all issuances by value.
The findings highlight the potential of green bond markets to support India’s ambitious push to achieve energy independence by 2047, a target recently announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Proceeds from the INR 78,200 crore of capital raised have directly refinanced debt for over 10 GW of Indian RE projects. Wind and solar power account for 42% each of this refinanced portfolio and represent a combined 8.4 GW. Hydropower makes up the balance. This implies that 8.4% of India’s non-hydro RE capacity (solar and wind), totalling 100 GW, has been debt-financed with overseas capital, according to the study.
Gagan Sidhu, Director, CEEW-CEF, and co-author of the study, said, “India’s non-hydro RE portfolio recently crossed the 100 GW mark, but we need to significantly ramp up capital mobilization to get to 450 GW by 2030. Additional routes of capital such as green bonds will be essential for this transition, which requires investments of more than INR 15 lakh crore in power generation capacity alone. For perspective, the outstanding exposure of Indian institutional lenders to the entire power sector stood at approximately INR 13 lakh crore as of March 2020.”
The CEEW-CEF study highlighted that green bonds issued by Indian developers had generated high market interest, with average oversubscription at 360%. Asian investors have shown the greatest appetite by picking up nearly 50% of the bonds. However, the market remains nascent. Only eight Indian developers have accessed international bond markets as of June 2021. 
Shreyas Garg, Consultant, CEEW-CEF, and lead author of the study, said, “So far, international green bonds have been primarily raised by India’s established utility-scale developers. Going forward, we hope to see more developers leveraging their strong financial credentials to unlock much-needed capital through this route. Smaller players without gigawatt-scale capacities should also seriously evaluate green bonds. Further, it is interesting to note that projects with state utilities make up over 60% of bond portfolios, with developers mitigating payment delay risks by diversifying their portfolios. Other firms planning bond raises should similarly structure projects into portfolios that can diversify risk and attract investor interest.”
The CEEW-CEF study recommends increased participation by developers of all sizes in international bond markets. Also, industrial units looking to set up RE plants for captive consumption can leverage their strong credit profiles to obtain favorable pricing. RE manufacturers can also leverage their inherently ‘green’ businesses to raise green bonds and diversify capital.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/19/the-potential-for-grid-scale-energy-storage-in-india/,"FINANCE,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 19, 2021",The potential for grid-scale energy storage in India ,"A new report by US National Renewable Energy Laboratory states energy storage would play a significantly growing role in India’s power system. The nation could deploy energy storage capacity in the range of 50 to 120 GW (160 – 800 GWh) by 2030. The installation would increase to the range of 180 to 800 GW (750 – 4,800 GWh) by 2050, representing between 10% and 25% of total installed power capacity by 2050. 
The researchers modeled the growth of grid-scale energy storage deployment in India under different technology costs, policy, and regulatory scenarios, resulting in a range of storage growth trajectories over the next three decades. The reference-case scenario represents middle-of-the-road projections with standard assumptions through 2050. Additional scenarios were explored by making a change to the reference-case assumptions of value streams for energy storage, costs of solar and storage, and fossil fuel investments. 
In the reference case, power capacity additions were assumed as per the national plan, such as 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030, and future projections for electricity demand growth. Further, it was assumed energy storage devices receive revenue for the full value of grid services they provide. 
Under reference-case assumptions, energy storage deployment would grow quickly with an average annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2030. The installation would reach 635 GW by 2050, constituting around 23% of the nation’s installed power capacity (2,700 GW) by 2050. The total energy capacity of energy storage would be 3,220 GWh by 2050, with an average storage duration of 5 hours across all devices. 
The researchers don’t see additional investment in pumped-hydro electricity storage beyond what is currently under construction or planned. 
Battery storage investments would become cost-effective in 26 of the 34 states and union territories by 2030. Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat, and Karnataka together would have a potential for over 10 GW of battery storage capacity by 2030. 
By 2050, the researchers see a large concentration of battery storage in Northern and Western Region states, particularly in Rajasthan and Gujarat. These states have the highest total battery storage deployment, with 1,060 GWh and 680 GWh of battery energy capacity, respectively. 
As for energy storage types, four-hour battery storage would be the only cost-effective storage technology from the mid-2020s through the late 2030s. All 2-hour storage devices will get retired by 2039, having reached the end of their technical and financial life. There are no additional investments in 2-hour batteries after they are fully retired. 
Beginning in 2039, 6-hour batteries would become cost-effective in certain locations. And beyond 2040, these will grow the fastest among all storage technologies. 
Eight-hour batteries start to become cost-effective in the mid-2040s. 
In the Reference Case, the researchers assumed that energy storage projects received full compensation for the multiple services they provide to the grid. The same battery storage facility, for example, can help reduce operational costs by performing energy time-shifting, provide reliable capacity for long-term capacity adequacy, and also provide essential grid services (i.e., ancillary services) to help maintain grid reliability. 
The researchers found energy time-shifting and capacity services as the largest source of value for energy storage, both in the near and long term. The value of energy storage to provide operating reserves, on the other hand, was relatively small and declined over time.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/19/solar-modules-are-being-detained-by-us-customs-agents-reports-suggest/,"LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 19, 2021","Solar modules are being detained by US customs agents, reports suggest","From pv magazine USA
Solar module shipments to the U.S. appear to have been detained by Customs and Border Protection agents as part of an enforcement action aimed at banning the import of solar equipment containing components provided by a Chinese company suspected of using forced labor.
Roth Capital Partners said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents. The analyst said that Jinko may not ship hundreds of megawatts of capacity to the U.S. as long as the customs inquiry is in process.
Canadian Solar also was said to have had four testing samples detained, and Trina Solar may have had six testing samples detained in July.
Action taken on June 24 by the Biden administration included a “Withhold Release Order” by the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) against Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., a company located in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Withhold Release Order instructs personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.
(Read “Border action ordered for solar components made by Chinese manufacturer.”)
The CBP acted in response to what officials said were credible reports of forced labor being in the solar supply chain in the Xinjiang region of China. The report that modules actually were being detained was among the first indication that enforcement action may be under way.
A spokesperson for JinkoSolar said the company would not comment on the report. Requests by pv magazine USA for comment from Canadian Solar and Trina Solar were not immediately returned.
Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners said that “almost any module coming to the U.S. cannot yet prove it does not have Hoshine silicon metal.” He said that traceability protocols do not yet go far enough up the supply chain. In addition, it may take 6-12 months to develop the traceability capability up through silicon metal or quartz. Shen said that solar cells may be manufactured in Southeast Asia, Europe or the U.S., “but the challenge is that 95-99% of the world’s wafers come from China.”
In a related move, a group called the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed petitions requesting that the Department of Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The group said in a trio of petitions totaling more than 600 pages that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
Timothy Brightbill, a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm Wiley Rein, declined to identify the companies that joined in filing the petitions. In an email, he said that “Given the Chinese control of the entire solar supply chain, retaliation is likely if their identities are revealed.” He said that in such situations, the companies who make up the coalition “are allowed under U.S. law to remain confidential.”
The organization said that while Chinese companies “now almost exclusively” export to the United States from Southeast Asia, “the vast majority” of manufacturing, research and development, and capital investment remain in China. The group called for duties on Chinese solar products to be extended to what it said were “circumventing entities.”
The group asked the Commerce Department to investigate the following companies:
Malaysia: Jinko Solar Technology Sdn. Bhd.; LONGi (Kuching) Sdn. Bhd. and its affiliate Vina Cell Technology Company Limited and Vina Solar Technology Company Limited; JA Solar (Malaysia) Co., Ltd. or JA Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.
Thailand: Canadian Solar Manufacturing (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Trina Solar Science & Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Talesun Solar Technologies Thailand or Talesun Technologies (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Astroenergy Solar Thailand Co., Ltd
Vietnam: Trina Solar (Vietnam) Science & Technology Co., Ltd.; Canadian Solar Manufacturing (Vietnam) Co., Ltd.; China Sunergy Co., Ltd. in Vietnam; Boviet Solar Technology (Vietnam) Co., Ltd. or Boviet Solar Technology Co., Ltd.; GCL System Integration Technology (Vietnam) Co. Ltd.; Vina Cell Technology Company Limited and Vina Solar Technology Company Limited; LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd.; JinkoSolar (Vietnam) Co., Ltd.
