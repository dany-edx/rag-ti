IndRa stated solar projects continue to have stable operations, adequate debt service coverage, and comfortable internal liquidity. The significant fall in module prices over the past six months is positive for under-construction projects. However, timely project completion is critical in view of the slowdown in capacity addition observed in 1H FY24 compared to the previous year.
According to Ind-Ra, India installed 5 GW of solar capacity and 1.6 GW of wind in 1H FY24, compared to 6.8 GW of solar and 1.3 GW of wind added in 1H FY23. The capacity addition for the entire FY23 stood at 12.8 GW solar and 2.3 GW wind.
Wind projects continue to be marred by generation variability.
Ind-Ra expects wind power generation in FY24 to be similar to FY23, while remaining lower than the P90 level, considering the portfolio average. Elimination of reverse auction is likely to allow developers to bid with a better risk-return profile and improve the capacity addition in the medium term.

This paradigm shift to prioritize women’s involvement in designing and using the solutions can lead us to a more inclusive approach for a better society.
All cleantech companies should ensure continuous engagement and support that will further help to maximize the utilization of clean energy technology. The changing macroeconomic trends, with focused contemporary policies and women-centric solutions, will help to drive positive change and acceptance within society.
Many solar energy companies and cleantech startups across India have ventured into this space, bringing new innovations to rural households. These startups are developing solutions for social issues ranging from drinking water crisis, agricultural issues, or other problems triggered by climate change. The startup ecosystem in India is receiving support from the central as well as state governments and their initiatives, but we need more support to reduce the dependence of India’s clean energy sector on imports from other countries.
Various new schemes of the government for distributed applications of renewable energy in rural India will further validate the value of clean technology solutions and lead to wider adoption, ultimately benefiting the rural communities and value chains. There are various challenges in scaling up these applications such as novelty and a high starting price of these technologies. These clean-tech products are perceived as high-risk purchases, especially by women users.
The relatively lower risk appetite of rural women is due to socioeconomic reasons and limited avenues to avail financing. There is a lack of established market linkages and limited mobility/networks of women outside their villages.
In India, all the hype around renewable energy and the changes it can bring to society, is mostly limited to either mega solar or wind projects or the lowering of per unit tariff achieved in auctions. Behind all these large projects, there are many people from rural India who are silently working on clean energy-based solutions that also help to bring change in the lives of the people. There are many enterprises working in this field that are focused on solar energy for urban areas with a broader goal of reducing the country’s dependency on the import of solar products from other countries. We are still dependent on other countries such as China for several parts of the renewable energy sector and its technologies. In India, we need to promote more Made in India products and increase manufacturing hubs.
To move ahead with these clean technologies in rural areas, we need to focus more on leveraging the experience of early women adopters. We should organise hyperlocal events and demos – create spaces for women to network and become aware. We should enable easy finance to purchase products. The funding companies should consider easing the loan application process. We should ensure adequate after-sales services and buy-backs. Backward and forward market linkage should be promoted. This includes finding and connecting producers to consumption hubs in urban areas.
There is also a need to develop business models that enable the people of rural India, especially women, to sell to an intermediary to regularise revenue stream. State rural livelihood missions, agriculture departments, etc., must be converged to leverage the reach of government institutions.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/09/solyco-switches-on-vertical-pv-systems-on-green-rooftops-in-germany/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,"NOVEMBER 9, 2023",Solyco switches on vertical PV systems on green rooftops in Germany,"From pv magazine Germany
Solyco has deployed its first vertical rooftop PV system at two different locations in Germany.
The Germany-based company described its Solon system as an ideal solution for the residential and commercial flat rooftop market, especially for so-called green roofs, which are rooftops covered with low-maintenance gardens and plants.
One of the two systems is located in Hamburg. The 10 kW project features 68 vertically mounted modules. The second array, in Hannover, includes 79 panels, with a total installed capacity of 12.64 kW.
Both installations have glass-glass bifacial modules made with tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells, installed in a vertical fashion to minimize shadows on the vegetation below. A ballast-supported racking system provides support and avoids drilling into the roof.
The vertical orientation delivers peak power early and late in the day with a valley formed at noon with an east-west orientation, according to the company.
The Solon system relies on frameless custom-designed modules that are smaller than the standard size, measuring 2,011 mm x 415 mm, with a rated power of 160 W. The weight is around 23 kg/m². The panels have 3.2 mm glass sheets front and back with forty-two M10-sized TOPCon cells. The system’s installed nominal capacity is 100W/m², according to the company.
The substructures of the horizontal and vertical aluminum profiles are connected by cross-bracing. Stable connections are secured with a profile connector and bolted with M6 cap screws and safety nuts. The black coating finish on the metal racking and hardware provides the aesthetics reportedly required for this type of application.
Philip Kallenberg, product manager for Solyco, told pv magazine that the main reason it chose TOPCon cells over passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells is because they can reach about “85% bifacial coefficients,” which results in “more balanced energy production” throughout the day.
“A vertical PV system in combination with a green roof is the ideal roofing strategy for any flat roof. It combines the ecological advantages of green roofs with the local production of renewable energy,” Solyco CTO Lars Podlowski told pv magazine.
The company’s wind tunnel test have confirmed that the system does not experience drag or lift forces. According to Kallenberg, wind loads primarily impact the first and last rows of modules, resulting in fewer required ballast blocks compared to traditional horizontal installations.
“Only the first and last row need ballast bases to prevent displacement,” Kallenberg stated.
Recently installed pilot systems in Hannover and Hamburg follow tests of an earlier version of the system at an outdoor location near the company’s headquarters in Berlin. Solyco developed the technology in cooperation with ISC Konstanz, University of Applied Sciences HTW Berlin, and funded by the country’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) through its program for SMEs (ZIM).
Solyco sells the systems through distributors and partners, such as Germany-based Optigrün International. Certifications include IEC 61215: 2016, IEC 61730: 2016, and a 25-year product warranty and linear performance guarantee.

According to the press release, the companies won the contract after submitting “the most cost-competitive bid” of $16.84/MWh as part of the fourth round of the Middle Eastern country’s National Renewable Energy Program auction. The plant is expected to reach financial close in early 2024 and will be connected to the grid in 2025, the announcement stated.
SPPC, a government-run department tasked with granting energy project tenders, said in its own press release that the project’s levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is SAR 6.31575 ($1.68420)/kWh.
Masdar is a renewable energy company based in Saudi Arabia. EDF Renewables develops renewable energy projects and is a subsidiary of France-based utility EDF Group. Nesma Home Company is a venture capital company based in Saudi Arabia.
The two announcements did not specify what solar technology would be used and on what date the agreement was signed.
In 2020, Saudi Arabia derived 51% of its energy supply from gas and 49% from oil, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The country has increased its installed solar capacity since that year – only 59 MW – to 389 MW in 2021 and 390 MW in 2022, according to other IRENA stats.
Saudi Arabia plans to generate 50% of its energy from renewables by 2030.

The company’s consolidated net profit (PAT) in the quarter ending Sept. 2023 (Q2 FY24) grew 9% YoY to INR 1,017 crore (YoY). Revenue too rose 9% YoY to INR 15,442 crore.
During the quarter, a significant 84 % contribution in PAT came from the core businesses, while the contribution from overseas joint ventures, including coal mining operations, continues to decline.
Clean energy generation portfolio (across solar, wind, hydro, and waste heat recovery) achieved the milestone of 5,500 MW during Q2 FY 2024, standing at around 38% of the total installed generation capacity (14,384 MW).
TPREL has installed a cumulative renewables capacity of 4,127 MW (3,137 MW solar and 990 MW wind) and has 3,656 MW under various stages of implementation. The company’s rooftop solar business reported 87% growth in residential business in Q1 FY24 to 18 MW. Utility-scale order book stands at 4.2 GW worth INR 17,643 crore. Rooftop solar and group captive order book stands at INR 2,504 crore.
Praveer Sinha, CEO and managing director, said Tata Power’s adherence to financial discipline, operational excellence along with business resilience and diversification has helped it maintain a consistent profit growth.
Tata Power’s 4.3 GW greenfield solar cell and module manufacturing plant in Tamil Nadu produced its first module on Oct. 28. The module plant is expected to stabilize in the next two to three months. The cell plant is on track to roll out the first cell in Q4 FY 2024.
“The cell plant will start getting operational from January onwards and it should get stabilized by March or April. So, by April you will start seeing a good quantum of cells and modules being produced from the plant and that will give us much better visibility in the cost of the modules and we definitely expect better margins in all our EPC contracts,” shared Sinha.
The 4.3 GW solar cell and module facility will produce 4 GW of mono PERC and 300 MW of TOPCon modules. “The purpose is that whenever in future there is a huge demand for TOPCon we have the right experience. The plant has been designed such that if we have to partially or fully move to TOPCon, we can do it at a much faster pace than others who will have to possibly do it de novo in a new location. At this stage, out of the 4.3 GW capacity, about 3 GW will be used for ourselves and the balance will be supplied to others both within the country and outside,” said Sinha. 
Sinha said as of now they have no plans for manufacturing overseas.
Tata Power is also focusing on supplying round-the-clock renewable energy with hybrid solar and wind plants along with pumped storage plants
The company has signed an agreement with the Maharashtra government to set up 2.8 GW of pumped hydro project in Maharashtra. The project will come up at its existing hydro plants in the state. “We expect to start the work [on this project] sometime mid of next year after all the necessary approvals are obtained by us,” said Sinha.
