Our “solar 101” series is designed to guide prospective residential and commercial solar customers in their quest for the right solar system.
We’ll break down the decision-making process into bite-sized pieces so you can navigate the process and feel good about your choices.
We’ll focus on the most common type of residential or commercial installation: a system attached to a roof.
And to get started, we will look at how to evaluate the age and condition of your structure’s roof. Is it old? Is it new? Wait… didn’t we just replace the roof not too long ago?
If your roof is less than five years old (or better yet, if it is brand new) then this is a perfect time to install solar. Solar installed on a newer roof is low maintenance, and will age gracefully over the years!
But what if your roof is old or leaking, and will soon need to be replaced? That’s also an ideal opportunity, because it allows your roofers to coordinate with your solar developer to install the best system overall.
But what if your roof is somewhere in between?
Customers often have a problem adding solar panels to roofs that are middle-aged. A typical roof has a 25-year life expectancy, so roofs in the range of 8 to 20 years present a dilemma of wasting many costly “roof years.”
For instance, a 250,000-square-foot white thermoplastic (TPO) roof on a commercial structure might cost $5/sq. ft.—on the order of $1.25 million–to replace. That amounts to roughly $50,000 per roof year. So, if you “give up” five years, that’s $250,000.
And while a homeowner’s dollar amounts are much lower, the dilemma is just as real.
When unsure of what to do because your roof is in that pesky middle-aged range, use this approach to quickly determine the dollar value of the roof’s age:
Expected Roof Lifetime – Age of the Roof = Leftover Roof Life
Divide Leftover Roof Life by Expected Roof Lifetime. (This gives the percentage of the roof’s remaining value)
Multiply that percentage by the cost of the new roof
The dollar amount that results offers a way of figuring out what you may be willing to pay for clean electricity from solar. If that number hurts as the check is written, maybe wait a few years. But not always! Especially not if you’re someone who cares about the environment. In fact, you might purposely decide to spend a little extra for the opportunity to reduce your environmental impact.
And, sometimes, depending on solar incentives and bank financing rates, it actually makes economic sense to replace a roof early. So use the formula as a guide, but weigh it against your other goals and factors.
As a start, get quotes from both roofing and solar contractors. When you compare the total cost of both investments to the long-term electricity savings you stand to realize from the solar system, you can get a good idea of your projected electricity savings.
Obviously, the combined payback period for a new roof and a new solar system is much longer than a solar system’s payback on its own. However, a solar power system pays for itself in a way that asphalt shingles and TPO simply can’t.
Seen from a different angle, buying a roof with a solar system is almost the same as getting a free roof!
Subsequent articles will dive into important questions such as how to find and vet contractors, how to size the system, and what expenses to expect related to hardware, fees, and labor. We also will show how rebates and tax incentives provide a boost to ROI, and how banks now see solar projects as ideal for lending.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/26/green-taxonomy-first-step-towards-building-a-resilient-society/,"CLIMATE CHANGE,COVID-19,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,INDIA",,"APRIL 26, 2021",Green taxonomy first step towards building a resilient society,"Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, the momentum towards green and climate-aligned investment has picked up pace across the world. The focus on sustainability has moved beyond governments, international agencies, and impact investors, with triple-bottomline becoming a commercial imperative amongst the board rooms of top investment firms and Fortune 500 companies. 
In recent times, a heavy green premium is enjoyed by green stocks even in retail stock markets. Tesla, which is valued at several times more than its established ICE competitors, is an excellent example. 
The current Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for a proactive and resilient growth model. There is a need to redirect capital flows towards sustainable projects to make our economies, businesses, and societies more resilient against climate and environmental shocks and risks, which, not unlike Covid, pose an existential threat. 
Increasingly, a class of green capital flowing predominantly into renewable energy projects has emerged. However, sustainability and climate-aligned investments must expand to include energy efficiency, green manufacturing, air pollution, potable water supply, land and sea conservation, etc. It is crucial to optimally allocate available resources towards projects that would deliver maximum climate impact while offering market returns. 
Lack of nomenclature that is commonly agreed and benchmarked is one of the biggest challenges facing a world that is keen to channel finance towards impactful green investments. The issue of greenwashing—packaging dirty projects as green projects—has affected the confidence of investors with a genuine interest in sustainability. A common language and a clear definition of what is ‘green’ is critical. The challenge of a common green taxonomy is a lot more complicated and technical than many realize. 
The EU recognized this challenge and got to work. To meet the European Union (EU)’s climate and energy targets for 2030 and reach the objectives of the European Green Deal, the EU’s action plan on financing sustainable growth called for the creation of a common classification system for sustainable economic activities, or an “EU taxonomy”.
Inspired by the EU’s initiative to produce a green taxonomy, many emerging markets are seeking to develop clear definitions of activities or investments that embody their own national environmental objectives, such as addressing climate change or reducing deforestation. The countries such as the EU, Bangladesh, China, and Mongolia have already adopted a green taxonomy. India, too is working on initiatives towards building a green taxonomy. 
Speaking at the World Sustainable Development Summit, the prime minister remarked, “Two things will define how the journey of humanity will unfold in the times to come. First is the health of our people. The second is the health of our planet. Both are interlinked. The need of the hour is to think out of the box, invest in our youngsters and work towards sustainable development.”
True to his words, the Indian government is pursuing an agenda of “development without destruction”, aiming to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by up to 35 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. 
Climate Transparency report 2020 highlighted that India is the only country among G20 nations that is on track to achieve its targets under the Paris Agreement. This is because India is well on its way to exceeding its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets under the Paris Agreement reflecting the government’s commitment. 
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has estimated that India has a climate-smart investment potential of $3.1 trillion from 2018 to 2030. However, Climate Policy Initiative highlighted, green finance investments for FY2017 and FY 2018 in India were only 10% of the total required investment of US$ 170 billion per year. 
The gap between desired and actual green investment needs to be scaled down by unlocking green investment at a revolutionary scale. In addition, non-coherent publishing of data due to the lack of a green finance taxonomy in the country creates barriers for green finance flows into India.
Not all green investments have the same climate mitigation impact. Also, not all green technologies have the same level of risks. A smart green taxonomy, which is designed to incentivize investments proportional to the positive impact and the risks associated, will lead to diversified portfolio green investments.    
A government-supported green investment nomenclature (taxonomy) framework that is commonly agreed and aligns with global taxonomies will provide clarity to investors and businesses alike. It will solve the existing information asymmetry in the market, and green investors would be exposed to a greater choice of projects and can leverage new avenues of green growth. 
In a global competition for green capital, the taxonomy will be a plus for Indian projects, attracting global green capital into domestic projects and creating a domestic green investor class. 
Enterprises seeking green financing will take advantage of new funding sources through global capital markets and the financial sector worldwide who (with the taxonomy in place) will have greater confidence in the Indian market. 
Under the prime minister’s leadership, India is primed to be one of the green growth leaders of the world. This requires a seamless flow of green capital into both established and cutting-edge green technologies. 
A sophisticated green taxonomy will be key to unlock the latent green growth potential of India. It will help us achieve “swacch, sundar avam svastha bharat” (clean, beautiful, and healthy India) by leveraging global capital to catalyze the Indian juggernaut towards sustainable development.

The coal producer signed the PPA with state utility Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) to sell the power generated by the 100 MW solar plant for INR2.20/kWh for 25 years.
In its maiden venture into solar power generation, Coal India secured the 100 MW project in a 500 MW reverse auction conducted by GUVNL which also saw NTPC, Sprng Energy, and Tata Power’s TP Saurya allocated generation capacity at the same price.
With a capital investment of INR442 crore, Coal India will execute the 100 MW project through a solar engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor. In a back-to-back arrangement, the coal company had already issued the tender to finalize the EPC company. The project will be executed within a year from the date of placement of the work order, Coal India said in a statement.
The fossil fuel business is following counterpart NLC by entering the solar market.
Coal India Ltd (CIL) this month announced two new business units: CIL Solar PV and CIL Navikarniya Urja, with both intended to capitalize on the growth opportunities in solar. CIL Solar PV Limited will manufacture ingots, wafers, cells and modules.

Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE claims to have achieved a 35.9% conversion efficiency rate for a III-V monolithic triple-junction solar cell based on silicon.
“This value measured under the terrestrial AM1.5g spectrum sets a new world record and demonstrates the potential of silicon-based tandem photovoltaics,” the research institute stated.
The cell, which looks externally like a device with a two-terminal architecture, was built with III-V semiconductor layers that were connected to the silicon sub-cell on the atomic level. The key for achieving the record power conversion efficiency was the use of a semiconductor material based on gallium-indium-arsenide-phosphide (GaInAsP) for the middle cell.
“The new material allowed us to further improve the lifetime of the charge carriers and thus achieve a higher cell voltage,” said researcher Patrick Schygulla. “It’s great to see how our material development has successfully contributed to improvements in III-V//Si triple-junction solar cells.”
The scientists claim the cell may be used in electrically powered aircraft and drones.
In August, the Fraunhofer ISE achieved a 25.9% conversion efficiency rate for a III-V tandem solar cell grown directly on silicon. This cell is a modified version of a 34.5%-efficient III-V solar cell that is manufactured through a process known as direct wafer bonding, where the III-V layers are first deposited on an aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate and then pressed together.
The cost of producing solar cells based on compounds of III-V element materials – named according to the groups of the periodic table that they belong to – has confined such devices to niche applications, including drones and satellites, where low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than costs in relation to the energy produced.
Researchers at the Tampere University in Finland have recently developed a III-V multi-junction solar cell which is claimed to have the potential for reaching a power conversion efficiency of close to 50%. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States announced last year a 32.9% efficiency for a tandem cell device utilizing III-V materials.
