(IHI), a Japanese engineering company, and Gentari Hydrogen Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petronas’ clean energy arm Gentari Sdn Bhd (Gentari), have announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly explore the establishment of a global green ammonia value chain that spans the production, transportation, storage and utilization of green ammonia in Asia Pacific and other areas of mutual interest.
Additionally, the two companies will explore the commercial utilization of IM270, a fully ammonia-powered gas turbine, developed by IHI with support from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).
“Anticipating commencement by 2026, this commercial demonstration could potentially be the world’s first fully ammonia-powered gas turbine to be deployed,” stated a media release.

The company plans a diverse portfolio of solar and wind power projects strategically positioned across Gujarat and Rajasthan. The lineup includes a 600 MW solar power project and a 150 MW wind power project in Gujarat and a 250 MW solar power project in Rajasthan. This will be achieved by FY 2026 (200 MW by March 2024) in addition to the existing 84 MW of solar and wind power.
“The investment not only demonstrates our commitment to environmental sustainability but also promises compelling economic advantages to Ambuja’s planned larger capacity of 140 mtpa (metric tonnes per annum),” stated Ambuja Cements. “With a lower cost of generation from green power, the power cost will come down from INR 6.46/kWh to INR 5.16/kWh. A reduction of INR 1.30/kWh (20%), which translates into INR 90 pmt of cement for a targeted capacity of 140 mtpa by FY 2028, accelerating the company’s ESG targets. Additionally, green power will assist in enabling an increased supply of green cement, making it possible for the user industry (infrastructure and housing) to go green.”
Ambuja Cements is also enhancing its waste heat recovery systems (WHRS) capacity from the current 103 MW to 397 MW over five years, which will further reduce the power cost.
With these initiatives, Ambuja expects 60% of its planned 140 mtpa capacity to be powered with green power.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/18/enphase-unveils-new-three-phase-inverters/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",Enphase unveils new three-phase inverters,"From pv magazine USA
Microinverter manufacturer Enphase has officially launched a new 208 V three-phase offering.
The company said that it is also offering a focused support team and design tools for small business solar projects.
It added that system.sized blocks of 200 kW will most efficiently maximize the hardware on a cost-per-watt basis.
Previously, 240V single-phase residential Enphase inverters could be configured into 208V three-phase commercial systems.. However, this required meticulous system design and additional “Q Cables.” The new 208V system offers more flexibility in string design and simplifies installation with a new four-wire 208V Q Cable.
Eric Bergman, Commercial and Industrial Sales Director at Enphase, touted the advantages of the new system to pv magazine USA. Bergman said that installers used to have to “physically land the output of the micros evenly across the three phases of the site.”
Installations also used to require a network protection relay, necessitating an external enclosure. The new IQ8 C&I microinverter comes with the four-wire QD Cable, which integrates phase balancing, V/F ride-through, and loss of phase detection – functions previously managed externally by the Network Protection Relay.
Enphase saie that all hardware and associated equipment will be classified as domestic content, potentially qualifying for the 10% US Inflation Reduction Act tax credit adder. However, the definitive guidance from the Internal Revenue Service is still pending.
US production of the commercial inverter is set to begin in the first quarter of 2024. Enphase is initially focusing on the core functionalities of the 208V equipment, with plans to introduce additional features like grid-tied load support, energy storage integration, and 480V three-phase support in the future.
Bergman noted that a large, skilled workforce is already trained to sell and install these systems.
“Right now, the nation is seeing a bit of a slowdown in residential solar sales. At the same time, commercial solar contractors are having a challenging time finding installation crews,” Bergman said. “The 208 V gear gives both groups multiple opportunities. Residential installers who’ve been installing Enphase their whole careers can be tapped by commercial groups to help them deploy these systems, or sell to small businesses on their own.”

The PLI Scheme is being implemented in two tranches. Tranche-I has an outlay of INR 4,500 crore, under which Letters of Award have been issued for setting up of 8,737 MW of fully integrated solar PV module manufacturing units. For Tranche-II with an outlay of INR 19,500 crore, Letters of Award have been issued for setting up 39,600 MW of fully/ partially integrated solar PV module manufacturing units.
The minister exhorted the industry to be reasonable in the pricing of solar modules and to not take undue advantage of basic customs duty by spiking domestic panel prices. He also spoke of the need to ensure competitive prices for domestic developers.
The minister said the government is committed to ensuring sustainability and a win-win situation for all. “The government is in continuous consultation with all stakeholders, taking inputs and listening to advice from everyone and then striving to ensure justice to everyone,” he added.
On the occasion, the minister launched a report on PV Supply Chain Resilience & Sustainability–India-EU Cooperation Study.
Khuba said, solar manufacturing is an emerging sector, especially in India, and that India has been both setting new targets at COP and attaining them, keeping in mind the needs of its growing population and the goal of attaining net zero by the year 2070.
The minister assured investors of a stable government and policy certainty in the years to come and exhorted them to tap into the opportunities available.

German inverter maker SMA Solar Technology AG plans to build an inverter factory at an unspecified location in the United States.
The factory will likely be operational in 2025 and will have an annual capacity of 3.5 GW.
Discussions are currently underway “with several federal states and potential partners to find the most strategically advantageous production location and the right approach,” the company said, noting that up to 200 new jobs will be created in the first three years
“The US is a key market for SMA, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers an extraordinary opportunity for long-term growth,” said CEO Jürgen Reinert. “With this step, we will significantly strengthen our market share in the USA and set the course for SMA’s future growth.”
SMA is also pushing ahead with capacity expansion in Germany, where it plans to reach 40 GW. It said it wants to produce solutions for large PV projects and storage systems from 2025 at its Niestetal site, for use in global markets.

Currently, Akcome’s Suzhou, Ganzhou, Huzhou, and Zhoushan production bases have a total capacity of 3.2 GW of HJT cells, 0.8 GW of passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) capacity, and 10.4 GW of solar panels. Despite on-hand orders for 2.95 GW of HJT modules, the company’s current HJT cell production capacity falls short of meeting demand for new orders.
Daqo New Energy has announced plans to add new production capacity, including silicon metal, in Shihezi, in China’s Xinjiang region. It plans to invest a total of CNY 15 billion. The development is two-phased and is expected to add 300,000 metric tons (MT) of silicon metal capacity, 100 MT of polysilicon, and 2.2 million seed rods when complete. The company said that implementation hinges on market conditions, shareholder approval, government filings and approvals, and energy consumption approvals.
CECC has launched its 2024 solar inverter tender, totaling 42 GW across four sections. It is seeking 10 GW of inverters above 3.125 MW in size, 27 GW for string inverters above 300 KW, and 5 GW for string inverters in the range of 10 kW to 150 kW.
