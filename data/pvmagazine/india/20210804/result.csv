https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/04/local-solar-will-lead-the-energy-transformation-over-the-next-five-years/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",,"AUGUST 4, 2021",Local solar will lead the energy transformation over the next five years ,"Currently, India ranks third globally when it comes to energy consumption. While the per capita energy use is less than half the global average, this is set to change over the years as electrification continues to grow and growing economic prosperity drives Indian households to buy more power-hungry electrical appliances and vehicles. We have the technology today to power a significant portion of this electrified future with clean, affordable, and reliable energy from rooftop solar.  
While a large chunk of India’s energy demand is currently being met by fossil fuels such as coal, this is not a sustainable option for the future. India’s energy policy is guided, to a great extent, by its commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, 2015. Some of the key targets under this include reducing emission intensity by 33‐35% by 2030, as compared to 2005 levels. In addition to this, the plan is to increase the share of non‐fossil fuel-based electricity generation capacity to 40%, to achieve 450 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030, with solar contributing about 280 GW (over 60%).  
The Government has already taken several steps to facilitate this shift, including a stated focus on the use of cleaner fossil fuels, greater use of biofuels, rapid scaling up of renewables, electric mobility, and a shift towards emerging fuels including hydrogen. The government as well as corporates have been rallying behind the increased adoption of renewable energy. They are also pro-actively exploring the feasibility of adopting other new emerging renewable technologies such as storage, hydrogen, and geothermal which are driving energy innovation.
While solar power accounts for about 4% of India’s electricity consumption today, it is set to see exponential growth in the coming years. As per an assessment by the National Institute of Solar Energy, India has a solar potential of about 748 GW, assuming 3% of the wasteland area to be covered by solar PV modules. 
We’ve seen an increase and transition in the use of solar energy in households, from solar water heaters to houses mostly dependent on solar energy. The following factors will influence the proliferation of solar in India over the next five years.
India’s domestic manufacturing capacity in solar is not sufficient to fulfill the demand for the installation of 25 GW solar power capacity every year. In 2019-20, the import of solar wafers, cells, modules, and inverters amounted to $2.5 billion, as per data from the Indian Government. As solar adoption goes up, this number is likely to go up significantly. 
Therefore, there needs to be a long-term policy in place to ramp up domestic manufacturing and reduce dependence on exports. Doing so will also create good-quality jobs all across the country, which, will, in turn, boost the overall economy.
The adoption of local, community-based energy solutions like rooftop solar and batteries can help make the energy grid more flexible and reliable. Home solar and batteries will enable the growth of ‘prosumers’ who produce and share energy, as well as consume it. Generating and using energy at the point it’s being used is also more efficient and reduces the need for big, centralized power often fueled by polluting fossil fuels. I’m encouraged to see the Indian Government taking steps to boost decentralized renewables and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading initiatives. 
Local solar and battery solutions will also prove to be beneficial from the perspective of rural electrification. Since it is abundantly available, solar provides greater energy security in a rural scenario. 
In addition, the Government of India’s plan to develop a ‘green city’ in every state of the country, powered by renewable energy will help take environment-friendly power to the mainstream. This will be achieved through initiatives such as solar rooftop systems on all houses, solar parks on the city’s outskirts, waste-to-energy plants, and electric mobility-enabled public transport systems.
In rural areas, efforts such as canal-top solar power plants, where irrigation canals are covered with solar panels, can offer an interesting alternative to rooftop solar. 
Solar energy in our communities and on our buildings helps people save money and reduces our overall reliance on polluting fossil fuels. It’s also creating good, local jobs through the installation of the equipment and the manufacturing of the technology. Let’s continue innovating and drive the transformation of our energy system one rooftop at a time.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/04/foreign-investors-tapping-into-indias-solar-market-undeterred-by-untimely-payments/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 4, 2021",Foreign investors tapping into India’s solar market undeterred by untimely payments,"Foreign investors are pairing up with local independent power producers to tap into India’s booming solar market despite problems with timely payments, land acquisition, and grid access, IHS Markit analysts say in a recent analysis of India’s PV market.
The analysts note that sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and Abu Dhabi, along with banks like Goldman Sachs, funds like Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), and utilities such as Japan’s JERA currently hold sizeable stakes in solar projects led by Indian developers. Further, major banks like JP Morgan and Standard Chartered are prepared to underwrite many of the green bonds that Indian power producers are floating to add to their renewables portfolios.
India is eager to attract foreign investment as the country aims for 450 GW of installed renewable capacity. For investors, the nation’s solar market offers a high-growth area. 
“Foreign investors see India’s solar market as a high-growth area, and many are buying substantial stakes in local firms that know the market and operate successfully there,” Conway Irwin, IHS Markit’s climate and cleantech research director who analyzed the solar market data.
“Foreign investors also are flocking to India because they need “a home” for the $88 trillion they have pledged to meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,” the analysis also quoted Tim Buckley, energy finance director for the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
And as the International Energy Agency noted in a July report on global electricity markets, India today represents the third-largest electricity consumer in the world. Demand is set to grow once it resumes economic activity that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to a crawl in the past two years.
IEEFA estimates India will need a $500-billion investment in new renewable installations to reach its 2030 goal of 450 GW, of which roughly half will be in solar, 20% in wind, about 10% in grid-firming technologies such as battery storage, and the rest devoted to upgrading grid distribution and transmission services.
Foreign investors are drawn to India as the nation offers up to 100% ownership in any renewable project in which they have a stake, something that China doesn’t allow. A 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) is another reason. The PPA is secured in some instances by sovereign guarantees via the Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI), which is under the administrative control of the Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
In this way, analysts say, foreign investors may be able to mitigate, but not eliminate entirely, the risk of untimely payments from individual state agencies—the purchasers of much of the renewable capacity. It also appears that some of the more successful renewable project developers in India have portfolios that are spread across various states, thereby allowing them to decrease their risk by avoiding putting all their eggs in one basket.
For the local renewable energy developers, IHS Markit said, “the promise of lower cost of capital associated with backing from stable, foreign financial institutions allows them to bid more competitively into price-sensitive markets in India than competitors that rely primarily on domestic funding sources.”
Investors look for prospects that will provide opportunities on a sensible, risk-adjusted basis, Buckley said. “And what India is offering is a $500-billion prospect of new investment in already government-guaranteed infrastructure assets in the renewables space,” the report quoted IEEFA’s Buckley.
In addition to the scale of capital deployment opportunities and strong, consistent energy policy framework offered, Indian renewable energy projects have historically provided “healthy project-level” equity returns in the range of 14-16% that are much higher than those available in say Germany or Japan, Buckley wrote in a February analysis of the global capital flows underpinning India’s transition to a low-to-zero carbon economy.
IHS Markit analysts agree.
Independent power producers with strong foreign financial backing enjoy substantially lower capital costs because they can access lower-cost financing from overseas investors and avoid domestic borrowing costs that can run as high as 9-10%, said IHS Markit’s Irwin.
“The negatives posed by the lack of timely payments by state agencies, which are the largest purchasers of renewable energy, is more than offset by all the reasons for going into India in the first place,” Buckley said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/04/meyer-burger-plans-to-launch-solar-pv-roof-tiles-in-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"AUGUST 4, 2021",Meyer Burger plans to launch solar PV roof tiles in 2022,"From pv magazine International
The first heterojunction Smartwire solar modules have just come off Meyer Burger’s production line in Germany’s Saxony, and the Swiss company is already planning its next step.
It announced Thursday that it plans to add innovative solar PV roof tiles to its portfolio. The product will be a roof-integrated, high-performance PV system that can be installed like traditional roof tiles.
To accelerate the market launch, Meyer Burger has acquired a highly developed solution from an unnamed German engineering service provider that has already been certified and approved by the German building authorities, in accordance with IEC 61215 and IEC 61730.
The purchase agreement includes all intellectual property rights to the PV roof tile solution, including all associated patents, certifications, and building authority approval, as well as technical knowhow, said Meyer Burger. The parties agreed not to disclose the purchase price.
The roof-integrated solar PV system will expand Meyer Burger’s portfolio in the premium rooftop segment. The manufacturer plans to present its solar roof at Intersolar Europe in Munich at the beginning of October.
Meanwhile, first deliveries of the PV tiles to customers are scheduled for the second half of 2022, according to the company. They will be designed in such a way that they can be easily installed and maintained by a roofer, it added.
“Integrated solar roof systems still represent a market niche today,” said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Meyer Burger. “With our novel solar tile solution, we plan to take roof-integrated solutions out of the niche and into a larger market.”
Moreover, expanding the portfolio in this direction is a “consistent step within our growth strategy,” Erfurt added. With the integrated roof system, it will also be possible, in the future, to develop roof areas that are not suitable for the installation of standard PV modules.
The company added that it also intends to rely on its heterojunction smartwire technology for the tiles.
To date, Meyer Burger’s most prominent competitor in the PV tile market is probably Tesla. The CEO of the Californian electric car manufacturer, Elon Musk, presented his vision of a solar tile for the “solar roof” back in the autumn of 2016.
Since then, he has remained rather quiet again about the solution and it is relatively unclear how many roofs are equipped with Tesla’s PV tiles. There are also several other suppliers on the market, such as Autarq, Sunroof, and Midsummer.
