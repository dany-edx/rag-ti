https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/09/turning-nepals-solar-game-around/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,NEPAL",,"JUNE 9, 2021",Turning Nepal’s solar game around,"From pv magazine International
Nepal is a mountainous landlocked country situated between India and China. It comprises over 6,000 rivers featuring rivulets and tributaries totaling 45,000 km in length.
Rich in renewable water resources, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates the country has the potential to produce 83,000 MW of electricity, of which around 43,000 MW are thought to be economically viable.
Despite its enormous hydroelectric potential and absence of fossil fuel reserves, it was not until recently that Nepal began focusing on hydroelectric power. This development has come with problems, however. In particular, there is a deficiency of electricity generation in the dry season when demand rises, and water flow diminishes.
Though the installed electricity generation capacity of Nepal has grown steadily, peak demand has also increased at a higher rate and as per the data for 2016, energy imports from India doubled for an average annual growth rate of 20.4%, compared with a 0.3% annual increase in Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) generation.
Owing to this situation, in 2016, Kulman Ghising, Managing Director of the NEA, took steps to increase domestic generation, reduce system losses and increase cross border transmission capacity for electricity imports from India, and gradually decrease the load shedding hours.
Hence, load shedding (Nepal faced 16 hours of load shedding between 2008-2016) has been officially eliminated since May 13, 2018 . This was possible due to imports totaling around 145 MW of power from India via the Dhalkebar – Mujaharpur Transmission line in FY 2018/19. The eradication of load shedding also prompted a reform to Nepal’s energy sector.
Understanding the energy mix and its long-term implications for Nepal’s energy sector, Ghising re-initiated the World Bank’s Grid Solar and Energy Efficiency Project agreed between the World Bank and the NEA in 2014.
The NEA also signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the private sector for the purchase of solar energy and national grid connection. Moreover, in December 2016, ADB announced a US$20 million grant to promote private sector investment in utility-scale solar power. This funding was to ensure the installation of at least 25 MW of solar capacity by 2018 and was to be provided to private sector as viability gap funding.
Though there were a few bidders interested in developing the solar projects, to date none have been realized. This is because financial institutions and banks remain unconvinced of the financial viability of solar projects, despite the government’s promotion of alternative energy sources for electricity.
In FY2019/20, the total energy imported from India decreased by 38.55% compared to FY2018/19. Despite this, the total available energy in the system increased by 2.51% to 7,741 GWh in FY2019/20 over the corresponding figure of 7,551 GWh in FY 2018/19. Out of total available energy, total domestic generation is 77.67%, while imported electricity from India accounted for 22.33%.
In order to be self-dependent, as well as stimulate the market for energy exports to neighboring nations, the NEA under the leadership of MD Kulman Ghising decided to install solar projects that would meet the energy demand in dry seasons. Thus, the first stage of 25 MW solar project – 1.5 MW – was constructed and connected to the hydro-dominated national grid in June 2020. This was an NEA solar project constructed through the World Bank’s Grid Solar and Energy Efficiency Project.
The transition for Nepal’s solar energy sector came in 2019/20 when the Prime Commercial Bank approved financing for the 10 MW Mithila Solar PV Project by Eco Power Development Pvt. Ltd. However, despite the financial closure, in the absence of a proper EPC partner and understanding of the technology, Eco Power Development did not install the project.
An EPC agreement was eventually signed in 2020 with Sandeep Agrawal, managing director of Kushal Projects Nepal Pvt. Ltd who convinced Eco Power of his experience in the field of solar.
In February 2020, after all required documentation was secured, the bank loan was paid in March 2020, and in the April, a Letter of Credit (LC) for the products was opened. To initiate the project, a team comprising engineers and other trained manpower were recruited from India. It reached the site on June 29, 2020.
Various challenges were faced, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and unpredicted heavy rainfall. Thus, governmental officials were not convinced that the project could be implemented in such a short span, which led to regular monitoring for quality assurance. Finally, the project was completed within a period of seven months and on February 16, 2021, was connected to the national grid at Dhalkebar.
The average generation of the solar plant is more than 50,000 units per day. This has proved that such projects can generate electricity and can be a potential alternative source for energy generation for Nepal. The local population also benefitted as they can generate revenue against the land lease and undertake employment opportunities in the project. The successful installation of the project has been a particular achievement, because it feeds into the same grid as the electricity imported from India. Thus, the government has decided that Nepal will import 10 MW less from India.
Overall, Nepal is starting to see growth in the development of solar and there are around 300 MW of projects in the pipeline at present.

StorageX is an academic-industry-government initiative that aims to solve the most pressing real-world challenges in battery storage by addressing gaps between academic and industrial R&D.
ReNew’s collaboration with StorageX will focus initially on challenges surrounding grid-level battery usage and performance in India, with an eye toward optimizing storage assets’ performance and ultimately driving stable and firm power delivery to the grid. 
ReNew will participate in StorageX through the Stanford Energy Corporate Affiliate (SECA) program, which facilitates interactions between organizations and Stanford faculty and graduate students across the full range of energy-related topics. Through its membership in the SECA program, ReNew will have access to world-class research and opportunities for collaboration on research, education and training. 
Speaking about the affiliation, Sumant Sinha, ReNew Power founder, chairman, and CEO, said, “The collaboration with Stanford’s StorageX Initiative will broaden ReNew’s field of vision and help us in recognizing promising new technologies quickly. Reliable renewable power generation in India is critical to meeting the government’s goal of putting 450 GW of renewable power online by 2030. ReNew is proud to work with Stanford’s Precourt Institute for Energy in ensuring that economical and efficient energy storage technologies become critical in reducing the intermittency of renewable power in countries around the world.” 
Grid-scale battery storage is crucial for India to meet its long-term goal of firm, reliable electricity from grid-integrated renewable sources. The ability to deliver reliable power from renewable sources at peak and off-peak hours is critical to power distribution companies’ plans to meet obligations for purchasing renewable power. 
In January 2020, ReNew emerged winner in India’s first auction for renewable power generation combined with energy storage for guaranteed peak power supply. The 300 MW project was awarded by the Solar Energy Corporation of India. 
Additionally, ReNew has won the auction to provide 400 MW of round-the-clock power through renewable sources. This project will use a combination of wind and solar renewable generation assets and storage technology to provide annual capacity utilization of 80%–approximately double that of regular renewable energy generation projects.

Switzerland-based heterojunction solar module manufacturer Meyer Burger has teamed up with three German start-ups – Authentic Network, Torwell and Syscore – to develop a smart sticker that, for solar modules, is claimed to bring real added value for PV system owners, manufacturers and installers.
Each sticker, which marks the panel with a small green tick, encrypts a digital twin of the module that can be controlled via a smartphone app. The app offers various services such as a solar calculator, intelligent support in the search for an installer, and an access function for technicians. For example, the system operator can order a repair or an exchange service with a one-touch process within a few seconds.
The sticker is based on a blockchain technology developer by Authentic Network, which stated further services are to follow. The technology is not only attractive for customers but also for manufacturers. The latter, in fact, could turn themselves into technology partners and generate new revenue streams.
Meyer Burger uses the application for the photovoltaic modules it produces in its new factory that opened in Freiberg at the end of May. According to the Swiss manufacturer, these modules should not only deliver up to 20% more energy from the same square meter of roof area, but also offer added value via the app.
“Just as intelligent multi-function cookers have their own recipes today and mix all the ingredients together perfectly, we came to the conclusion that it must also be possible for a solar module to provide the customer with more than just electricity,” said Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt. “We wanted useful digital services and information that can be easily and conveniently accessed via an app.” The sticker with the green tick makes this possible.
