The two organizations will cooperate on a range of research and development (R&D) activities including the localization of thin film and other next-generation PV technology supply chains in India, high-volume manufacturing, testing of PV modules, and high-value recycling.
First Solar stands to benefit from IIT Madras Research Park’s expertise in areas such as field testing, while the partnership allows IIT Madras Research Park to broaden its understanding of thin-film PV technology,
Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala, president– IIT Madras Research Park, IITM Incubation Cell & RTBI, said, “First Solar is the world leader in thin film solar and its knowledge and track record in both R&D and high-volume manufacturing represents a tremendous opportunity for India, which is working to secure its clean energy supply chains. First Solar has demonstrated the potential of thin film to counter China’s dominance of crystalline silicon with high-performance solar panels that are competitive, sustainable, and responsibly produced. We are pleased to collaborate with the company to broaden our understanding of its technology while sharing our expertise in renewables.”
First Solar produces its thin-film PV modules using a fully integrated, continuous process under one roof. The company’s eco-efficient module technology, which uses its proprietary Cadmium Telluride (CadTel) semiconductor, has the lowest carbon and water footprints of any PV module available today.
Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer of First Solar, on the MoU said, “The MoU covers a number of areas that directly support India’s decarbonization, energy independence, and sustainability goals and we would be pleased to share our experience, while also benefitting from the institution’s expertise in areas such as field testing.”
In 2021, First Solar announced the investment in a new full vertically integrated thin-film solar manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu with an annual capacity of 3.3 GW DC. The facility, located in Pillaipakkam, Tamil Nadu, is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/10/pausing-almm-will-hit-solar-manufacturing-investments-say-industry-bodies/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 10, 2023","Pausing ALMM will hit solar manufacturing investments, say industry bodies","Amid reports of the government seeking to pause ALMM (The Approved List of Models and Manufacturers) implementation for two years, solar manufacturers in India say the move will hit investments into domestic PV manufacturing.
As per ALMM requirement, only the solar products and manufacturers making to this list are eligible for government-backed, open access, and net-metering projects. The policy was introduced by the ministry of new and renewable energy to safeguard the domestic industry from dumping of Chinese products and ensure the use of quality solar cells and modules in PV projects.
CEEW estimates India would require INR 53,773 crore of investments over the next 3-4 years to indigenize the domestic solar manufacturing value chain. “ALMM mandate is crucial to protecting these investments,” said manufacturers.
Further, India is expected to have more than 95 GW of PV manufacturing capacity by the end of the calendar year 2025 with a continued focus on domestic manufacturing. Solar cell production is expected to reach 18 GW by the end of 2023, according to JMK Research.
“ALMM implementation was a reaffirmation of the government’s inclination towards bringing India’s economic growth, job creation and fulfilling net-zero target through solar. Improving domestic solar manufacturing is expected to bring $30 billion (INR 2.3 lakh crore) to domestic manufacturers in revenues by 2030 (by selling 150 GW at INR 15/Wp). However, delaying ALMM implementation would certainly impact capacity expansion investments made by domestic manufacturers in a negative manner, thus slowing the progress of realizing Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India),” said Ashwini Sehgal, President of Indian Solar Manufacturers Association (ISMA)—an industry body representing manufacturers of solar cells, modules, and glass for modules in India.
Hitesh Doshi, president of All India Solar Industries Association (AISIA), said, “The growth opportunities are there for India and with growing solar demand it will only bring in more advantage only if we focus on nurturing domestic solar manufacturing. Besides, according to IEA, China holds an 80% share of all key manufacturing stages of solar panels in the global solar market. China concentrating the supply chains to itself is leading to imbalances and correction is needed to create a solar industry that is resilient to supply-side shocks or other crises. We are confident India can play a larger role with the timely implementation of favorable policies such as ALMM.”
Manish Gupta, president of the North India Module Manufacturer Association (NIMMA), appealed for a swift resolution in the matter, prioritizing the domestic solar manufacturing sector. “With the timely implementation of ALMM, our country stands to claim a much higher position in leading national and global solar transition through continuous manufacturing capacity expansion and R&D.” He appealed for a swift resolution in the matter, prioritizing domestic solar manufacturing sector,” he added.
ALMM list features 83 solar module manufacturers totaling 20.98 GW capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/10/survey-shows-34-3-failure-rate-for-residential-inverters-over-15-years/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 10, 2023",Survey shows 34.3% failure rate for residential inverters over 15 years,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Bern University of Applied Sciences have conducted an online survey to investigate the “time to failure” (TTF) for residential inverters. They have found that 34.3% of the devices experienced their first failures after 15 years.
“I would say this failure rate is acceptable, even good,” researcher Christof Bucher told pv magazine. “One assumes the inverter must be replaced once in the lifetime of a PV system.”
The survey includes inverters from Fronius, Huawei, Kostal, SMA, SolarEdge, and Sputnik. However, the scientists said that the analyzed devices are not representative of the current PV market, as they were purchased many years ago.
“The oldest inverters investigated in this study are from the early 1990s,” they said.
The survey includes data from 1,195 PV systems with 2,121 inverters and 8,542 optimizers. The biggest share of the inverters used in these systems had power ratings between 10 kVA and 15 kVA.
“A large part of the data was collected with the help of people who know the history of the PV systems well,” the scientists explained, adding that incomplete, unanalyzable data records were deleted. “The survey gave respondents the opportunity to add their own comments to the technical data.”
In order to analyze the TTF, the research group used the Kaplan-Meier estimator, which is commonly used to estimate the survival function from figures that are censored, truncated, or have missing values. The survival curve shows which percentage of the population is still alive after how many years.
“The Kaplan-Meier estimator can be adjusted for different influencing factors, for example to the year of commissioning, the inverter manufacturer or the nominal power ratio,” the researchers explained.
The scientist said the survival curve considers how many inverters are still under observation in the corresponding year of operation. That could help assess when a certain percentage of the inverters will have their first expected malfunctions.
“However, because only little data is available for old inverters, the uncertainty in the survival curve increases with increasing inverter life,” said the scientists.
The survey showed that more than 65% of the inverters did not present yield-relevant faults by their 15th year of operation. The scientists said the TTF mainly depends on the manufacturer and a device’s location, with outdoor installations having shorter TTF rates. They said the overall reliability of an inverter is proportional to the reduction in the number of power electronic components. In inverters with power optimizers, the first fault often occurs earlier than in devices without optimizers, according to the scientists.
“The inverters and optimizers in this study represent a broad, albeit not representative, cross-section of the inverters and optimizers used in PV systems on buildings in Switzerland and Europe,” they explained.
When they first announced the survey in July, the researchers said the causes of the failures and defects had not been precisely recorded. They said at the time that the “the rule of thumb that inverters should run without faults for around 15 years” had been confirmed by their findings.
The research project will run until the end of 2025 and extended to other systems.
