Premier Energies, backed by global environment fund GEF Capital (based in Washington DC), has offices in India and Toronto and has a fully automated line in Hyderabad (India) with an annual capacity of 2 GW of cells and 3 GW of modules. 
Premier Energies’ 88 modules spanning 400 W, 450 W, 500 W, and 540W series qualified as Top Performer after passing PVEL’s rigorous Product Qualification Program (PQP). Under PQP, the modules were tested on a variety of parameters like thermal cycling, damp heat, mechanical stress sequence, potential-induced degradation (PID), light-induced degradation (LID), light and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LETID), and PAN performance. 
“Premier Energies modules have, in fact, delivered high reliability scores of less than 1% degradation in critical tests like LID+LETID and less than 2% degradation in PID. These reliability scores, in simulated real world rigorous conditions are highly relevant to solar developers who are looking for modules that perform reliably under varying and testing conditions,” stated Premier Energies.

This is about 54% higher than the Q4 2022 installations. About 801 MW of rooftop solar capacity was added during the period, which is 44% higher than the Q4 2022 installations, according to JMK Research & Analytics’ RE Update for Q1 2023.
Over 4 GW of central and string inverters and about 3.1 GW of modules were shipped in India in Q1 2023. Waaree was the largest module supplier, with about 12.8% share of total shipments during the fiscal. Sungrow was the leading inverter supplier, followed by Sineng and Fimer.
About 8 GW of utility-scale solar capacity was added during the twelve months ending March 31, 2023, which is about 22% less year-on-year. In the rooftop solar segment, 2,232 MW of new capacity was added during the fiscal.
JMK analysts expect India to add about 18 GW of new solar capacity (15.5 GW from utility-scale and 2.5 GW from rooftop) in FY2023-24. Quarterly installation activity is likely to pick up further. In the next two quarters, about 6.7 GW of solar and 2.5 GW of hybrid capacities are expected to get installed in the country.

Just in time for the summer barbecuing season, Arka Energy is introducing the PowerGazebo to residential solar installers and consumers in the United States, offering 2.4 kW to 4.3 kW of solar power through monocrystalline PERC mounted solar tiles.
The outdoor gazebo serves as a functional solution for households seeking home-generated power, particularly those with limited rooftop space for traditional solar panels.
With a solar capacity of 14 W per square foot, the PowerGazebo comes in configurations of 180 square feet or 312 square feet. Arka Energy provides a 25-year warranty for the solar tiles, while the gazebo assembly is designed to withstand strong storm winds.
The mono PERC solar tiles feature a power capacity ranging from 77 W to 97 W, boasting a cell efficiency of 22% and utilizing a 10-bus construction. The panels are mounted at a slope of 7 degrees to 14 degrees, optimizing daily sunlight exposure.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/24/new-solar-panels-produce-water-from-humidity/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 24, 2023",New solar panels produce water from humidity,"From pv magazine Global
US manufacturer Source Global has developed a solar module technology that generates drinking water from atmospheric humidity using PV electricity.
The company, formerly known as Zero Mass Water, claims their new panel is “the world’s first renewable drinking water system” and can operate independently in various locations throughout the world.
The Commercial Hydropanel and R3 Residential Hydropanel, with a lifespan of around 15 years, can function with as little as 10% humidity in the air.
While specific details about the patented technology were not disclosed, Source Global explained that the panel’s PV unit produces electricity to power fans extracting water vapor from the air. The collected vapor is then converted into liquid water using the panel’s internal heat.
A self-contained system maintains water circulation and cleanliness in a storage tank, followed by mineralization for ideal composition and taste.
Commercial panels are already deployed in remote areas, indigenous communities, camps, and arid deserts, such as Oman, where the company established its inaugural “water farm.”
Residential panels, priced at $2,950 per unit, including deposit, domestic connection kit, and warranty, are sold in pairs and can yield an average of 4 to 10 liters of clean water per day.
