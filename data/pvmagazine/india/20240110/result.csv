Solar installations decreased by 28% compared to CY2022, while wind installations were 52% up year-on-year, according to a new report by JMK Research.
The solar addition in 2023 included about 6.5 GW of utility-scale solar installations (about 42.5% less than in 2022), 3 GW in the rooftop segment (58% higher yoy), and nearly 500 MW in the off-grid/distributed solar segment.
JMK attributed the decline in utility-scale solar installations to below-par tender issuance activity during the period from 2020 to 2022. With the recent upsurge in tender activity, it anticipates the utility-scale solar installations to increase in the future.
Rajasthan topped in large-scale PV capacity addition with 2,193 MW installed in 2023, followed by Gujarat (1,317 MW) and Maharashtra (979 MW). Gujarat led the wind installations by commissioning more than 1,300 MW of new wind projects in the 12 months of 2023.
In terms of cumulative installations, according to the data released by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) till December 2023, India’s installed RE capacity reached 133.89 GW. Solar energy contributes the largest share of around 55% of the total RE capacity, followed by wind energy (33%), biopower (8%), and small hydro (4%).

A memorandum of understanding for the initiative was exchanged between Unsoo Kim, managing director and chief executive officer, Hyundai Motor India, and V. Kamakoti, director, IIT Madras.
Sembcorp Industries has committed an investment of INR 36,238 crore (over $4.36 billion) to establish a green hydrogen plant in Thoothukudi.
Elcogen and Convion have wrapped up 2,000 hours of testing of a solid oxide electrolyzer equipped with Elcogen’s cell technology. The test campaign included steady-state operation and 1,000 rapid power cycles. The companies reported robust system performance, achieving an electrical efficiency exceeding 85%, to produce 39 kWh of electrical energy per kilogram of green hydrogen. In the context of electrolysis, this represents a reduction of 20% to 30% in electricity compared to competing PEM and alkaline technologies. The steam electrolyzer features Elcogen’s Solid Oxide cell and stack technology implemented in Convion’s steam electrolyzer system platform.
The Hydrogen Energy Association (HEA) has launched the United Kingdom’s first free-to-access Hydrogen Projects Map. The hydrogen trade association has brought together hydrogen projects across the value chain, mapping them for the first time. “The HEA has mapped more than 70 low-carbon hydrogen production projects that are in operation or advancing quickly towards final investment decisions,” said the HEA. “The first wave of large-scale electrolytic hydrogen projects will be in operation in 2025. Aberdeen H2 Hub (400MW), Cromarty Hydrogen Hub (300MW), Lowestoft hydrogen production facility (200MW) and Hybont (250MW) are some of these pioneering projects.”
Australia’s Northern Territory government has awarded “Major Project Status” to TE H2’s 1 GW Darwin H2 Hub. Major Project Status is a formal recognition of a project’s significance through its contribution to economic growth, decarbonization, employment, and renewable energy supply chains, which could lead to faster approvals “With our abundant solar resources and our strategic location to support exports into the Indo-Pacific, the production of green hydrogen is a key opportunity for the Territory to address the growing demand for this green energy globally,” said Chief Minister Eva Lawler in a press release. TE H2 is a joint venture formed by TotalEnergies and EREN.
Equinor and RWE have agreed to jointly develop a large-scale energy value chain. They aim to replace coal-fired power plants in Germany with hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants and to build a production of low-carbon, renewable hydrogen in Norway that will be exported via a pipeline to Germany. The Norwegian company said that it plans to capture and permanently store more than 95% of the CO2 beneath the seabed off Norway.
Woodside and South Korea’s SK E&S have agreed to enable studies on the potential development of a lower-carbon hydrogen value chain, including hydrogen and ammonia. “[We] plan to jointly explore opportunities relating to long-term ammonia and hydrogen offtake arrangements, equity participation in ammonia and hydrogen production projects, and project engineering supply opportunities,” said Woodside.

Spearheaded by the Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Department (UPNEDA), this ambitious project encompasses the development of solar parks, solar-powered boats, street lights, and the widespread adoption of solar energy in public transport. The government buildings will also be solar-powered.
As a part of the Solar City program, Ayodhya will also host a 40 MW solar power plant over 165 acres of identified land. The ambitious project is well underway, with a 10 MW plant already commissioned and the full 40 MW capacity expected to be operational by March 2024. The project is being developed by NTPC Green Energy with Jakson Green as the EPC provider.
As a part of the broader framework outlined in Uttar Pradesh’s Solar Energy Policy 2022, Ayodhya is set to pioneer solar innovation, serving as a model for 17 municipal corporations, including Noida.
UPNEDA
The multifaceted plan involves strategically developing solar parks along the banks of the Saryu River and extends beyond infrastructure to include the adoption of solar energy in public transport, enhancing the city’s eco-friendly mobility.
“Ayodhya’s solar initiative transcends mere technological deployment and encompasses public spaces, with the installation of solar-powered mobile phone charging setups, ensuring convenient access to clean energy. The promotion of solar energy for domestic and household purposes signifies a comprehensive approach to integrate sustainable practices into the daily lives of Ayodhya’s residents,” stated UPNEDA.
“The establishment of a 50-kilowatt off-grid solar power plant in the Bhairo Singh Gaushala, showcases Ayodhya’s dedication to harnessing solar energy across diverse sectors. Solar-powered water kiosks have been set up to ensure access to clean and sustainable water sources.”
A total rooftop solar capacity of 1,073 kW has been established on residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. This initiative, coupled with extensive outreach and 80 camps, aims to encourage widespread adoption of solar power and avail the benefits of the program.
Under the Babu Ji Kalyan Singh Gram Unnati Yojna for solar street lights, the target of 200 lights has been achieved. The state government is eyeing a world record of installing the longest line of solar-powered street lights in the temple town of Ayodhya. Determined to increase the use of renewable and green energy resources in Ayodhya, UPNEDA will install 470 solar-powered lights covering a stretch of 10.2 km connecting Guptar Ghat to Laxman Ghat. Once the lights are installed, the state government would approach the Guinness World Records for inspection before declaring the stretch as the longest solar-powered street in the world.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/10/israeli-startup-launches-530-w-bifacial-pvt-panel/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"JANUARY 10, 2024",Israeli startup launches 530 W bifacial PVT panel,"From pv magazine Global
Israel-based P.G. Solar Greener has developed a novel hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) bifacial panel with a maximum electric output of 530 W and a thermal capacity of 1,280 Wh.
The photovoltaic unit is based on 144 monocrystalline PERC cells and has a power conversion efficiency of 20.7%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius.
The PVT panel measures 2,094 mm x 1,038 mm x 3.5 mm and weighs 43 kg. It uses a water pump to circulate water behind the module uniformly. This cools down the panel temperature, with excess heat being moved to a heat exchanger. The latter is then connected to a boiler, producing hot water.
The company said the panels have an overall dual electrical efficiency of 26%, due to module cooling and a thermal efficiency of 55%. The recommended module retail price is €40o ($437.60).
“We are installing the system in a boarding school in Israel,” CEO Peter Graner told pv magazine. “We are installing 60 panels producing 9,000 liters of 60 C water daily. In addition, those panels will produce 52,470 kWh per year.”
Graner said the company will install an additional 150 panels on boarding schools later this year. This will be the company’s first commercial project, although it has launched a number of pilot projects over the past five years.
Dan Halperin, the company’s VP of business development, said that while the panels are now only available in Israel, the company is seeking global partners to further expand.
