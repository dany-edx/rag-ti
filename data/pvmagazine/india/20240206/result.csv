Ltd (BPCL) today unveiled India’s first indigenous alkaline electrolyzer at the India Energy Week (IEW) 2024 in Goa. The electrolyzer has been developed collaboratively by BPCL and the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC).
Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the operation of the alkaline electrolyzer at IEW 2024.
In alkaline water electrolysis, hydrogen is produced from alkaline water via electrolysis.
In line with India’s target to build a green hydrogen production capacity of 5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) by 2030, BPCL plans a 5 MW green hydrogen plant at Bina Refinery. Additionally, a 500 kW capacity integrated hydrogen refueling station will be established at the Cochin International Airport Ltd.
BPCL is showcasing its ongoing efforts in the IEW 2024 Hydrogen Pavilion, highlighting progress in green hydrogen production.

The successful developers will set up projects on a build-own-operate basis. SJVN will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the developers. Power procured by SJVN from these projects has been provisioned to be sold to the different buying entities of India.
A single developer can bid for a cumulative contracted capacity of 50 MW to 750 MW in multiples of 10 MW.
“Bidders, including its affiliates, who have already installed wind-solar hybrid power plants or are in the process of constructing such plants and have untied capacity may also participate in the bid. In such case, they will be given the benefit of a longer duration of PPA, commensurate to the duration between the actual date of commencement of supply of power and the scheduled commencement of supply date,” as per the tender document.

Lithium producer Lithos Group LTD’s subsidiary Aqueous Resources LLC applied for a $30 million grant through the Department of Energy’s FedConnect program. The $150 million grant, to be awarded by the DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, is meant to help advance the development of financially and environmentally sustainable processes associated with the production and refinement of lithium.
Each awardee receives up to $30 million, and Aqueous’ financing will go toward renovating its 55,000 sq ft Bessemer, Ala., complex. “We are excited to extend and expand our relationship with the U.S. Department of Energy and use this additional grant funding to accelerate pilot scale production of Lithium hydroxide from the Bessemer, Ala., complex,” said Scott Taylor, CEO of Lithos.
The funds will help increase the facility’s capacity to process lithium hydroxide sustainably, which is essential to ensuring organizations can meet local demands for lithium without causing further harm to the environment.
Lithium is usually mined from hard rock or salt brines. Both can have a negative environmental impact; however, Aqueous technology works to minimize the amount of groundwater evaporation necessary for lithium recovery from salt brines. The process usually requires pumping saltwater from underground reservoirs to the surface, then storing it in evaporation ponds, where it takes 12 to 18 months to evaporate and leave behind a brine with high lithium concentrations.
Carbon Accounting Platform Greenly states that it takes almost 2.2 million liters of water to produce one ton of lithium. This depletes groundwater levels in nearby areas, thus potentially harming agricultural land.
The patent-pending technology, AcQUA, employs an electric-pressure membrane process to remove and refine lithium chloride salt brines. It allows for directly removing raw brine from saltwater without evaporation ponds. Aqueous states that the process is cost-effective and efficient because the technology can pre-treat, select, purify, and concentrate lithium-enriched brines before extracting lithium chloride.
The company reports that the technology also allows for repurposing over 98% of the input brine water.
Lithos states it has a fully operational direct lithium extraction processing plant commissioned in Denver, Colo. The organization is focusing on applying the same technology to reduce the environmental impact of processing brines across other locations in the United States, as well as in Argentina and Chile.
The company seeks to become the global standard for economically and environmentally sustainable lithium production, used in the manufacturing of EV batteries. Its Bessemer, Ala., facility sits near Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, Inc., Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, LLC, and Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, LLC.
“The existing permits allow us to seamlessly extend our pre-treatment processing flowsheets to DLE and through polishing and purifying battery grade lithium. We are grateful for the support we received from the Senate, Congress, the University of Alabama, and the City of Bessemer,” said Taylor.

AFSIA has released a new annual report on PV deployment in Africa. It said the continent connected around 3.7 GW of new solar capacity in 2023.
About 65% of the new installations were industrial and commercial (C&I) power plants for self-consumption, said AFSIA. “Unlike other regions of the world, there have been only a handful of large-scale projects, responding to government requests, that have been connected to the African power grid in 2023,” it added.
The association estimated that Africa passed the 16 GW threshold of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of December. However, that “does not take into account residential installations which are not monitored by AFSIA,” it added. The figure is only based on projects it has identified, while some projects may still be unknown at this stage, it explained.
In 2023, the continent installed 3.7 GW of new capacity. South Africa accounted for nearly 3 GW of the total, primarily driven by C&I projects (75%). The country’s connected PV capacity increased from 4.2 GW in 2022 to 7.1 GW by the end of 2023.
“By quickly changing tack to focus on self-consumption, South Africans are showing the rest of the continent the way forward. A path where alternative options exist and are financially viable in the event of failure of the national public utility,” said AFSIA. “The South Africans had no choice and had to adapt very quickly.”
Burkina Faso has installed the second-most solar capacity in Africa with 92 MW, followed by Mauritania with 84 MW, Kenya with 69.5 MW, and the Democratic Republic of Congo with 40 MW. Except for Mauritania, where all of the new capacity is C&I, these countries have built large-scale projects. Another 15 countries installed more than 10 MW each last year, but most African states remain below 1 MW of installed capacity.
