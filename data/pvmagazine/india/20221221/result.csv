The prospective contractor’s scope of work includes design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing, commissioning and three years of comprehensive operation and maintenance of the solar plant, excluding the supply of PV modules.
“PV modules shall be supplied to the BOS contractor by SJVN Green Energy,” reads the tender document.
EPC completion period is 465 days from the award of contract.
SJVN Green Energy has already signed a power purchase agreement with BREDA.

As the nation targets to double its steel production to 300 mtpa by 2030, it also needs to become a responsible steel producer. And therefore the government has put in place a national green steel policy and is looking at both demand-side and supply-side drivers for decarbonizing steel production, said union steel minister Jyotiraditya Scindia yesterday at an event in New Delhi.
Scindia said, on the supply side, the government is looking at components like energy efficiency, use of renewable energy and green hydrogen, resource efficiency, scrap usage, and carbon capture utilization and storage.
“Through renewable energy, CO2 emission in steel production can be cut by about 10-15%….The cost of green hydrogen is roughly $6/kg today. The use of green hydrogen in steel production will make economic sense only when its cost falls to around $1.5/kg,” he said.
On the occasion, the minister unveiled India’s first green steel from Saarloha Advanced Materials (Saarloha), a Kalyani group company. These green steel products, launched under the brand Kalyani FeRRESTA, are manufactured in an electric arc furnace using electricity from 100% of renewable energy sources and more than 70% recycled scrap material with zero GHG footprint.
The Kalyani Group has set up a 75 MW solar to power green steel production. It has also deployed an 8 MW wind power plant.
‘KALYANI FeRRESTA PLUS has Net Zero GHG emissions per ton of Crude steel, whereas KALYANI FeRRESTA has very low GHG emission of <0.19 tCO2e per MT of Crude Steel. Customers purchasing KALYANI FeRRESTA & KALYANI FeRRESTA PLUS steel products will get Green Steel certificates jointly issued by DNV Business Assurance India Private Limited & Saarloha which they can use to claim their Scope 3 emissions reduction,” stated Saarloha.

CleanMax will own and operate the projects, while Meta will purchase the power generated to supply its operations.
The 33.8 MW of renewable energy project is in addition to CleanMax and Meta’s 32 MW of wind energy project jointly announced last year, bringing their total investment to 65 MW of new renewable energy.
These projects are part of a larger wind-solar hybrid farm being developed by CleanMax. The overall capacity of the CleanMax wind-solar hybrid farm will stand at 364 MW; comprising 154 MW wind and 210 MWp solar once commissioned.
Solar-wind hybrid plants combine two of the fastest growing renewable energy technologies owing to their complementary nature. These hybrid power plants are highly efficient, provide reliability of continuous power supply and help effectively manage the consumption load.

Scientists from Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) have once more broken the efficiency world record of tandem solar cells consisting of a silicon bottom cell and a perovskite top cell. The 32.5% efficiency record has been officially confirmed by the certifying institute European Solar Test Installation.
“This is a really big leap forward that we didn’t foresee a few months ago,” said Steve Albrecht from HZB’s perovskite tandem solar cell department. “All the teams involved at HZB, especially the teams from the PV Competence Center (PVcomB) and the HySPRINT Innovation Lab, have worked together excellently and with great dedication on this.
His team used an improved perovskite compound with a modificed surface. Silvia Mariotti and Eike Köhnen, both authors of the study, developed an interface modification in which charge recombination losses are largely suppressed. Furthermore, they applied special measurement methods to better understand the fundamental processes. These developments were then successfully transferred to tandem solar cells and combined with further optical improvements by Lea Zimmermann.
In recent years, there has been a continuous increase in efficiency values by various research institutions and photovoltaic companies worldwide. At the end of 2021, various teams from HZB achieved a then record value of 29.8% efficiency. To achieve this, they introduced special, periodic nanotextures into the solar cells. Then, this summer, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, was able to significantly surpass that value again, achieving 31.3% efficiency with a certified tandem cell.
Now the highest value of 32.5% efficiency was again achieved by the HZB. “We are very pleased about the renewed significant leap in efficiency. This demonstrates the high potential of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells to contribute to a sustainable energy supply and turnaround in the coming years,” said Albrecht.
HZB’s chief scientific officer, Bernd Rech, noted that “at 32.5%, the solar cell efficiency of the HZB tandems is now in ranges previously only achieved by expensive III/V semiconductors.”
Just last week, Meyer Burger signed a multi-year cooperation agreement together with several research institutes in Germany and Switzerland, including HZB. This involves the industrialization of perovskite tandem solar cells and modules.
