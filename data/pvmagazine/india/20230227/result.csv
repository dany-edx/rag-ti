EET will focus on hydrogen, decarbonization, new energy infrastructure, and biofuels, creating a fully integrated energy transition hub at Stanlow in the UK.
EET plans to invest a total of $3.6 billion in developing a range of low-carbon energy transition projects over the next five years, of which $2.4 billion will be invested across its site at Stanlow in the UK and $1.2 billion in India.
EET will include Essar’s operating entities such as Essar Oil UK, the company’s refining and marketing business in North West England; Vertex Hydrogen, which is developing 1 GW of blue hydrogen for the UK market, with follow-on capacity set to reach 3.8 GW; EET Future Energy, which is developing 1 GW of green ammonia in India, targeted at UK and international markets; Stanlow Terminals Ltd, which is developing enabling storage and pipeline infrastructure; and EET Biofuels, which is investing in developing 1 MT of low-carbon biofuels.
“The investments in the UK, across a range of hydrogen production technologies, decarbonization, biofuels (road and aviation), and infrastructure projects, will contribute to North West England quickly becoming one of the leading post-carbon industrial clusters in Europe. EET believes that these investments will support the reduction of around 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, about 20% of the total industrial emissions in North West England,” stated the company.
The Stanlow refinery in the UK will achieve a 75% reduction in carbon emissions before the end of this decade as part of EET’s decarbonization plans.
In India, EET will invest $1.2 billion in developing a cost-efficient global supply hub for low-carbon fuels, including green hydrogen and green ammonia. Ammonia will be shipped from India to the UK, Europe, and globally to meet the expanding market demand for green hydrogen, stated Essar.

The report analyzed electricity transition in 16 Indian states that together account for 90% of the nation’s annual power requirement. It tracks the states’ progress across four dimensions: their preparedness to shift away from fossil-fuel-based power, their ability to incentivize greener market participation, their power system’s reliability, and policies pushing for power sector decarbonization. Based on this analysis, the report authors devised the States’ Electricity Transition (SET) scoring system, which measures the performance of the different states in the transition to clean electricity.
Karnataka scored well across all the dimensions of clean electricity transition identified in this study. It was the best-performing state in decarbonizing its power sector, the performance of its power system, and the readiness of its power ecosystem. It also has conducive policies and political commitments for a smoother transition.
“India’s revised Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets have put the country on the right path for transitioning its electricity sector. To achieve those targets, the center now needs the cooperation of the states to move faster in their clean electricity transitions. This means states redoubling their efforts to walk the electricity transition pathway, and both central and state governments tracking progress and taking corrective measures as required,” says the report’s co-author Vibhuti Garg, Director, South Asia, IEEFA.
The report says states need to ramp up their efforts to maximize renewable potential and deploy more energy storage solutions such as batteries and pumped hydro for better renewable energy integration.
“Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal have work to do to strengthen their clean electricity transition performances. These three states should maximize their renewable energy generation potential, and at the same time increase their commitment to moving away from fossil-fuels-based electricity,” says co-author Saloni Sachdeva Michael, Energy Analyst, IEEFA.
Apart from ramping up renewable energy capacity and storage, the report recommends that states take a multi-dimensional approach toward the clean electricity transition, which includes efforts on the demand side.
With more renewable energy coming online, the report also recommends states focus more on strengthening their power systems.
“Even the long-considered front-runners of adding renewable energy capacity, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, have to improve the readiness of their power ecosystems for a clean electricity transition,” says co-author Aditya Lolla, Senior Electricity Policy Analyst, Ember.
“State energy departments also need to strengthen electricity infrastructure for better integration of renewables. In addition to managing the demand and supply of electricity, ensuring effective utilization, monitoring, and tracking of electrons is also very important,” he adds.
Further, according to Lolla, introducing private sector participation and competition would bring more capital and management expertise into the electricity sector. This will help enhance operational efficiency and increase accessibility and affordability.
The report highlights increasing states’ participation in green market mechanisms as a key element to the clean electricity transition. “Developing a more robust market is an opportunity to support states with low renewable energy potential. To achieve this, states need to take urgent actions like removing banking restrictions and allowing banking of renewable energy not just monthly but also quarterly and yearly, especially for wind generation,” adds Sachdeva Michael.
The report also highlights that innovative bilateral financial markets mechanisms like Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPA) and Contracts for Difference (CfD) have huge potential to open up the market and give buyers and regulators the required assurance on handling intermittent renewable energy generation.
Another key aspect where states can do better is data availability and transparency. To monitor progress effectively and course-correct when necessary, the report calls for data availability and transparency improvement.
The report states the states also need to develop a more holistic and circular approach toward handling solar panel, battery, and electric vehicle waste. This will become even more crucial as India sets up new manufacturing units under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) scheme.
Finally, the report highlights that states must bridge the gap between the intent of their electricity transition policies and their implementation.

Chinese imports of polysilicon fell 23% year on year to 88,093 metric (MT) in 2022, due the ramp-up of new production capacity in the country, according to a new report by Bernreuter Research. The declines follow severe  polysilicon shortages in 2021.
Annual polysilicon imports  into China have nearly halved from their peak of 158,918 MT in 2017. They are now close to 2012 levels, when they reached 82,760 MT.
The biggest decline was seen in imports from Japan. In 2021, Sharp offloaded large volumes of polysilicon inventory after the company’s long-term purchase contract with Hemlock Semiconductor expired in 2020. That drove up imports from Japan to a record high of 15,431 MT in 2021. However, in 2022, imports fell by 60% to 6,129 MT.
A similar development occurred in Taiwan, where former producers of solar wafers are still selling polysilicon stocks they own from long-term contracts into China. Imports from Taiwan dropped by 50% from 6,899 MT in 2021 to 3,480 MT in 2022.
The Malaysian polysilicon subsidiary of South Korean chemicals group OCI also exported significantly less to China. Its shipment volumes dropped by 23% from 29,727 MT to 22,944 MT, due to longer-than-expected maintenance work at OCI’s factory.
Imports from Germany’s Wacker, the largest foreign polysilicon supplier to China, fell by 6.3% from 51,316 MT to 48,070 MT. Meanwhile, US-based Hemlock Semiconductor reduced its volumes from 4,811 MT to 2,785 MT, after both polysilicon manufacturers concluded sales contracts with Chinese module maker JinkoSolar, which opened a new wafer factory with a 7 GW wafer facility in Vietnam in early 2022.
Trina Solar is the next major Chinese module maker seeking to move production in response to ongoing anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations in the United States. Trina is expected to open a 6.5 GW wafer manufacturing facility in Vietnam mid-2023.
“With the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act that bans products from Xinjiang and the anti-circumvention decision against solar modules produced with Chinese wafers in Southeast Asia, the United States are driving the demand for solar panels made of polysilicon and wafers not coming from China,” said Bernreuter Research. “At the same time, polysilicon imports into China will shrink further in view of the massive domestic capacity expansion. Consequently, the future of non-Chinese polysilicon feedstock lies outside China.”
Preliminary production estimates shows China’s share of global solar-grade polysilicon output at 88% in 2022, up from 82% in 2021 and 55% in 2017. Driven by the big profits seen in 2022, industry analysts expect existing polysilicon expansion projects to materialize in 2023, with production rapidly increasing toward an eventual surplus.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/27/pumped-hydro-key-to-meeting-storage-demand/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",,"FEBRUARY 27, 2023",Pumped hydro key to meeting storage demand,"From pv magazine Global
Large-scale storage is required for energy systems based upon variable solar and wind. But there is already a highly credible, off-the-shelf, low-cost energy storage technology that is unconstrained by material availability, that has been available for a century. It has already been deployed at a scale of 200 GW, and is available at unlimited scale nearly everywhere. This technology is pumped hydro energy storage (PHES).
But there is a twist. Nearly all of the good PHES sites are located away from rivers, for the simple reason that most of the global landscape is not near rivers. The Australian National University’s Global Pumped Hydro Atlas lists 616,000 sites with a combined storage capacity of 23 million GWh, which is about 100 times more than is needed to support a global 100% renewable energy system.
PHES can be readily scaled to any required storage capacity at a known and affordable cost. Future technological development could further reduce the cost of electrochemical electricity storage such as Li-ion batteries. However, existing PHES technology sets a robust upper limit on the cost of storage that is already affordable and highly available in almost every country.
Companies and governments can confidently proceed with terawatt-scale deployment of low-cost, variable solar and wind in the knowledge that at least one highly credible, scalable and affordable energy storage technology already exists. No arm-waving is required about future cost reductions, and there are minimal resource constraints.
Off-river PHES involves pumping water uphill from one reservoir to another at a higher elevation for storage. When power is needed, water is released to flow downhill through turbines, generating electricity on its way to the lower reservoir.
For example, a pair of 100-hectare reservoirs – at an average depth of 20 meters, spaced a few kilometers apart and connected with a tunnel, with an altitude difference of 600 meters – can store 24 GWh of energy. This means the system could supply 1 GW of power for 24 hours.
The reservoirs can be constructed in hilly country, away from any river. Alternatively, existing lakes or reservoirs can be used. Because most sites are away from rivers, there is no need for flood control or new dams. The annual operating cost is low, and the system lifetime is 50 to 100 years. The working fluid is water, rather than electro chemicals.
Hour-by-hour analysis over many years of several countries suggest that about 2 GW of storage for one day (50 GWh of storage energy) per million people is enough to support a 100% renewable energy system in an affluent country, depending on local factors.
The land requirement is very small: in the range of 4 square meters per person. The water requirement is also small, at about 4 litres per day per person for the initial fill. To replace evaporation, the water is cycled up and down hill for 100 years.
In comparison, about 30 square meters of solar panels per person are required to provide each individual with 10 MWh of electricity per year, which is typical of annual electricity requirements in affluent countries.
The Global PHES Atlas lists 616,000 sites that can be panned and zoomed to a resolution of 30 meters. Sites in National Parks are excluded from the atlas. Tunnel routes, dam walls, flooded land, and cost classes (A to E) are shown for each site. Clicking on a site produces pop-ups listing 16 different attributes, including location, head, tunnel length, and volumes of the impounded water.
The United States has 35,000 good sites with 1.4 million GWh combined storage, mostly in the Rockies, but with a good number in the east as well. The enormous solar and wind potential of Texas can be coupled with local PHES storage to supply solar electricity to the east and west coasts in the middle of the night.
While northern Europe has relatively few sites, there are many good sites in the south. Strong north-south grid interconnections allow wind energy from the north to be exchanged for southern solar energy and PHES storage.
