Form Energy, a Massachusetts-based grid-scale energy storage developer, announced a definitive agreement with Georgia Power, a Southern Company utility, to deploy a 15 MW / 1.5 GWh iron-air battery into the utility’s Georgia grid, providing a 100-hour dispatch long-duration energy storage (LDES) system.
The multi-day LDES project is part of Georgia Power’s integrated plan to deploy additional cost-effective clean energy systems for grid reliability and resiliency. Subject to regulatory approval, the battery project is projected to enter commercial operations in 2026.
“Our customers, including many businesses and commercial accounts, are increasingly interested in the use of new technologies such as multi-day energy storage to help grow renewable energy and enhance reliability, especially as they relocate or grow their operations in Georgia,” said Kim Greene, president and chief executive officer of Georgia Power. “Form Energy’s technology is cutting edge and we’re excited to continue to work with them to serve our customers.”
Form Energy and the utility are collaborating to fully evaluate and demonstrate the 100-hour iron-air battery project will strengthen the local grid against normal daily, weekly and seasonal weather variability, in addition to extreme weather events, the developer said. This includes analysis modeled by Georgia Power and input from Formware, Form Energy’s investment and operational modeling software tool for power grids.
“We are pleased to strengthen our relationship through this partnership with Georgia Power and look forward to delivering an innovative multi-day energy storage system that will provide grid reliability and resiliency in their service territory for years to come,” said Mateo Jaramillo, chief executive officer and co-founder of Form Energy.
Georgia Power provides electricity to 2.7 million customers in all but four Georgia counties. In 2022, regulator Georgia Public Service Commission approved the utility’s long-term integrated resource plan (IRP). The utility has already deployed a large grid storage project, the 265 MW McGrau Ford battery facility, a lithium-ion battery project in Cherokee County, Ga., and an additional 500 MW of storage assets.
Besides the Form Energy project, the utility has a 65 MW project under development in Talbot County and a 13 MW project deployment for the U.S. Army located at Fort Stewart, near Savannah, Ga.
Form Energy was founded in 2017 by energy storage veterans who shared a unified mission to reshape the global electric system by creating a new class of low-cost multi-day energy storage systems.
The company began construction of its Weirton, West Virginia battery factory in May and plans to start manufacturing iron-air battery systems in 2024 for commercialization. The Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that the state was able to structure a unique financial incentive package worth up to $290 million in asset-based, performance financing to support their decision to locate in Weirton.
The company has raised over $820 million in growth equity funding to date, with a most recent $450 million Series E round completed in October 2022 from TPG Rise Fund, GIC and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Prior investors include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Capricorn Investment Group, Energy Impact Partners, ArcelorMittal, MIT’s The Engine, Prelude Ventures and VamosVentures, among others.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/13/india-installed-third-most-solar-capacity-in-the-world-in-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,WORLD",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 13, 2023",India installed third most solar capacity in the world in 2022 ,"The world installed 239 GW of new solar capacity in 2022, 45% up year-on-year. The total globally installed solar capacity reached almost 1.2 TW by the end of 2022, according to a new report by SolarPower Europe.
China continued to top in annual PV capacity addition by adding almost 100 GW in 2022—more than four times as much solar PV capacity as the second-largest market, the United States.
The US remained the second largest PV market in 2022, with 21.9 GW of annual addition.
India retained its third spot in annual PV capacity addition by installing an impressive 17.4 GW solar capacity in 2022, 23% up from 14.2 GW in 2021. Rooftop solar accounted for only 28% (4.9 GW) of annual installations in 2022.
The nation reached total PV installations of 77.6 GW (with 10 GW from rooftop) by the end of 2022, missing the 2022 target of 100 GW by a large margin. The analysts cite the dismal rooftop solar addition of 10 GW against the 40 GW target as the main reason for India falling significantly short of its 100 GW target.
The analysts anticipate a relatively slower PV growth in India in 2023, with around 20 GW of new capacity addition, representing a 15% growth compared to the previous year’s 23%.
“The market keeps expanding, but it is important to consider India’s historical sensitivity to PV product prices. The implementation of a basic customs duty of 25% on solar cells and 40% on modules from April 1st 2022 may result in project delays. There were also little module imports from China in the first months of the year,” stated the report.
On the other hand, after missing the 100 GW target by 2022, the government is implementing various measures to reach its ambitious goal of 280 GW of solar PV by 2030. Accomplishing this target would require the annual market to experience rapid growth, averaging 25 GW per year between 2023 and 2030.
Under the medium scenario, the analysts predict that India will add 24.5 GW in 2024 and 28.4 GW in 2025, and up to 38.3 GW in 2027.
“While the utility-scale sector will continue to be the primary driver of solar growth in India, the distributed segment, which played the key role in falling short of the 2022 target, will transition away from its niche status in the medium to long-term,” they said in the report.

Researchers at the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR) have assessed the performance of different polycrystalline solar modules coming from 11 undisclosed manufacturers and installed under the same warm and humid climatic conditions in Kumasi, Ghana.
Their work analyzed, in particular, 48 solar panels coming from 12 different PV systems. “In each PV system, the stratified random sampling technique was used to select 4 PV modules for testing,” they explained. “All the systems were off-grid connected and installed on rooftops for 5-9 years.”
The scientists decided to keep the manufacturers anonymous and marked the 12 sites with the letters from A to L and said the panel power output ranged from 100 W to 460 W. They conducted a visual inspection based on a checklist developed by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and used a Seaward PV 210-meter automatic I-V Tracer to measure the performance of the panels.
They said none of the PV systems was exposed to shading and that they were all built with the same installation and maintenance practices.
Through the testing, the scientists ascertained that the minimum degradation rate of the analyzed modules was 0.79%/year, while the maximum degradation rate was found to be 1.67%/year. They also found that the modules degraded at different rates with degradation rates between 0.78-1.95%/year with mean and median degradation rates of 1.36%/year and 1.38%/year.
“Overall, PV modules from only one manufacturer degraded less than the warranty rate of 0.8%/year while the modules from the remaining manufacturers degraded more than 1.0%/year,” they stated, noting that 42 modules exceeded the 1.0%/year threshold, which they said means these panels may “fail” before 20 years in operation under outdoor conditions in Kumasi. “Out of the 48 PV modules studied, 6 PV modules representing 12.5% are likely to operate reliably for 20-25 years, with only 4 PV modules representing 8.3% expected to meet the warranty period of 25 years.”
The research group stressed that the solar panels from the manufacturer with the highest mean degradation rate do not necessarily mean that all products from this manufacturer are of lower quality. It also said the degradation rate does not correlate with the age of the modules and that maximum power degradation was mainly attributable to lower short-circuit current.
The academics presented their findings in the paper “Degradation analysis of polycrystalline silicon modules from different manufacturers under the same climatic conditions,” published in Energy Conversion and Management: X. “The results of this study were comparable to the results obtained in the degradation analysis of polycrystalline silicon modules from different manufacturers carried out in other countries,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/13/gautam-solar-unveils-all-black-topcon-modules-at-intersolar-europe/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 13, 2023",Gautam Solar unveils n-type TOPCon modules at Intersolar Europe,"India’s Gautam Solar is set to launch n-type TOPCon modules at Intersolar Europe in Munich, Germany, as it eyes the European market. It will offer these modules in two power output ranges. Modules with power outputs from 420 Wp to 435 Wp are targeted at residential, and commercial & industrial (C&I) segments, whereas modules with 565 Wp to 580 Wp are suitable for utility-scale and large C&I customers.
“Europe is an important market for Indian solar module manufacturers and our new products with higher efficiencies are ideal for Europe,” said Gautam Mohanka, CEO of Gautam Solar.
The 420 Wp – 435 Wp TOPCon modules are available in four variants: all black, silver frame, glass-to-glass bifacial, and light-weight bifacial. These have an area under 2 m2, in compliance with local requirements. 
The all-black panels incorporate a black backsheet and black anodized aluminum alloy frame, in stark contrast to the conventional design with a white backsheet and silver anodized aluminum alloy frame. 
Glass-to-glass bifacial variant provides up to 10-30% gain from the rear side. Together, n-type TOPCon and bifacial technologies provide 37% more power.
Light-weight bifacial modules use a transparent backsheet, which ensures good rear-side power generation while keeping the module lightweight to prevent handling issues. These are built with 108 half-cut cells based on an M10 wafer.
The 565 Wp – 580 Wp modules for utility and large C&I projects feature 144 half-cut cells based on an M10 wafer.
Gautam Solar has also launched 400-415 Wp mono PERC modules in an all-black design. 
“All of these modules incorporate round ribbon for better light utilization, non-destructive cell cutting for higher reliability and lower chances of micro-cracks, and half-cut cell technology for better low-light performance. The optimum module size using M10 cells ensures maximum space utilization in a standard 40 ft. container during transportation,” stated Gautam Solar.
The new advanced modules are being manufactured at the company’s manufacturing facilities in India.
Gautam Solar is based out of New Delhi, with four factories in Haridwar. It has a solar module capacity of 500 MWp and is expanding to 1 GWp by September 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/13/agrivoltaics-for-vertical-farming/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 13, 2023",Agrivoltaics for vertical farming,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Polytechnic University of Marche in Italy have proposed to combine vertical farming with solar power generation from PV greenhouses in an effort to increase land utilization.
They defined solar greenhouses as “closed agrivoltaics (CA),” which would be a form of agrivoltaic project in which power generation and food production are implemented in a protected environment.
“All common horticultural crops grow with none or limited yield losses when the percentage of the projection of the PV panels on the roof to the greenhouse area (PV cover ratio) is under 20%,” the researchers specified. “We propose an alternative approach to increase the agricultural sustainability of the CA with the experimental integration of the vertical farm (VF) technology, characterized by yields, light and resource use efficiency consistently higher than conventional greenhouses.”
They also emphasized that vertical farming utilizes use light-emitting diodes (LED) to achieve high photosynthetic use efficiency and year-round production in the plants, noting that PV is a perfect solution to reduce the impact of the LEDs’ high energy consumption on project viability.
The Italian group sought to assess, in particular, the land productivity, the PV area, and the electricity required by an experimental VFCA system with a cover ratio of 100%. “The yield was quantified on green and red baby-leaf lettuce varieties, adopting four lighting treatments, expressed as Daily Light Integral (DLI) and compared to a control CA,” it explained.
They tested this approach on an experimental 40.48 kW VFCA located in the municipality of Villaperuccio, Sardinia, Italy. The system is operating since 2012 and is selling power to the grid at a feed-in tariff of €0.39 ($0.41) kWh. The shelves used for vertical farming each have a height of 40 cm and eight LED dimmable lamps that each have a nominal power of 22 W.
The greenhouse hosts four varieties of baby-leaf lettuce grown under four different lighting treatments.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the VFCA system is able to provide a 13% higher agricultural yield compared to a conventional CA system, with CO2 emissions dropping by over 12%.
“The case study quantified the high land consumption of this reconversion, with a CA area from 5.4 to 13.9 times higher than the VF area to achieve the energy self-sufficiency and avoid the related CO2 emissions, meaning that only 7–18% of the CA area can be reconverted to vertical farming,” they highlighted.
Their findings were presented in the study “Increasing the agricultural sustainability of closed agrivoltaic systems with the integration of vertical farming: A case study on baby-leaf lettuce,” published in Applied Energy. “This study contributed to identify the main design features to reconvert the existing and underutilized CAs into sustainable and efficient mixed agrosystems,” the researchers concluded.

France’s Ministry of Ecological Transition has reported that around 601 MW of new PV systems were connected to the French grid in the January-March quarter. In the same period a year earlier, the country added 596 MW of new PV capacity and in the fourth quarter of 2022, new installations hit 685 MW.  Full-year installations hit 2.4 GW of new solar in 2022
France reached 17.15 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of March 2023. The regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, and Grand Est accounted for 63% of all newly connected capacity in the first quarter this year. They are the regions with the highest installed capacities, representing more than 73% of all cumulative power connected in France by the end of March.
The aggregate capacity of queued solar projects with grid-connection requests, meanwhile, has increased by 40% since the start of this year to 18.5 GW, including 4.4 GW with signed connection agreements.
