Increased raw materials costs, severe volatility in module availability and price, power curtailment in several states, and high freight charges have all added to the difficulties for the developers. Notwithstanding that, India’s solar addition in the first nine months of 2021 totaled over 7.4 GW, a 328% increase YoY compared to the 1.73 GW installed in the same period in 2020, stated Mercom in its report.
India added 2,835 MW of solar in the third quarter (Q3) of the calendar year (CY) 2021, 14% more than 2,488 MW installed in Q2 2021. Year-over-year (YoY) installations in Q3 were 547% up.
“Despite supply challenges, the Indian solar market is headed towards one of best years on record, and a complete turnaround from 2021, which was one of the worst years for solar due to Covid-19,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “We expect a strong 2022 despite the high price of components and uncertainties surrounding the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) related transmission issue in Rajasthan. An increase in GST, curtailment, and payment issues are adding to the challenges facing developers and constraining growth.”
The average selling prices of solar modules rose steeply during the third quarter. Prices of mono PERC modules surged over 15% QoQ, with supply constraints after major manufacturers started cutting output in China. Freight charges peaked at around $9,000 per container in the quarter.
“Manufacturing capacity ramp-up continues at a brisk pace as domestic producers look to take advantage of the 40% basic customs duty scheduled to be imposed from April 2022. In the second quarter of next year, we can expect to see procurement strategies starting to change drastically as imports become expensive,” added Prabhu.
According to the report, module prices have now been increasing for six consecutive quarters, a trend not seen in the past ten years.
This quarter also saw the largest QoQ increase in large-scale system costs by over 10% attributed to the increase in raw material and component prices.

The chief minister was speaking here on the occasion of the exchange of power agreements with the selected developers for 1,500 MW of solar projects planned in the Agar, Shajapur, and Neemuch districts.
The chief minister added that the State is now self-sufficient in power generation with 22 GW of electricity produced per day from sources including water, coal, wind, and sun.
On the occasion, the union minister for energy and new and renewable energy, R.K. Singh said that the government has enabled the setting up of 1,59,000 kilometers of the electricity grid and has provided electricity to every household up to Leh in Ladakh. Today, the nation can transfer 1,12,000 MW of power per day.
New and Renewable Energy Minister for the State, Hardeep Singh Dang said the 1,500 MW of projects with a private investment of about INR 5,250 crore will start generating electricity by March 2023. 
Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Limited, a joint venture of Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam and Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), is developing solar projects of 550 MW in Agar, 450 MW in Shajapur, and 500 MW in Neemuch in the state.
The Agar solar park project, comprising two units of 350 MW and 200 MW, will span about 1,100 hectares of land. In the reverse auction held on July 12, 2021, Avaada Power won 200 MW with the lowest bid of INR 2.459/kWh. Beam Power Energy secured 350 MW with an INR 2.444 bid.
Shajapur solar park will have three units of 105 MW, 220 MW, and 125 MW set up in an area of about 900 hectares. In the auction held on June 28, NTPC Renewable Energy won 105 MW quoting INR 2.35/kWh, and 220 MW at INR 2.33/kWh. Talettutayi Solar Projects won 125 MW at INR 2.33/kWh.
In Neemuch, Tata Power arm TP Saurya Ltd, Mumbai, secured a total of 330 MW capacity (160 MW with an INR 2.149/kWh bid, and another 170 MW at INR 2.14/kWh). Al Jomaih Energy and Water Company Dubai won another 170 MW with the lowest bid of INR 2.15/kWh.

These assets are spread across three states and have a mix of Central Government and State Government off-takers.
The acquisition is in line with Virescent’s strategy to acquire operational renewable energy assets that have stable long-term cashflows with government counterparties across India.
In May this year, Virescent Infrastructure had announced it had completed the acquisition of 76 MWp of Indian solar assets from Singapore’s Sindicatum Group. These PV assets are also spread across three states and benefit from long-term power purchase agreements with government off-takers.
Focal Energy is backed by a group of international investors, including Pitango Venture Capital, Federmann Group, Migdal Group, and Poalim Capital Markets from Israel, and Swiss impact investor Vital Capital.
With the acquisition of Focal’s 55 MWp assets, Virescent now manages 13 operating projects spread across seven states in India, with >50% exposure to Tier 1 counterparties including the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN), and Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/09/hybrid-wind-solar-generator-for-rooftop-applications/,"HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"DECEMBER 9, 2021",Hybrid wind-solar generator for rooftop applications,"From pv magazine International
French startup Wind my Roof has developed a small-scale hybrid wind-solar power generator for rooftop applications.
The system consists of a 1,500 W wind turbine and two 600 W solar modules. The company said the pairing of the two sources helps maintain a good level of production all year round, while optimizing the use of space on the roof.
The hybrid WindBox system can purportedly produce up to 2,000 kWh of wind energy and up to 800 kWh of photovoltaic energy per year, for a total of 2,800 kWh/year. In addition, the system integrates the same inverter and battery, which results in lower costs, according to the company.
The system requires a rooftop area of 4m² and measures 2.1 meters x 1.6 meters x 2 meters. It weighs 300 kg. It has been tested under extreme climatic conditions and its automatic safety systems can provide resistance to up to 180 km per hour of wind and temperatures down to -15 C. It is equipped with anti-vibration, fixing systems and a hull that makes it silent.
The manufacturer said that 92% of the installation is made in France. It added that a life-cycle assessment (LCA) study is now being certified.
The idea of developing the technology began at the end of 2016, during a course in fluid mechanics at the École des Ponts, where two engineers were studying the recovery of wind energy from buildings. Research shows that only one place on a rooftop is really usable – the ridge of a building. The wind “takes off” above the buildings it hits, after climbing up the facade and accelerating slightly.
On the edge of the roof, the WindBox can recover horizontal and vertical winds, said the company. This also offers good exposure to the sun, while optimizing a rarely used area and leaving space available for traditional solutions, such as more rooftop PV.
The company has installed a prototype on a building in La Défense, in Paris.
“We have international goals, and ambitions especially in Germany,” said Yanis Maacha, a company spokesperson.
The company – with the support of the SolarImpulse Foundation, BPIFrance, and the French environmental agency, Ademe – recently raised €700,000 ($790,280). It is now preparing to launch the installation of its first eight power plants in Rouen, in Normandy.
The company has also secured support from French engineering group Segula Technologies, both in terms of design and production development.
“The energy transition is an essential sector of diversification for our group. This is the challenge for the future that we wish to address,” said Segula Technologies Technical Director Nicolas Fraisse. “Thanks to our HeXplora startup support platform, we were able to support Wind my Roof in the first stages of their production to assemble the first eight WindBox prototypes.”
