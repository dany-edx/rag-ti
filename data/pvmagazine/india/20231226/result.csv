The Indian government has outlined ambitious targets, aiming for 500 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, and has made remarkable progress in expanding its renewable energy capacity.
India currently holds the fourth position globally for installed solar power capacity and in the last five years, the country has seen a monumental increase in its solar installed capacity from 21,651 MW to 70,096 MW in 2023.
A recent study by energy think tank Ember sheds light on India’s remarkable contribution to global solar energy generation. The report, which analyses electricity data from the first half of 2023, reveals that India, alongside the European Union, contributed 12% to the global increase in solar generation during this period.
Globally, solar energy accounted for 5.5% of electricity generation in the first half of 2023, marking a significant 16% increase compared to the same period last year, equivalent to an additional 104 terawatt-hours.
India’s solar growth was even more impressive, with a 26% increase contributing an additional 12 terawatt-hours, outpacing the global average. This substantial growth powered half of the country’s increased electricity demand over the same period, demonstrating the immense potential of solar energy in meeting India’s energy needs.
Notably, 50 countries, including India, set new monthly records for solar generation in the first half of 2023. In May, India itself reached an impressive milestone, further solidifying its position as a major player in the global solar power sector. During this period, India generated a remarkable 7.1% of its electricity from solar sources, underlining the country’s commitment to green energy.
In November 2023, 18 new renewable energy tenders with a cumulative capacity of 15,165 MW were issued. In terms of completed auctions, in November 2023 alone, about 4600 MW RE tenders were auctioned and allotted to various developers.
When it comes to key deals and financing trends, around $167 million was invested in the renewable energy sector last month.
From January to October 2023, about 8.7 GW of solar capacity was added in the country and India’s installed renewable energy capacity is expected to increase to about 170 GW by March 2025 from the level of 132 GW as of October 2023.
The Indian government has demonstrated a robust commitment to advancing solar energy by implementing various strategic initiatives. There has been a reduction in the import tax on solar panels from 40% to 20%. Notably, there has been a reduction in prices across mono, poly, and mono half-cut solar panels.
A reduction in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on solar panels, to 5% from the previously imposed 12% in 2021 has also been advocated by the government.
There has also been a shift in the market from traditional on-grid systems towards hybrid solar solutions, signalling an increased demand for hybrid solar technology.
The Union Minister for New & Renewable Energy and Power has informed that as of 30.06.2023, a cumulative solar power capacity of 70,096 MW has been installed in the country. The Minister informed that the country has an estimated solar power potential of 7,48,990 MW. Hence, the potential of solar energy is not fully tapped, so far.
The Government is making efforts to harness the available potential through various schemes and programs. Several steps have been taken by the Government to promote renewable energy, including solar energy, in the country in 2023. These include permitting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 100% through the automatic route, an influential move to encourage international investment. Waiving of inter-state transmission system (ISTS) charges for the inter-state sale of solar and wind power for projects commissioned by June 30, 2025, aims to bolster inter-state renewable energy transactions.
The declaration of trajectory for Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) until 2029-30 sets a clear roadmap for renewable energy integration.
Additionally, the establishment of standards for solar photovoltaic systems/devices and the creation of a Project Development Cell for facilitating investments showcase India’s commitment to fostering solar energy infrastructure.
Further, the government’s directive for power dispatch against a Letter of Credit (LC) or advance payment ensures prompt payment to renewable energy generators, enhancing financial security.
The introduction of the Green Energy Open Access Rules 2022 and the Green Term Ahead Market (GTAM) fortify platforms for the sale of renewable energy, notably solar power, through exchanges, reflecting a comprehensive approach toward propelling the nation’s solar energy agenda.
India is steadfast in its pursuit of reaching a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 and ascending to the position of the world’s third-largest economy by 2030. This renewed drive is accompanied by a strong emphasis on curbing the nation’s carbon footprint and fulfilling Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
To propel a green revolution, the government has outlined an ambitious objective of achieving 500 GW of installed renewable energy by 2030. This goal involves the installation of 280 GW of solar power and 140 GW of wind power generation capacity, marking a significant leap toward a sustainable future.
Accelerating the shift toward clean energy, the government has implemented numerous measures and favorable policies to encourage the domestic production of renewable energy. As part of this initiative, the government unveiled a Rs 2.44 lakh crore transmission plan. The plan is designed to facilitate the country’s energy transition and involves the development of 50,890 circuit km transmission lines and 4,33,575 MVA substation capacity. These infrastructural enhancements are poised to significantly boost domestic production within the industry.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/26/thin-film-solar-is-the-future-of-agrivoltaics/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"DECEMBER 26, 2023",Thin-film solar is the future of agrivoltaics,"From pv magazine USA
As solar power has been developed and popularized across the globe over the last several decades, the industry has given way to more recent innovation that allows for higher efficiency in irregular places: thin-film solar cells. These lightweight, flexible cells are capable of attachment to surfaces of nearly any shape or design, thanks to their flexibility, while requiring minimal structural supports, due to their light weight. With this technology, solar power is able to be harnessed in a variety of applications and places where previously thought impossible, due to the rigid structure and heavy nature of traditional solar panels.
And now, thin-film solar modules are ready to take on their next challenge: agrivoltaics.
As the impacts of climate change worsen each year, domestic farmers have begun to struggle to keep their crops healthy, as the sun beats down on them with punishingly-high temperatures. Thankfully, a new use of solar technology, known as agrivoltaics (APV), have come to help.
Farmers need elevated coverage to provide partial shade for their struggling crops and solar modules need ample space to soak in the sunlight to generate power. APV combines these two needs, by placing arrays of solar modules above areas of crop growth, to provide partial shade, which reduces sunburn on the land, reduces water evaporation, and insulates the crops from extreme cold and extreme heat, all while giving farmers the primary benefit of solar power utilization: a second revenue stream through power generation.
And now, thin-film solar PV is ready to supercharge this powerful relationship.
Current challenges facing agrivoltaics 
If you were to set up your agrivoltaic system with traditional, rigid solar panels, it’s possible you will run into some logistical issues. Traditional panels are quite heavy, requiring substantial support structures, and are so large that they provide more shade than necessary for most crops, and can stifle their health and growth. The goal of a balanced APV system is to provide just the right amount of shade that keeps the land from dehydration while also allowing the proper amount of sunlight to shine through and help the crops grow. Unfortunately, the rigid nature of traditional solar panels limits the ability to strike this delicate balance.
Most current APV installations that utilize rigid panels will typically consist of a row of solar panels next to a row of crops, taking about half of the land out of production, and make crop care and harvesting quite difficult. Heavy machinery employed in standard maintenance and harvesting processes often must be replaced by expensive manual labor to avoid damage to the solar system.
Lastly, the electrical conduit for traditional solar modules is installed underground; this disables flood irrigation and therefore can limit the variety of crops that are able to be grown in symbiosis with a traditional solar array. If only certain crops can work within the module, then it may end up not being a good fit for an otherwise interested farmer.
Key benefits of thin-film for agrivoltaics
In contrast with traditional panels, thin-film solar cells are much more adaptable to these agricultural situations, thanks to their flexible, lightweight design. Thin-film agrivoltaics overcome the challenges of their rigid, heavy counterparts by consisting of a series of solar crossbars covered in solar that are elevated high above the protected crops, which allows for:
Agrivoltaics, using thin-film solar technology, allow for the proper distribution of shade and sunlight onto the ground beneath it.
The use of thin-film solar cells also allows for greater energy savings, a healthier crop yield, and increased water savings.
Perhaps best of all, is the ability for thin-film modules to continue functioning after being struck, impaled or damaged. Climate change continues to bring about dangerous, unpredictable weather phenomena, where high winds carrying various items and debris is common. When a traditional solar cell suffers an impact, its glass coating is often shattered, creating a costly mess, the need for swift, expensive repair, and the total lack of energy production until it is properly fixed. But thin-film solar cells don’t have these same drawbacks; if a cell is punctured or damaged by outside forces, the rest of the cell will continue to function just fine, leaving only the small, damaged area in need of repair, rather than taking the whole array out of commission.
The future of thin-film for agrivoltaics
As more and more domestic farmers turn to agrivoltaics as a viable solution to increase revenues per acre, reduce on site energy costs and to bolster crop yields, we will start to see a greater embrace of thin-film solar to get the job done.
While there are plenty of applications and situations where large, traditional, rectangular solar panels are the optimal choice for solar power generation, agrivoltaics is an area that requires the flexible nature of thin-film solar technology to deftly handle the delicate relationship between crops and their need for shade and sunlight. Soon, farmers across the nation will begin to see not only the lucrative energy-saving benefits of thin-film agrivoltaics, but also the crop health benefits of it as well.
