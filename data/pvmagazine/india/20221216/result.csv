Mehta also served as the chairman of Global Solar Council and made outstanding contributions in India, which today ranks amongst the top 5 solar countries in the world. A national scholar throughout his academic career, Mehta spent nearly five decades in both corporate and government sector including Tata Steel, Essar, Reliance Industries, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited
An expert in concept-to-commissioning of high-technology projects, Mehta contributed to steel, petroleum, natural gas, and solar energy sectors with an emphasis on sustainable development. He previously served in the 7-member steering committee of IRENA Coalition for Action and was presently chairing the International Solar Alliance’s Corporate Advisory Group.

(IREDA) has sanctioned an INR 4,444.71 crore ($537 million) loan to SJVN Green Energy (an arm of SJVN Ltd) for its 1 GW solar power project in Rajasthan. The two companies recently signed the loan agreement for the project, which will come up in Bikaner.
The IREDA funded project will connect to 400/220 KV substation near Bikaner.
SJVN bagged the project through the tender floated by IREDA under the second phase of the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme. It won the project by quoting a viability gap funding (VGF) requirement.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/16/adani-appoints-eil-as-owners-engineer-for-polysilicon-project/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",Adani appoints EIL as owner’s engineer for polysilicon project,"Engineers India Ltd (EIL) announced this week it has been appointed as owner’s engineer for Adani Group’s 30,000 MTPA polysilicon and 500 MTPA monosilane project. It landed the contract from Mundra Solar Technology, a group company of Adani Enterprises.
Polysilicon is the primary component for manufacturing photovoltaic panels. Globally, polysilicon production is concentrated in China and the US. Monosilane (SiH4) is a gaseous compound used for production of polysilicon.
India’s ambitious solar power generation target implies that the country would need significant PV component manufacturing capacities to meet the resulting demand. However, the nation lacks polysilicon manufacturing capacity and is dependent on imports.
As part of its strategic plan, Adani Group targets 10 GW of polysilicon-to-solar module manufacturing capacity up and running by 2025. The group, which already manufactures cells and modules, recently unveiled its silicon ingot made in India.
“[Polysilicon production] would be a step towards realizing the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. This would also contribute towards nation’s target of Net Zero by 2070,” stated EIL.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/16/color-sensing-tech-to-remove-dirt-from-solar-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,PV MODULE CLEANER,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",Color-sensing tech to remove dirt from solar panels,"From pv magazine International
Researchers from the University of Johannesburg in South Africa have developed a cleaning system for solar modules based on the TCS3200 color sensor and the Arduino Uno open-source microcontroller.
The TCS3200 is a programmable color light-to-frequency converter equipped with white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate an object’s surface for color detection, with the object reflecting light to the sensor to determine color intensities.
“TCS3200 can detect the color of the light incident and output square waves with 50% duty cycles,” the scientists said. “Compared to other scientific instruments, this sensor is reasonably at a low cost.”
The microcontroller is the key element of the entire system, which also includes a 46 V motor driver, two 12 V DC motors, a charge controller, a rechargeable battery, a voltage regulator, and a roller brush.
“The roller brush provides a sweeping motion for cleaning the panel surfaces by spinning at a higher speed than the movement wheels,” said the research team.
The system also uses Arduino IDE software to write, compile and upload sketch codes for the system. It includes the connecting rods, the case shielding the electronic components, and the brush-driving devices.
The system can detect dirt on solar panels by measuring colors, calibrating colors, and comparing measured results with reference results.
“When the controller detects that the humidity threshold level signal has reached 80%, the motor driver will turn on to clean the solar panel,” the academics explained. “Motor A of the two DC motors in the setup moves the color sensor across the solar panel for color monitoring, while Motor B drives the cleaning robot to remove dirt.”
The group estimates annual system costs at €1.50 ($1.60) per panel, with capital and maintenance costs accounting for most of the associated costs.
“In one minute, up to 95% of the dust on the PV panel surfaces can be removed by this device,” claimed the group.
The scientists described the new cleaning system in “Solar panel surface dirt detection and removal based on Arduino color recognition,” which was recently published in MethodsX.
“The researched project is an improvement over existing systems since it eliminates many of the drawbacks, such as the need for water, manual cleaning, the need for labor,” the scientists concluded. “The system can operate for many years before requiring maintenance.”
