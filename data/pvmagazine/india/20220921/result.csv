https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/21/amazon-announces-420-mw-of-utility-scale-solar-projects-in-india/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Amazon announces 420 MW of utility-scale solar projects in India,"U.S. e-commerce group Amazon has announced its first utility-scale renewable energy projects in India – three solar farms located in Rajasthan. These include a 210 MW project to be developed by Indian developer ReNew Power, a 100 MW project to be developed by Amp Energy India, and a 110 MW project to be developed by Brookfield Renewable. 
“Combined, these solar farms can generate 1,076,000 MWh of renewable energy per year, enough to power over 360,000 average-sized households in New Delhi annually,” stated the company. 
Amazon will also add 23 new solar rooftop projects on its fulfillment centers across 14 cities in India, which have the capacity to generate an additional 4.09 MW of renewable energy. This brings the total number of its solar rooftop projects in India to 41, with 19.7 MW of renewable energy capacity, which will contribute to powering Amazon’s fulfillment network in India. 
“We are bringing new wind and solar projects online to power our offices, fulfillment centers, data centers, and stores, which collectively serve millions of customers globally, and we are on a path to reach 100% renewable energy across our entire business by 2025,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO of Amazon Web Services. 
Amazon’s 210 MW deal with ReNew Power in Rajasthan is one of the largest solar corporate power purchase agreements by a technology company in India — and the largest single business-to-business (B2B) project that ReNew Power is developing in India. 
Amazon also announced that it is expanding its renewable energy portfolio globally, with an additional 2.7 GW of clean energy capacity across 71 new renewable energy projects. This includes the company’s first renewable energy project in South America – a solar farm in Brazil – and its first solar farm in Poland. 
Once fully operational, Amazon’s global renewable energy portfolio will generate 50,000 GWh of clean energy, which is the equivalent amount of electricity needed to power 4.6 million U.S. homes each year. 
As the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally, Amazon now has 379 renewable energy projects across 21 countries, including 154 wind and solar farms and 225 rooftop solar projects, representing 18.5 GW of renewable energy capacity. In the Asia-Pacific region, the company now has a total of 57 renewable energy projects. By the end of 2021, the company had reached 85% renewable energy across its business.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/21/tamil-nadu-could-lower-carbon-emissions-by-over-36-million-tonnes-with-5-10-conversion-to-ev-use/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,EVS,HIGHLIGHTS,TAMIL NADU",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Tamil Nadu could lower carbon emissions by over 36 million tonnes with 5-10% conversion to EV use,"A new study by Climate Trends shows that the Indian state of Tamil Nadu could offset 36-38 million tonnes of carbon emissions by converting 5-10% of new vehicle sales (two-, three- and four-wheelers) during 2022-30 to ‘electric’. 
The study “Carbon emission savings in Tamil Nadu’s road transport by 2030 through electrification” considers two target scenarios. If 5% of all vehicle sales till 2030 are converted to electric, Tamil Nadu can save 36.53 million tonnes of carbon emissions. As per this target, Tamil Nadu can have close to 3.59 million EVs on the road across two-, three-, and four-wheelers. 
If 10% of newly registered vehicles during 2022-30 are converted to electric, Tamil Nadu can save 38.76 million tonnes of carbon emissions. As per this target, Tamil Nadu could have close to 3.86 million EVs on road. 
The study shows that if no vehicles are converted to electric, the total new ICE vehicles on the road would emit close to 387 million tonnes of carbon, considering the average number of kilometers covered by them in India in their lifetime.
Tamil Nadu is among the first few states to announce an electric vehicle policy in 2019. It accounts for around 35% of all investments in e-mobility in India. 
“While the e-mobility industry is growing well, the sales of electric vehicles could do with a boost,” states the report. 
In 2021, Tamil Nadu had the third highest registered EVs in the country, but by August 2022, it slipped to the 6th position, as per Vahan data. As the state aims to release a revised EV policy, the Climate Trends report makes a strong case for why the policy should also focus on increasing the number of EVs on its roads. 
“Reducing emissions from transport and making that happen through electrification will play a very significant role in India’s road to net zero emissions. To make this real, action will need to be at the state level,” says Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends. “Tamil Nadu is already a leader in installed renewable energy capacity in the country through progressive policies and schemes. It is also the hub for automobile companies. A targeted approach to transport electrification, through investments, policies and government attention, will have a major contribution towards reduction in carbon emissions for the state.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/21/hydrogen-to-play-limited-role-in-building-energy-supply/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Hydrogen to play limited role in building energy supply,"From pv magazine Global
A global energy turnaround without hydrogen is unthinkable. The cost and efficiency of hydrogen make alternatives appear more attractive in many sectors. In the building sector, for example, hydrogen will in principle not be used.
That is the verdict of a study that originated from the HyPat joint project. The Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI, along with other institutes, including the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the German Energy Agency (Dena), examined 40 recently published studies on energy systems and hydrogen scenarios and used 300 reduction scenarios from the sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to determine a range of global hydrogen demand.
According to their forecasts, a scenario in which the greenhouse gas reduction is more than 80 percent by 2050 will require between 4 and 15 petawatt hours of hydrogen and synthesis products such as ammonia and methanol. One petawatt hour is equal to 1 million gigawatt hours.
Calculated on the basis of global final energy demand, that is 4 to 12%. The consumption of hydrogen is subject to strong regional differences. In relative terms, the EU will become the main consumer of hydrogen. The study calculates that up to 14% of the final energy requirement could be covered by hydrogen. In China, the authors assume a share of up to 4% in final energy consumption.
Calculated in absolute numbers, however, the relationship looks different. The major share of the EU will only lead to a consumption of 0.3 to 1 petawatt hour per year. In China, the demand will be between 0.6 and 4 petawatt hours per year.
“Our evaluations underline that hydrogen will play an important role in future global climate policy — but it will not be the dominant final energy source in the future,” says Martin Wietschel, professor at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and head of the Competence Center for Energy Technologies and Energy Systems at Fraunhofer ISI. “In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally, measures to save energy and direct electrification based on renewable electricity, such as through heat pumps, electric vehicles or in heating networks, are seen as the most important levers. Hydrogen, on the other hand, plays a relevant role in certain application areas in which other technologies cannot be implemented technically or economically.”
Broken down by sector, mobility shows the highest demand in absolute figures as well as relative to total demand. The study assumes that by 2050 around 16% of global energy in the mobility sector will be covered by hydrogen and its synthetic products. The authors forecast a share of 14% for the Chinese market. The EU stands out in this sector with an expected share of 28%.
The use of hydrogen in road traffic offers short “charging times” and long ranges compared to electric cars. However, the overall efficiency of fuel cell vehicles leaves a lot to be desired at just 34%. That is nevertheless still well above the 14% efficiency of vehicles that are fueled with synthetic fuels. Electric cars achieve a value of 77% in this metric.
The use of hydrogen is more conceivable for heavy-duty transport, since the weight of the batteries becomes a problem in this area of application. In addition, the long loading times are not always compatible with the way logistics companies work. In any case, hydrogen and above all synthetic products will be used in air traffic and shipping.
These technical and logistical uncertainties sometimes lead to very large bandwidths in the hydrogen demand in the 40 studies examined for the mobility sector. As a result, investments in production, transport and consumers are still avoided. In Europe, the individual studies predicted a hydrogen share of 13 to 36%. For China it was between 10% and 19%.
Compared to the mobility sector, lower demand is forecast for the industrial sector. However, unlike in mobility, there are often no alternatives here. Especially in the iron and steel industry, as well as in basic chemistry, it will not work without hydrogen, ammonia and methanol.
However, this does not apply to all areas of industry. When it comes to the provision of heat, for example, there are even greater uncertainties. This is mainly due to the available alternatives. According to the study, by 2050 hydrogen will account for between 2 and 9% of the world’s total energy requirements in the industry. Here, too, there are strong regional differences. The majority of the studies examined expects a share of 3 to 16% for Europe in 2050. Individual studies even forecast a share of 38%. In China, on the other hand, the proportion will only be between 1 and 4% in 2050.
The more alternatives there are to hydrogen, the lower its use. This applies in particular to the building sector. According to the study, the share of building energy consumption in 2050 is likely to be less than 2%. Up to 1.7% is expected in the EU. Globally, the share is likely to be 1.6%. In China, only 0.5% of building energy requirements are probably covered by hydrogen.
The low use of hydrogen in the building sector is due to the other ways to save emissions, such as direct electrification with heat pumps and infrared heating. Alternatives are also significantly more efficient than fuel cell heaters, which are only 57% efficient. Even heating systems that burn compressed hydrogen directly for heat use only achieve an efficiency of 64%. Electric instantaneous water heaters, on the other hand, achieve 95%. The authors of the study assumed an efficiency of 300% for heat pumps.
