Naveen Patnaik, chief Minister of Odisha, laid the foundation stone of the plant. ReNew E-Fuels is developing the project with an investment of INR 22,000 crore (over $2.65 billion). The project is estimated to provide employment to more than 4,000 people.
ACME Group and IGX will explore opportunities of collaboration in developing green hydrogen and ammonia projects in India. The two parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) recently. The partnership will span the green hydrogen and ammonia value chain, from production to logistics and supply to the industrial customers for use in a range of applications.
Wood Mackenzie said in a new report that global policymakers need to prioritize regulations and subsidies based on the carbon intensity of hydrogen, rather than just its color. “Because of its potential to deliver almost carbon-free hydrogen, green hydrogen is generating the most industry interest, but it is important exporters and developers look more closely at the full value chain as more regulation is put in place,” said Wood Mackenzie Principal Analyst Flor De La Cruz, the author of the report. With more than 40% of the announced project capacity targeting exports, the research consultancy said that it is important to understand hydrogen’s full life-cycle emissions, including the processing and transport of ammonia. It argued that exporters will also need to focus on technologies to reduce emissions so they can comply with varying regulations.
IDTechEx said that the materials market for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells could exceed $8 billion by 2034, with on-road vehicles, marine applications, and zero-emission trains driving growth. “The PEM fuel cell for transportation market is set to grow at a CAGR of 28% between 2024 and 2034, but there are key questions to be answered with respect to the components used in fuel cells,” said Conor O’Brien, senior technology analyst for IDTechEx.
Thyssenkrupp Steel has officially launched a call for tenders to supply hydrogen to its first direct reduction plant. “The hydrogen requirement is being put out to tender in a transparent and broad-based procedure, with the aim of operating the direct reduction plant fully on hydrogen by as early as 2029,” said the German company. It said it is organizing the call for tender in coordination with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection (BMWK), which, together with the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, is  providing about €2 billion ($2.15 million) of funding for the plant project and the associated hydrogen ramp-up.
The European Commission said that a business mission will explore investment opportunities in Mauritania in March. The delegation will follow up on discussions from the green hydrogen roundtable held in Nouakchott on Feb, 8.
P2X Solutions has been selected to develop a project for a hydrogen production plant that Oulun Energia plans to build in the Laanila industrial area in Oulu, Finland. According to the preliminary plan, the project will include a 100 MW electrolysis plant, a carbon capture facility, hydrogen and carbon dioxide storage capacity, and a processing plant whose final product could be methane or methanol. Enersense, which holds an 18.5% stake in P2X Solutions, said an investment decision will likely be made in fall 2025, with the plant to be ready by 2028 at the earliest.
The Galician Association of Metal Industries and Associated Technologies has said that the Hydrogen PERTE program has selected the Atlantic Wind Supercluster of Galicia, Asturias, and Cantabria, along with about 20 partners, to develop a system that will use electricity from offshore wind farms for hydrogen and renewable ammonia production. The project, funded with €7.7 million from Spain’s Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism through IDAE, will deploy a floating barge at the Port of Santander by the end of the year for on-site transformation of offshore wind into fuel for maritime transport and industrial purposes.

The scope of services includes preparation of a detailed project report comprising both technical and commercial analysis to understand the attractiveness, feasibility, risks and mitigation plans related with setting up of the solar power park.
TREDCO Rajasthan Ltd is a 74:26 joint venture between THDC India Ltd and Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corp. Ltd, which is going to develop 10 GW of solar power parks in a phased manner in Rajasthan. For the development of 10 GW solar parks, TREDCO has identified around 29,563 acres of government land in different villages such as Bodana, Motigarh, Bikampur, Mehrasar, Karnisar Bhatiyan, Bhanawatawala, Soorasar, Ramsara, Sardarpura in the Bikaner and Jaisalmer districts of Rajasthan. Presently, TREDCO plans to develop a 1,292 MW solar power park under Mode8 scheme of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), government of India. The MNRE has given approval for development of this solar park.

Solar recycling company Solarcycle is investing an estimated $344 million in a solar glass manufacturing facility in Cedartown, a city in the US state of Georgia.
Billed as the first of its kind in the country, the facility will use recycled materials from retired solar panels to make new solar glass. The plant will be the first of Solarcycle’s facilities to manufacture glass in addition to recycling solar panels.
Solarcycle said the new facility will position it as one of the first manufacturers of specialized glass for crystalline-silicon photovoltaics in the United States, with the capacity to make 5 GW to 6 GW of solar glass every year.
The glass will be sold directly back to domestic solar manufacturers, said Solarcycle, filling a critical gap in the country’s supply chain to build more solar panels in America.
With construction work set to begin later this year, the facility is expected to be operational in 2026. It is set to create 600 full-time jobs in Polk County.
Solarcycle currently operates two solar panel recycling facilities in the United States. The company claims its recycling technology allows it to extract up to 95% of the value of a solar panel’s materials, such as silver, silicon, copper and aluminum and to recycle or repurpose panels for new uses.
Earlier this week, Solarcycle said it had entered into a partnership with solar module manufacturer Qcells. The agreement will see Qcells’ solar panels recycled after decommissioning.
The company recently opened a new headquarters in Mesa, Arizona.

The partners completed the deposition of perovskite solution on a flexible substrate measuring 76.2 cm x 6,096 cm using standard manufacturing processes, equipment, and environmental conditions. The novel coating tool and process is dubbed Verde Slot Coating.
“Verde Slot Coating achieves the scalability associated with slot-die coating, while significantly accelerating iteration cycles and film optimization,” Verde Technologies CEO, Skylar Bagdon, told pv magazine.
“This means we can make rapid progress on a small scale but unlike spin-coating or blade coating, the findings are transferable to large commercial roll-to-roll systems, as the pilot with Verico makes clear,” said Bagdon.
The Vermont-based company intends to develop single junction and all thin-film tandem perovskite solar technologies. Its perovskite cell technology has reportedly a lab-scale power conversion efficiency of above 21%.
Looking ahead, Bagdon said, “Verde’s next phase of development will be focused on outdoor testing of modules with early customers.” He added that the team will be doing testing with the Perovskite PV Accelerator for Commercializing Technologies (PACT) consortium and at new solar research and testing facility recently opened in Burlington, Vermont.
The company’s commercial roadmap is to initially target repowering projects, typically utility scale projects exchanging end-of-life panels with higher-performing panels, before expanding to other lightweight PV segments, such as “large commercial metal and membrane” rooftops.
The company was able to tap into national U.S. research and development programs. For example, last summer Verde entered a collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Northern Illinois University (NIU) which gives it access to some of NREL’s perovskite breakthroughs, such as lead sequestration and active encapsulation.
Verde also has an exclusive partnership with the University of Toledo to commercialize its perovskite cell technology with promising stability performance.
Most recently, the company was the grand prize winner in the latest round of the US Department of Energy’s Perovskite Startup Prize for its progress, focus on domestic solar manufacturing, scalability and collaboration , according to Bagdon.
