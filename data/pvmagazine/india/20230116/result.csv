The developer won this capacity under SECI’s 1.2 GW hybrid wind-solar tender (Tranche-V). 
Amp Energy will develop the capacity, connected to the interstate transmission system (ISTS), on a build-own-operate basis. As per the tender document, it can set up the project at its chosen location anywhere in India. 
Currently, Amp has a 1 GWp+ portfolio of utility-scale projects across solar, hybrid, and floating solar segments. With the signing of the latest PPA, Amp Energy India’s hybrid portfolio has swelled to 600 MWp.

SAEL currently has more than 20 projects, both operating and under construction, in solar and agri waste-to-energy space. It has developed a business model where it purchases paddy crop residue/paddy straw from farmers to produce energy at its biomass power plants. 
At the biomass plants, paddy straw, which otherwise would be burned, leading to degradation of soil quality and air pollution, is efficiently converted to energy through an advanced boiler mechanism.
SAEL also installs biomass plants for other customers on a build-operate-transfer basis.
SAEL aims to grow its portfolio to 3 GW over the next five years by adding 100 MW of new biomass and 400 MW of new solar power generation capacity annually in addition to its existing portfolio of 600 MW. Norfund’s investment will help it in the implementation and scaling of the projects.
Every year, farmers in Northern India burn agri stubble in their fields to remove paddy residue, resulting in severe air pollution with devastating health effects in the region. Fine particle matter (PM 2.5) levels rise with the yearly burning of crop stubble and contribute to some of the world’s worst air quality. High levels of PM 2.5 have been linked to health effects such as asthma and decreased lung function, and the burning of crop stubble also contributes to reduced soil quality, requiring increased use of chemicals which causes other health issues.
“By collecting the crop stubble to be used as fuel in our waste-to-energy plants, we contribute to combating one of our nation’s greatest health issues. At the same time, we are creating local employment and generating extra income for farmers and local entrepreneurs,” said Jasbir Awla, chairman and managing director of SAEL Limited.

The project is being developed by SJVN’s wholly-owned subsidiary, SJVN Green Energy Ltd (SGEL), on a build-own-operate basis. Larsen & Toubro Ltd is tasked with engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) of the PV plant.
SJVN secured the project at INR 3.26 ($0.039)/kWh in a tariff-based competitive bidding and reverse auction by REWA Ultra Mega Solar Ltd. The power purchase agreement was signed between SGEL, RUMSL, and M.P. Power Management Co. Ltd (MPPMCL).
Nand Lal Sharma, chairman and managing director of SJVN, stated that an investment of INR 650 crore will be made on this project. As per the contract agreement, the project is scheduled to be commissioned by December 2023. 
Once operational, the project is expected to generate 196 million units of electricity in the first year and about 4,570 million units over 25 years.

Amara Raja is executing this 306 MWp ground-mounted utility-scale power plant spread over 1,850 hectares (approximately the equivalent of 3,500 contiguous football fields).
Nextracker’s optimized bifacial tracker design has been proven to increase energy yield as validated by third-party test laboratory PVEL in a seminal bifacial and solar tracker white paper.
The announcement follows the upward trend for the deployment of solar trackers combined with bifacial module technology in India due to falling module prices and increased tracker design efficiencies.

It commissioned 10 MWp at Seraikela Kharsawan, Jharkhand, and 30 MWp (two plants of 15 MWp each) at Banka, Bihar. 
Oriano executed the projects on a turnkey basis, with its work scope encompassing design, engineering, supply of balance of plant equipment, erection, commissioning, testing, and operation and maintenance. Module supply and power evacuation were carried out by Shree Cement Ltd. 
The projects employ fixed-tilt module mounting structures and string inverters and have the provision of a fully automatic robotic cleaning system. Power evacuation is done at 11 kV and 33 kV levels at Jharkhand and Bihar sites, respectively.
Oriano develops, builds, owns, and operates utility-scale solar energy projects. It also has a strong portfolio in the EPC segment. As of Dec 31, 2022, Oriano had a development and EPC portfolio exceeding 1 GWp, out of which 500+ MWp is operational across India and the balance is under construction and development stage. Additionally, Oriano has currently more than 250+ MWp under asset management. It expects to achieve a 1+ GW asset management portfolio by December this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/16/cooling-solar-modules-with-vacuum-pressure/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 16, 2023",Cooling solar modules with vacuum pressure,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Politeknik Negeri Ujung Pandang in Indonesia have proposed the use of vacuum pressure to reduce the operating temperature of PV modules.
“Our vacuum technique is still in the development stage,” researcher Suryanto Suryanto told pv magazine. “but our plan is to bring it to the market at some point.”
The passive cooling method involves a casing to apply negative pressure around the PV module. Negative pressure is pressure that is less than the existing atmospheric pressure and is a condition under which the air pressure is lower in one place in comparison to another.
“If the pressure of a room is lowered, it will cause the room temperature to decrease,” the scientists explained.
They applied this to a solar module a casing frame made of board material with a thickness of 18 mm. The casing is covered with 5 mm glass – resistant enough to withstand negative pressure. It uses a valve to allow air to be sucked from the casing by a vacuum pump and a pressure sensor to measure the pressure conditions in the PV casing chamber.
The researchers used a temperature sensor to monitor the top and bottom surfaces of the PV module and a temperature logger to collect all data. They compared the performance of the cooled panel with that of a reference module without cooling at an ambient air temperature of around 35 C to 36 C.
They found that the cooled module had a current ranging from 0.89 A to 0.91 A, while the reference module was just 0.62 A. They found that the temperature at the top of the PV panel under vacuum pressure reached a temperature of between 29 C and 30 C, while that of the uncooled module was between 44 C and 45 C. ”
Suryanto said that adding this cooling technique to a PV system could result in an additional cost of $30/kW to $50/kW.
“Regarding plans for mass production we will seriously consider them in the near future, of course with the cooperation of interested industry parties,” he concluded. “A further investigation on the tech costs should be conducted in future work.”
