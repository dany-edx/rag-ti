Shell Overseas Investment, an arm of Shell, shall acquire Sprng Energy from UK investor Actis, which owns Sprng through its Mauritius-based arm Solenergi Power. 
Shell Overseas Investment has agreed to acquire 100% of Solenergi Power for $1.55 billion and, with it, the Sprng Energy group of companies. 
Established by Actis in 2017, Sprng has more than 2.9 GWp of assets in India (2.1 GWp operating and 0.8 GWp contracted) with a further 7.5 GWp of renewable energy projects in the pipeline. It supplies solar and wind power to electricity distribution companies in India. 
Shell has 1 GW of renewable generation capacity in operation globally. The acquisition of Sprng Energy’ solar and wind assets will triple its present renewable capacity in operation. 
The deal also positions Shell as one of the first movers in building a truly integrated energy transition business in India. In India, its gas business (Shell Energy) serves customers through a fully-owned and integrated value chain. It has also invested in companies like Husk Power Systems and Cleantech Solar Pte Ltd.
Wael Sawan, Shell’s Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions Director, believes the acquisition will enable Shell to become a leader across the power value chain in a rapidly growing market where electrification on a massive scale and strong demand for renewables are driving the energy transition.
“Sprng Energy generates cash, has an excellent team, strong and proven development track record and a healthy growth pipeline. Sprng Energy’s strengths can combine with Shell India’s thriving customer-facing gas and downstream businesses to create even more opportunities for growth,” he said.
Sprng Energy will retain its existing brand and operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell within Shell’s Renewables and Energy Solutions Integrated Power business.

BSUL is a joint venture of state-run hydropower producer NHPC Limited and Uttar Pradesh New & Renewable Energy Development Agency. It has been appointed by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to implement the 1.2 GW Jalaun Solar Park under its Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Park (UMREPP) scheme.
The proposed park spans two locations at the tehsils of Orai and Madhogarh in the Jalaun district, with areas of 1,213 ha and 1208 ha, respectively. Solar projects are to be developed in 100 MW blocks at both locations.
BSUL will procure power from the solar project developers at a fixed tariff not exceeding INR 2.75/kWh, considering all transmission losses. It will provide land plots/blocks for a capacity not less than 100 MW, each having infrastructural facilities as per the UMREPP Scheme. 
The selected parties will develop solar power projects on the allocated land blocks and operate the same for 25 years from the commercial operation date.

The company won the project by quoting the lowest bid in an online auction conducted by state-run power producer NTPC. 
The solar plant, located at Bhadla Solar Park, spans an area of 525.39 acres and comprises four sections of 65 MW each. Jakson Group will be responsible for continuously monitoring the site for preventive and corrective maintenance issues, including plant performance, regular upkeep of various plant components and equipment, warranty claims, spare parts inventory, and various other onsite ground services. 
“With the help of technologically advanced methods, the company will commence the Operation and Maintenance services from May 13, 2022. This will generate employment opportunities & improve the livelihood of locals,” stated the company. 
The solar plant was initially installed and commissioned by Jakson Group along with Tata Power Solar and Vikram Solar. It has been commercially operational since its commissioning on March 25, 2017.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/29/energy-vault-ntpc-sign-mou-for-gravity-based-energy-storage/,"HIGHLIGHTS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA,SWITZERLAND",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 29, 2022","Energy Vault, NTPC sign MoU for gravity-based energy storage","India’s largest power generating utility NTPC Limited is looking to deploy Switzerland-based Energy Vault’s EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and software solutions to support its clean energy transition. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) forging a long-term strategic partnership between the two parties was signed recently.
NTPC will deploy Energy Vault’s EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and software solutions based on the outcome of a joint feasibility study with Energy Vault.
Energy Vault’s EVx storage system is comparable to pumped hydro, using grid-scale renewable energy when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-ton blocks on a six-arm crane tower, rather than water, up to a height. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the blocks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
According to the company, there is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time.
The NTPC and Energy Vault collaboration will also see the beneficial utilization of coal ash to manufacture composite blocks for Energy Vault’s gravity-based energy storage system, promoting a circular economy.
Robert Piconi, chairman, co-founder, and CEO of Energy Vault, said, “Energy Vault’s mission is to make sustainable, carbon-free energy a reality, and this announcement marks further advancement towards that goal with the expansion into one of the largest global markets for energy. Our collaboration with NTPC builds upon previously announced commercial expansions across multiple continents as we transitioned to a public company earlier this year.”
Gurdeep Singh, chairman and managing director of NTPC, said, “As a large, integrated power producer, it is critical for NTPC to have a diverse clean energy portfolio to decarbonize India’s economy. We have enhanced our renewable capacity addition targets to spearhead India’s energy transition goals, and we are focusing on solar, wind, RTC (round-the-clock), and hybrid projects to achieve the targets. The collaboration with Energy Vault will help NTPC further its energy transition goals through a sustainable approach by way of utilizing coal ash for manufacturing of composite blocks. Accordingly, this collaboration will also promote a circular economy.”
