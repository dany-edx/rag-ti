It has signed the agreement to acquire the stake from International Finance Corporation (a member of the World Bank Group) and IFC GIF Investment.
Founded in 2008, Azure Power has a cumulative 7 GW of solar portfolio, including 2 GW operational and 5 GW under construction or awarded.
“This agreement to invest in Azure Power demonstrates OMERS strong global interest in high-quality renewable power and energy transition assets, as well as our interest in India as an investment destination and Asia-Pacific more broadly,” said Annesley Wallace, Executive Vice President and Global Head of OMERS Infrastructure. “This transaction directly supports our mission of building a strong portfolio of well-run assets that will help pay pensions to our members over the long term,” she added.
The transaction in Azure would mark OMERS Infrastructure’s second direct infrastructure investment in India, following its 2019 investment in the IndInfravit Trust, which holds a portfolio of 13 operational toll road concessions in India. 
“In support of our goal of prudently diversifying OMERS investments across global markets, we will continue to explore additional promising opportunities in India and throughout Asia-Pacific,” said Prateek Maheshwari, Managing Director, Asia, OMERS Infrastructure. 
OMERS Infrastructure’s global renewable energy holdings include Leeward Renewable Energy, a growth-oriented renewable energy company that owns and operates a portfolio of 22 renewable energy facilities across nine U.S. states, totaling more than 2 GW of installed capacity. Leeward is headquartered in Dallas, Texas.
The transaction is expected to close in early August. Ambit Private Limited acted as financial advisor to OMERS Infrastructure.
Azure Power is backed by several long-term investors, including Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Helion Venture Partners, Société de Promotion et de Participation pour la Coopération Économique (PROPARCO), and Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/03/indian-roofs-offer-fastest-energy-payback-on-silicon-solar-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MONO PERC,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA,WORLD",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 3, 2021",India offers fastest energy payback on silicon solar rooftop systems,"The latest version of the Photovoltaics Report produced by German research body the Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy Systems (ISE) shows the energy payback time of PV systems varies greatly depending on the geographical location.
The report authors considered the rooftop PV installation in different geographies used a typical, Chinese-made, 60-cell, mono-crystalline PERC, 19.9%-efficient solar module.
As per the report, such a PV system, mounted in India, would take only 0.44 year (160.6 days) to generate the amount of energy consumed during its production process, with the figure rising all the way to 1.42 years – 518.3 days – in Canada. 

The energy payback time is the period required by the PV system to produce the same amount of electricity (converted into equivalent primary energy) as produced by the grid for its manufacture.
The researchers considered energy needed during different stages like poly-Si, ingot wafering, cells, modules, balance-of-systems, and transport to arrive at the total energy consumption in a PV system production.
In the examples cited by the report’s authors, the balance-of-system, non-generating components of the PV system required the most time to displace their energy footprint, accounting for about 0.46 year (167.9 days) of 1.28-year (467.2-day) energy payback period of a PV installation in Europe.
The report also provides the state of European photovoltaic manufacturing along the value chain for materials, solar cells and PV modules at the end of 2020.
The continent had 22.1 GWp of solar-grade polysilicon production capacity at that point, according to an executive summary of the latest update of the document, published yesterday. According to the report, Europe’s polysilicon capacity was held by Norwegian-based, Chinese state-controlled manufacturer Elkem, and by German businesses Wacker and Silicon Products.
By contrast, Europe had just 1.25 GW of solar wafer production capacity at the end of 2020, according to the Fraunhofer ISE report, based in Norway, at Norsun and REC Silicon-owned Norwegian Crystals; and in France, at energy company EDF‘s Photowatt operation. 
The lack of European cell manufacturing capacity was even more glaring, with the study estimating just 650 MW of facilities, held by Finnish business Valoe, at its fab in Lithuania; by Italian energy business Enel in its homeland; and by Ecosolifer, in Hungary.
The market had 6.75 GW of solar module production capacity at the end of the year, however, spread across 29 companies identified by the research institute. That marked 3% of the world’s silicon solar module market last year, stated the report’s authors, with China contributing 67% as part of the 95% accounted for by the wider Asian region, and producers in the U.S. and Canada claiming 2%.
Despite the dramatic shift in module production from Europe to Asia witnessed from 2010 onwards, Germany accounted for 7.6% of all the solar capacity installed worldwide by the end of last year, with Europe as a whole hosting 23%, China 36%, North America 12%, Japan 9%, India 6% and the rest of the world 14%, including off-grid capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/03/residential-pv-makes-evs-cheaper-reduces-emissions/,"DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV CHARGERS,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 3, 2021","Residential PV makes EVs cheaper, reduces emissions","From pv magazine International
A traditional gas-powered light-duty car costs about $1,260 a year to fuel, an EV lands at about $1,058 per year when a public charger is used. With home solar, EV owners can power their car for as little as $415 annually, according to a new consumer report run by SolarReviews.
Over a 25-year span, a typical warranty period for home solar, SolarReviews estimated that charging an EV with home solar could lead to average savings of $16,250.
The DOE also reports that scheduled maintenance for light-duty vehicles costs at about ten cents per mile, while battery electric vehicles only cost about six cents per mile to maintain.

A battery electric vehicle lacks engine oil, timing belts, oxygen sensors, spark plugs, and many more components and the maintenance costs associated with them. This means, over their lifetime, EV’s cost 40% less in scheduled maintenance costs than traditional gas-powered vehicles.
SolarReviews compared a gas-powered Hyundai Kona, and an all-electric Hyundai Kona, and found that in a 13,500-mile year, the gas-powered Kona would spend $1,260 on gas, while the EV charged at home would spend $662 per year in California, and as little as $450 per year in a state like Florida.
Plus, home solar energy is cheaper and greener than pulling your EV’s power from the grid. Grid-sourced energy can range from $.10 to $.40 per kWh, and averages about $.13 per kWh, while the levelized cost of energy for home solar across the country landed at $.11 per kWh, according to SolarReviews. Both of these options are significantly cheaper than a public charger, which ranges from $.28 to $.69 per kWh.
From a carbon standpoint, home solar performs the best as well, reported SolarReviews. Home solar has an implied emission of 368 lbs. of carbon dioxide per 3,780 kWh, while grid power and EV chargers stand at 1,531 lbs., and 450 gallons of gasoline (an equivalent to 3,780 kWh) would emit a whopping 8,830 lbs. of CO2.

Curiosity for EVs and their integration with home solar is on the rise, as SolarReviews reported a 1000% year over year increase in requests to estimate the solar requirements of charging a Tesla on their website. They suggest that an average of five additional solar panels would be sufficient for the average driver to meet the needs of a Tesla Model 3 charged on a level 2 charger.
“Home solar is the key to unlocking the most value from an EV investment, representing the cheapest charging method with the lowest carbon footprint when compared to public EV chargers, grid power and gasoline,” said Andy Sendy, Founder and President of SolarReviews. “Home solar is the clear solution for consumers looking to get the most out of their electric vehicles and realize consistent and sustainable cost savings.”
