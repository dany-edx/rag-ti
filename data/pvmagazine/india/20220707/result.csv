It executed the project, with a cumulative capacity of 10.201 MWp, for Sportking India, Bathinda, Punjab.
“The plant was completed in a record time of 4 months including statutory approvals and is one of the earliest projects under the newly introduced Net Billing policy of the government of Punjab at 66 kV feeder,” Roofsol stated.
Trina Solar supplied 18,500 high-efficiency 550 Wp mono PERC solar modules for the plant. The installation also uses Sungrow’s 77 inverters of 100 kW each. Around 100 km of DC cables was laid to carry the DC power from modules to the inverters.
The plant is expected to generate 13.5 million units of electricity in the first year and offset greenhouse gas emissions by 14,000 tonnes annually.

Jakson Green will concentrate on green hydrogen, ammonia, waste-to-energy, electrolyzers, fuel cells, utility-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS), solar, and related operation and maintenance services.
“This new venture is a testimony to the company’s increasing footprint and focus on sustainable growth in the renewable energy sector,” said the company.
It has appointed Sterling & Wilson Solar‘s former global chief executive officer, Bikesh Ogra, to lead Jakson Green as CEO and managing director. He will be supported by Chief Operating Officer Kannan Krishnan. The group has already signed an agreement with a leading US-based fuel cell manufacturer to pursue hydrogen projects in India.
Jakson Group, established in 1947, has diversified from diesel generator production into solar project development, engineering, procurement and construction services, and solar module manufacturing. It also produces battery storage systems for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. In India it has four factories and more than 30 sales offices.

Under this policy, Jharkhand targets installing 4 GW of solar power generation capacity from 2022-23 to 2026-27. This includes about 3 GW of utility-scale solar, 720 MW under distributed generation, and 280 MW under off-grid mode.
The chief minister said the state would explore and deploy solar capacity through schemes for solar parks, canal-top solar, floating solar, etc under this policy.
The policy provides a single-window system, payment security mechanisms, and land arrangements through land banks to encourage private investors. It also proposes the setting up of a dedicated solar power cell, statutory approval within a maximum of 60 days, setting up 1,000 solar villages, schemes to encourage economically backward villagers, and cross-subsidy to promote the adoption of solar energy.

“For us, agrivoltaics is above all a collective project,” Jean-Michel Lamothe, a farmer in France’s Landes department and vice president of the French Federation of agrivoltaic producers (FFPA), told pv magazine.
Lamothe is also leading the Pujo Arbouts Territoire Agrivoltaïsme (PATAV), an association of 35 farmers spread across the six municipalities of Castandet, Vignau, Maurrin, Hontanx, Pujo-le-Plan and Saint-Gein.
“In our area, hydrologists have traced a perimeter of 1,400 hectares, where groundwater shows a concentration of pesticide metabolites above the regulatory limit of 2 μg/L,” Lamothe explained. “This situation is the result of the intensive use that has been made in the past of phytosanitary products and herbicides on corn fields.”
According to Lamothe, the nature of the land currently makes it difficult to implement organic farming. “This is why we opted for an agrivoltaic solution,” he stated. Due to the low water quality, operators have no other choice but to cultivate new species, which will make it possible to recreate biodiversity but, at the same time, will offer less productivity. “We decided to grow plants rich in omega-3s, which respond well to our water quality problem and the climate of the region: flax, chia, camelina, rapeseed, and sunflower,” he further explained. “And we will compensate for the drop in productivity with revenues from photovoltaics.”

The group of entrepreneurs is now partnering with Green Lighthouse Development (GLHD) on solar projects. The company wants to use monofacial panels installed on trackers at a height of 1.2 m from the ground, with the module rows having a 9 m distance to allow the passage of the harvester cutter bars under the panels.“In May, we experienced an episode of high heat and drought,” Lamothe said. “Under the panels, which retained the evapotranspiration of the plants, we found that the plants were greener and better developed than between the rows. So we think the return will be higher than what we originally estimated.”Only 700 hectares of the 1,400 hectares in the area will be equipped with solar panels. “Our ambition is indeed to maintain agricultural activity on our land, despite the decrease in water quality. This requires several sources of income.” Harvesting machinery and production packaging equipment will also be pooled.
The objective is also to create value for the whole territory through the taxes paid to the municipalities. At present, farmers hope to obtain authorizations in early 2023 for financing finalized in late 2023-early 2024 and commissioning in early 2025. “We will have to go to ‘zero-phyto’ on our crops,” Lamothe concluded.

German chemical producer Basf and Germany-based storage specialist Man Energy have unveiled a plan to build a large-scale, high-temperature heat pump at Basf’s Ludwigshafen site, in the Rhineland-Palatinate region.
The two companies said in a joint statement that they are currently conducting a feasibility study for the project, which is the world’s largest heat pump ever planned to date.
“The planned large-scale heat pump will enable production of steam using electricity from renewable energy, tapping waste heat from the cooling water system at BASF as a source of thermal energy,” the statement reads. “The residual heat in the water will be processed using compression to produce steam that will be fed into the site’s steam network.”
According to Basf, its industrial site in Ludwigshafen has a annual steam demand of 20 million MT. ” By integrating the planned heat pump into the site’s production infrastructure, up to 150 metric tons of steam can be produced per hour, equivalent to a thermal output of 120 megawatts,” the company said. “At the same time, it would make the cooling water system more efficient and less dependent on climate and weather conditions.”
Basf utilizes steam at the site to dry products, heat up reactors, and distilling. Currently, this demand is covered by heat coming from different production facilities located at the site, as well as gas and steam power plants.
The project is aimed at helping the two companies in gaining experience in the use of industrial-scale heat pumps and to assess the applicability of similar projects at other sites. “The feasibility study’s findings with regard to the economic viability, efficiency and competitiveness of the technology will form the basis for the subsequent decision-making process for the construction of the heat pump,” the two companies said, adding that the first results should be available by the end of this year.
