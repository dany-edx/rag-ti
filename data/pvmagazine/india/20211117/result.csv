The plants shall come up in various sizes. Bidders must quote minimum capacities for various categories as per the table below:

For common facilities in group housing societies/residential welfare associations (GHS/RWA), the allowed RTS capacity shall be limited up to 500 kWp (@ 10 kWp per house), with the upper limit being inclusive of individual rooftop plants already installed by individual residents in that GHS/RWA at the time of installation.
The scope of work for the empanelled vendor includes design, supply, erection, testing and commissioning including warranty, comprehensive operation & maintenance for a period of five years of grid-connected rooftop solar plants.
“The consumers under this scheme shall be free to install their projects from any empanelled vendors subject to the condition that project shall have to be installed/commissioned as per the MNRE Phase-II Guidelines and subsequent amendments,” reads the tender document.

The meeting sought to discuss land availability for setting up the renewable energy project at identified areas of Pang in the Leh district. The required transmission system along with a battery energy storage system for providing round-the-clock power was also reviewed.
R. K. Mathur, the lieutenant governor of Ladakh, assured to provide 20,000 acres of land (on lease basis) immediately for setting up the project at Pang. The availability of other 20,000 acres of land at Pang would be explored based on the inputs provided by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). Public-sector undertakings under the power ministry will also undertake CSR activities for development in the region.
Among other outcomes of the meeting, it was decided that a 5 GW transmission link from Pang (Leh) to Kaithal (Haryana), along with 12 GWh of battery energy storage, will provide 76% utilization of the transmission capacity and would evacuate 13 GW of renewable energy generation (9 GWp solar + 4 GW wind).
Out of 12 GWh battery energy storage, about 1-2 GWh will be developed as part of the transmission element to keep the line charged during the period of no generation, while the remaining battery energy storage could be developed as part of the generation element.
Powergrid would revise their detailed project report accordingly for setting up of the 5 GW transmission link, including 2 GWh of battery energy storage, and AC system strengthening in Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir to provide RE power within Ladakh and also to Jammu & Kashmir.
The MNRE would also move a proposal for providing a central grant for the development of the transmission link as part of the Green Energy Corridor. The transmission link is proposed to be completed within five years.
