NTPC REL will design, develop, and install renewable energy projects (solar, wind, etc) and hydrogen energy storage systems in a phased manner. Under the MoU, NTPC REL and Indian Army will jointly identify potential sites to set up green hydrogen projects for supplying electricity, in a phased manner.
NTPC REL is a step-down subsidiary of NTPC Ltd through its wholly owned subsidiary NTPC Green Energy Ltd. Currently, it has a portfolio of 3.6 GW RE capacity under construction. NTPC Group targets 60 GW of RE capacity by the year 2032 and currently it has 3.2 GW of installed RE capacity. It has taken several initiatives in hydrogen technologies and has already commissioned a hydrogen-blended piped natural gas project in Gujarat. Currently, it is executing a hydrogen-based mobility project (in Ladakh and Delhi) and a green methanol project in Madhya Pradesh.

The oil and gas major targets net-zero operational carbon emission by 2046 and plans to offer a diverse portfolio of both molecules and electrons targeting 35 GW of renewable energy capacity, one million metric tons of biogas, and 4 million metric tons of biofuels by 2030. It targets 200 GW of renewable energy, 9 million metric tons of biogas, and 7 million metric tons of biofuels by 2050.
From 0.4 million metric tons of green hydrogen capacity in 2030, IndianOil will also have approximately 2 million metric tons of green hydrogen in its fold by 2050.
The oil major will consolidate all its existing green assets under one entity and scale its footprint across sustainable energy avenues like biofuels, renewables, green hydrogen, and CCUS (carbon offsets and carbon capture, utilization and storage).
To give a fillip to all these green and decarbonization initiatives, Indian oil is building the world’s largest renewable energy research campus in Faridabad at a total plan outlay of INR 3,200 crore. This center will house four centers of excellence in alternate energy, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and material and corrosion research.

The program focuses on improving the lifetime of electrolyzers by the development of thermochemically robust membranes and electrolytes, reinforced fluoropolymer membranes, graphite composite bipolar plates, and ceramic interconnects. 
Additionally, under the Department of Science and Technology’s call of Advanced Hydrogen & Fuel Cell (AHEC 2021), R&D projects are being supported on various hydrogen technologies. Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, Amethi, and CHRIST University (deemed to be a university), Bengaluru, both are working on increasing the lifetime of electrolyzers. 
Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, Amethi, is developing electrodes and a modular, compact, membrane-less electrolyzer setup for sustainable H2 production from sea, tap, and groundwater. 
CHRIST University is developing an alkaline water electrolyzer stack prototype for green H2 production from dynamic renewable energy devices using a self-repairable electrocatalyst and stable membrane.
Notably, the Union Cabinet has approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an initial outlay of INR 19,744 crore. The Mission proposes a comprehensive R&D program to support innovation efforts for improving the affordability, efficiency, and reliability of green hydrogen technologies including electrolyzers. An outlay of INR 400 crore has been earmarked for the R&D program.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/21/iberdrola-using-dogs-robots-to-monitor-solar-plants/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MONITORING AND CONTROL,OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MARCH 21, 2023","Iberdrola using dogs, robots to monitor solar plants","From pv magazine Global
Spanish energy company Iberdrola is using a real dog and a robotic dog to detect faults in one of its ground-mounted PV plants.
The real dog uses its olfactory abilities to detect problems in the electrical network that could lead to power outages. It was trained by technicians from ScottishPower, Iberdrola’s subsidiary in the United Kingdom, to find the faults. The company claims it had a 100% success rate in a test conducted in December.
“Not only has it found all the problems that had been prepared, but he has also detected some that he was not expected to find,” Iberdrola said, noting that the dog saves time and eliminates unnecessary work by helping to fix faults as quickly as possible. “The training of the dog is not accidental, since it is part of a pilot project that joins other actions that the company has planned to deal with inclement weather in the country.”
In addition to the services provided by the real dog, Iberdrola is also using a robotic dog at the PV facility. The device has a built-in thermal vision system that generates thermographic reports on the status of the different PV plant components, as it walks between the panel rows following a programmed route. According to the robot developer – US-based Boston Dynamics – the big benefit of the robotic legs is that they are terrain-independent.
Iberdrola says the robotic dog is able to detect and analyze faults in substations.
“The advantages of this small technological assistant are several,” it explained. “On the one hand, it takes high-resolution photos that it compares with images taken previously, which makes it possible to detect changes in the infrastructures that escape the human eye.”
The company added that the robot can collect large amounts of data, which can help it to increase the number of inspections that are carried out every year.
Boston Dynamics sold its first robot dog in 2020 for $74,500. Thus far, it has been used by various industries for a wide range of applications. Initially, the robotic dog was used to inspect the construction of active infrastructure tunnels, according to the US manufacturer.
