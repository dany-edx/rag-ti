The two partners are looking at long-term supplies for industrial and commercial customers. They will initially launch a pilot project in Karnataka. 
Ayana is executing more than 3.59 GW AC of solar, wind and hybrid power projects across India, in addition to its 1.19 GW AC of assets already operational in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Rajasthan. Its partnership with Greenstat Hydrogen India combines their respective expertise to facilitate the development of green hydrogen in India, as the nation aims to boost domestic production of green hydrogen to 5 million tons per annum by 2030. 
“By 2050, India aims to produce three-fourths of its hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Ayana and Greenstat being specialists in their respective domains, carry the right expertise to facilitate this growth,” said Shivanand Nimbargi, Ayana’s chief executive officer and managing director.

The robot is built for harsh, dusty environments, and the company claims it can lead to a generation increase of up to 7% compared to periodic wet cleaning.
The robot doesn’t require any external power supply, as it is powered by an onboard monocrystalline solar panel and lithium battery with a control box. It is cloud-enabled and can sense weather to work accordingly.
An all-metallic body and aluminum components make the robot robust and lightweight at the same time. The industrial trolley-based design of the dock with height and tilt adjustment mechanism allows for the cleaning of multiple, misaligned arrays without lifting the robot. This eliminates the mishandling of the robot while shifting between arrays.
The robot easily travels without any rails and cleans itself while docking. A silicon coating on the wheels provides a cushion between it and the PV modules, preventing physical damage to the solar panels.
Cloud connectivity also allows the Enray team to centrally control and monitor the robot’s performance and update its software from time to time. The team has installed the robot for clients such as Adani, NTPC, Tata Power, and Vikram Solar.

The project will be located near the Fatehgarh-III ISTS substation. It will be awarded through competitive bidding, followed by a reverse auction. 
The BESS must be designed to have a useful life of 12 years after the start of commercial operations. The developer must provide comprehensive operation and maintenance for the BESS plant (including battery replacement and disposal, if required) over the project’s lifetime. 
The systems must be guaranteed for annual degradation of less than 2.5% and must demonstrate a minimum 70% of their original rated capacity after 12 years of commercial operation.
NTPC REL said it plans to finance the subject package through its own resources.

It has signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) and Punjab State Power Corp. Ltd. (PSPCL) for around 1.5 GW of utility-scale solar. Agreements have also been signed with multiple corporate buyers for the long-term supply of renewable energy. The new utility-solar projects will be located in the western state of Rajasthan and will supply power at flat tariffs over periods of 25 years.
“Two PPAs of 600 MW and 375 MW are under the SECI Rajasthan IV scheme, where ReNew will supply electricity at INR 2.18 ($0.029)/kWh. The other two PPAs with SECI for 300 MW and 100 MW are under the SECI IX scheme and have a tariff of INR 2.37/kWh. Under the PSPCL PPA of 100 MW, ReNew will supply electricity at INR 2.33/kWh. All the projects are expected to be commissioned by the fourth calendar quarter of 2023,” stated the company.
Long-term corporate PPAs for 491 MW have been signed at tariffs ranging between INR 3.06/kWh to INR 3.95/kWh. The buyers include a large US-based global technology major, Grasim Industries (part of India’s Aditya Birla Group), and Netmagic (a subsidiary of Japan’s NTT Communications).
