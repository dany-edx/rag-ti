The developer said the 70 MW hybrid project will supply clean energy at 25-35% cheaper rates than grid tariffs to corporate clients in New Delhi and Hyderabad.
Off-takers include Filatex, Linde, Nexus Malls (a Blackstone Group company), and Deccan Chemicals.
Fourth Partner Energy stated it executed the project within 10 months. It expects the plant to generate nearly 163 million units of clean energy annually. The project comprises 14 wind turbines supplied and erected by GE.
Karan Chadha, head of business development at Fourth Partner Energy, said the 70 MW plant is the first of many hybrid projects in the pipeline for Fourth Partner Energy. The company will soon commission projects across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra.
“The C&I renewables market in India is set to grow by over 45 GW in the next five years – and Fourth Partner Energy is committed to meeting that demand by offering the entire suite of integrated RE solutions,” said Chadha. “Hybrid projects can deliver a capacity utilization factor (CUF) of nearly 60% compared to standalone wind or solar projects’ 20-30%. Further combining hybrid with battery energy storage system can take that to 80%.”
Through this plant, Fourth Partner Energy is supplying 10.8 MW of electricity to Filatex, one of India’s leading polyester yarn manufacturers.
The hybrid plant has been funded by Aseem Infrastructure Finance, which is backed by NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund). Aseem Infra provided a customized debt solution of up to INR 300 crore for the project.
Fourth Partner Energy has installed 1.3 GW of solar and wind assets and is targeting a 3 GW portfolio across India and Southeast Asia by 2025.
“For off-site renewables, our focus is currently across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. We believe the Centre’s waiver of transmission charges for renewables projects under ISTS (Inter State Transmission System) will be a game-changer. We are currently constructing a 600 MW project in Karnataka under this mechanism,” said Chadha. Fourth Partner Energy is currently backed by Norfund and TPG’s RISE Fund.

Meyer Burger has announced that the European Commission has judged its funding application for €200 million ($224.4 million) as “eligible.” The commission is expected to issue a formal funding decision by the end of this year.
It said it will use the funds to support its “high-efficiency onshore PV module production in Europe” (HOPE) project, including a 3.5 GW solar cell and module factory. It will probably built the facility at an unspecified location in Spain.
“The project is among the eleven selected candidates for EU funding in the funding segment ‘Clean Tech Manufacturing.’ According to the EU Commission, a total of 239 projects applied in all funding segments, of which 41 were successful,” Meyer Burger said in a statement. “In the area of photovoltaic production, the Norwegian company Norsun was also successful with a project to expand wafer production. Norsun and Meyer Burger are already in a supply relationship for solar wafers for Meyer Burger.”
Meyer Burger signed a long-term wafer supply contract in February with Norwegian wafer manufacturer Norsun. The contract provides for rising purchase quantities as Norsun expands its wafer production capacity, in line with Meyer Burger’s growth plans.
In October 2022, Meyer Burger also revealed plans to raise CHF 250 million ($291.1 million) via an ordinary capital increase, by issuing new subscription rights. The company is now targeting around 3 GW of new annual production capacity by the end of 2024, including 1.4 GW of module production capacity in Freiberg, Germany. It is also exploring plans to manufacture solar cells in the United States.

It is also working towards achieving a solar module manufacturing capacity of 1 GW per year and a green hydrogen production capacity of 3,800 tonnes per annum by 2025.
As of March 31, 2023, JSW Energy installed a cumulative power generation capacity of 6.6 GW across thermal (3.2 GW), wind (1.4 GW), hydro (1.4 GW), and solar (657 MW). Under-construction projects stood at 3.2 GW, which the company expects to commission by the end of 2024. 
JSW Energy plans to scale its renewable energy capacity upwards and foray into energy products and services. In addition to solar and wind generation projects, it is investing in new-age businesses like energy storage, green hydrogen, and solar PV module manufacturing.
The company said its 1 GW of PV wafer-to-module manufacturing capacity will become operational in April 2025. It won this capacity under the government’s Performance Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. In energy storage, it has a locked-in capacity of 3.4 GWh (2.4 GWh pumped storage and 1 GWh battery storage).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/17/former-us-coal-plant-to-host-100-hour-iron-air-battery/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 17, 2023",Former US coal plant to host 100-hour iron-air battery,"From pv magazine USA
PUC has approved Form Energy’s construction of a 10 MW/1 GWh iron-air long-duration energy storage facility for Xcel Energy. It is scheduled to be built on the site of the former Sherburne County Generating Station, which is a coal-fired generating plant on the banks of the Mississippi River. The project will replace a facility previously capable of delivering over 2.2 GW of coal-generated power.
Xcel plans to start construction in mid-2024, aiming to bring the site online by mid-2025. The project proposal submitted to PUC has been largely redacted, concealing many details, including specific cost information, from the public. This is somewhat ironic, given the “public” nature of the utilities commission.
The filing does disclose that the project’s location on a brownfield/coal site qualifies it for an additional 10% tax credit adder under the US Inflation Reduction Act. The filing also implies that the project might also be eligible for a 10% domestic content tax credit adder, as Form Energy has expressed commitment to ensuring their product’s qualification. In a recent development, Form Energy announced the establishment of a factory in West Virginia.
According to a different Minnesota PUC docket, a white paper from Form Energy (Docket No. ET-2/RP-22-75), prepared as part of the slower-progressing Cambridge Energy station, provides insights into the cost inputs for the financial modeling tools (see table below). Form Energy estimates the cost of iron-air energy storage hardware, under the “All-in Capital Cost,” to be between $1,700 and $2,400 per kW, with operating costs of $19/kW per year.
Although the hardware costs are two to three times higher due to its unique nature (100-hour battery capacity), Form Energy projects the operating costs to be less than half of those for eight-hour lithium-ion batteries.

They say that between 64% and 69% of the hydrogen network could reuse gas pipelines and that expanding both the hydrogen network and the power grid would help meet net-zero emission targets, cutting costs by 9.9%, or €72 billion per year.
PlasmaLeap Technologies has showcased its green ammonia technology, a new plasma-driven path to ammonia synthesis, to Australian authorities. The ammonia reactor uses only air and water in plasma activation, leading to nitrogen oxides in solution, then used in electrochemical conversion to produce ammonia. “PlasmaLeap Technologies is on track to achieve energy efficiency rates of 20 kWh/kg ammonia in its large-scale reactors by the end of 2023,” said the Australian startup, adding that the technology provides on-demand zero-emissions ammonia feedstock for agriculture.
Ireland has published its national hydrogen strategy, focusing on hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors. “Prior to 2030, hydrogen will be produced from grid-connected electrolysis from surplus renewables,” said the Irish government, adding that the country will work on a 2 GW target of offshore wind for renewable hydrogen production by 2030. Heavy-duty transport applications are anticipated to be the first end-use sectors to develop, followed by industry and flexible power generation.Aviation and maritime are expected to be large high-priority end-users, but these sectors will take longer to develop, the government said. Industrial heating from hydrogen is expected to start in 2033 and hydrogen exports after 2038.
HPS Home Power Solutions has inaugurated the “world’s first grid-serving solar hydrogen house” with a full thermal and electrical supply near Berlin. Built as part of the “FlexEhome” research project funded by the German government, the house tests grid-serving performance, said said HPS Home Power Solutions. “Electricity is only given to or taken from the grid when it serves the grid,” it added, noting larger storage capacity compared to batteries and loss-free storage over longer periods.
The European Commission has published a call for expression of interest to set up a list of independent experts to assist the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking for tasks concerning the European Hydrogen Safety Panel. “The European Hydrogen Safety Panel will be composed of a multidisciplinary pool of experts (15-20 approx.) grouped in small ad-hoc working groups (task forces) according to the tasks to be performed and expertise,” said the contracting authority.
