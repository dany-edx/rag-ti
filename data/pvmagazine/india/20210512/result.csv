https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/12/hydrogen-as-a-universal-climate-solution-might-be-a-bit-of-false-promise/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 12, 2021",‘Hydrogen as a universal climate solution might be a bit of false promise’,"From pv magazine International
Hydrogen, and electrofuels (e-fuels) produced with hydrogen are currently raising high expectations as a form of energy that could pervade all sectors, including mobility and heating. However, they will likely not be able to fully decarbonize the global economy, due to lack of capacity and too-high prices.
This conclusion was drawn in research conducted by scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Germany, and the Paul Scherrer Institute, in Switzerland, in which they stated that the use of hydrogen-based fuels should be prioritized in sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as long-distance aviation, feedstocks in chemical production, steel production and high-temperature industrial processes.
The scientists cite short-term scarcity and long-term uncertainty as a major obstacle for hydrogen to reach sectors that are easier to electrify, such as transport and heating, although hydrogen fuels will probably not be completely excluded from applications of this kind. “There will likely be small-scale niche applications and also regional-specific responses to this question,” researcher Falko Ueckerdt told pv magazine.
“If we use hydrogen-based fuels instead of direct electrification alternatives, two to 14 times the amount of electricity generation is needed, depending on the application and the respective technologies,” explained research co-author Romain Sacchi. “Efficiency losses happen both on the supply side, in the production process of the hydrogen-based fuels, and on the demand side – a combustion engine wastes a lot more energy than an electrical one.”
pv magazine has created a Hydrogen Hub to collect all the news and feature articles on the topic of green hydrogen, making it easy for you to stay up-to-date. As the industry develops, we will report on the most significant technological changes, co-location projects, and business models.
The academics defined the current race for green or blue hydrogen and e-fuels as a “potential distraction” from the task of electrifying the global economy, which they claim is more urgent as well as cheaper and easier to achieve. E-fuel costs, on the other hand, may become competitive only if carbon prices will rise significantly before the end of this decade – a scenario that the German-Swiss group described as rather unlikely.
“Even if assuming 100% renewable electricity, the costs of avoiding one ton of CO2 emissions by using hydrogen-based fuels would currently be €800 for liquid and €1,200 for gaseous fuels,” the research team explained. “This is much higher than current CO2 prices, for instance in the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which currently are below €50 per ton.”
According to its calculations, hydrogen-based fuels may be cost-competitive, eventually, by 2040, but this would be too late for relying on hydrogen as a climate solution. Direct electrification alternatives already exist, it further explained, and these must be applied if climate change needs to be tackled.
Considering that carbon prices may need more than a decade to reach sufficient levels to better support a hydrogen economy, public policies will be necessary to support research and the market introduction of hydrogen-based fuels, the researchers went on to say. Government strategies should support innovation and initial scale-up, including direct electrification and enacting energy tax reforms to create a level-playing field for all technologies.
“Fuels based on hydrogen as a universal climate solution might be a bit of false promise,” Ueckerdt concluded. “While they’re wonderfully versatile, it should not be expected that they broadly replace fossil fuels.”
The paper Potential and risks of hydrogen-based e-fuels in climate change mitigation was recently published in Nature Climate Change.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/12/production-linked-solar-scheme-to-benefit-just-8-13-of-240-gw-panel-demand-till-fy30/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 12, 2021",Production-linked solar incentive scheme to support just 8-13% of 240 GW panel demand till FY30,"India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has estimated the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) could facilitate an additional 8-12GW annual solar cell/module manufacturing capacity in India. 
The scheme provides an INR4,500-crore ($613 million) outlay for the beneficiary manufacturing facilities, which shall be distributed based on their production and sales over a five-year period from commissioning.
The scheme provides an incentive for up to half of the planned output of the facility set up by the winning bidder. This means it will benefit 4-6 GW of sales annually over five years from commissioning the beneficiary manufacturing facilities, or 20-30 GW across the five-year implementation period.
This estimate assumes localization to be between 65% and 100%, base PLI rate of INR2.25 (US$0.031) per watt power, and entirely greenfield expansion (new ventures executed from scratch).
According to India Ratings, the scheme is a good start, but it supports just a fraction of the incremental demand till FY2030. India has set a target to install 280 GW of solar power plants by FY2030, out of which about 240 GW is under pipeline or yet to be implemented. As estimated by India Ratings, the scheme will provide incentives to the beneficiary facilities for an aggregate sales of 20-30 GW over a five-year period, which is just 8%-13% of the 240 GW planned requirement till FY30.
The scheme could lead to more sector consolidation (from the current 15-20 players with significant capacities) to benefit from the economies of scale and requirement of minimum capacity to benefit from the scheme. 
“Higher scales and backward integration, as stipulated by the scheme, will require much larger investments into the sector, resulting in near-term natural consolidation, as small players who cannot benefit from the scheme will become uncompetitive compared to both domestic manufacturers benefitting from the PLI scheme and imported cells/modules,” India Ratings stated.
As per the Scheme, bidders will have to at least manufacture solar cells from outsourced wafers domestically to avail of incentives. Preference will be given to more backward integrated players till the most primary stage of manufacturing polysilicon from silica. At least 1 GW of manufacturing capacity will need to be established on the scale side. PLI will be calculated on annual sales up to 50% of manufacturing capacity or 2 GW, whichever is lower, so that at least three players can be accommodated within the allocated amount. 
On the flip side, the scheme may lose out on its intended purpose for the level of backward integration, given the strict timelines for implementation. 
“Winning bidders may lose on the committed timelines in case they slip on the commissioning timelines of 1.5-3 years from the date of PLI sanction (depending on the level of backward integration),” said India Ratings. 
“Moreover, the PLI benefit will be available till five years from the scheduled date of commissioning only, meaning that winning bidders will be at risk of losing the benefit of the scheme if they overcommit on the level of integration,” it said, adding that “backward integration may take some time, given the already established procurement contracts and supply chains internationally.” 
Given the strict penalties, players may want to play it safe and commit less on the integration part under the current allocated amount—which defeats the main intention of the scheme. 
According to India Ratings, the scheme is a shot in the arm and the much-required step to tackle import requirement and bring it down from 90% import requirement levels to 64%-74% on an average till FY30. 
However, it feels the amount under the scheme will have to go significantly up if India has to reduce its import dependence any further, assuming the ‘280GW by FY30’ solar target.
