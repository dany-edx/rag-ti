If Germany wants to achieve its solar energy targets set for the second half of this decade, the nation will need to annually install triple the amount it added in 2022, when 7.19 GW of PV were connected to the grid. However, there is currently a lack of skilled workers to deploy PV systems in the country, as in the rest of Europe. Germany alone cannot compensate for the shortage, according to BSW-Solar, the German PV industry association. Workers should therefore be recruited from India.
Under a training program launched by the Indian Ministry of Renewable Energy, young electricians can be trained to become “suryamitra” (solar workers) within three months. To date, 51,000 “suryamitra” have completed the training course. And if the German federal government and BSW-Solar have their way, these Indian specialists will also contribute to PV expansion plans in Germany.
“The placement of well-trained specialists for the solar industry in Germany is important for our energy transition,” said German State Secretary Udo Philipp.
BSW-Solar works with the “Hand-in-Hand for International Talent” project to integrate specialists, with funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection, the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the Federal Employment Agency and the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce. BSW-Solar is counting on a new immigration law for skilled workers to arrive in Germany in the summer. It aims to further promote the integration of foreign skilled workers into the German solar industry.
Business representatives say the German federal government has ignored the nation’s shortage of skilled workers for years. At the “Handelsblatt Energie-Gipfel 2023” event in January, companies presented their own initiatives to recruit workers. However, politicians now recognize the seriousness of the situation. This can be seen in the task force set up in the Chancellery to address the shortage of skilled workers.

A significant positive for 2022 was the open access market, which added 3.4 GW of new capacity, the highest ever to date, according to India Solar Compass Q4 2022 released by Bridge To India.
Adani (1,755 MW), NTPC (1,618 MW), and Avaada (1,383 MW) were the top developers by projects commissioned in 2022.
The report stated the average solar tariff during the year 2022 rose 11% to INR 2.66/kWh, while hybrid tariffs increased by 15% year-on-year to INR 2.85/kWh. State-owned hydropower producer SJVN was the top project winner in pure solar auctions with a total allocated capacity of 1,095 MW, followed by Fortum (800 MW) and Tata Power (650 MW). Tata Power led solar-wind hybrid auctions by a large margin with total wins of 1,310 MW, followed by NTPC (450 MW) and ReNew (300 MW).
As on Dec. 31, 2022, the total project pipeline (projects allocated to project developers and at various stages of development) stood at 52,293 MW.
Q4 2022 addition stood at about 2,755 MW, a 17% decline over the preceding quarter. Out of this, 79% (2,166 MW) was utility-scale, 15% (428 MW) rooftop, and 6% (161 MW) off-grid.

SEG Solar has unveiled a new solar module based on n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPcon) technology. The Yukon 144-cell modules feature M10 (182 mm) N-type TOPCon cells and are designed for ultra-large power stations, it said.
SEG Solar is offering four versions of the panels, with power outputs ranging from 565 W to 580 W. The efficiency ratings range from 21.87% to 22.45%. The open-circuit voltage is between 51.50 V and 52.10 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.89 A and 14.07 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panels measure 2,268 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 32.0 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and 2 mm semi-tempered glass. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0%. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
The manufacturer currently produces its panels at factories in Vietnam and Indonesia.

German PV module manufacturer Axitec has revealed plans to increase its annual production capacity from around 1.2 GW to 2 GW by the end of this year.
It said it aims to meet growing solar module demand in Europe, particularly in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It will expand capacity at its production facilities in China, India and Vietnam, where it is converting its production lines to n-type TOPCon technology.
It sells TOPCon panels under the Axiperfect brand. Its n-type TOPCon solar modules have output s ranging from 410 W to 425 W. They are designed for residential applications, according to the manufacturer. The modules have efficiencies of 21.0% to 21.76 %.
The company said that it plans to further increase production over the next few years. In 2026, it wants its PV module production capacity to reach 4 GW.
