Brookfield Renewable, through its Brookfield Global Transition Fund (BGTF), will invest up to $1 billion in Avaada Ventures. 
Global Power Synergy Public Co. (GPSC), a 42.9% equity partner in Avaada Group’s renewables arm Avaada Energy, will further invest $68 million in Avaada Energy for releasing debt obligations and supporting the growth. 
Avaada Group is also in advanced discussions with potential investors to raise another $200 million. 
Avaada Group currently operates a renewable energy portfolio of 4 GW with plans to reach 11 GW by 2026 and 30 GW by 2030. It has diversified into the production of electrolyzers, green hydrogen, and green ammonia. The Group has also expanded its footprint into the solar PV supply chain with the manufacturing of solar cells and modules. Towards this end, it recently won production-linked incentives of INR 961 crore ($116.78 million) for setting up 3 GW of wafer-to-module capacity.
Vineet Mittal, chairperson and founder of Avaada Group, said, “Avaada Group is building an integrated ‘Sand to molecule’ business aligned for the global energy transition towards decarbonization… The collaboration [with Brookfield] will support us in pursuing exciting opportunities as we play a critical role in meeting the exponential growth of sustainable energy and position ourselves at the forefront of the global energy transition.”
Brookfield Renewable is the flagship listed renewable and transition company of Brookfield Asset Management, a leading global alternative asset manager with around $800 billion of assets under management. In India, Brookfield has over 9 GW of wind, solar and hybrid assets in various stages of execution across seven different states.
Nawal Saini, managing director, Renewable Power & Transition, Brookfield, said their strategic partnership [with Avaada] will leverage Brookfield’s global track record, access to capital, and operational expertise alongside Avaada’s strong local footprint, to enable their vision for the energy transition business.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/26/biden-to-maintain-us-solar-tariff-pause-with-veto/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 26, 2023",Biden to maintain US solar tariff pause with veto,"From pv magazine Global
US President Joe Biden plans to veto a move by Congress to end a two-year suspension on tariffs for goods shipped from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, which make up around 80% of the US supply of solar components.
“The administration strongly opposes H.J. Res. 39, which would disapprove a rule issued by the Department of Commerce that temporarily suspends the collection of certain duties on imports of solar cells and modules,” said the White House in a press release. “The four Southeast Asian countries were allegedly harboring tariff-dodging products from China, which under antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws could lead to tariffs that range between 50% to 250% of the cost of shipped goods.”
This looming threat of tariffs created an untenable level of risk that cascaded into cancelled and delayed projects. The effect was so stark that it led the Solar Energy Industries Association to cut its project deployment forecast in half for the year.
About 20% of utility-scale solar capacity was delayed or cancelled in the first half of 2022 due to supply problems and uncertainty. This uncertainty was temporarily lifted when President Joe Biden placed a 24-month moratorium on solar tariffs from the four nations on June 5, 2022.
This April, the House Ways and Means Committee voted 26-13 to end the moratorium and restore tariffs via the Congressional Review Act.
“We cannot allow foreign solar manufacturers to violate trade laws, especially when it comes at the expense of American workers and American businesses,” said Representative Dan Kildee (D-MI).
The tariff exemption applies to modules that are imported before June 6, 2024, or modules installed on project sites before December 2024. Biden’s two-year moratorium is meant to act as a bridge while US domestic solar manufacturing ramps up, said Reuters.
“The United States currently lacks the capacity to produce solar panels and cells in adequate volumes to meet domestic demand,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association. “This strategic approach protects existing jobs while new ones are added, but it also helps sustain the robust environmental, national security and job-creating benefits offered by US solar deployment.”
Commerce made a preliminary ruling in December that the four nations are guilty of breaking AD/CVD laws. The final decision for this ruling is scheduled for May 2, 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/26/solis-unveils-hybrid-inverters-for-rooftop-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 26, 2023",Solis unveils hybrid inverters for rooftop applications,"From pv magazine Global
Solis has developed new hybrid inverters for residential PV and commercial and industrial (C&I) applications. The Chinese inverter supplier says the S6 series features added generator connections and control functions, making them particularly suited for markets that experience frequent power outages, such as South Africa.
“Solis has launched a new S6 Advanced Power Hybrid Inverter which combines solar generator and battery connectivity to liberate power-starved households and businesses in South Africa from the unpredictability of daily electrical outages,” said James Frank, Solis country manager for South Africa. “In particular, peak shaving control in both self-use and generator modes allow users to prioritize backup power for their most mission-critical loads more flexibly and cost-effectively.”
The inverters are available in five versions, with power outputs of 3 kW, 3.6 kW, 5 kW, 6 kW, and 8 kW. The first four versions measure 440 mm x 598 mm x 205 mm and weight 24 kg. The 8 kW inverter measures 437 mm x 675 mm x 215 mm and weighs 27 kg.
The new products have an efficiency rating of 97.5% and a European efficiency rating of 96.2%. They feature two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) points, with MPPT voltage range between 90 V to 500 V for the 3 kW and 3.6 kW versions, and up to 520 V for the more powerful versions.
The maximum input voltage is 600 V and the recommended maximum PV power ranges from 4.8 kW to 12.8 kW. Solis says the inverters support both single-phase and three-phase connections of up to 36 kW in parallel for the smaller devices and of up to 48 kW for the 8 kW inverter. The S6 series is compatible with lithium-ion or lead-acid batteries with battery voltage ranges of 40 V to 60 V.
The 8 kW device has a maximum charging and discharging current of 190A, to allow for incorporation of generators with multiple input methods and automatic on/off control.
“This flexibility avoids over-specifying higher capacity inverters, PV arrays, generators and batteries than necessarily required, with considerable capex and opex savings over our competition,” said Frank. “Thanks to an automatic UPS switching function and a 10-second, 200% surge overload capability, users can be confident of a seamless supply during grid interruptions, even for the most sensitive electronic equipment.”
The inverters have an operating temperature range of -40 C to 60 C and are IP66 rated.
