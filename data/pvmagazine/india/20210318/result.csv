These cities, however, house 67.6 million people, or 18% of the nation’s urban population.
The 2021 edition of REN21’s Renewables in Cities Global Status Report shows that eight cities in India have set renewable energy targets and nine passed renewable energy policies as of 2020.
The report states that net-zero targets are not as widespread in Indian cities. And by the end of 2020, only three cities in India—Kolkata, Chennai and Delhi—had committed to achieving net-zero targets for 2050.
The report highlights that smart cities programme launched in 2015 is accelerating adoption of solar power generation capacity in urban areas. In 2018, Diu Smart City became India’s first city to run completely on renewable electricity, thanks in part to a 9 MW solar PV park and solar panels installed on 79 government buildings.
Several other smart cities issued tenders in 2019 and 2020 for local solar PV capacity atop buildings, canals and sewage treatment facilities.
The report noted the emergence of solar PV and solar water heater mandates in several Indian cities. Rajkot city in the Indian State of Gujarat mandates installation of solar PV rooftop systems on new buildings. Karimnagar in Telangana passed a similar regulation in 2019 making it mandatory for new buildings to install rooftop solar PV if the building area exceeds 2,700 square feet, it stated.
By the end of 2019, the industrial city of Pune had more rooftop solar capacity (130 MW) than any other Indian city.
Among innovative approaches adopted by cities to boost solar uptake, the report highlighted Delhi’s virtual net metering policy that allows residents and businesses without suitable roof space to invest in solar energy systems. The policy allows users to offset their on-site electricity consumption by using electricity generated elsewhere on the grid. Under such models, consumers that participate in community solar projects receive credits on their electricity bills on a pro-rata basis according to their individual share of investment in the project as a whole.
Karnataka leads in solar water heater capacity with push coming from State Discoms. In 2009, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) started denying grid access to households that were not equipped with a solar water. This led to 1,234 million m2 of collector area installed across the city by 2017. BESCOM’s policy was copied by other utilities across Karnataka.

Enel Green Power, the renewable energy unit of multinational energy group Enel, has launched a series of agrivoltaic pilot projects at nine demonstration sites in Europe, including two in Greece, five in Spain, and two in Italy.
“Our initial approach to agrivoltaics is based on the idea of utilizing existing and operational solar parks,” Giovanni Tula, Enel Green Power’s head of sustainability, told pv magazine. “We are trying to understand if different kinds of agricultural activities can be integrated in an efficient way into plants that have been active in the power generation business for several years.”
Its approach is designed to utilize agricultural surfaces that have already been used for the construction of large-scale solar plants, so there is no need to occupy new plots of land.
According to Tula, there is plenty of room for crops between the trackers and the panels. “A conventional solar park does not change the nature of the ground and agriculture is still possible,” he said. “Our goal is to explore the agrivoltaic option in large-scale PV parks or sites in which the energy business remains the most important one.”
This business model, according to Tula, would be completely different from more “conventional” agrivoltaic projects, where the agricultural business dominates and the panels are usually mounted on special structures at a certain height to enable the use of farm equipment beneath them.

ADB Ventures is the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) new venture arm that invests in early-stage technology companies addressing urgent development challenges in emerging Asia and the Pacific.
Euler Motors has raised $9.4 million in Series A funding with ADB Ventures, Blume, Inventus, and other investors. The electric vehicle manufacturer and fleet operator, focused on last-mile commercial logistics, will use the funds for the upcoming launch of its three-wheeler cargo vehicle this year, and support market expansion in India to cities like Bengaluru, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, and Pune – in addition to Delhi-NCR. 
Euler Motors has a full-stack ecosystem approach towards making commercial EV mainstream and enabling seamless customer adoption. Since its inception, Euler Motors has established a network of 100+ charging infrastructure in Delhi-NCR that can charge 200-plus electric vehicles at any given point. It has deployed over 250 vehicles across e-commerce and third-party logistics companies to fulfill last-mile intra-city delivery requirements. 
Smart Joules has raised $4.1 million in its Series A financing led by ADB Ventures and Sangam. Max I. Limited and other angel investors also participated in this round.
Smart Joules provides energy efficiency-as-a-service for large hospitals and commercial buildings. It offers capital expenditure (CapEx)-free retrofits by improving the overall design of energy-intensive systems like cooling, heating, compressed air, and steam in commercial and industrial facilities and replacing aging energy-intensive equipment with energy-efficient equipment. Their DeJoule technology platform then utilizes sensors and IoT controllers to track and control each equipment and optimize overall facility performance in real-time using data. This technology allows Smart Joules to guarantee its clients 15% energy savings.
Smart Joules will deploy the invested funds to strengthen its energy management team, enhance its digital technology platform, expand its presence across hospitals and scale its cooling-as-a-service offering for commercial buildings and industries with heavy air conditioning loads such as pharmaceuticals and data centers. 
The investments in Euler Motors and Smart Joules were made by the ADB Ventures Equity Fund, which is ADB Ventures’ first investment fund.
“ADB Ventures will spur high-impact cleantech, agritech, fintech, and healthtech innovations in developing Asia with its ecosystem building. Our vision is to crowd-in $1 billion of commercial investment towards the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030,” said ADB vice-president Ashok Lavasa.
The ADB Ventures Equity Fund received $60 million in funding commitments in 2020 from Finland’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Government of the Republic of Korea, Climate Investment Funds’ Clean Technology Fund, and the Nordic Development Fund. The Fund focuses on climate and gender impact in South and Southeast Asia.
