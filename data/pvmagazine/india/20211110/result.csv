Freeriding and climate fairness are the two main issues in reaching meaningful international agreements on reducing carbon emissions.
The European Green deal sets the goal of a 55% reduction in carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and to make it a climate-neutral continent by 2050. The European Parliament has given the green signal to the European Commission’s plan to decarbonize its economy by 2050, by approving the proposed Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). It helps to reduce the risk of carbon leakage and to level the field for EU industries working to decarbonize their production processes. This will be done by imposing a carbon tariff on carbon-intensive products such as cement and electricity imported by the EU. 
The CBAM is likely to take effect in 2026 with reporting stated in 2023. But it is impossible to stop global warming or climate change overnight or even over the next several decades, we can slow the rate and limit the amount of global warming by reducing human emissions of heat-trapping gases and soot. 
In today’s time, every kind of cooling machine and air conditioner contains chemical refrigerants that absorb and release heat, making it possible to chill food and keep buildings and vehicles cool. Many harmful gases, especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), were once key culprits in depleting the stratospheric ozone layer, which is essential for absorbing the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. It can warm the atmosphere 1,000 to 9,000 times greater than that of carbon dioxide, depending on its exact chemical composition. 
The process of phasing out HFCs will take many years, and they will persist in kitchens and condensing units in the meantime. Approximately 90 percent of emissions happen at disposal. When we remove them carefully and store them, refrigerants can be purified for reuse or transformed into other chemicals that do not cause warming. 
To slow or even reduce global warming many measures can be taken such as “climate engineering” or “geoengineering.” Some geoengineering plans call for injecting reflecting particles into the highest layer of the atmosphere to scatter and reflect sunlight back to space, which would chill the Earth’s surface. The measure of seeding the oceans with iron to stimulate large-scale phytoplankton blooms, thereby drawing down carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Many reports released oppose the undertaking of geoengineering until we have a much better understanding of the possible side effects. There are many unresolved legal and ethical issues that are surrounding geoengineering.
Many pieces of research suggest that fossil fuels can side-line zero-emission wind energy during the mid-twentieth century. Wind energy has its challenges. The weather is not the same everywhere. The wind has a variable nature, there are times when turbines are not turning. Turbines are noisy, aesthetically unpleasant, and at times deadly to bats and migrating birds. 
Today, approximately more than 3, 14,000 wind turbines supply 3.7 percent of global electricity. The number will soon be much more. According to a research report in 2015, a record 63 gigawatts of wind power were installed around the world, despite a dramatic drop in fossil-fuel prices. Wind Energy is less expensive than coal-generated electricity. 
Many modern technologies make it easier to overcome fluctuations in electricity supply and demand. These interconnected grids can shuttle power to where it is needed. With the help of newer turbine designs, one can address concerns over bird and bat deaths with slower-turning blades and siting practices to avoid migration paths. Rapid and constant cost reductions will make wind energy the least expensive source of installed electricity capacity, perhaps within a decade.
Now, we can say that the era of fossil fuels is over, and the only question is when the new era of clean energy will be upon us. Solar photovoltaics meets two per cent of the global electricity requirement. Over the past decade, we have seen exponential growth in solar photovoltaics (PV). Distributed systems of less than 100 kilowatts of power accounted for roughly 30 percent of solar PV capacity installed worldwide in the year 2015. 
The production of PV panels involves emissions, they generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases or air pollution. PV produces energy at the site of consumption when we place them on a grid-connected roof, avoiding the inevitable losses of grid transmission. It helps utilities to meet the demand by feeding unused electricity into the grid, especially in summer. 
 The “net metering” policy can make solar panels financially feasible for homeowners. Rooftop PV is very affordable. It is now becoming a powerful tool for eliminating poverty. It helps to create jobs and energizes local economies. Today all around the world, rooftop module installations are surging because of their affordability. These benefit from a virtuous cycle of falling costs, driven by incentives to accelerate their development and implementation, economies of scale in manufacturing, advances in panel technology, and innovative approaches for end-user financing. 
 Many startups and companies deal with measuring the carbon footprints of individuals and organizations and help them to erase that and make the environment a better place to live. They are developing many digital tools to help people take action on climate change. The goal of calculating and eradicating the carbon footprint is to effectively counteract climate change. We all should envisage a society in which everyone, including individuals and businesses, operate carbon neutrally, i.e., all entities reduce their carbon footprint by adopting sustainable practices and pay for their unavoidable carbon imprint by reducing their carbon footprint. 
 The reforms in the pricing of electricity by way of dismantling a system that relies on the industry to subsidize residential use of electricity, a market design that does not penalize renewable energy, and promoting grid-connected distributed energy such as grid-connected roof-top solar are critical to the decarbonization of the economy.

The committee comprises leading institutional investors, including multilateral and commercial organizations, to guide the ISA on its investment objective. Senior representatives from leading investors like Africa50, Canada’s CDPQ Global, World Bank’s private-sector arm International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Development Bank of Southern Africa, US-based Capricorn Investment Group, and Singapore’s Temasek are part of the committee. 
The advisory committee will inform and direct ISA on partnerships to achieve the US $1 trillion solar investment target. ISA’s partnership with Denmark’s Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU), green thinktank CONCITO, and World Climate Fund is one among the many more to follow. The partnership aims to translate ISA’s goal into real investments on the ground by engaging investment and finance actors. 
Speaking on these developments Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General, ISA said, “The members of the Advisory Committee have depth and diversity of years of experience, and their guidance on solutions will help drive investments across regions. Their guidance, as well as the partnerships with IFU, CONCITO, and World Climate Fund will help us unearth opportunities and establish the conditions that facilitate an expanded flow of institutional capital into solar energy. These meaningful partnerships and advisors serve as an endorsement of our journey Towards 1000 while also symbolizing a diversification and broadening of stakeholder interest in solar energy.”
The new ISA partnership will build on the Solar Investment Action Agenda released at COP26, and on ISA’s ongoing efforts with the World Resources Institute (WRI), Bloomberg Philanthropies, and BloombergNEF to develop a Solar Investment Roadmap to be launched in 2022. 
Connie Hedegaard, Chair of CONCITO’s Board and former EU Commissioner for Climate Action, said: “We know that the world needs to dramatically scale up investments in renewable energy including solar to achieve our climate and development objectives. We also know that the majority of this investment will need to happen in the developing world and will have to be financed by private sources. The Nordic region has an important contribution to make. We have investors and businesses with the ambition and willingness to act. We have made public-private “ambition loops” work in practice. And we have public finance that is able to catalyze private investments. CONCITO is proud to partner with the International Solar Alliance in this ambitious effort, and in doing so further deepening our partnership with World Resources Institute.”
Torben Huss, CEO of Denmark’s Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) said, “As the Danish DFI, we are committed to scaling up investments in climate and clean energy. We have a special focus and track record in helping to channel institutional capital to emerging and developing economies.”
Jens Nielsen, CEO of World Climate Foundation, said: “Ambitious frontrunners in the Investment community have made long-term commitments to net-zero targets. Through efforts like the Climate Investment Coalition, they focus on translating this into tangible investments in the near future. The third logical and necessary step is to make concerted efforts to make increasing levels of investments happen in the developing world, where the investment needs are the highest. ISA aims to generate investments at scale, and WCF is happy to join the effort to mobilize $1 trillion in solar investments.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/10/shipping-problems-for-first-solar-but-production-line-expansion-is-under-way/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA,WORLD",MAX HALL,"NOVEMBER 10, 2021",Shipping problems for First Solar but production line expansion is under way,"From pv magazine International
U.S. thin-film solar manufacturer First Solar has announced it expects to have more cash and equivalents in the assets column at the end of the year than previously thought, even though logistics problems dragged on its third-quarter results.
Despite CEO Mark Widmar warning “extended transit times for ocean freight impacted our third-quarter results,” and net sales for the three-month period falling $46 million from Q2, to $584 million, the solar manufacturer said it now expects to have a year-end net cash balance of $1.45-1.55 billion, a range $100 million higher than previously forecast.
That may be, in part, due to a lower-than-expected 2021 capital expenditure figure which has come in from $825-875 million to $675-725 million, with First Solar reporting, in Thursday’s financial update, it began building its third factory in Ohio in the last quarter, and also started ordering equipment for its first Indian fab.
First Solar said it produced 2 GWdc of modules last quarter and pointed out the $51 million operating-income figure posted in Q3 was battered by $66 million worth of depreciation charges, $9 million related to the aforementioned production start-up costs, and another $6 million for shares compensation awards.
The other full-year forecasts made by the company remained unchanged and include an expected annual ‘gross margin’ – net sales minus the cost of producing the goods but without selling expenses, tax etc taken into account – of $695-760 million. First Solar expects full-year net sales worth $2.88-3.1 billion on the back of an anticipated 7.6-8 GW of products shipped, as previously announced.
