The announcement was made by UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly during his recent visit to India.
Hygenco, based in the Indian state of Haryana, aims to become a global leader in deploying green hydrogen and green ammonia-powered industry solutions. It designs, engineers, optimizes, and commissions end-to-end green hydrogen and green ammonia assets on a build-own-operate and build-own-operate-transfer basis.
Hygenco aims to deploy over $300 million in green hydrogen projects across India in the next three years and Neev’s investment will provide the necessary capital to Hygenco for commercialising the early pipeline.
“This investment [by Neev] will enable Hygenco to expedite India’s green energy transition through low-cost green hydrogen production at scale in the next 2-3 years,” said Hygenco CEO Amit Bansal.

The business will undertake the engineering, design, procurement, and construction of more than 400 km of 380 kV overhead transmission lines and a new 230 kV gas-insulated substation with associated automation and protection systems.
Its renewables arm has also declared the commissioning of a 20 MW floating solar plant for an undisclosed industrial reservoir in Uttar Pradesh. Going by a 2020 release, this plant is possibly the one built for NTPC, at the latter’s Auraiya Gas Power Plant.
L&T’s power transmission and distribution business vertical provides end-to-end solutions for transmission/distribution infrastructure, and clean electricity starting from solar plant EPC to last-mile electrification. The renewables arm of the power T&D business is a single-stop EPC service provider globally for GW-scale solar, energy storage, microgrid, and hybrid renewable projects.

Consolidated revenue was INR 14,163 crore, 49% up year-on-year.
The company attributed the stellar Q2FY23 performance to higher plant availability in Mundra, higher sales across distribution companies, and capacity addition in renewables.
Total renewables portfolio reached 5,660 MW with an installed capacity of 3,870 MW and 1,790 MW under various stages of implementation.
In Q2, Tata Power raised INR 4,000 crore from a consortium led by the world’s largest fund manager BlackRock Real Assets, and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company to fund the growth of renewables business, and $320-million sustainability-linked loans from foreign lenders led by Bank of America to refinance existing loans.
The company completed a cumulative 625 MW of large-scale renewable EPC projects and secured large-scale renewable projects from NHDC Ltd (125 MWp) and SJVN in Gujarat (100 MW).
Tata Power has a presence across the entire power value chain, from the generation of renewable as well as conventional power including hydro and thermal energy, to transmission and distribution, coal and freight, logistics, and trading. Together with its subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities, it has an installed/managed capacity of 14,002 MW.

Building new solar capacity in Europe could be 10 times cheaper than continuing to operate gas-fired power plants in the long-term, according to a new study by Norway-based research company Rystad Energy.
Europe has seen skyrocketing gas prices since the drop in Russian gas exports, with spot prices on the Netherlands-based Title Transfer Facility (TTF) rising to an average €134 ($135.15)/MWh so far this year. Rystad forecasts prices will stabilize at around €31 per MWh by 2030, which puts the LCOE of existing gas-fired plants closer to €150 per MWh.
“This is still three times more than the LCOE of new solar PV facilities. For gas-fired plants to continue being competitive, gas prices would need to fall closer to €17 per MWh and carbon prices would need to fall to €10 per tonne, which is currently unthinkable,” the company said in a statement.
“Gas will continue to play an important role in the European energy mix for some time to come, but unless something fundamental shifts, then simple economics, as well as climate concerns, will tip the balance in favor of renewables,” said Carlos Torres Diaz, head of power at Rystad Energy.
If gas funds were invested in renewables instead, Europe could replace gas with solar and onshore wind power generation by 2028, when total capacity would reach 333 GW, Rystad forecasts. This estimate assumes a weighted average capital cost for the technologies of €1.3 per watt, as well as a two-year pre-development phase.

PV and wind power are the most important way to reduce emissions in the electricity sector, the IEA said in its new “World Energy Outlook 2022” report. Their share of electricity generation will increase from 10% in 2021 to 40% in 2030, reaching 70% in 2050, according to the agency.
Solar provided more than 3% of global electricity generation in 2021.  Annual capacity addition reached 150 GW, making 2021 another record year. Solar panel prices have fallen by 80% over the past decade, thanks to economies of scale and continuous innovation throughout the supply chain. As a result, PV has become the most affordable power generation technology in many parts of the world. The IEA expects annual growth to more than quadruple to 650 GW in 2030.
By then, annual solar and wind power installations in the United States will increase two and a half times from today’s levels, thanks in part to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). New targets are also driving the massive build-up of clean energy in China, with the country’s coal and oil consumption peaking before the end of this decade. Accelerated renewable energy deployment and efficiency improvements in the European Union mean that EU demand for gas and oil will fall by 20% and coal consumption by 50% over the course of this decade, according to the report.
The average selling price of solar panels rose for the first time in 2021 – by around 20% from 2020 – due to higher freight and commodity prices, particularly for polysilicon. While module prices remained at high levels in the first half of 2022, the IEA said that continuous innovations, further improvements to materials, and energy efficiency will lead to further cost reductions.
The energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could accelerate the transition to a more sustainable energy system, according to the IEA. Although the use of fossil fuels will peak in this decade, it will then decline in the long term. The IEA forecasts that more than $2 trillion will be invested every year in climate-neutral technologies by 2030, through programs like the IRA, REPower EU, and others in Japan, South Korea, and China. This corresponds to an increase of more than 50% compared to today. However, that would still fall short of 1.5-degree target, which would require a $4 trillion investment by 2030.
“The energy markets and energy policies have been changed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and not just temporarily, but for the coming decades,” said Fatih Birol, director-general of the IEA. “Even with today’s political framework, the energy world is changing dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this an historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system.”
