Ltd (HPCL), a government-owned oil and natural gas company, plans a capex of around INR 75,000 crore over the next five years with around 25 to 30% earmarked for the renewables and the gas segment. To reduce its carbon footprint, the company targets to increase its renewable energy generation portfolio to 2.4 GW in 2027-28 from 184 MW as of 2022-23. Further, it targets 16,870 tpa green hydrogen production capacity by 2027-28, from 3.5 tpa in 2022-23.
Green hydrogen plants/capacities under execution or planning include 12,200 tpa and another 370 tpa at Visakh Refinery and 4,300 tpa at Rajasthan Refinery.
HPCL’s current solar capacity is primarily for its own consumption, partially meeting the electricity requirement of its marketing locations and retail outlets. To increase its renewables portfolio, it is exploring participation in the tariff bidding process for the allotment of wind and solar plants.
HPCL is advancing on its plan to form a wholly-owned subsidiary for consolidation of ‘green & emerging business’ opportunities under one umbrella.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/23/wall-mount-lithium-battery-inverter-from-exide/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,LI-ION,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 23, 2023",Wall-mount lithium battery inverters from Exide,"The Exide Integra wall-mount lithium battery inverter features an integrated pure sine-wave inverter system with an inbuilt Li-ion battery. It is available in two sizes: Exide Integra-700 is a 450 W system with 51.2 V, 12Ah in-built battery, while Exide Integra-1000 is a 720 W system with 51.2 V, 18 Ah in-built battery.
Integra-700 gives one hour 30 minutes backp at 400 W load and Integra-1000 gives two hour 30 minutes backup at 400 W load.
The 450 W and 720 W models weigh 22.65 kg and 22.95 kg, respectively, and measure 665x405x140 mm each. In UPS mode, changeover time is less than 10 milliseconds.
“While traditional home power backup systems are bulky and come as two units (the electronic system and the battery), Integra is a sleek, single unit that can even be wall mounted where the battery and electronics are integrated together in a smart package. The Integra unit is also relatively much lighter than lead acid battery-based systems and as such has easy portability. It has a much smaller footprint also to save on space,” states the company.
The Integra comes with automated intelligent battery charge management and automatic protection controls for overload, low battery, heat-up and short-circuit. It takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge an Exide Integra fully.
Both the models of Exide Integra are covered by a product warranty against manufacturing defects of electronics and Lithium-Ion batteries for a period of five years.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/23/gallium-arsenide-solar-cell-achieves-23-1-efficiency-via-electrochemical-porosification/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 23, 2023",Gallium arsenide solar cell achieves 23.1% efficiency via electrochemical porosification,"From pv magazine Global
A Belgian-Canadian research team claims to have found a way to develop gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cells at a lower cost while maintaining high power conversion efficiencies.
The scientists said they grew the cell on detachable germanium (Ge) films, which allows the reuse of Ge in other applications, thus reducing production costs. “By ingeniously creating a weak layer between epitaxial layers and a germanium substrate, we unlock the potential for reusing germanium, leading to a significant reduction in both environmental impact and production costs for optoelectronic devices,” Sherbrooke Professor, Maxime Darnon, told pv magazine.
In the paper “High-efficiency GaAs solar cells grown on porous germanium substrate with PEELER technology,” published in RRL Solar, the research team explained that, in order to create this weak layer, it used the so-called PEELER technique, a novel electrochemical porosification technique originally used for silicon wafers.
“The versatility of the PEELER process extends far beyond the realm of traditional solar cell technology,” Darnon said. “From its foundational application in producing high-efficiency solar cells that redefine industry standards to the creation of lightweight and adaptable solar solutions, PEELER opens doors to a myriad of possibilities. Demonstrated with a single-junction solar cell, the concept is applicable to multijunction solar cells. It is perfectly fit for spatial applications where weight and efficiency are paramount. Additionally, the process finds its stride in concentrator photovoltaics, optimizing energy capture in concentrated sunlight environments.”
Utilizing metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), the researchers fabricated a 1 mm2 front-contacted GaAs PV device based on a Ge substrate, the weak Ge layer, an epitaxial Ge layer, the GaAs absorber, a top contact made of nickel (Ni), Ge, and gold (Au), and a contact layer. 
The champion device built with this architecture achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.012 V, a short-circuit current density of 26.28 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 81.98%.
“The demonstrated performance of single-junction GaAs photovoltaic cells on porosified 100 mm Ge wafers not only matches but surpasses state-of-the-art GaAs solar cells fabricated on detachable substrate, showcasing the transformative potential of growing high-efficiency optoelectronic devices on detachable Ge films,” Darnon stated.
The academics said their experiment also showed the compatibility of the porous structure with the MOCVD growth technique, which they claimed confirmed the industrial potential of the proposed approach.
The research group was formed by scientists from Canada’s Université de Sherbrooke, Canadian energy project developer Saint-Augustin Canada Electric Inc., and Belgian Germanium materials provider Umicore Electro-Optic Materials.

Germany installed 1,231 MW of new PV capacity in October, according to the latest figures from the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur). This compares to 1,050 MW in September and 706.5 MW in October 2022.
In the first 10 months of this year, developers connected 11.7 GW of solar to the grid, compared to 6.12 GW in the same period a year earlier. The country’s cumulative solar capacity surpassed 79.2 GW at the end of October
Rooftop PV systems, incentivized by Germany’s incentive program, accounted for more than 606 MW of new capacity in October, while 535 MW of ground-mounted PV systems, selected under Germany’s tender schemes, were installed in the same month.
The German government has already surpassed its target of installing 9 GW this year, but achieving the cumulative goal of 215 GW by 2030 requires a monthly linear increase of 1,578 MW, a threshold that has not been reached in any month this year, according to the Bundesnetzagentur.
