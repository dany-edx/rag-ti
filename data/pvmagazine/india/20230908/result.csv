Firstly, let’s explore the ABC model (Anchor, Business, and Community) in the context of solar mini-grid businesses. Most companies, regardless of their sector, thrive on a steady and predictable demand. In the energy sector, this predictability is vital for ensuring a consistent supply. In the ABC model, mini-grid developers prioritize serving commercial and industrial customers with substantial and predictable electricity needs, such as mobile towers, irrigation pumps, and cold storage facilities. The excess capacity generated is then used to provide electricity to small residential consumers. This strategy enhances the utilization rate of mini-grids, reduces risks, and bolsters developer profits. These stable loads are known as ‘anchor loads’ and are the foundation of the ABC model.
For instance, in Haiti, after the devastating 2010 earthquake, micro-grids were proposed as a solution to electrify remote villages. An anchor load, in this case a telecom tower, shouldered the majority of the installation costs. EarthSpark established a microgrid in the village of Les Anglais based on this anchor load in 2012. By 2013, it was powering a school, small local businesses, and a community of 54 residents. 
ZeroBase expanded this microgrid in 2014 to a 100 kW hybrid mini-grid, which now serves 430 households, the local market, small agricultural processing units, and other businesses. Customers prepay for their electricity, gaining access to clean, affordable, and dependable power. Additionally, the mini-grid serves as a training ground for Haitian students and technicians, enhancing their skills in rural electrification and microgrid maintenance.
Historically, electrification relied on grid extension, which demanded substantial time and resources. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, grid expansion projects took an average of six years to complete and cost nearly $100 million. However, the grid does not guarantee resilient, sustainable, or reliable electricity supply, leading to the use of stand-alone generators powered by fossil fuels. For example, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, and Zambia rely on hydropower, which is susceptible to seasonal variations and declining water levels due to climate change.
As solar energy becomes the most cost-effective form of energy generation in many countries, with clear climate, energy, and economic benefits, its acceptance and political support are growing. To enhance resilience and sustainability, strategies that incorporate a diverse energy mix, combining centralized and distributed renewable generation, are most effective, especially in underserved nations.
In India, approximately 700 solar mini-grids are owned and operated by private companies. These carbon-free mini-grids essentially function as community projects, improving the quality of life in various regions. 
Effective community involvement, starting from project conception, customization based on community input, and engagement of local workers, is crucial, as is ongoing system maintenance. 
Underserved areas often encounter challenges in maintaining solar/electricity infrastructure, chiefly because of unskilled manpower. These seriously hinder the reliable supply of electricity and the development of sustainable energy systems on these islands. Training local residents, involving the community, and building capacity for system maintenance are essential. If a grid has been installed, institutions and communities must ensure a maintenance budget and trained staff are available. Relying on external experts is costly and short-term.
Mini-grids are particularly valuable for settlements located more than 10-15 km away from existing power grids, depending on population size and density. Solar-based mini-grid projects can secure funding through a combination of grants, government assistance, and private-sector investments. Stand-alone solutions often require grant-driven initiatives to deploy in areas with limited financial capabilities among consumers. 
When the main grid reaches a remote location, there are several models for integrating mini-grids with it. Until the early 1990s, the main grid couldn’t reach rural areas in Cambodia. Consequently, local entrepreneurs invested in and operated hundreds of diesel-powered mini-grids without government support. However, when the national utility, Electricite du Cambodge (EdC), extended the main grid to these rural areas, the electricity landscape underwent a significant transformation. 
The Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) required mini-grid operators to obtain ‘distribution licenses’ and, in return, allowed them to operate at higher tariffs. Isolated mini-grids were also permitted to become small-power distributors (SPDs), enabling them to purchase electricity from EdC or neighboring countries at lower costs than diesel generation. The EAC provided technical assistance on the installation and operation of mini-grids, improving distribution network quality for future grid connectivity. 
Currently, more than 250 formerly isolated mini-grids are connected to the national grid as SPDs, benefiting over one million consumers. 
The government later intervened to establish uniform tariffs for all SPDs nationwide and introduced subsidies to bridge the gap between the retail tariff and the higher operational costs of SPDs.
In order to expand the deployment of mini-grids for electricity access, especially in less developed countries and with a focus on private sector investment, several crucial facilitating elements must be established. These encompass the need for favorable policies and regulations, access to affordable financial resources, training, and skill-building in technical aspects, ensuring the quality and standardization of equipment, and the availability of reliable data. 
When initiating electricity access projects in various countries, it’s vital to acknowledge the unique challenges presented by each location and to tailor the approach accordingly. Thus, for widespread adoption of solar mini-grids, it becomes imperative to conduct specific assessments for individual countries. These assessments should scrutinize the existing conditions, suggest pertinent modifications and additions, and devise strategies for execution while considering the prevailing policy and regulatory framework. 
If the 660 million people who are likely to be left without electricity by 2030 are to be served, solar is the solution we have. Combined with battery storage, solar energy’s affordability, technical maturity, easy adaptability, and bankability combined with its ability to have a multiplier effect on job creation makes it an essential solution in achieving universal energy access.

Sao Paulo-based consulting firm Clean Energy Latin America (CELA) has launched a green hydrogen production cost index that applies to several Brazilian states. The new tool was developed based on CELA’s own modeling and its experience with multiple H2V projects in Brazil. It said it will be updated every six months.
The cost index for producing green hydrogen in Brazil takes into account the nation’s unique characteristics, encompassing factors like taxation, renewable resources such as solar and wind energy used in electrolysis to separate hydrogen and oxygen from water, as well as logistical aspects including investment data for plants, operational expenses, and capital costs.
In its inaugural release, CELA’s LCoH Brazil Index reveals that it is currently feasible to manufacture green hydrogen in select strategic locations within Brazil at a levelized cost ranging from $2.87/kg to $3.56/kg. However, with optimization and incentives, these costs could potentially decrease to as low as $1.69/kg, making them highly competitive when compared to gray hydrogen derived from fossil fuels, known for its environmental impact.
Camila Ramos, the executive director of CELA, noted the index’s significance as a valuable tool for decision-making regarding investments in H2V (hydrogen-to-vehicle) plants in Brazil. She said that it provides greater certainty regarding the economic viability and attractiveness of such projects.
“It is essential to choose the best location for the project, based on the consumer market for this green hydrogen and the technical and regulatory conditions of the state, which will make the difference in the financial viability of the project,” she said. “The index can also be a great guide for the technical and financial optimization of a project and a very clear signal to the Brazilian authorities about the importance of new incentives for the production of green hydrogen in the country.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/08/six-states-account-for-60-of-ev-sales-in-first-eight-months-of-2023/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2023",Six states account for 60% of EV sales in first eight months of 2023 ,"Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Rajasthan accounted for 60% of the EV sales in India during the Jan.-Aug. period of 2023. The remaining 40% of EV sales are scattered across 22 states and eight union territories, highlighting that a handful of states are driving e-mobility growth. 
This was revealed by an EV dashboard on www.cleanmobilityshift.com that draws, in real time, EV sales data from the government-owned Vahan dashboard. 
EV sales in the first eight months of 2023, at 964.51k units, are nearly the same as EV sales for 2022. EV penetration (EV sales against total vehicle sales) in this period touched 6.4%.
EV sales in 2023 are projected to reach 1.2 million, compared to one million last year.
Aarti Khosla, Director of Climate Trends said, “E-mobility has come a long way in India and has gained significant acceptance as a mode of clean transport. The Prime Minister has also acknowledged the big role that transport decarbonization will play in India’s sustainable development efforts. It’s important to sustain narratives in the public debate on why EVs are clean transport, and what is the sales data telling us about ground realities, hits, and misses of policies. This dashboard will help with fact-based, data-driven stories, and support researchers, journalists, and the public in understanding EV growth in different geographies, across time and vehicle types.”
The dashboard shows that while electric two-wheeler sales are growing well in numbers, their penetration is still low at nearly 5% in 2023. This shows that electric two-wheelers are still not a preferred choice among consumers and barriers to their adoption still remain. 
Shikha Rokadiya, Researcher, ICCT, said “Demand-side incentives will need to be continued for some time to make costs of EVs more palatable to end users, both by the central and state governments. But at the same time, attracting investments in EV manufacturing that eventually lead to economies of scale and thereby bring down cost, also needs to be addressed in parallel. Subsidies alone cannot drive mass volumes.”
Narayan Kumar, associate director, e-mobility, Shakti SEF, added to this discussion, “Finding ways to unlock affordable and accessible finance is also a way of encouraging two wheeler sales without relying heavily on subsidies. Currently, SBI offers an interest rate as high as 18% for two wheeler purchase, which is not at all affordable for the common man. Along with this, creating strong regulatory frameworks that builds the confidence of investors to invest in the EV ecosystem is the need of the hour.”
The dashboard reveals every second three-wheeler sold in India is now electric. Ladakh, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Assam and Uttar Pradesh have achieved 80% penetration of electric three-wheelers in 2023. Goa has the highest electric two-wheeler penetration (17%) in 2023. In Kerala, Delhi and Goa, electric four-wheeler penetration in 2023 has crossed 4%, indicating the start of a shift in consumer preference.
