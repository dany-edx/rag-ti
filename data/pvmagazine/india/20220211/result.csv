And what if the system also lets you generate more power than conventional setups while freeing up a good deal of space for other purposes?
Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) have developed portable solar towers that generate 20-30% more power while requiring only 50-60% rooftop space compared to conventional solutions. These solar towers are portable in that they can be mounted on a truck and taken anywhere to generate power. Use of mirrors alongside solar panels redirects the sunlight to the panels, maximizing the solar power generation.
These space-saving solar towers are designed in mechanical and non-mechanical tracking versions. Both the systems are patented by IIT Delhi and licensed to Banglore and Mumbai-based EP Sunsol for commercial installation. EP Sunsol has already deployed the systems of 3kW, 4kW and 5kW capacities at Chennai, IIT Delhi, and Navi Mumbai, respectively.
The systems are scalable to higher capacity with the addition of more arrays in a tower design and are particularly useful for electric vehicle charging stations, rooftop solar power generation, and power generation for agriculture purposes (agri-photovoltaics) such as solar water pumping, charging the battery for tractors, etc.
“After intensive research, we got success in arriving at the lightweight and cost-effective novel design on mounting solar PV towers along with high reflectivity mirrors to follow the Sun movement. Both non-mechanical and mechanical solar towers can generate 20-25% and 25-30% more power, respectively, while utilizing only 50-60% rooftop space compared to conventional solutions,” said Dalip Singh Mehta, a professor at the Physics Department of IIT Delhi, and part of the project team.
Mayank Gupta and Virendra Kumar (Department of Physics), Masood Ali (SeNSE), and Sanjay Ambwani (Design Department) were also part of the IIT Delhi research team. The EP Sunsol Team, which did the installation, comprised Mahadevan R and Hitesh Mehta.
In non-mechanical tracking solar tower, solar panels, along with high-reflectivity mirrors, are vertically mounted at an angle based on the location that these fall in the line-of-sight of Sun during the morning, mid-day and evening hours, hence leading to high-efficiency solar power generation. 
“The mounting methodology helps to generate more power during non-peak hours of the Sun, i.e., 9am-11am and 2pm-5pm in addition to peak hours of 11pm-2pm. The mirrors/reflectors deployed in this solution boost the irradiance on solar panels during the entire day i.e., 8 am – 5 pm. The percentage of increase of solar irradiance onto the solar panels is more than 50%, thus maintaining 1000W/m2 from 9 am – 4 pm. Due to this increase in solar irradiance from 9 am – 4 pm, the increase in the amount of power generated is 20-25% compared to the conventional mounting of solar panels,” according to IIT researchers.
In the ‘mechanical tracking’ version, the solar PV tower with mirror reflectors employs a low-cost programmable electro-mechanical system for horizontal single-axis solar tracking rotation from east to west. Single/double towers are mounted in such a mechanism that the whole system with panels and reflectors follows the direction of the Sun. The panels start the day facing the East direction and end the day in the west direction. By the next morning, the panels return to their East facing position to start a new day. 
The innovative tracking system developed by IIT Delhi does not require any light-dependent resistance (LDR) based sensors and consumes very low power drawn from the solar tower itself.

Companies committing the investments included state-owned power producers THDC India, NTPC, NHPC, and SJVN (10 GW each); Solar Energy Corporation of India (2 GW); and private-sector Reliance (20 GW), Axis Energy Group (28 GW of solar projects and 4 GW solar module manufacturing facility), and Sukhbir Agro Group (2 GW RE and 100 MW biomass). 
THDCIL has signed the letter of intent to build 10 GW of solar power projects with an INR 40,000 crore investment in the Indian State of Rajasthan. It will form a special purpose vehicle as a 74:26 joint venture with Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Limited (RRECL) to implement the projects. 
The land bank will be allocated by the Government of Rajasthan through RRECL. 
THDC expects its investment in the Rajasthan energy sector to create around 10,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities during the peak time of construction, which will boost the local economy.
“The project shall be commissioned between the third and fifth year in a phased manner. These mega ventures by THDCIL and RRECL will usher in the socio-economic development of the project areas and also bring in cheap solar electricity in the region. This will also contribute towards the RE capacity addition target of 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030,” read THDCIL statement.

Seaborg Technologies, a Danish manufacturer of molten salt nuclear reactors, is working with its sister company, Hyme Energy ApS, to develop a molten salt thermal energy storage technology that can store large amounts of intermittent wind and solar power.
The novel technology was originally conceived for use in Seaborg’s next-generation advanced nuclear reactor, the Compact Molten Salt Reactor. But it acquired a life of its own when the company’s experts developed a chemistry control method that holds the corrosion by sodium hydroxide at bay.
“Normally no chemist in their right mind would look at anything as corrosive as sodium hydroxide,” Seaborg CEO, Troels Schönfeldt, told pv magazine. “However, in the development of our reactor, we needed to use sodium hydroxide and were forced to develop these methods.”
Sodium hydroxide can be produced at low cost from seawater as a byproduct from chlorine production. Seaborg said this is six times cheaper that standard salts used for storage.
“Hydroxides can contain more heat per salt unit, making it more efficient and reducing the amount of salt needed compared to current salt uses,” the company explained. “This reduces the cost of salt as a storage medium by approximately 90%”.
Sodium hydroxide is produced across the globe in bulk, as a byproduct part of the alkali chloride process. Normally, bulk price would be around $150 per ton, or around $0.75 per kWh as a volumetric storage price for the storage medium.
The proposed storage system uses renewable energy to heat the salt using electrical heaters. It is based on two-tank molten salt storage designs developed for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. It has a scalable storage capacity from 250MWh to 5GWh. A 1GWh facility with sodium hydroxides is expected to be able to store heat to produce power and heat for around 100,000 households for 10 hours of discharge.
The two tanks are able to stores electricity as heat at 700 C. The high temperature provides large flexibility for how energy can be extracted back out, including Rankine cycle combined heat-and-power production, Brayton cycle heat-to-power, heat storage for district heating, and industrial process heat.
The immersion heaters are used to store excess electricity as heat, while pumps control the flow for discharging through salt to steam heat exchangers for producing steam to drive steam turbines for co-generation in the simplest setup. Seaborg said this storage system may have a maximum heat loss down to 0.5% to 1% per day and its charge and discharge are freely scalable. Its costs should be between 30% and 50% lower than conventional molten salt storage. Hyme believes it could  halve the price of long-term and large-scale energy storage facilities regardless of the geographical location.
“We are pursuing the commercialization of hydroxides as the key component in large-scale energy storage,” said Hyme CEO Ask Emil Løvschall-Jensen, noting that the first pilot manufacturing facility should be operational within 18 months.
Hyme has received backing from the Danish Energy Agency to build the pilot plant at a test site in Esbjerg, Denmark – an area well-known as a very favorable geographical site for wind power, with large offshore projects already in operation. The pilot plant will be built by Hyme together with project partners including SAN Electro, Alfa Laval and Sulzer, as well as regional district heating supplier DIN Forsyning.
