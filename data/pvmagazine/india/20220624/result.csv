The seed funding round was led by JITO Angel Network.
BatX Energies aims to recycle approximately 1 billion lithium-ion cells over the next three years. It already has an end-of-life battery recycling unit in the Secunderabad industrial area near Bulandshahar district of Uttar Pradesh, where it can annually produce up to 15,000 metric tons of black mass, a mixture of battery anode and cathode materials, with battery input of 30,000 metric tonnes. The used batteries undergo a seven-layer mechanical process involving shredding and crushing to produce black mass. Secondary products from this process include high-grade plastic, aluminum, copper, and stainless steel, which are bought by recyclers.
“BatX Energies will establish a commercial-scale battery material extraction plant co-located with its recycling unit. Using a hydrometallurgical process, the plant will produce specific battery materials from the black mass. The plant will produce up to 20,000 tons of battery materials per year. The company expects to switch on commercial production before December this year,” Vikrant Singh, co-founder and CTO of BatX Energies, told pv magazine.
The company claims to have developed a “zero waste, zero emissions” technology to extract critical rare earth metals. It extracts lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese, from end-of-life lithium-ion batteries. All of these metals can be used in Li-ion cells.
BatX Energies works according to a hub-and-spoke model, under which it sources end-of-life lithium-ion cells from different locations in India and transports them safely for recycling at its facility. It will expand its footprint in India and international markets, with plans to source and process locally. It said it will invest up to $50 million over the next 24 months to set up recycling units in different parts of the world. The biomass produce will then be shipped to its India facility for battery material extraction.
“The cost of recycled material is far lower than mined material with greater environmental benefits. We are fortunate to have received a lot of interest from various countries for our economically viable solution and machinery, thus opening our routes for organic global expansion,” said Utkarsh Singh, co-founder and CEO of BatX Energies.

The prospective contractor will supply, install and commission 5 metric tons (MT) of solar cold storage capacity in Senegal, as well as 5 MT in Sudan and 5 MT in Seychelles. The ISA and NTPC are also planning two 2 MT systems in Djibouti. The ISA has engaged NTPC as an implementation partner and project management consultant, as it plans to deploy solar demonstration projects in member countries. ISA will finance the projects.
To be eligible, the bidders should have a track record of supplying, installing and commissioning 25 MT of cumulative solar cold storage. At least 10 MT of that capacity should be in successful operation for a period of at least a year from the date of commissioning, prior to the techno-commercial bid opening date.
According to the tender document, the cold storage equipment must have a minimum storage capacity of 2 MT. It should also be able to store 2,000 kgs of potatoes or farm produce equivalent, in terms of the specific heat and respiration rate.
The system will have a battery of adequate capacity for operating system auxiliaries during non-sun hours. The battery capacity should also be able to energize a 100 W load for up to 10 hours (during non-sun periods) to connect electrical devices such as lamps. The total solar PV array capacity should be adequate to run refrigeration systems, fully charge thermal energy storage systems, and fully charge the batteries. It should not be less than 3.0 kWp in size.

Scientists from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have developed a dual-band selective solar harvesting (SSH) window based on transparent photovoltaics (TPVs) and transparent solar absorbers (TSAs). The TSAs are used to convert ultraviolet (UV) or near-infrared (NIR) light by converting it into thermal energy.
“The harvested thermal energy is extracted by ventilated air to provide indoor space heating in cold seasons or abate indoor cooling loading in hot seasons,” they explained. “We demonstrated that the SSH window has a visible transmittance of 42%, achieves a solar-electricity conversion efficiency of 0.75%, and a solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 24% with a ventilated air temperature rise of 10 C.”
The research group used a luminescent solar concentrator (TPV) based on copper indium sulfide and zinc sulfide (CuInS2/ZnS) quantum dots (QDs) as the exterior window. It is able to collect UV light and convey it to opaque PV devices that are located at the edge of the transparent substrate for electricity generation. The TSAs were instead used to fabricate the interior side of the window where heat is produced and collected.
“The thermal energy is mostly extracted by the ventilated air within the gap for various purposes such as indoor space heating in cold seasons,” the group said.
The academics fabricated a prototype measuring 30 cm x 30 cm x 2.4 cm by assembling the TPV elements with the TSAs on the interior side. They claim the device showed a substantial visible transmittance and that it was able to generate 6 W per square meter of power and the thermal power of around 150 W per square meter.
“Thermal power is 25 times of the generated electrical power, suggesting that the harvesting thermal power is of primary importance for building-integrated solar energy harvesting windows,” they said. “With thermal energy harvesting by air ventilation, the total effective efficiency was estimated over 30% at a typical operating condition for building space heating applications.”
They presented their findings in “Selective Solar Harvesting Windows for Full-Spectrum Utilization,” which was recently published in Advanced Science.
“The SSH window can save the annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption by up to 61.5% compared with the normal glass, in addition to the generated electricity that accounts for up to 19.1% of the annual energy saving amount,” they said.
