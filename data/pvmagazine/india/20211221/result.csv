With this, the developer has reached a total 7.4 GW of operating renewable energy capacity and is on track to hit 8.2 GW by the end of FY2021-22. 
ReNew Power installed a record 1.5 GW of renewable energy projects to date in the current fiscal year (FY2021-22) despite challenges related to Covid-19 and supply chain disruptions. 
The 1.5 GW capacity addition in the current fiscal year comprises more than 1.3 GW of utility-scale solar projects, including 1.2 GW in Rajasthan, 105 MW in Gujarat, and 20 MW in Maharashtra. Wind capacity addition stood at over 150 MW, including 136 MW in Karnataka and 22 MW in Gujarat. 
All these capacity additions in FY2022 are expected to offset over 75,000 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent cumulatively. Around 1.05 GW of this organic capacity addition benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement with the SECI. 
Speaking about the capacity addition, Chairman and CEO of ReNew, Sumant Sinha, said: “ReNew continues to be at the heart of India’s transformation as a clean energy leader. The major organic addition of 1.5 GW of renewable energy projects this fiscal year and the fact that we have crossed 7 GW of commissioned capacity shows we are well on track to achieve our aspirational goal of 18 GW by FY2025. We will further intensify our efforts to help India achieve its climate goals, including meeting half of its energy needs through renewables, and also develop green hydrogen.”
ReNew develops, builds, owns, and operates utility-scale wind and solar energy projects, hydro projects, and distributed solar energy projects. As of November 30, 2021, the developer had a renewable energy portfolio of approximately 10.3 GW (including commissioned and committed projects) across India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/21/power-banking-restrictions-will-curb-open-access-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RENEWABLES,ROOFTOP SOLAR,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 21, 2021",Power banking restrictions will curb open-access solar,"New restrictions on the banking of power will inhibit the growth of the rooftop and open-access solar market, and potentially slow progress towards India’s national target of 450 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030, according to a new briefing note by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research.
Banking allows renewable energy generators to deposit surplus power into the grid and withdraw it later when needed – much like putting money into a savings account at a bank. 
“Solar and wind projects are likely to produce excess energy during peak summer or windy seasons,” says co-author Jyoti Gulia, Founder of JMK Research. “Without a banking facility or with banking restricted to monthly rather than annual periods that excess generation is lost.”
The authors analyze banking provisions across key states, noting that some states, for example, Gujarat and Maharashtra, have moved from annual to monthly banking. And that banking provisions are likely to be restricted further to the time of day or daylong across most states. 
States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have withdrawn banking facilities altogether.
Without banking provisions for excess energy, the business model for open-access renewable energy projects, which sell electricity direct to commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers, will become unviable, says Gulia.
“This will be a major setback for renewable project developers at such an early stage in India’s renewable growth trajectory. The C&I segment’s renewable energy share is less than 1% of the overall electricity generation portfolio across most key renewable-rich states.”
The banking restrictions follow the introduction of net metering limits and the withdrawal of waivers for open-access renewable energy projects.
Co-author Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist, Lead India at IEEFA, explains that power distribution companies (discoms) are concerned about the impact on their revenues of high-paying C&I consumers moving from conventional to alternative power procurement through the rooftop and open-access solar model.
“While imposing restrictions on banking will do little to help the discoms’ finances, it may have a significant impact on India’s renewable energy rollout which now needs to accelerate dramatically to reach the target of 450GW by 2030,” she says.
The authors say restrictions on banking should not be considered until statewide rooftop and open-access targets have been achieved.
As an alternative, they propose discoms can opt to procure the banked energy themselves. Instead of returning power to the end consumer/developer, discoms can simply pay for the quantum of banked energy after each month at their lowest cost of procurement. Regulators could allow banked energy to contribute to the discoms’ Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO).
Further, the authors recommend making regulations uniform across states. Project developers face confusion and uncertainty because banking provisions and banking charges vary from state to state.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/21/enphase-energy-powers-indiqube-workspace/,"ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 21, 2021",Enphase Energy powers IndiQube workspace,"Enphase Energy, Inc., a global energy management technology company and the world’s leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems, today announced the commissioning of a solar rooftop installation at a building of flexible workspace provider IndiQube.
The 103 kWp solar rooftop plant at IndiQube Lakeside was installed by EPC service provider U-Solar. It comprises 228 Renewsys 450Wp panels and 228 Enphase IQ 7A microinverters. The generated solar power meets 25% of the total energy requirement of the property and will help offset 140 tons of CO2 emissions in a year. This carbon footprint reduction is equivalent to planting 900 trees every year. 
Enphase solar monitoring mobile app Enlighten allows IndiQube to track solar energy production and monitor the system’s health on a real-time basis.
Enphase has shipped more than 34 million microinverters globally, and approximately 1.5 million Enphase-based systems have been deployed in more than 130 countries. Its India manufacturing facility in Chennai has deployed ~400,000 units per quarter and can ramp up to 1 million units per quarter.
Enphase microinverters feature Burst mode technology that leads to more electricity production even at dawn, dusk, and in low-light conditions. These also have a built-in rapid shutdown feature, so solar power can be turned off instantly in the event of an emergency.
Sunil Thamaran, vice president and managing direcor at Enphase Energy India said, “As employees gradually start going back to offices, the energy consumption of office buildings is going to rise drastically. Shared workspaces will have to pre-empt energy requirements and explore ways to meet this rising demand. We are delighted to partner with IndiQube and convert their workspace into a green building. IndiQube has now moved on from just being an energy-efficient building to an energy-neutral building and we are proud to be a part of this green transition, along with our partner U-Solar who installed the system on their rooftop.”
IndiQube has a portfolio of 4 million square feet, spread across 60+ properties in six cities. It is on a mission to provide sustainable workspaces, aiming to take its overall rooftop solar power capacity to over 1 MW in 2022.
Rishi Das, Co-founder and CEO at IndiQube, said they plan to extend their collaboration with Enphase to more properties, thereby taking the overall rooftop solar power capacity to over 1 MW in 2022.
Commenting on the solar installation, Sanjeev Jha, Head of Operations at U-Solar, said, “Companies are increasingly implementing more sustainable and eco-friendly practices, and it is a trend that we expect will continue to grow. Organizations can install an affordable, efficient, and clean energy solution to power office requirements. The Enphase IQ microinverters ensure maximum solar power generation from solar panels, enabling us to provide a smart solar solution for properties like IndiQube.”

With the acquisition, Vedanta has become the sole producer of nickel in India.
“As the sole producer of Nickel in India, we will invest in improved production of this green metal to assist India’s transition to a Green Economy,” stated the company.
Cobalt and nickel are used in the batteries to power electric vehicles (EVs) and in energy storage.
Cobalt is found associated mostly with copper and nickel ores and extracted as a by-product. Globally, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the leading cobalt producer. China, Canada, and Australia also have significant reserves.
In India, occurrences of cobalt ores are reported from Jharkhand, Odisha, Rajasthan, Nagaland, and Madhya Pradesh. However, the nation meets its demand for cobalt usually through imports. Among players, Nicomet Industries is a leading producer of cobalt metal and different cobalt salts in India. It manufactures cobalt cathodes under NICO Brand in Maharashtra.
Nickel is found as oxides, sulphides, and silicates in India. Odisha accounts for the largest share of nickel ore resources in the country (93%), followed by Jharkhand and Nagaland. For nickel too, India is largely dependent on imports, given limited facilities to recover this metal from primary sources.
Nicomet Industries produces nickel metal and its derivatives and had about 5,400 MTPA annual production capacity at its Goa plant as of 2019.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/21/solar-redox-flow-cell-for-residential-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 21, 2021",Solar redox flow cell for residential energy storage,"From pv magazine International
Solar redox flow cells (SRFCs) are devices that can store electricity by harvesting sunlight via a photoelectrochemical (PE) panel. These storage devices are attracting increasing interest from scientists and research institutes and have been developed so far only at research level.
Two of the biggest challenges these batteries have to overcome, along with other minor issues, are the fact that their performance is restricted by inefficient photoelectrochemical reactions and that their storage capacity is limited by the physical dimension of solid electrodes.
With this in mind, scientists at the University of Porto have recently developed a solar redox flow cell for decentralized, residential energy storage.
“In our work, we designed, built, and tested the highest photoactive-area solar redox flow cell device ever reported to date,” the research leading author, Telmo da Silva Lopes, told pv magazine. “We also provided important device design guidelines that will help develop future up-scaled SRFCs, an emerging technology that uses semiconductor-based photoelectrodes to store solar energy in chemical bonds and heat.”
Called SolarFlow25, the device was designed to optimize light absorption by the semiconductor and ensure effective diffusion of redox species while offering minimal electronic and ionic transport resistance.
The device has a 25cm2 photoactive area and was built with a large-area PE cell linked to the system structure via small stainless steel screws and an auxiliary metallic rim. “These screws create an electrical path between the conductive metal layer on the perimeter and edges of the PE and the end plate, allowing for … effective current collection,” the Portuguese group explained. “To assemble the cell, both anodic and cathodic compartments were screwed together using bolts with a Nafion 117 membrane in between.”
The system also relies on ferrocyanide/anthraquinone (2,7-AQDS) redox flow chemistry and nanostructured hematite (α-Fe2O3) photoelectrodes combined in series with a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) that is able to produce a photocurrent of approximately 40 mA.
The SRFC was connected to a conventional redox flow cell (RFC) and its performance was tested. “By connecting the SolarFlow25 cell with a conventional RFC, the electrochemical fuels were photocharged and discharged in continuous operation exhibiting an unbiased photocurrent of around 11 mA during photocharge (100 mW/cm2) and a round-trip efficiency of around 0.15%,” the academics emphasized. “These photocharging results were further improved using a sponge-like nanocube, α -Fe2O3, photoelectrode that provided an unbiased photocurrent of around 40 mA during photocharge, resulting in a round-trip efficiency of around 0.44% during the 10 cycle/14-hour demonstration.”
These efficiency levels are claimed to be fourfold higher than any other results reported for α-Fe2O3-driven SRFCs to date.
The academics stressed that no leakage or electrical problems were detected for the device during the experiment, which they said lays the ground for further improving the proposed technology. “We hope that our contribution will help bring SRFCs closer to commercialization, on its way to revolutionize energy storage for households and stationary applications,” Silva Lopes concluded.
The device is described in the study “A 25 cm2 Solar Redox Flow Cell: Facing the Engineering Challenges of Upscaling,” published in Advanced Energy Materials.
A  low-cost redox flow battery powered by perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells was presented in July 2020 by researchers from the Wisconsin-Madison and Utah State universities, in the United States. This device combines photo-electrochemical solar cells with aqueous organic redox-flow battery technology and has solar-to-output efficiency of 20.1%.
