It also estimates the nation has a green hydrogen production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes in the pipeline, which is expected to be commissioned by 2030.
“So far, five major green hydrogen projects have been announced in India, which, when commissioned, would add a cumulative production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes per annum by 2030. The green hydrogen produced will be used to make derivatives like ammonia, urea, and methanol,” Aashish Mallik, hydrogen analyst at Rystad Energy, told pv magazine. “For instance, ACME has announced a green ammonia project in Tamil Nadu with a capacity of 1.1 million tonnes per annum which will be derived from 198,000 tons of green hydrogen.”
Rystad analysts say joint industry and government initiatives are leading India on the path to becoming a global leader in the nascent hydrogen economy. In addition to ACME, companies like Avaada and the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) have announced projects for green hydrogen production and its derivatives, bringing the country’s green hydrogen pipeline capacity to 1.8 million tonnes. 

These plans are aligned with India’s ambitions to boost its annual green hydrogen production to 5 million tonnes by decade end. India released the first phase of its National Hydrogen Mission Plan in February, and its much-awaited second part is expected soon.
Rystad expects India to have six electrolyzer gigafactories operational by 2025. Adani Group has announced plans to build a hydrogen electrolyzer gigafactory as part of its $70 billion investment in clean energy by 2030. With this, it has joined the ranks of five other industry ventures for electrolyzer gigafactories announced last year, including Reliance-Stiesdal, Larsen & Toubro (L&T)-HydrogenPro, H2e Power, Greenko ZeroC-John Cockerill, and Ohmium. 
Reliance has partnered with Danish manufacturer Stiesdal, and L&T with HydrogenPro to bring alkaline electrolyzers to the Indian market. Belgium engineering company John Cockerill and Greenko ZeroC plan to set up a high-pressure alkaline electrolyzer facility with a capacity of 2 GW per annum. Meanwhile, Ohmium has set up a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer manufacturing plant with a capacity of 500 MW per year in Bangalore, which it plans to expand to 2 GW. Similarly, H2ePower will set up solid-oxide (1 GW) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer (200 MW) manufacturing plants in Pune, India. 
With this, the combined annual capacity will rise above 8 GW by 2025, avoiding 12 million tonnes of CO2 annually by 2025, stated Rystad.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/20/us-startup-unveils-5-kw-solar-canopy-for-ev-charging/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",US startup unveils 5 kW solar canopy for EV charging,"From pv magazine Global
California-based Paired Power has unveiled a 5 kW solar canopy with built-in EV charging capabilities.
Its PairTree product can be used in on-grid or off-grid modes and can be paired with lithium-ion battery systems with storage capacities of up to 40 kWh.
“The product is currently only being sold in the US, Paired Power is focused on the US market but will consider international opportunities down the line,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The carport can host up to 10 bifacial solar modules and can be installed within a single workday, with just two workers using standard hand tools.
“The installation of traditional EV chargers and solar canopies is a time and labor-intensive process, not to mention the disruption and delays of construction,” said CEO Tom McCalmont. “We designed PairTree to eliminate these hassles and make the transition to solar and EV charging simple and scalable while also being modular enough to accommodate future needs.”
The system measures 3.2 meters x 5.2 meters x 3.7 meters and supports single- and dual-port “Level 2” charging and a universal SAE J1772 charging interface. The J1772 5-pin is a North American standard for electrical connectors for electric vehicles.
The canopy sits on a ballasted steel foundation, which the company said allows customers to avoid costly foundation work and permitting delays.
“PairTree offers additional options of batteries or ground screws to secure the charger in high winds,” it said. “PairTree is designed to be installed side by side in multi-unit configurations for additional energy output to power additional chargers.”
It also claimed that the system needs minimal maintenance, as there are no moving parts.
“AC charging stations are offered to support Level 2 charging, and 120V outlet panels can be added to support emergency or temporary power,” it explained.”Orders for PairTree can be placed now and are expected for general delivery starting in Q2 2023.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/20/solar-pv-employed-around-3-4-million-people-in-2021/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EMPLOYMENT,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",Solar PV employed around 3.4 million people in 2021,"From pv magazine Global
The energy sector employed over 65 million people in 2019, or 2% of global employment, according to the newly published World Energy Employment Report by the IEA. Half of this workforce is employed in the clean energy sector, with solar PV employing more workers than any other power generation technology.
According to the report, power generation employment totaled 11.2 million in 2019, comprised of 3 million in solar PV, 2 million in coal power, and 1.9 million in hydro. Onshore and offshore wind power employed 1.2 million and nuclear power 1 million. Employment in other renewables totaled around 710,000 employees.
The agency estimates that employment in the entire energy sector in 2021 was up by around 1.3 million and could increase by another 6 percentage points by 2022, with clean energy accounting for all of the growth. Energy investment could rise by 8% in 2022, reaching $2.4 trillion, but with almost half of the increase in capital spending linked to higher costs.
Around 3.4 million workers were employed in solar PV in 2021, almost half of which in China, enabled by lower-cost labor, according to the report. North America employed around 280,000 workers and Europe over 260,000. There were around 50,000 people working in the solar industry in Africa, with this number set to grow due to the proliferation of on- and off-grid solutions in the continent, the agency said.
Most employees in the industry work in manufacturing and installation of new capacity, with manufacturing jobs being strongly concentrated in a few countries: China alone accounted for 260,000 workers in the production of polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules.
“Residential solar panels are often installed by construction workers and electricians who also work on other projects, such that many solar PV jobs are not full-time, and it can be difficult to count employees accurately,” the agency noted.
Shortage of skilled labor poses a major challenge for the industry, which is expected to see continuous growth in annual capacity installation in every IEA scenario. Around $215 billion were invested in the industry in 2021, an annual average growth of 5% over the previous decade, according to the report. Total installed capacity worldwide stood at 740 GW in 2019, comprising 425 GW of utility-scale installations and 315 GW of residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) installations.
Construction of new projects, including manufacturing of components, is reportedly the main driver of employment across the energy sector, employing over 60% of the workforce. Industries with a higher share of workers in construction, like solar, have lower wage premiums than industries like nuclear, oil, and gas, according to the report. The solar industry also has less trade union representation than fossil fuel industries, where labor representation has led to higher wages.
According to the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 14 million new clean energy jobs will be created by 2030, with another 16 million workers shifting to new roles related to clean energy. In this scenario, around 60% of new employees will require at least two years of post-secondary education, making worker training essential to the sustainable development of the industry.
The report also shows that currently women are strongly under-represented in the energy sector, accounting for 16% of the sector’s workforce, compared to 39% of global employment.
“Women make up a very small share of senior management in energy, just under 14% on average. However, there is substantial variation among energy sectors, with the percentage shares in nuclear and coal the lowest at 8% and 9%, respectively, whereas electric utilities are among the highest with nearly 20%. This compares with 16% of women in senior management economy-wide,” the report says. There are no major differences in the share of women’s employment between fossil fuels and clean energy globally.
