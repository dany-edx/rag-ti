The projects shall be awarded through competitive bidding followed by the e-reverse auction. GUVNL may enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders.
The successful bidders shall build solar power projects in Khavda Solar Park on a build-own-operate basis to supply the power.  In the park, six plots of 100 MW each have been earmarked for this tender.
“The plots shall have a fixed capacity of 100 MW and no partial installation of capacity in any plot shall be allowed. Irrespective of the number of plots and capacity quoted by bidder, the tariff to be quoted by bidders shall be single and uniform for all the plots and capacity. Each bidder must place a bid for minimum 100 MW capacity and in multiples of 100 MW only,” as per the tender document.

The cell boasts a conversion efficiency of up to 23.2%. The cell has an open-circuit voltage of 0.68 V, a short-circuit current of 13 A, and a fill factor of 82%.
“The 182mm wafer size is the most economically viable option, based on an in-depth analysis of various geographical conditions along the industrial value chain,” stated Premier Energies, which has an integrated solar manufacturing facility in Hyderabad.
Currently, Premier Energies has a 2 GW module and 750 MW cell (182mm mono PERC) capacity. It plans to grow to 8 GW module, 4 GW cell, and 2 GW ingot/wafer by 2025, with 2 GW module and 1.25 GW cell of this new capacity added within six months.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/03/solis-eyes-growth-in-utility-scale-solar-segment/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 3, 2022",Solis eyes growth in utility-scale solar segment,"At Renewable Energy India Expo 2022, Chinese PV inverter manufacturer Solis showcased its 255K-Plus three-phase string inverter for utility-scale solar segment in India. The new inverter is an upgrade over its earlier version, and offers new features for grid stabilization.
The 255K-EHV-5G-Plus inverter has an output of 255 kVA and boasts a peak efficiency of 99% and greater than 150% DC/AC ratio. It is compatible with 500+ W bifacial modules. The maximum input voltage is 1,500 V.
“We have already supplied 30 MW of our 255 kVA inverters to NTPC’s Rihand solar project in Uttar Pradesh. Commissioning is under way,” Honey Raza, head-India sales at Ginlong (Solis) Technologies, told pv magazine.
The new product launch comes as Solis aims to strengthen its sales in the utility-scale PV market. Solis has supplied a cumulative 2.5 GW of inverters to the Indian solar market. “Commercial, industrial and residential accounts for 70% of our portfolio in India, with 30% from utility-scale. We want to have a balanced portfolio of 50% C&I and 50% utility-scale. We have the experience of installing inverters in utility-scale projects across different terrains in India as well as globally, and we want to further strengthen our presence in this market,” said Raza.
Solis also unveiled new inverters for residential and C&I segments at REI 2022. It has launched storage inverters up to 10 kVA for the C&I segment. Offerings for grid-tied residential solar PV include S5 and S6 series string inverters, which come with arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) protection to reduce the fire risk.
