The $600 million project will have 975MW of wind and solar capacity, supported by Greenko’s hydro pumped storage project to overcome the intermittent nature of wind and solar power generation.
The project will be owned and funded by ArcelorMittal. Greenko will design, construct and operate the renewable energy facilities in Andhra Pradesh, Southern India. The project commissioning is expected by mid-2024.
ArcelorMittal’s joint venture company in India, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India), will purchase 250MW of renewable electricity annually from the project under a 25-year off-take agreement with ArcelorMittal. This will help its Hazira plant meet at least 20% of its electricity requirement through renewable sources, reducing carbon emissions by approximately 1.5 million tonnes per year.
Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said: “This is an attractive opportunity for ArcelorMittal. We will be partnering with a highly experienced energy transition company in a project that will enable our joint venture company AM/NS India to reduce both its electricity costs and carbon emissions, as well as providing consistent, guaranteed returns for ArcelorMittal.
“Large amounts of green energy are one of the key foundations for both a net-zero economy and a decarbonized steel industry. We are excited about the potential of replicating this model in other regions. It demonstrates how establishing partnerships and collaborating across the supply chain can help us progress faster towards our decarbonization targets.”
Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty, chief executive officer and managing director at Greenko, said their partnership with the world’s leading steelmaker would serve as a blueprint for adopting renewable power for large-scale steel manufacturing in India. “These efforts will also represent a notable contribution to India’s own commitment to build 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030,” he added.

The modules provide a peak power output of 566W, with front and back power conversion efficiency of up to 25.72%, according to the manufacturer. The rear-side offers a 10-30% gain in power generation, Gautam said.
The modules use A+ grade mono PERC cells, high-quality transparent backsheets, split junction boxes, and the highest-grade raw materials, the company added.
“[The] G-2X Mono Series will reduce the balance-of-system (BOS) and installation costs and offer a higher power generation of up to 30% in the same available area for solar power plant customers,” said the manufacturer. “This is ideal for megawatt scale solar plants, where maximum power generation per unit of the land area is a very important determinant for the project’s success.”

A Danish-Norwegian research group has designed a metal-based monolithic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) that is claimed to be suitable for transport applications. The scientists explained that SOFCs are generally utilized for stationary applications, in particular with combined heat and power systems, thanks to the high temperature at which they can operate. These devices, however, are generally considered less suitable for vehicles due to their lower power density and the limited thermal cycling robustness of their ceramic anode.
In the proposed fuel cell configuration, the ceramic anode was replaced with metallic interconnects. “The monolith concept integrates the cell support, gas channels, and the interconnects into a single layer, thereby reducing the stack height by a factor of 2–4,” the researchers explained, noting that the metal-based monolith stack is significantly cheaper than a conventional stack. “This considerably increases the volumetric density and specific power of the stack, which are important parameters considering the space and weight constraints in vehicles.”
Furthermore, the high metal content of the SOFC is claimed to lower temperature differences across the stack and offer more robustness to fast thermal cycles during operation, which the scientists said could be important when combining the fuel cell with electric batteries in a vehicle. “Previous work on monolithic SOFCs designs were reported by Saint-Gobain, which developed fully ceramic monolithic SOFC stacks, and by Argonne National Laboratory, which designed metal-supported SOFC stacks (‘TuffCell’),” the research group stated. “However, our concept of metal-based monolithic SOFCs comprises several significant differences when compared to the one developed by Argonne National Laboratory, such as the processing techniques to integrate gas flow channels, the electrode materials and thicknesses, and the concept of integrated seals.”
A monolith SOCF with an active cell area of around 18 cm2 was built through four processes – tape casting, lamination, co-sintering, and catalyst infiltration – which the scientists described as common techniques utilized in fuel cell manufacturing. The device was found to have an open-circuit voltage of 1065mV and a power density of5.6 kW/L, which the researchers said are on par with the best performing fuel cells based on ceramic anodes. ” We speculate that this design, or similar, could enable large-scale production of electrified transportation powered by fuel cells with considerably increased range, decreased charging times, and lower cost,” they concluded.
The fuel cell tech is introduced in the paper Production of a monolithic fuel cell stack with high power density, published in nature communications. The research team includes academics from the Technical University of Denmark and Norwegian research entity Sintef.

Tesla boss Elon Musk insisted on coming to Berlin from California for the official start of production of the first gigafactory in Europe. Just outside the capital, in Grünheide, in Brandenburg, the first Tesla Model Y rolled off the assembly line on Tuesday, and Musk handed it over to the new owners. A total of 30 cars were handed over to customers.
Brandenburg’s prime minister, Dietmar Woidke (SPD), also attended the commissioning ceremony; as did federal chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD); federal economics minister Robert Habeck; and Brandenburg’s economics minister, Jörg Steinbach, and environment minister, Axel Vogel.
“The fact that you have chosen Brandenburg is good for Tesla and good for the future region of Berlin-Brandenburg,” explained Woidke in his speech at the opening of the factory. “Tesla is the outstanding example of Brandenburg’s new economic dynamic. The first European gigafactory attracts a lot of attention everywhere. This ensures that our country becomes even better known as a high-tech location,” Woidke continued. The German state sees good opportunities to attract more investors. There are already plans for lithium-ion battery production in Brandenburg. Overall, a value chain for electromobility could emerge, so Woidke hopes.
Musk tweeted “Thank you Germany” on the day of the opening, in German. He had announced the construction of the factory in Brandenburg in mid-November 2019. However, he only received the final approval two weeks ago. Before that, Tesla built at record speed at its own risk, and with some preliminary approval from the authorities. Numerous requirements still had to be met before production could start. Recently, the factory’s water supply caused a stir but this issue seems to be solved now.
The factory will create thousands of jobs. Tesla plans to produce up to 500,000 Model Y electric vehicles at the Grünheide site in the first expansion stage. The vehicle is an, approximately two-ton, mid-size car in the manufacturer’s range, with a starting price of around €64,000. The range should be around 500km. In addition, a production facility for battery cells will also be set up at the site.
