These projects, commissioned in 2017, are located in Telangana and benefit from long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) with the Southern Power Distribution Company of Telangana.
As per the agreement, AGEL will acquire a 100% stake in Sterling & Wilson’s two special purpose vehicles (SPVs) holding 75 MW operating solar projects. The enterprise valuation of the two target SPVs is INR 446 crore. 
With this acquisition, AGEL will increase its operating renewable capacity to 3,470 MW with a total renewable portfolio of 15,240 MW. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions.
The acquisition announcement follows AGEL’s recent deal to buy SkyPower Global’s 50 MW Telangana solar project at an enterprise value of around INR 317 crore.
Vneet S. Jaain, managing director and chief executive officer, Adani Green Energy Ltd, said, “Strengthening our portfolio through organic and inorganic growth opportunities is an integral part of our vision to build a capacity of 25 GW by 2025 and become the largest renewables company in the world. We will leverage the strength of our platform and capital management philosophy to achieve operational improvements and value-accretive returns from the project.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/24/solar-tariff-rise-due-to-customs-duty-would-cost-discoms-inr9-billion-annually/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 24, 2021",Solar tariff rise due to customs duty would cost to Discoms INR9 billion annually,"India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) says the basic customs duty (BCD) levy on solar cells and modules from April next year will lead to developers quoting higher power tariffs as they face an increase in the overall project costs. The rise in power purchase costs would eventually make solar projects less attractive to off-takers and end-consumers.
The analysts estimate that Discoms would have to pay the developers INR 9 billion/year more due to the tariff hike.
Asmita Pant, a senior analyst at Ind-Ra, said, “The increase in tariffs will increase power purchase costs for solar off-takers by INR9 billion annually, considering that around 10 GW of solar capacity will come on stream in the next 12 months. This amount will keep on increasing exponentially with the commissioning of new projects, till the time the duty is in place or the import costs and the cost of local manufacturing achieve parity.”
Solar module and cell imports are set to attract basic customs duty of 40% and 25%, respectively, from April 1, 2022, as India’s finance ministry has given the green light to the proposal. The BCD would also apply to already bid-out projects. 
Ind-Ra estimates a 20-25% increase in the overall solar project cost when using imported modules under the BCD regime vis-à-vis INR 1.99/kWh in a no-duty scenario.
Tariffs will likely touch INR 2.43 when using imported solar modules with 40% duty applicable and INR 2.08 when using domestically manufactured modules using imported cells compared to INR 1.99 when using imported modules without BGD and safeguard duty.
Currently, solar cell and module imports from China, Thailand, and Vietnam attract a 14.50% safeguard duty (SGD), which is due to expire on July 30. 
Ind-Ra stated, the landed cost of imported solar modules (including transportation and hedging costs) is around 25% less than domestically manufactured panels without considering an SGD of 14.5%. 
However, as BCD would completely replace SGD, imported modules will likely cost 6%-8% higher than the current domestically produced modules. On the other hand, the cost of modules manufactured using imported solar cells will likely be 4%-5% lower than the existing domestic modules prices, as per Ind-Ra’s estimates. 
However, the existing domestic module manufacturing capacity can be a constraint in completely meeting the demand for solar installations.
Tariff rise under the BCD regime is imminent as developers strive to maintain equity returns on solar projects at levels without any duty.
According to Ankur Agarwal, Associate Director, “To maintain a similar equity return on solar projects, the increase in the module cost (60%-65% of the overall project cost) due to imposition of the BCD will lead to an increase in current tariff rate by 40-50 paisa per unit if complete modules are imported and by 30-35 paisa per unit if only solar cells are imported, compared to scenario when no SGD/BCD is applicable on imported cells/ modules. This is due to the fact that overall project cost (landed cost at the project site) for solar plants (considering that no SGD is applicable) is likely to go up by 20%-25%, considering imported modules are utilized”. 
Ind-Ra’s estimates are almost in line (considering that solar cells are imported and modules are manufactured domestically) with the recent tariff of INR2.20/kWh discovered after BCD imposition in the latest solar auction conducted by Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/24/india-can-target-600-gw-renewables-by-2030-with-maximum-50-from-solar-says-a-new-study/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 24, 2021",‘Solar could supply half of a new 600 GW clean energy ambition’,"A new study by U.S.-based researchers has suggested India must aim at least 30% higher than its 450 GW-by-2030 renewable energy target.
The report found 600 GW of solar and wind generation capacity–45% of the total generation mix–could keep Indian power-sector emissions at their 2018 level at a cost comparable to a fossil fuel-dominated grid whilst almost doubling electricity supply.
In carbon-mitigation and customer price terms, the most cost-effective approaches would entail a broad balance of solar and wind power or a power mix concentrated more on the latter, found the study.
The University of California’s Ranjit Deshmukh and Duncan Callaway; and Amol Phadke, from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, studied various energy demand and cost scenarios, operational strategies, and battery storage investments along with differing clean energy mixes, weather patterns, and energy infrastructure networks. The results of the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, indicated renewables would not completely obviate the need for fossil-fuel generation but would better position the nation to exploit clean power.
The researchers modeled the electricity and carbon mitigation costs of reliably operating India’s grid in 2030 in line with achieving renewables capacity of 200 GW, 400 GW and 600 GW to determine the optimal manner of keeping those costs down. The lowest carbon mitigation costs were found to be associated with energy systems in which solar supplied 25-50% of the renewable energy supply in most cases.
The emphasis on wind was explained by Deshmukh, who pointed to its higher capacity factor–the proportion of maximum generation potential likely to actually be delivered–and the high winds observed in the country during monsoon season. The fact wind power, unlike solar, is also available in the hours of darkness would mean grid operators could shutter coal plants during monsoons in a way that is not possible with solar, stated the study.
“Wind-dominated, or balanced wind and solar, targets are more economical and require fewer coal and gas plants,” said Deshmukh, who suggested the emphasis on solar power in India should shift to wind.
India is currently placing more faith in solar, which supplies 100 GW of the nation’s 160 GW variable-clean-power generation capacity target for next year and 350 GW of the 440 GW ambition stated for 2030. However, that apparent imbalance may also reflect the higher capacity factor offered by wind power facilities. Non-hydro renewables currently make up 90 GW of India’s 380 GW power generation capacity.
Weather patterns and peak electricity profiles, however, would ensure India will need to keep building fossil fuel power plants, stated the report, probably coal and natural gas facilities.
Whilst battery storage can even out the supply of solar and wind power, the authors of the U.S. study pointed out: “Battery storage holds promise only if [its] costs fall to an average low of $150/kWh [INR10,900] and if variable RE [renewable energy] penetration is high (600 GW). Variable RE cost declines and coal energy cost growth, both of which are likely, could, together, result in costs similar to a fossil fuel-dominated system, even with 600 GW of variable RE.” That would ensure, as costs fall, battery storage could cost-effectively avert the need for new fossil fuel power plants.
The researchers created 15 solar and wind renewable energy scenarios encompassing the three generation capacity targets reached using all solar; 75% solar; an even split with wind, 25% solar and all wind. The optimal sites for each power source were modeled up to a maximum of 15% of the total generation capacity per state. India’s solar auction price results were used to estimate the levelized cost of energy from the clean power facilities.
Deshmukh emphasized the economics of renewables must be competitive against the likes of coal, stating: “Most of these countries have low historical carbon emissions compared to more industrialized countries. So, the approach we take is that if renewable energy makes economic sense, then those countries should deploy more of it.”
