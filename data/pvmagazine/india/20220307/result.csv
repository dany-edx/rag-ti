A press release issued this morning by Scatec, to announce plans for a 50/50 Omani green ammonia project company joint venture with Acme, indicated plans for the port facility have been scaled up by almost a third.
pv magazine reported Acme’s plans for the Omani plant in August, when the Indian developer said the facility would produce 2,400 tons of green ammonia daily for annual output of around 876,000 tons.
However, Acme founder and chairman Manoj Upadhyay, quoted in today’s Scatec announcement, said: “This facility will have 1.2 million tons per annum capacity of green ammonia production and can potentially be further expanded in the future at the same location.”
With Acme in August having put an investment figure of $3.5 billion on the project – planned for the special economic zone at the port of Duqm – it was not clear how much the raised ambition would raise that sum as the Scatec press release did not include a cost estimate.
Scatec was also vague about the timescale for a project Acme in August said would see its first phase operational this year, with the Norwegian company stating: “The overall schedule for the project is under development, but the partners share the ambition for this facility to be one of the first commercial large-scale green ammonia facilities in operation globally.”
Phase one of the Omani plant, Scatec said, will produce 100,000 tons of green ammonia per year with the help of 300MW of electrolyzer capacity and 500MW of solar generation capacity.
Acme in August said the site would be powered by 3GWp of solar, upon completion, plus 500MWp of wind turbines, and those figures could rise in line with the raised ammonia output capacity today announced for the project.
Acme’s Upadhyay in August said construction at Duqm would begin “soon after” his company commissioned a green hydrogen and green ammonia site at Bikaner, in the Indian state of Rajasthan, to be powered by 5MWp of solar capacity – scalable to 10MW – and to produce five tons per day of green ammonia for annual output of 1,750-1,800 tons.
With Scatec today stating Acme had “set up” what the Norwegian company described as “the world’s first single-location integrated solar-power-to-green-ammonia facility at Bikaner, Rajasthan,” that would suggest ground could be broken in Oman before too long.
Acme’s announcement in August coincided with the developer having signed a land agreement for the Duqm project with Oman’s Public Authority for Special Economic Zones and Free Zones. Scatec today said its JV partner has been developing the green ammonia project for 18 months.
The announcement follows the news, revealed last month, that another Acme-Scatec joint venture – a 900MW solar field, also in Rajasthan – has been put on hold because of a combination of the 40% import duty to be applied on non-Indian solar modules from next month by the Indian government, and a lack of Indian products to fill the resulting shortfall.

The value of solar cells imported from April to the end of last year stood at US$633 million, topping the US$572 million figure reported for the whole of the previous fiscal year.
China was the biggest source of imported solar cells from April to December, accounting for US$578 million worth, with Malaysia the source of US$20 million worth of products, and Thailand banking solar cell trade worth US$16 million in India, according to Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry data.
During the same period of the current fiscal year, India imported US$2.5 billion worth of solar panels, with China accounting for 90% of that trade, with US$2.25 billion worth of exports. Panels from Hong Kong accounted for US$201 million of Indian imports, Malaysia exported US$25.3 million worth of modules to India, and Singapore US$20 million.
In terms of solar module trade flows out of India, for the first nine months of fiscal year 22, the nation exported US$81 million worth of products. The US was the biggest destination for Indian panels, and imported US$59 million worth of them, to account for 73% of Indian module exports.
India also exported US$6.8 million worth of panels to Somalia, from April to year-end, and US$4.55 million worth to South Africa.

Researchers from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia have developed a solar-powered integrated water-electricity-crop production system that is able to produce water from atmospheric water vapor.
“Our system is suitable especially for off-grid communities anywhere as it provides an easy way of getting electricity, water, and crop products for point-of-consumption,” the research’s corresponding author, Peng Wang, told pv magazine.
Called WEC2P, the system relies on a PV system to generate power and an atmospheric-water-harvesting (AWH) material to produce water vapor from the air. The freshwater produced by the AWH device is used either to grow crops or to reduce the operating temperature of the solar modules. The system works in two operation modes, which the scientists called AWH-PV cooling mode and AWH-water and crop production mode.
The cooling device consists of a polyethylene (PE) anti-corrosion film with a thickness of around 0.04 mm, polymer-based atmospheric water-vapor sorbents, and a polyacrylamide-calcium chloride (PAM-CaCl2) hydrogel. “The as-obtained PAM-CaCl2 hydrogel was directly attached to the backside of each individual PV cell in the PV panels via its self-adhesion properties,” the Saudi group explained. “A poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plate-shaped frame was installed by spring bolts to reinforce the adhesion of PAM-CaCl2 hydrogel with PV panel and secure their close contact.”
The excess heat extracted during the cooling operations is used to drive the water to evaporate from the polymer-based sorbents during the daytime. This evaporated water vapor is then collected during the daytime in a condensation chamber that is utilized as a passive condenser.

The surface area of the condensation chamber, which is made of an aluminum alloy with a copper nozzle at the lower sidewall is 1.6 times, that of the overlying four south-oriented PV panels, which were deployed at a tilt angle of 22 degrees. A cotton wick passing through the nozzle was used to help the extraction of the condensed water into a water-collection bottle. “Each PV panel was considered as an independent module and was connected with an MPPT system and a 12-V lead-acid battery,” the scientists emphasized. “Furthermore, each module was connected with a total of 20-W light-emitting diode (LED) light strips as a load to discharge the battery at night when the PV panel was not in operation.”
The performance of this system design, both with and without the cooling system, was analyzed at an outdoor testing facility aimed at growing spinaches located in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, over a 3-month period during last summer.
The proposed system configuration was found to allow a 9.9% increase in power generation thanks to a reduction of the operating solar module temperature by up to 17 degrees Celsius. The small spinach growth unit registered a crop surviving rate of 95%.
The costs of the systems haven’t been estimated so far by the researchers. “The performance is far from being optimized and thus it would be not possible to reasonably estimate the overall cost of the system when scaled up,” Wang affirmed.
The system was introduced in the paper An integrated solar-driven system produces electricity with fresh water and crops in arid regions, published in Cell Reports Physical Science.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/07/swiss-manufacturer-unveils-500w-solar-module-with-23-2-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 7, 2022",Swiss manufacturer unveils 500W solar module with 23.2% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Swiss solar module manufacturer Megasol has launched the bifacial module M500-HC-144-b RC GG U30b with a reported power conversion efficiency of 23.2%.
The company claimed to have improved the efficiency of the panel, which previously featured an efficiency of 22.1%, through a new back-contact technology dubbed “RearCon.”
“By moving the busbars to the rear, we eliminated the problem of self-shading, as every contact on a cell covers cell area with which electricity can be generated,” explained Michael Reist, head of communications and marketing at Megasol. In addition, the manufacturer said it used busbars with particularly high conductivity for the rear contact. “This reduces the internal resistance and, as a result, the ohmic losses considerably,” Reist continued, noting that this also reduces the cell spacing. “In fact, the cell spacing is negative — the cells overlap very slightly by 0.3 millimeters. This gapless stringing leads to space savings and higher efficiency,” he affirmed.
The rated output of the new 144-cell glass-glass module is 500 W. Depending on the albedo of the ground, a bifacial additional yield of up to 30% is possible, according to the product sheet from the Swiss photovoltaic manufacturer.

The dimensions of the module are 2,063 x 1,046 x 30 mm and its weight is 26.5 kg. It features a black anodized aluminum frame and is suitable for use in a temperature range of -40 to +85 degrees Celsius and a maximum system voltage of 1,500 volts. The manufacturer offers a 15-year product and 30-year linear performance guarantee for its new module.
“The RearCon technology requires only about half as many production steps as the production of previously known solar modules with rear contact,” Reist further explained. Which production steps would be saved is a trade secret. However, the cheaper production will affect the overall costs for customers. “We would like to pass this cost advantage on to our partners. That’s why the prices of the RearCon solar modules are significantly lower than what has previously been seen for solar modules with rear contact. That can be 30% or even more,” he added.
Megasol sees significant improvements not only in terms of performance and production costs, but also in terms of appearance, since it is a completely black module. “The contacts on the back of the busbars result in a more homogeneous appearance and thus significantly improved aesthetics of the solar modules,” the manufacturer said. “This is particularly important for use in solar facades.”
