This portfolio will comprise a mix of already operational (300 MW), under construction (500 MW), and under development assets (250 MW). 
AGEL will contribute to the JV the assets and TotalEnergies an equity investment of $300 million to further support their development. 
“[This new transaction] will reinforce TotalEnergies’ strategic alliance with AGEL and support the company in becoming the Indian leader of renewable energy, with a target of 45 GW renewable power capacity by 2030,” stated AGEL.
TotalEnergies has been actively developing, notably through AGEL, its presence in the Indian renewable power market.
“After our first joint venture AGEL23 in 2020 and our acquisition of shares in AGEL in 2021, this new joint venture with AGEL will enable us to speed up our development through direct access to a large portfolio of assets and to support the ambition of AGEL in becoming the Indian leader of renewable energy,” said TotalEnergies chairman and CEO, Patrick Pouyanné.
Adani Green Energy has one of the world’s largest renewable power generation portfolios, with locked-in growth of 20.4 GW across operational, under-construction, awarded, and acquired assets. The company develops, builds, owns, operates, and maintains utility-scale grid-connected solar and wind farm projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/20/how-long-do-residential-solar-inverters-last-3/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2023",How long do residential solar inverters last?,"From pv magazine USA
In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we look at residential solar inverters in their various forms, how long they last, and how resilient they are.
Inverters, which convert the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, come in a few different configurations.  The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters.
In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE) called DC optimizers. Microinverters and DC optimizers are generally used for roofs with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientation (not south-facing).

In applications where the rooftop has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
String inverters generally come with simplified wiring and a centralized location for easier repairs by solar technicians. Typically they are less expensive, according to Solar Reviews. Inverters can typically cost 10% to 20% of a total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly aging components. A common source of failure in inverters is the electro-mechanical wear on the capacitor in the inverter. The electrolyte capacitors have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralized residential string inverter will last about 10 to 15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life.
String inverters generally have standard warranties ranging from 5-10 years, many with the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring through the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.

Microinverters have a longer life, EnergySage said they can often last 25 years, nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Roth Capital Partners said its industry contacts generally report microinverter failures at a substantially lower rate than string inverters, though the upfront cost is generally a bit higher in microinverters.
Microinverters typically have a 20 to 25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfill its 20+ year promise.
The same goes for DC optimizers, which are typically paired with a centralized string inverter. These components are designed to last for 20 to 25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/20/the-hydrogen-stream-worlds-first-green-hydrogen-plant-to-heat-steel/,"ELECTROLYZER,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2023",The Hydrogen Stream: World’s first green hydrogen plant to heat steel,"Hitachi Energy has supplied Ovako with a modular eHouse solution for the electrification of a 20 MW electrolyzer in Hofors, Sweden. The project marks the world’s first steel plant to use hydrogen for heating before the rolling process. Beyond steel heating, the hydrogen will fuel cell-powered trucks, and surplus heat from the plant will support district heating. Hitachi Energy’s delivery includes a modular Grid-to-Stack solution, with components such as transformers, rectifiers, control equipment, and high-current connections to convert alternating current from the distribution grid into the direct current required for the electrolyzer. The company has collaborated on the system’s development with Volvo Group, H2 Green Steel, and Nel Hydrogen.
Enapter has expanded its product lineup with the introduction of the “AEM Flex 120,” a new AEM electrolyzer for industrial and refueling pilot projects. The AEM Flex 120 features up to 50 AEM Stack core modules, ensuring high reactivity to fluctuating renewable energy sources. It can produce approximately 53 kg of hydrogen per day at 99.999 percent purity, with the option for a dryer. This electrolyzer addresses the market gap between Enapter’s AEM Electrolyser EL 4 (1 kg/day) and its megawatt-scale AEM Multicore (450 kg/day), and the company is scaling up its production capacities to meet demand.
The Port of Rotterdam and the inland Port of Duisburg have jointly presented the findings of a feasibility study focused on North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The results show a significant local increase in demand for low-carbon hydrogen, exceeding 3 million tons per year until 2045. To meet this growing demand for green hydrogen in the medium term, the study recommends completing the first hydrogen pipeline between the two ports by 2027. Subsequently, pipelines for hydrogen derivatives and CO2 export should follow, complementing the essential roles of inland shipping and rail transport.
Rina, in collaboration with SEA Aeroporti di Milano and the local branch of the Italian enterprises federation Confindustria, has launched the Hydrogen Valley Malpensa project – Italy’s first hydrogen valley in an airport environment. The project’s objective is to establish a complete hydrogen supply chain ecosystem by September 2027. Participants in the project include Air Pullman, Artelys, Circe, Emisia, and Lhyfe Labs, making it a collaborative effort involving various stakeholders.
Nuvera Fuel Cells has agreed to supply a hydrogen fuel cell system for a reachstacker developed by Hyster, which has been delivered to the Port of Valencia in Spain as part of the H2Ports project. This initiative aims to introduce hydrogen-powered vehicles and equipment into port operations. “The hydrogen is stored in high-pressure tanks and can be refilled less than 15 minutes,” said Nuvera Fuel Cells. “The hydrogen fuel cell charges the batteries, which power the electric motors and hydraulic systems, enabling the reachstacker to lift laden containers with comparable performance to a diesel alternative.”
Irish Rail and Digas have signed a contract for a proof-of-concept project to convert a diesel locomotive from traditional diesel fuel to hydrogen. As part of this €1.5 million project, Irish Rail will provide the 071 Class Diesel Locomotive for the conversion, while Digas will manufacture and install a Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine (H2 ICE). The project’s success could demonstrate a practical and cost-effective means to decarbonize and operate existing diesel locomotives with hydrogen-powered engines, offering environmental benefits for rail transportation.
