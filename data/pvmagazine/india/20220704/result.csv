INR 3,000 crore to set up a greenfield 4 GW solar cell and module manufacturing plant in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu.
The company recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Tamil Nadu government to invest in the state. It will invest the amount over a period of 16 months. 
“The new plant in Tamil Nadu will integrate mono-PERC (passivated emitter and rear contact) bifacial technology with future n-type technology of tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCON) and will produce high-wattage modules with industry-leading efficiencies,” stated the company. 
The facility will implement autonomous mobile robots that use lasers and cameras. It will be a fully interconnected factory comprising smart manufacturing tools and technologies and meeting Industry 4.0 standards. 
Tata Power estimates the plant to directly or indirectly create over 2,000 employment opportunities.
Tata Power is one of the first companies to put a solar manufacturing facility in India in 1991, and since then, it has regularly upgraded the facility. In FY 2021, it set up a mono-PERC cell line at its existing manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, Karnataka. The Bengaluru plant has a production capacity of 635 MW of modules and 500 MW of cells.

It set a world record by completing this installation in 70 days–the fastest ever in floating solar history worldwide. The plant is purportedly India’s first floating solar project installed in brackish backwaters.
State-run power producer NTPC is the project developer, and Tata Power Solar the EPC provider.
Ciel & Terre India’s scope of work included plant engineering, supply and installation of floats, anchoring and mooring system, and floating PV installation up to the DC part.
The plant uses Ciel & Terre’s proprietary Hydrelio aiR 1280 floats to support the solar panels. 1,69,641 Hydrelio aiR 1280 floats were mounted with 1,47,042 of 490/495 Wp Trina PV panels in ‘4 in a row’ configuration–spanning an area of 129 acres and covering 52.6% of the total water body. The installation uses ten 5 MW central inverters.
Ciel & Terre manufactured and delivered its Hydrelio floats in a record five months’ timeline, despite the Covid crisis. It manufactured the floats locally at its on-site manufacturing unit, having an annual production capacity of 300 MW. This strategic placing of the manufacturing plant accelerated project deliverables and saved a huge amount in transportation.
The plant will supply power generated to the grid and power over 100,000 homes, helping to offset 9,26,71,427 tons of CO2 emissions.
“This project is unique on its own as it is installed on salty backwaters of the Arabian sea. Our thorough R&D has enabled our floats to be sustainable in harsh, humid, and saline water conditions,” said Deepak Ushadevi, MD and CEO, Ciel & Terre India. “Also, despite the Covid crisis and extreme weather conditions (heavy rain and wind), we managed to complete the project in a record time.”
Earlier, Ciel & Terre India had commissioned three unique floating solar projects in Kerala, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu with capacities of 452 kWp, 5.4 MWp, and 14.7 MWp, respectively. Over the last four years, it has added six projects under its portfolio with a cumulative capacity of 115+ MWp.

And it seeks public finance support of $360 million to support these first-generation projects that create a public project development experience which can be applied to the next generation of scaled-up projects after 2025.
“The 25/25 plan addresses immediate project development priorities by providing a pathway to the first 150 MW that will help India learn, improve, collaborate and build scalable GW-scale green hydrogen projects in the 2025-30 period,” Amrit Singh Deo, senior managing director, FTI Consulting, and IH2A Secretariat lead.
IH2A had submitted its 25/25 National Green Hydrogen Hub Development Plan to government thinktank NITI Aayog and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India.
The plan recommends the first-generation green hydrogen projects may include 12 industrial de-carbonization projects in chemicals, refinery, and steel industries; three heavy-duty transport projects; three ‘H2 blending in city gas distribution’ projects; and seven distributed waste-to-H2 municipal projects.
These 25 green hydrogen projects can be clustered at five national green hydrogen hubs in Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. At these hubs, multi-sectoral demand for green hydrogen can be produced and used without building expensive new infrastructure in the next three years.
The plan proposes Ankleshwar-Vadodara in Gujarat as National Green Chemicals and Ammonia Fertilizer Hub with a 40 MW electrolyzer plant. It will produce 8,000 tonnes of green H2 per annum for chemical and fertilizer units, reducing 8 million metric tonnes of CO2 emission over a decade.
Bellary-Nellore (Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh) can be developed as National Green Steel and Chemicals Corridor, Pune-Mumbai (Maharashtra) as National Green Steel and Transport Hub, and Kochi (Kerala) as National Green Refinery and Transport Hub with a 30 MW electrolyzer plant each. Each hub will produce 5,000 tonnes of green H2 per annum, reducing 5 million metric tonnes of CO2 within a decade.
The plan proposes Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) as National Green Refinery and Transport Hub with a 20 MW electrolyzer plant, producing 4,000 tonnes of green H2 per annum.
The industry body said government support of $360 million is required to meet capital expenditure on electrolyzers and balance-of-plant (BoP) equipment for the first-generation green hydrogen projects.
It has also proposed the formation of a green hydrogen project development consortia by industry leaders in partnership with state governments and the preparation of state-level green hydrogen policies to create the green hydrogen hubs.

NREL scientists have tried to quantify the operational benefits of combining floating PV generation with hydropower plants.
In “Enabling Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FPV) Deployment,” the researchers considered both the long- and short-term combination of the two energy sources. In their proposed system configuration, the hydropower facility would rely on a grid interconnection capacity that equals its installed capacity. The floating PV array, meanwhile, would be 50% of the nameplate capacity, with its tilt angle set at 11 degrees.
The scientists considered PV curtailment on an hourly, daily, and seasonal basis. They said that the hybridization of the two energy sources could provide benefits from the plant level to the system level.
“Actual hydropower plant flexibility can vary significantly by reservoir size, number of generator units and their characteristics, environmental constraints, and within seasons,” they explained. “For the purpose of our study, we assumed that hydropower was only constrained by available water and a ramp rate.”
They found that the combination of floating PV and hydropower could reduce solar curtailment. “At a system level, the cost optimal operational decision is to maximally utilize low-to-zero marginal cost resources by dispatching solar and conserving hydropower resources for later in the year if the hydropower is flexible enough to do so,” they said.
Floating arrays connected to hydropower facilities could also generate more electricity, thanks to curtailment reduction.
“At the diurnal scale, results suggest that full hybridization could lower generator
operations and maintenance costs and reduce cycling for gas-fired generation by taking advantage of more hydropower flexibility,” they said. “At the seasonal scale, results suggest that hybridizing FPV leads to more optimal use of water resources with hydropower generation reduced in the wet season to conserve water for use during the dry season.”
Looking forward, the NREL researchers said more work is needed to assess system costs.
“This kind of analysis would require more spatially and temporally resolved data, as well as a production cost model that can model at a sub-hourly timescale,” they said.
A similar study was published last year by a research group from the Islamic University of Technology, in Bangladesh. They showed that the two energy sources could be perfectly optimized and that PV could compensate for water shortages during the winter, while hydropower could compensate for poor yields from the floating array during monsoon season.
Scientists have conducted several studies in recent years on the combination of the two technologies. Past NREL research showed that linking solar with hydro in a full hybrid system configuration at every hydroelectric facility in the world could result in the deployment of 7,593 GW of combined generation capacity.
