The facility, at Electronic City, near Hyderabad’s airport, is a 25-acre greenfield project. 
Built for INR483 crore, the plant will have an annual cell and module production capacity of 750 MW. Premier currently boasts 500 MW of module capacity, and 60 MW for cells, at Annaram village in Sangareddy district.
“The plant’s construction is complete and it is expected to be commissioned by April this year,” said Premier Energies founder and MD Chiranjeev Saluja.
The factory, described as having a 1.5 GW capacity by the manufacturer, will be able to produce polycrystalline and mono PERC cells on wafer sizes up to 210mm. Its mono PERC output will have an efficiency of 23% and its polycrystalline cells, 19%, according to Premier.
“The capacity is equipped to process solar panels based on wafer sizes starting from 157mm up to 210mm,” said Saluja. “We are also investing in mono PERC+ cells. Going forward, we are looking at topcon [tunnel oxide passivated contact output]. We plan to launch 500-plus W modules by July using India-made cells.”
The company, founded in 1995 and which exports to the USA, Africa and Europe, sees the new production capacity as positioning it among India’s top five solar manufacturers.
The factory will generate 45% of its electricity from a rooftop solar plant and Premier said its automation and robotics levels would be on a par with leading manufacturers in Asia, Europe, and the USA.
The new facility comes as the manufacturer has reported good revenues, buoyed by robust domestic demand due to the domestic content requirements of state-owned solar projects and a huge national PV pipeline. 
“We earned an INR800 crore revenue for the fiscal year 2019-20 and estimate the same level for 2020-21 as well, despite operations [being] hit due to the Covid-prompted lockdown,” said Saluja. “[With the new capacity in place] for the next year, we are looking at almost doubling our revenues, to INR1,500 crore.”
The Premier MD added, India-made modules have achieved cost parity with imports due to the safeguarding duty imposed on some East Asian products.

The bidding deadline, initially set for February 10, is now pushed to February 24.
Among the tender amendments, SECI has clarified the modules must be domestically manufactured in India. This compliance, however, doesn’t apply to cells.
The tender inviting global bids was floated by SECI in December last year.
As per the tender document, the plant—to be set up in turnkey mode—shall come up at Phyang village in Leh district.
The work scope includes design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing, commissioning of the plant, and comprehensive operation and maintenance for ten years.
Only domestically manufactured bifacial mono-crystalline modules (with front-side efficiency ≥ 19.5%) are allowed for the project. The PV modules manufacturer should have supplied a minimum of 5 GW capacity globally or 500 MW in India in the last five years (as on the last date of bid submission).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/10/virescent-assigned-provisional-aaa-rating-for-its-renewable-energy-invit/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",Virescent assigned provisional ‘AAA’ rating for its renewable energy InvIT,"US investor KKR-backed Virescent Infrastructure has announced that its proposed renewable energy infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) has received CRISIL’s ‘AAA/Stable’ provisional rating for its bank loan facilities.
The InvIT, Virescent Renewable Energy Trust (VRET), is awaiting final approval from the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
VRET is the first renewable energy InvIT in India to be assigned the highest provisional rating of ‘AAA’ from CRISIL. 
The key rating drivers are Virescent’s healthy revenue visibility due to long-term power purchase agreements at pre-determined tariffs. Its track record of enhanced generation capabilities, healthy financial risk profile, and low leverage expectation also worked in its favor. Virescent’s low leverage has resulted in a healthy debt-service coverage ratio over its entire debt tenure, supported by adequate liquidity.  
VRET’s initial portfolio will comprise nine solar energy projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 400 MWp. The assets are located in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. 
VRET aims to achieve approximately 1.5 GW of assets in the initial phase of its growth over the next two to three years. Solar assets are estimated to comprise about 80% to 90% of its portfolio.
Sanjay Grewal, chief executive officer of Virescent, said, “The provisional ‘AAA’ CRISIL rating for Virescent’s proposed InvIT opens up a variety of options for us to raise debt financing at competitive rates from various market avenues, including FPIs, to enhance our liquidity position. The ‘AAA’ rating is reflective of the strong sponsorship of VRET by KKR, in addition to our prudent business strategy centered on building a diversified portfolio of approximately 1.5 GW over the next two to three years.” 
Grewal added that InvITs worth Rs 2 trillion are expected to enter the market over the next five years, and INR 80,000 crore of InvITs are in the pipeline for launch within a year. “The proposed InvIT of Virescent Infrastructure gives us a first-mover advantage to create new long-term and stable investment opportunities in India’s fast-growing renewable energy market.”

The government has committed almost INR1.97 lakh crore to the five-year scheme, which will start in the new fiscal year. Of that sum INR4,500 crore will be set aside for the manufacture of high-efficiency solar modules, with the incentive program applied to the sector by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy.
Under the scheme, the government will incentivize domestic and foreign manufacturers to build gigawatt scale, vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in India.
An MNRE press release about the program, issued yesterday, stated: “The expenditure finance committee (EFC) meeting for formulating a scheme in this regard has already been held. It will now be taken to the cabinet for final approval. The scheme will reward [the] efficiency of solar modules as well as local value addition.”
The solar portion of the production-linked incentive scheme will aim to attract 10 GW of annual, vertically-integrated – ingot-to-module – solar production capacity by the end of 2022-23, according to the MNRE, which also mentioned “direct investment for around INR14,000 crore,” presumably a figure which the department expects the program to attract from solar manufacturers.
