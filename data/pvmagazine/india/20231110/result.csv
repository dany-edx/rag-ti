Revenue for Q2 FY24 stood at INR 259 crore, up by 18.4% yoy from INR 219 crore in the same period last year.
Profit after tax stood at INR 11 crore for Q2 FY24 as against INR 10 crore in Q2 FY23. The company said its Q2 FY24 profitability was impacted by a significant increase in financing costs as a result of the company’s obligation to provide new bank guarantees to secure the massive order inflow.
Genus Power Infrastructures’ total order book now stands at more than INR 19,000 crore. The company expects a steady and significant increase in order volumes in the upcoming months of the fiscal year 2024 as numerous state electricity boards have commenced the bidding process to procure smart meters, underscoring the positive impact of the ‘Reforms-Based, Result-Linked Power Distribution Sector Scheme.’

However, their path to commercialization is paved with challenges, including the need to overcome the narrow electrochemical window in aqueous systems and the poor ionic conductivity in non-aqueous systems.
Now, a research team in HKU’s Department of Mechanical Engineering has designed a quasi-solid-state magnesium-ion battery boasting a voltage plateau at 2.4 V and an energy density of 264 Wh/kg, surpassing the performance of current magnesium-ion batteries, and almost matching the performance of lithium-ion batteries.
Previously, the same research team developed a water-in-salt magnesium-ion battery with an operating voltage above 2 V. Yet, it still lagged behind non-aqueous counterparts due to the dominance of proton over Mg-ion storage in the cathode.
“Hydrogen ions, or protons, are smaller and lighter compared to the metal ions. Because of their size, protons can easily get into the battery’s cathode structure. However, this creates a problem because protons and magnesium ions compete for space, which severely limits how much energy the battery can store and how long it can last,” said Sarah Leong, a HKU researcher and the study’s first author.
The researchers have improved on the earlier design implementing a polymer-enhanced electrolyte to control the competition between protons and metal ions and confine the hydrogen bond network.
“It is a game-changing development,” said HKU Professor Dennis Y.C. Leung. “Our quasi-solid-state magnesium-ion battery combines the best of both worlds, offering the high voltage of non-aqueous systems and the safety and cost-effectiveness of aqueous systems. It represents a major step forward in the development of high-performance magnesium-ion batteries.”
In extensive cycling tests, the research team found that even under extreme conditions of subzero temperatures (-22°C), the quasi-solid-state magnesium-ion battery retained 90% of its capacity after 900 cycles.
The battery is also non-flammable and resistant to high pressure loading, which makes it a promising candidate for consumer electronics, even in colder climates.
“The advanced electrolyte development strategy presented in our research holds potential beyond magnesium-ion batteries, extending to other multivalent metal ion batteries, such as zinc-ion and aluminium-ion batteries,” said HKU Assistant Professor Wending Pan. “We believe that this study will pave the way for the next generation of energy storage solutions that are not only efficient but also environmentally friendly.”
Their findings are discussed in “Next-generation magnesium-ion batteries: The quasi-solid-state approach to multivalent metal ion storage,” which was recently published in Science Advances.

California-based PVEL, an independent test lab for the downstream solar industry, said this week that it has made several upgrades and expansions to its extended reliability and performance tests for solar modules. 
The test lab expanded its Product Qualification Program (PQP), which has been offering accelerated testing services since 2012. The PQP provides empirical data for PV module benchmarking and project-level energy yield and financial modules to identify top performing PV modules. 
The PQP testing helps inform the company’s annual PV Module Reliability Scorecard, which provides actionable insights for solar module procurement. 
“The improvements we’ve made in this PQP update incorporate critical feedback from our downstream partners, research institutes, module and component manufacturers, and our own test results, keeping the PVEL PQP at the forefront of the growing demand for PV module procurement due diligence,” said Tristan Erion-Lorico, vice president of sales and marketing at PVEL. 
The changes to the PQP include: 
Participation in PVEL’s PQP is voluntary for manufacturers and only top-performing module model types are named in the annual PVEL Scorecard. To date, PVEL has tested over 600 balance-of-materials from more than 70 manufacturers for the PV Module PQP.
“The module buying landscape has changed dramatically in recent years with advancements in module technology and new players entering the market, and in response, PVEL has focused our globally-acclaimed test program on addressing these changes,” said Erion-Lorico.
Erion-Lorico was a recent panelist on the pv magazine Roundtables US 2023 event. The session, which focused on emergent trends in solar cells and module production and adoption, can be viewed in full below.
