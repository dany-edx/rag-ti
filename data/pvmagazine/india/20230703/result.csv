https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/03/sodium-ion-vs-lithium-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV BATTERIES,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SODIUM-ION BATERIES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",,"JULY 3, 2023",Sodium-ion vs lithium-ion batteries,"Sodium-ion and lithium-ion are both rechargeable battery technologies, but there are some key differences between the two. Here is a comparison of sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries in the context of India:
1. Energy Density: Lithium-ion batteries generally have higher energy density than sodium-ion batteries. This means lithium-ion batteries can store and deliver more energy per unit weight or volume, resulting in a longer driving range for electric vehicles (EVs). Currently, lithium-ion batteries are more suitable for EV applications. 
2. Cost: Sodium-ion batteries are expected to have lower costs than lithium-ion batteries. Sodium is more abundant and widely available, which can potentially reduce the overall production cost of sodium-ion batteries. This cost advantage could make sodium-ion batteries more attractive for certain applications, especially in countries like India that have limited lithium resources. 
3. Safety and Stability: Lithium-ion batteries have been extensively developed and refined over the years, resulting in a mature and safe technology. Sodium-ion batteries are relatively newer and still undergoing research and development. Safety and stability considerations are important factors for wide-scale adoption in applications like EVs. 
4. Charging Infrastructure: Lithium-ion batteries are currently the dominant technology in the EV market, and thus, there is a well-established charging infrastructure for lithium-ion-powered EVs in India. On the other hand, sodium-ion batteries are still in the early stages of development, and the charging infrastructure for sodium-ion-powered EVs is yet to be developed. 
5. Environmental Impact: Sodium-ion batteries may have a lower environmental impact than lithium-ion batteries due to the availability of sodium as a more abundant and widely distributed resource. Additionally, the manufacturing process of sodium-ion batteries may be less energy-intensive than lithium-ion batteries.
Considering the current scenario, lithium-ion batteries remain the preferred choice for EV applications in India due to their higher energy density, well-established infrastructure, and safety record. However, the development of sodium-ion batteries continues, and they may have potential advantages in terms of cost and environmental impact, making them a promising alternative in the future.

Researchers at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom have conducted an extensive review of all antireflecting (AR) coating technologies for glass used in solar modules in an effort to assess their future prospects.
In the paper “The performance and durability of Anti-reflection coatings for solar module cover glass – a review,” published in Solar Energy, the research group presented all coating designs, materials, and deposition methods, split into two categories – single-layer and multilayer coatings. Furthermore, it provided an assessment of their durability, with a particular focus on their vulnerability to abrasion.
Moreover, they discussed the incorporation of properties such as anti-soiling and sub-bandgap reflection into existing AR coatings.
As for the single-layer AC coatings, the scientists said that the sum of their reflectance and transmittance values at each wavelength should be 100%, noting that this technology is currently the industry standard.
“Because single layers minimize reflection at a single wavelength, reflectance rises to either side of this, making single layer AR coatings less effective over longer wavelength ranges,” they said, however, stressing their current limits. “Also, the need for a low refractive index material means that porous materials are generally used, and this can lead to durability issues.”
Multilayer anti-reflection (MAR) coatings, by contrast, are presented as able to overcome the typical limitations of single-layer coatings, as they have a high and low refractive index, which reduces reflection across a broader wavelength range.
“The most basic type of MAR coating is a double layer coating consisting of one high index and one low index material, both a quarter-wave thick,” they explained, adding that MAR coatings also offer an advantage in terms of durability, as they have no need for ultra-low refractive index materials. They also stressed, however, that these coatings are generally more expensive, which limits their adoption at a commercial level.
When it comes to durability, the scientists said they found that the coatings’ useful lifetimes are under 8 years, although manufacturers usually offer a 25-year warranty for their PV modules.
“Because the AR coating is hydrophilic, with a water contact angle of around 20 degrees, increased soiling has been observed in some locations, causing a power loss greater than the improvement obtained from the addition of the AR coating,” they emphasized. “This emphasises the need for the addition of hydrophobic, anti-soiling functionality for AR coatings on PV module especially for locations with levels of high soiling.”
Looking forward, the team said that the research should focus on improving AR coatings’ durability and multifunctionality, with special attention for anti-soiling techniques. “Further work is required to improve the UV resistance of currently available commercial hydrophobic coatings, and this should be a focus for industry,” it concluded.

Oxford nanoSystems (OnS), a materials technology company, has claimed that its nanoFLUX metallic-alloy coating significantly improves hydrogen production capacity in alkaline electrolyzers by more than 50%. The proprietary coating, which promotes the formation and release of gas bubbles, enhances process efficiency and reduces production costs. An independent assessment by E4Tech has confirmed the cost-benefit advantage. OnS is collaborating with leading electrolyzer manufacturers to test and scale up nanoFLUX production, in order to reduce green hydrogen production costs, according to OnS CEO Ian Russell.
Denso has revealed plans to launch a pilot program at its Hirose plant in July with a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) to produce green hydrogen by electrolyzing high-temperature steam. Denso said that the trial will involve testing the green hydrogen in a prototype power card line at its semiconductor manufacturing plant, serving as a verification of SOEC technology and its application in manufacturing.
The Indian government has said that it actively developing a definition for green hydrogen as part of its plans to shape its hydrogen strategy during a three-day conference in New Delhi, starting on July 5. Indian Minister of Renewable Energy Shri Bhalla said there have been around 48 publicly announced projects on green hydrogen in India. He noted the industry’s strong interest in the green hydrogen opportunity, particularly in relation to green ammonia production, which could yield approximately 3.5 million metric tonnes per year of green hydrogen.
Germany and South Africa have agreed to expand cooperation on green hydrogen and power-to-X products. “Our commitment in this area complements the German government’s efforts to support South Africa in its overall energy transition,” said Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck. “To this end, we want to make an additional €30 million ($32.5 million) available from the International Climate Initiative.” The two countries said they aim to cooperate even more closely in producing, processing, and transporting green hydrogen. 
Gasunie has announced a planned €100 million investment in the construction of the initial segment of a hydrogen network in the Netherlands. Construction will start in Rotterdam after the summer. The Dutch transmission system operator (TSO) said that the €1.5 billion, nationwide hydrogen network will connect key industrial regions in the Netherlands and neighboring countries, including Germany and Belgium, from 2030. The network will facilitate connections between import terminals, domestic hydrogen production sites, and large-scale hydrogen storage facilities.
H2 Green Steel and Swedish shipping company Gotland Company have agreed to explore the possibility of establishing a production plant that could supply part of Gotland’s fleet with green hydrogen. “H2GS will, in a few years, operate one of the world’s largest electrolyzers in Boden in northern Sweden, with a capacity of over 700 MW,” said H2 Green Steel. 
Airbus UpNext has launched a new program to investigate the use of hydrogen fuel cells to generate non-propulsive energy in aircraft. The focus is on the auxiliary power unit (APU), which powers various non-propulsive functions. The company said it plans to replace the APU of an A330 with a HyPower hydrogen fuel cell system in order to reduce CO2 emissions, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and noise levels associated with traditional APUs. In addition, Airbus is conducting tests on a hydrogen conditioning system for supplying aeronautical gas turbines.
Air Liquide and Iveco Group recently reaffirmed their commitment to hydrogen at the inauguration of the first high-pressure hydrogen station (1 ton/day) for long-haul trucks in Europe, in Fos-sur-Mer, France. “This transport solution for long haulage features a fast refueling time at 700-bar pressure,” said Air Liquide. Iveco plans to deliver hydrogen trucks from later this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/03/new-high-performance-anode-material-for-lithium-ion-batteries/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 3, 2023",New high-performance anode material for lithium-ion batteries,"Researchers at the Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences (CeNS), an autonomous institute of India’s Department of Science and Technology (DST), have developed a ternary composite anode material that exhibits stable cycling performance at high rates and could be a potential alternative to the commercial graphite anode in lithium-ion batteries.
The team, led by H.S.S. Ramakrishna Matte, developed an amorphous manganese dioxide (MnO2)-modified iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) ternary composite that addresses the limitations of the bare FeOOH anode arising from poor conductivity and volume expansion. A simple low-temperature synthesis method was employed to obtain a uniform distribution of FeOOH nanorods over the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) matrix, which was further modified with a buffer layer of amorphous MnO2 nanosheets. 
The anode exhibited capacities of 956, 842, and 688 mAhg-1 (milliampere-hours per gram mass) after 200 discharge-charge cycles at the rate of 1, 2, and 5 Ag-1, along with cycling stability of 900 mAhg-1 over 100 cycles at 1 Ag-1. 
The team used various electrochemical techniques to analyze the superior performance of the ternary composite anode. It deduced that the carbon matrix effectively provides favorable pathways for electron conduction and aids in the stable solid electrolyte interface formation. The amorphous MnO2, on the other hand, maintains the structural integrity of the electrode by controlling volume expansion, which is a major challenge faced by conversion-based anode materials. The exceptional stability of the anode at high rates was attributed to the increased pseudocapacitive nature of the FeOOH-rGO-MnO2 ternary composite anode due to the presence of amorphous MnO2.
“The simple and versatile amorphous-MnO2 modification strategy employed to optimize the FeOOH anode in this work could be extrapolated to other conversion-based materials to address similar problems and achieve their maximum capabilities,” said the researchers. 
The research work is published in ACS Applied Energy Materials.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/03/roof-integrated-solar-takes-44-less-time-to-install-on-new-construction/,"HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 3, 2023",Roof-integrated solar takes 44% less time to install on new construction,"From pv magazine USA
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted a time-motion study on solar contractors installing roofing integrated photovoltaics (RIPV) on residential solar projects at several California sites. The researchers published their findings in a publication titled “Observations and Lessons Learned From Installing Residential Roofing Integrated Photovoltaics.”
The study primarily highlighted that new construction RIPV installs very quickly. However, the time required for retrofit RIPV is still comparable to that of standard solar installations. The installation times are still higher for retrofit RIPV, at least in part, due to the application of new techniques and the continued evolution of supply chains.
This analysis was prompted in part by the fact that building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have not kept up with forecast price declines. This is despite the fact that investing in BIPV during the retrofitting of roofing, siding or windows can reduce or eliminate the need for separate solar components. Even when these hardware and labor costs are factored in, the expense of BIPV installations still tends to surpass that of conventional installations.

To further understand why costs remained higher than anticipated, NREL interviewed industry experts and performed time-motion studies at various RIPV residential installation sites.
The research compared the time taken for RIPV installations with that of standard residential solar installations. In the U.S., 32% of the installation costs are attributed to racking and mounting, 32% to electrical work, 20% to meals, breaks, cleanup, and delays, and 16% to travel and installation preparation. Overall, the study found that standard installations required 6.9 worker-hours per kW installed.

NREL conducted its analysis by monitoring two distinct RIPV reroof sites, with each site using a different product. They also observed RIPV installations on new homes at nineteen additional construction sites in the vicinity.
The three field visits were conducted in Central California:
NREL divided the RIPV installation process into four main steps. The process begins with pre-installation tasks including staging, unloading and preparing the roof. This is followed by the placement of fire-resistant underlayment, a task typically performed by roofing material companies, not solar installers. The third step involves the installation of flashings and solar modules, and the final step is the installation of wiring and monitoring.
The most time-consuming reroof step was the installation of flashings and solar modules, which took approximately 2.4 worker-hours per kW and accounted for 60% of the process time of an average installation. On average, the total installation process took about 6.4 worker-hours per kW at reroofing sites, and 3.5 worker-hours per kW at new construction sites.

NREL researchers found that the normalization of retrofit RIPV solar projects in the installation process could speed up installations. The team noted several delays caused by different suppliers delivering materials to project sites, exacerbated by limited product availability and contractors not maintaining sufficient stock. These factors led to unnecessary time wastage for the onsite installation team.
The two reroof projects highlighted that various RIPV systems require differing amounts of time for various tasks, each presenting a unique learning curve. While the NREL report didn’t specify which products were used, it appeared that Reroof A might be a more complex Tesla Solar Roof, whereas Reroof B could be a standard solar shingle product.

The installation complexity of the Tesla Solar Roof has been a known challenge, particularly due to the number of custom pieces required for assembly.
NREL also had the opportunity to observe new solar installations on pristine rooftops. These projects, on average, required a total of 13.2 worker-hours to install an average of 3.4 kWdc of solar, amounting to roughly 3.8 worker-hours per kW installed. This time frame was notably 45% less than the 6.9 worker-hours per kW necessary for a typical retrofit installation.
Inconveniently located vents and oddly shaped roofs often present frustrating challenges for solar designers.
Despite having a clean slate with plywood roofs free of shingles, crews working on new construction suggested that installation efficiency could be improved if architects and solar product manufacturers collaborated more. According to their feedback, aligning roofing materials’ dimensions more closely with those of solar products could increase solar module coverage on the roof, and accelerate solar solar product development by reducing the need for on-site customization.
Looking at specific characteristics, NREL found that projects installed on a single roofing plane were significantly less time-consuming. As expected, electrical work proved to be considerably quicker and easier on homes with bare frames already designed to accommodate specific solar hardware, as compared to retrofit projects involving fully constructed structures.
