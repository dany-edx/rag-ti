Under the agreement, the partners will examine various co-operate opportunities including fuel cell manufacture in India.
Green hydrogen could be a logical move for Adani, given its experience in large scale renewables and electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure. The group sees itself as well-positioned to become a big green hydrogen producer.
Adani’s efforts under the deal signed with Ballard will be led by newly formed green hydrogen subsidiary Adani New Industries Limited, which is focused on production of the energy carrier including via downstream products, green electricity generation and the manufacture of electrolyzers and wind turbines. 
“Green hydrogen is the fuel of the future and fuel cells will be a game-changer in India’s energy transition,” said Vneet S Jaain, director of Adani New Industries. “Our ability to build a world-class green hydrogen value chain will be critical in facilitating the energy transition and we are excited to partner with Ballard, a global leader in fuel cell technology, to create a shared fuel cell ecosystem in India. We will be deploying innovative use cases across our businesses with fuel cell trucks, mining equipment, marine vessels, off-road vehicles, and critical industrial power. We will shape the industry through this strategic collaboration.”
The Adani group, founded in 1988, has a market capitalization of $151 billion, comprising seven publicly listed companies with businesses spanning power generation and distribution; renewables; infrastructure; seaport, airports, shipping, and rail; mining and resources, and other sectors. 
“We are excited to partner with Adani, given [Adani Group chairman and founder] Gautam Adani’s inspiring leadership and the highly complementary assets across the group portfolio,” said Randy MacEwen, Ballard’s president and CEO. “India represents a new growth opportunity for Ballard and we look forward to working with the Adani Group to support and accelerate their energy transition and decarbonization goals.”

Hero MotoCorp will first establish a substantial charging infrastructure at BPCL’s existing nationwide energy station network and subsequently may broaden the collaboration to develop more synergies within the EV ecosystem and adjacent business verticals, thereby enabling prospects throughout the customer life cycle. 
In the first phase, charging stations will be set up across nine cities starting with Delhi and Bengaluru. The network will be then expanded across the country to establish a high density of charging stations. 
Hero MotoCorp will soon commence the infrastructure development in the two cities. Each charging station will feature multiple charging points including DC and AC chargers and will be available for use to all two-wheeled EVs. 
The entire user charging experience will be controlled by a Hero MotoCorp Mobile-App and will be a cashless transaction model. 
Bharat Petroleum, accelerating its focus on new business segments for sustainable growth, had announced last year that it will convert its 7,000 conventional retail outlets into energy stations providing multiple fueling options, which will include EV charging facility also, in the medium to long term.

The collaboration has started on February 4, 2022, for three years duration.
Chockkalingam Karuppiah, chief technology officer, Ohmium, said: “CECRI is recognized as a world leader in electrochemical research. This sponsorship enables Ohmium to leverage CECRI’s deep expertise and resources, which will benefit both our current and the next-generation technology.”
Kalaiselvi, Director, CSIR-CECRI, added: “We’re delighted to work with a technology leader like Ohmium. Our research efforts will focus on material innovation, deployable as a sustainable solution provider.”
Ohmium manufactures electrolyzers in India through a subsidiary. Through its suite of electrochemical products, it enables industries to deploy green hydrogen for a sustainable future.
Arne Ballentine, CEO of Ohmium International, said, “One of the things that makes Ohmium really special is our ability to rapidly translate R&D advances into actual production. It’s a function of our people, our unique modular technology, and powerful collaborations like this one with CECRI.”
“The world must make the transition to green hydrogen to meet its net-zero emission targets. Ohmium’s collaboration with CSIR-CECRI will help ensure that not only is green hydrogen cost-effective but also globally scalable to meet the world’s demand.”

AC Energy Inc (ACEN), the renewable energy arm of Filipino conglomerate Ayala Corporation, has energized a 40MW/60MWh storage facility at the 120MW Alaminos Solar plant, one of the Philippines’ largest operational PV projects.
Called Alaminos Energy Storage, the facility consists of two 20MW storage facilities that are planned to store power when electricity demand is low while also providing rapid power charging and ancillary services to the national grid.
“The facility holds 24 battery containers with SAFT 2.5MWh lithium-ion batteries, enough to power about 20,000 homes and avoid 35.87 metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per year,” the manufacturer said in a statement.

The Alaminos solar plant is located in Alaminos, Laguna province, in the Calabarzon region of the island of Luzon. The plant began commercial operations in June.
Several large scale storage projects were completed or announced in the Philippines over the past months.
The power arm of the Philippines-based brewing-to-energy conglomerate San Miguel Corporation (SMC) recently said it is ready to start operations of an initial 690MW of battery storage facilities. These projects include a 470MW/470MWh portfolio that UK storage specialist Fluence is developing with San Miguel. The first 20MW/20MWh battery energy storage system of this portfolio was commissioned in late January.
