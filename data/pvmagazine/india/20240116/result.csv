[And] the most significant near-term reductions will come from large-scale, vertically integrated projects encompassing the entire supply chain,” Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group, wrote in his blog for the 54th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
“This approach is highly capital-intensive, and vertical integration carries its own risks, such as changes in technology. However, it also promises the greatest acceleration towards the $1/kg mark,” wrote Adani in the blog titled “Reducing costs: The key to leveraging green hydrogen on the road to net zero”.
Adani, in his blog, says green hydrogen holds the key to realize the dream of carbon neutrality across the world. The blog reflects on the viability and potential of green hydrogen as a key alternative to fossil fuel as the world seeks to transition towards a clean and renewable future.
Hydrogen has been known as a potential energy storage medium and can produce electricity in fuel cells with water as the only waste product. To fully realise its potential, Adani emphasises on the importance of its broader adoption to decrease the cost of production, various policy support measures, and adopting the approach of vertical integration by encompassing the entire supply chain to make green hydrogen affordable.
“Companies with backward integration are the only ones who will be able to provide the world with affordable green molecules. The cost of production of green hydrogen must decline from the current $3-5 per kilogram (kg) towards $ 1/kg for widespread adoption,” said Adani.
Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL) from Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) is developing end-to-end solutions to produce globally competitive green hydrogen and its associated sustainable derivatives. Its first project of 1 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) green hydrogen is being implemented in phases in Gujarat. The initial phase is expected to start production by FY2027. Depending on the market conditions, ANIL aims to increase capacity to up to 3 MMTPA of green hydrogen in the next ten years, with an investment of about $50 billion.

Lithium metal batteries could offer far better energy density and much lower weight than lithium-ion technology thanks to the replacement of heavier graphite with lithium metal as anode. However, one of the biggest challenges in the design of these batteries is the formation of dendrites on the anode’s surface, causing the battery to rapidly degrade, short, and even catch fire.
Researchers at Harvard John A. Paulson SEAS have developed a new lithium metal battery that withstand at least 6,000 charging cycles and can be recharged in a matter of minutes.
Their research not only describes a new way to make solid state batteries with a lithium metal anode but also offers new understanding into the interface reaction between lithium and materials at the anode in these type of batteries.
“Lithium metal anode batteries are considered the holy grail of batteries because they have ten times the capacity of commercial graphite anodes and could drastically increase the driving distance of electric vehicles,” said Xin Li, Associate Professor of Materials Science at SEAS and senior author of the paper. “Our research is an important step toward more practical solid-state batteries for industrial and commercial applications.”
In 2021, Li and his team offered one way to deal with dendrites by designing a multilayer battery that sandwiched different materials of varying stabilities between the anode and cathode. This multilayer, multi-material design prevented the penetration of lithium dendrites not by stopping them altogether, but rather by controlling and containing them.
In the new research, Li and his team stop dendrites from forming by using micron-sized silicon particles in the anode to constrict the lithiation reaction and facilitate homogeneous plating of a thick layer of lithium metal.
In this design, when lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode during charging, the lithiation reaction is constricted at the shallow surface and the ions attach to the surface of the silicon particle but do not penetrate further.
“In our design, lithium metal gets wrapped around the silicon particle, like a hard chocolate shell around a hazelnut core in a chocolate truffle,” said Li.
These coated particles create a homogenous surface across which the current density is evenly distributed, preventing the growth of dendrites. And, because plating and stripping can happen quickly on an even surface, the battery can recharge in only about 10 minutes.
The researchers built a postage stamp-sized pouch cell version of the battery, which is 10 to 20 times larger than the coin cell made in most university labs. The battery retained 80% of its capacity after 6,000 cycles, outperforming other pouch cell batteries on the market today, the reserchers reported in Fast cycling of lithium metal in solid-state batteries by constriction-susceptible anode materials published in nature materials.
The technology has been licensed through Harvard Office of Technology Development to Adden Energy, a Harvard spinoff company cofounded by Li and three Harvard alumni. The company has scaled up the technology to build a smart phone-sized pouch cell battery.
Li and his team also characterized the properties that allow silicon to constrict the diffusion of lithium to facilitate the dynamic process favoring homogeneous plating of thick lithium. They then defined a unique property descriptor to describe such a process and computed it for all known inorganic materials. In doing so, the team revealed dozens of other materials that could potentially yield similar performance.
“Previous research had found that other materials, including silver, could serve as good materials at the anode for solid state batteries,” said Li. “Our research explains one possible underlying mechanism of the process and provides a pathway to identify new materials for battery design.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/16/drones-vs-aircrafts-for-pv-plant-inspection/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"JANUARY 16, 2024",Drones vs. aircrafts for PV plant inspection,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the University of Genoa and Italian aerial inspection company Wesii have compared the aerial infrared (IR) thermographic results of PV plant inspections by either classical thermal cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or highspeed thermal cameras mounted on an airplane. Their research included an economic analysis of both remote sensing-based approaches for diagnostic and fault detection.
“The use of aerial drones expedites the detection of faults within a large solar PV plant. However, if the IR camera is not fast, the drone’s moving speed must be relatively low to avoid smearing effects,” the group explained. “An airplane can cover a very large area in a shorter time, resulting in more cost-efficient flights. On the other hand, due to the carrier speed, the IR camera requires high resolution and a higher number of acquired frames per second. These are typically found in cooled thermal cameras, which are much more expensive than standard uncooled cameras.”
For their experiment, the researchers used the DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise Advanced UAV and a human-crewed airplane P2006T SMP. Both have surveyed two PV plants in northern Italy twice and at the same time. System 1 comprises 4347 polycrystalline silicon PV modules, while System 2 comprises 4158 polycrystalline silicon PV modules. Both have an installed capacity of about 1 MW.
In all of its flights, the UAV has used a DJI M2EA thermal camera having an uncooled 640 × 512 microbolometer detector, operating in the 8–14 μm wavelength range. The human-crewed airplane used in the first flight a FLIR A8580 with a 1280 × 1024 cooled sensor operating in the 7.5–12.5 μm wavelength range, while in the second flight, it used a FLIR X8581 InSb, 1280 × 1024 cooled sensor operating in a different wavelength range of 3–5 μm.

“The rationale behind using a different thermal camera during the second airplane inspection was to permit the comparison between thermal patterns obtained by two IR cameras with different spectral responses, specifically the long infrared wavelength range (LW) for the drone and the medium infrared wavelength range (MW) for the airplane,” the academics explained.
Collected visual and thermal images were processed on a computer, identifying and categorizing thermal abnormalities in the PV plants.
“Regarding the most critical defects, such as defective substring, entire module, and a string of modules, 99.6 % of them were detected by both aerial platforms. Furthermore, 87.3 % of modules with single or multiple hotspots, identified by UAV surveys, were also detected by airplane inspections,” the researchers emphasized. “Overall, about 98 % of thermal defects captured by drone inspections were confirmed by airplane inspections, with only a 0.23 K difference in temperature delta.”
The group concluded that the results show excellent agreement, which is encouraging regarding using an aircraft. With those results, the scientists went on to do a comparative analysis of costs.

“While UAV-based inspections, which are the market standard, entail daily equipment and workforce costs not as high as those of the airplane, the latter platform, however, allows for coverage of a larger daily area,” they said. “This implies that a threshold value, based on the size (and capacity) of the inspected plants, is likely to determine which technique is more economically viable.”
Per the Italian test case, the daily cost of a UAV is €800 ($876), inclusive of the expenses for the operators and the uncooled thermal camera rental. Furthermore, the rental cost for the aircraft, including the pilot, is  €2,700 per day and €120 for the cooled camera. However, it can be assumed that the UAV platform can inspect a maximum of about 20 MW in a single working day, while the airplane can do 300 MW.
“The results show that for inspections of any plant requiring more than two working days, and that the use of the airplane is economically more convenient,” the academics said. “Furthermore, the threshold decreases (and conditions for aircraft use become more favorable) if the same amount of PV power is spread across a cluster of smaller plants in the same region.”
The results were presented in “Infrared thermography monitoring of solar photovoltaic systems: A comparison between UAV and aircraft remote sensing platforms,” published in Thermal Science and Engineering Progress.
