The two entities signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on this collaboration.
NIIFL will support TNIDB in identifying potential private-sector investment opportunities like asset recycling and developing greenfield and brownfield infrastructure projects in various sectors including renewable energy.
“Seven projects have been identified across departments which have the potential to attract private investments of approximately INR 5,000 to 6,000 crore. Work on these projects has been initiated,” stated NIIFL.
NIIFL’s ‘Strategic Initiatives and Policy Advisory’ (SIPA) team provides strategic advice to central and state government entities. NIIFL, through its SIPA team, supports the respective departments in project conceptualization and analyzing project attractiveness for private investments and in structuring transactions.
NIIFL will leverage its experience and expertise in the infrastructure sector as well as its experience of working with private capital to support the government of Tamil Nadu.

It is executing these projects through its arms KPIG Energia and Sundrops Energia. 
The offtakers include Creative Technologies, General Polytex, General Petrochemicals, Savalia Texturisers, Rushabh Wire Industries, Rajputana Stainless, and VD Global. 
“The project execution has commenced at the site and the entire capacity is scheduled to be completed by March 31, 2023, in various tranches,” stated KPI Green.
Upon commissioning of the new orders, the developer will reach 63.66 MWp of cumulative installed solar capacity (comprising both captive and independent power generation projects), executed through its arms.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/12/ntpc-switches-on-162-27-mw-solar-in-tamil-nadu/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TAMIL NADU",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 12, 2022",NTPC switches on 162 MW solar in Tamil Nadu,"NTPC, India’s largest power producer, has commissioned 162.27 MW solar capacity in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu. The plant is the first part capacity of NTPC’s 230 MW solar project at Ettayapuram in the Thoothukudi district. The project started commercial operation with effect from December 10, 2022.
The Ettayapuram plant is spread over about 900 acres of land and uses about 1.05 million solar panels of Indian origin. Larsen & Toubro is the EPC contractor for the project. Drone-based digital technologies were used for surveillance and monitoring during the plant construction. 
The project is supplying power to Telangana discoms. “The power generated from the plant is being evacuated from the NTPC solar plant to Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd’s Tuticorin-II, gas-insulated substation through a 19 km long, 230 kV transmission line built by NTPC,” stated NTPC. 
NTPC expects to commission the remaining 67.73 MW of the project this week.
NTPC is developing the Ettayapuram solar PV project under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme of the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy. It won the project in a viability gap funding (VGF) based competitive auction by the Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) in 2019. Larsen & Toubro is setting up the project under EPC with land mode, wherein it is also arranging the land required for the project.
The project employs solar cells and modules made in India as per the Domestic Content Requirement (DCR) clause of the CPSU Scheme and receives VGF from MNRE.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/12/mit-scientists-produce-new-organic-photovoltaic-fabrics/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 12, 2022",MIT scientists produce new organic photovoltaic fabrics,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed fully printed, large-area organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules that could be used as wearable power fabric or deployed in remote locations for assistance in emergencies.
“They are one-hundredth the weight of conventional solar panels, generate 18 times more power-per-kilogram, and are made from semiconducting inks using printing processes that can be scaled in the future to large-area manufacturing,” the researchers said, noting that the thin-film devices can be laminated onto many different surfaces. “Ultra-thin PVs can be prepared on premade substrates such as plastic films and metal foils, or on in-situ formed substrates such as chemical vapor-deposited parylene or solution-processed polyimide.”
The US group built the module’s cells with vapor-deposited parylene as the in-situ formed releasable substrate, a hole-transporting material (HTM) based on PEDOT:PSS, a donor-acceptor pair molecule known as PV2000:PC60BM that was provided by Taiwan’s Raynergy Tek, and coated nanowire films of 7.7 nm, with the deposition of tin-oxide nanoparticles, act as the electron transport layer.
“The photoactive layer of PV2000:PCBM is coated, followed by the hole-transporting PEDOT:PSS layer,” the scientists explained. ” A relatively thick layer of the hole transporting material is coated on top of the active layer to provide sufficient protection from the mechanically abrasive process of screen-printing the silver top electrode.”
They built integrated fabric-PV modules with specific power of 370 W kg−1, weighing 105 g m−2, and free-standing devices with a specific power of 730 W kg−1, wighing 52 g m−2.
“Overall, the ultra-thin device performance was comparable to devices made directly on glass except for a reduction in short circuit current which was ascribed to the reduced transmission from process variation between in-house deposition of the transparent electrode in comparison to commercially procured ones deposited directly on glass,” they said, noting that the current aslo decreased upon delamination due to some wrinkling of the free-standing film. “Such small-scale device tests provided sufficient support to proceed further with the process development of fabricating larger OPV modules.”
They presented the new organic cell tech in “Printed Organic Photovoltaic Modules on Transferable Ultra-thin Substrates as Additive Power Sources,” which was recently published in Small Methods.
“Essential to fully realizing the potential of this work, is the availability of equally ultra-lightweight encapsulation barriers that can protect the active layers of fabric-PVs from atmospheric exposure, which in turn can extend the operational lifetime of these devices, as needed for real-world applications,” they concluded.
