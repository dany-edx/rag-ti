Aggarwal brings to NIIFL a significant experience in the infrastructure and energy sectors. He joined sustainable infrastructure investor Actis in 2008, where he became a partner in 2010. He has driven Actis’ energy investments in Asia including India. Before joining Actis, Aggarwal worked with Citigroup and ANZ Investment Bank in the Indian energy and infrastructure sectors.
Aggarwal’s appointment will be effective in February 2024. He succeeds Rajiv Dhar, who has served as interim CEO and MD since May 2023. Under Dhar’s leadership, NIIFL made significant strides, launching its first bilateral fund, the India-Japan Fund with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), collaborating with the U.S. government on a multi-billion dollar green transition fund, and paving the strategy for successor funds.
NIIFL manages around $5 billion of equity capital commitments across its four funds – Master Fund, Fund of Funds, Strategic Opportunities Fund, and India-Japan Fund, each with a distinct investment strategy committed to support the country’s growth needs.

Fraunhofer IWU has launched an online tool for the sizing of rooftop PV arrays.
The Automated Renewable hOmepower Network (ARON) online platform evaluates the ideal size of PV systems. It considers location, roof pitch, power consumption profiles, and solar module specifications. It can also be used for heat pumps and battery storage.
The researchers offer the tool for free to private households, simulating the local energy yield of photovoltaic systems considering initial investment and energy tariffs. Calculations utilize EU-provided “typical meteorological year” values.
The Hydrogen Lab Görlitz at Fraunhofer IWU is developing a CO2-neutral operation concept for TÜV SÜD’s Leipzig-Stahmeln location using the ARON tool. TÜV SÜD aims to achieve climate neutrality in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. The researchers determined electricity and heat requirements, optimizing designs for photovoltaic systems, a small wind turbine, a heat pump, and an optional battery storage system to achieve a balance between CO2 neutrality and cost-effectiveness.

Square LFP battery cells suffered the biggest blow with a 10.1% price reduction in December, followed by Pouch NCM523 with 7% and Square NCM523 with 6.7%.
“A combination of lower-than-expected market demand and rapid capacity expansion led to oversupply and significant inventory build-up, evident since the third quarter of 2023,” TrendForce said in a press release. “Intense competition in the bidding process pushed centralized procurement prices (bulk orders negotiated on price) below CNY 0.40 ($0.06)/Wh, undercutting the production costs of some manufacturers.”
TrendForce said fewer market orders and suppliers’ need to stabilize cash flows led to the low-price strategies, with consumer demand also cooling in the final month of the year.
But as the electric vehicle market is projected to grow by up to 20% in 2024, and supply chain inventory also expected to normalize, lithium battery product stock levels and prices should return to normal in the second half of 2024, according to the company.
