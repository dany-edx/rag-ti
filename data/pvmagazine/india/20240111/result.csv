https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/11/first-solar-opens-manufacturing-plant-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 11, 2024",First Solar opens manufacturing plant in India,"First Solar, Inc. inaugurated its new manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu, India, with a capacity of 3.3 GW.
India’s first fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing plant will produce First Solar’s Series 7 solar PV modules that were developed at the company’s research centers in the U.S. and optimized for the Indian market, the company says. The facility employs approximately 1,000 people.
“We are pleased that First Solar chose Tamil Nadu for this landmark investment, solidifying our state’s position as India’s hub for manufacturing,” said Dr T R B Rajaa. “This factory sets a high bar for sustainability and advanced manufacturing and has created high-value jobs as a result of its presence in our state, all while supporting India’s ambition to become self-sufficient in solar technology.”
The company reports an investment of approximately $700 million in the facility in India, which includes $500 million in previously announced financing from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the facility is First Solar’s sixth operational factory in the world, with others in the U.S., Malaysia and Vietnam.
“The United States is leveraging American innovation and technology to diversify critical energy supply chains around the world and drive economic growth in India,” said DFC CEO, Scott Nathan. “That’s good for the United States and it’s good for India. This $500 million in financing reflects the increasing strength of our partnership with India – DFC’s largest market and a like-minded partner with a dynamic private sector.”
First Solar reports that its thin film PV modules are produced using a continuous process under one roof that does not rely on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains. Its proprietary, vertically integrated process takes about four hours to turn sheets of glass into fully functioning solar panels, the company says. Each module has a layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor, derived from byproducts of copper and zinc mining, which First Solar says have several benefits compared to conventional c-Si, including lower cost, superior scalability and a higher theoretical efficiency limit.
The Series 7 module produced by the new facility has a carbon and water footprint that is about four times lower than crystalline silicon modules produced in China, the company reports, using 50% less energy and only a third of the water than an equivalent polysilicon module production facility would require.
The factory in India is located in an area of high baseline water stress, and the company says it is believed to be the world’s first net-zero water withdrawal solar manufacturing facility. The facility will rely entirely on tertiary treated reverse osmosis water from the city’s sewage treatment plant and have zero wastewater discharge, expected to relieve stress on the local water system. Additionally, the factory is home to India’s first solar PV recycling plant.
“One month ago in Dubai, COP28 participants issued a bold call for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,” said Ambassador Eric Garcetti. “This First Solar production facility will help advance our global transition to cleaner, greener energy, and stands as a shining example of what can be achieved when the United States and India work together – across government and private sectors – to achieve lasting climate action.”
According to its Q3 2023 earnings report, the company delivered gross margins significantly higher than Wall Street expectations. Gross margins came in at 47%, higher than the consensus of 39%. Gross margins improved based on lower sales freight costs, higher module average sales prices, and a higher volume of U.S.-produced modules, which make them eligible for the 45x tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. First Solar was also the first company to close two separate tax credit transfer agreements, selling $500 million and $200 million of Inflation Reduction Act advanced manufacturing tax credits.
The company continues to grow its manufacturing capacity in the U.S., and expects to have 25 GW of global annual nameplate capacity by 2026.
Founded in 1999, First Solar is among the world’s ten largest solar manufacturers. It sets itself apart, however, by being the only U.S.-headquartered company in the top ten that is not manufacturing in China.

The accreditation, granted by TUV India (TÜV Nord Group), recognizes Susten’s commitment towards planet-positive initiatives and water resource conservation, said the company.
This recognition was awarded after an audit of all project locations in five states: Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. As per TUV India’s evaluation, Susten’s +1.5 GWp of renewable energy portfolio commands a score of 15 (Positive) on the Water Footprint Index implying that water recharged is 15 times over what was consumed.
Deepak Thakur, managing director and chief executive officer, Mahindra Susten, said, “While the solar sector is critical for meeting the world’s renewable energy needs, it has traditionally been water-intensive, which goes against sustainability norms. This is primarily attributed to the constant need for cleaning solar modules to minimize soiling loss and mitigate module performance-related impacts. We have taken a major step towards establishing sustainable operations by having a 100% water-positive portfolio.
Undertaking solar projects in water-stressed areas such as Rajasthan presents substantial problems for any developer in terms of securing the needed amount and quality of water.
Recognizing this challenge, Mahindra Susten initiated a mission to reduce water consumption without compromising the efficiency of solar power plants.
The company adopted a three-step approach to reduce its water footprint:
Mahindra Susten is Mahindra Group’s renewable energy platform. Its RE EPC portfolio includes over 4 GWp of installed capacity. Under independent power producer business, the company has more than 1.5 GWp of operating solar plants and more than 1 GW in development pipeline spread across several states in India. The IPP renewable portfolio is backed by long-term power purchase agreements – around 75% of assets are backed by central government entities and the remaining with distribution companies backed by state governments.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/11/rain-insufficient-for-removing-tree-pollen-from-solar-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 11, 2024",Rain insufficient for removing tree pollen from solar panels,"From pv magazine USA
A collaborative study by experts from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Duke University, Solar Unsoiled Inc., the University of Jaén in Spain, and Sapienza University of Rome, has revisited the assumption that rainfall alone can effectively clean solar panels. In their examination of different pollens at five solar power facilities in North Carolina, the researchers discovered that pollen from tree species such as cypress, juniper, pine, and oak proved particularly stubborn in adhering to solar panels.

During peak pollen seasons, variations in pollen types led to a decrease in solar panel efficiency by as much as 15%. Despite the rain ‘cleanings’, unwashed panels suffered approximately 10% annual production loss. Manual cleaning with a wet brush, after rain, showed a performance increase of 5% to 11%.
The facilities studied, ranging in capacity from 4 to 9 MW, face due south at a 20° angle and have been operational for approximately seven years.
The researchers initially expected minimal soiling losses due to the area’s relatively high average rainfall and short dry spells. In testing, however, they found that the soiling and associated generation losses exceeded their expectations.


In this study, tree pollen was the predominant type affecting the sites during the spring, significantly impacting solar generation. The researchers observed that grass and weed pollens, which peak towards summer’s end, did not correlate with the highest soiling losses on solar panels, unlike tree pollens.
NREL and Solar Unsoiled will continue their research to gain a deeper understanding of the issue. They noted that pollen particles from different trees have varying adhesion levels, influenced by factors such as the size and shape of the grains, the nature of the surfaces they stick to, their compositional properties, and environmental conditions like relative humidity and wind patterns.
Carla Dawson of Soilar Tech, PV soiling mitigation consultants, suggests using a soft, rather than a hard brush when cleaning pollen from solar modules. She states, “Due to the high level of cementation generally associated with pollen compared to dust, it is commonplace to clean with brushes with stiff bristles.”
While stiff bristles can remove pollen in one pass, it can create permanent damage to the anti-reflective coatings on solar panels, “creating a long-term permanent loss,” she said.
Dawson concluded that it’s best to clean panels with high levels of pollen deposition with soft bristles, “and they should  have been tested in laboratories that measure anti-reflective coating degradation levels and water with low TDS levels.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/11/global-solar-irradiance-relatively-stable-in-2023-says-solargis/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 11, 2024","Global solar irradiance ‘relatively stable’ in 2023, says Solargis","According to analysis from Slovakia-based solar data provider Solargis, global solar irradiance remained relatively stable in 2023, while increasing in some regions, despite record-breaking heat and extreme weather events driven by climate change and El Nino.
Australia and Southeast Asia experienced higher-than-average solar irradiance, exceeding their long-term averages by 2% and 10% respectively. Solargis attributed this to favorable weather conditions and reduced cloud cover.
Europe also benefited from higher-than-average solar irradiance, particularly in the southern Nordic region. Most of the continent exceeded its long-term average by between 1% and 7%, thanks to reduced cloudiness and rainfall.
The United States saw stable solar performance, with some regions benefiting from the El Niño effect bringing more sunshine and less precipitation. Solargis said Central America enjoyed stronger than average solar irradiance, while Africa maintained a steady and consistent solar resource.
In contrast, India continued a long-term dip in solar performance, which Solargis attributes to a prolonged and intense monsoon season. Central India was below its long-term average by between 1% and 5%, although Southeast India was up to 5% above its long-term average, thanks to an extremely dry and sunny June and August.
Solargis said extreme weather conditions are presenting challenges to solar projects at the regional level. In the United States and Australia, frequent and severe hailstorms have affected the insurability of projects. The data provider said that solar investors and operators should deal with fluctuating weather conditions by closely monitoring resource variability patterns.
Solargis CEO Marcel Suri said changing global weather patterns could alter the outlook for 2024.
“There is an increased need for stakeholders to closely monitor and analyze solar resource trends. This is crucial for optimizing projects and mitigating the ongoing risks in the face of changing climate dynamics,” Suri said. “As we navigate through the extremes, stakeholders must enhance their monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing capabilities to mitigate risks and embrace the unstoppable ascent of solar power in our global energy landscape.”
