The capacity won in Gujarat includes two grid-connected plants of about 200 MW each. The work scope includes design, engineering, supply, construction, testing, commissioning and operation & maintenance of the plants.
Among power transmission and distribution projects, Larsen & Toubro has won the order for a 765kV double-circuit transmission line package through a project-specific transmission company. This line is associated with the transmission scheme for the evacuation of power from solar energy zones in Rajasthan. 
In West Bengal, orders have been received to supply and install high-voltage distribution systems in certain districts on a turnkey mode. This grid modernization program in semi-urban and rural areas is being implemented by the State with multilateral assistance. Another order to construct 220kV and 132kV transmission lines has been won from the state transmission utility. 
In Tamil Nadu, the business has won a 400 kV substation order. This project aims to meet the Coimbatore region’s future load growth and strengthen the evacuation system of an upcoming pumped storage power plant.
In Qatar, the business has won an order to install line-connected current-limiting reactors for the first time in the country’s network. As the electricity network expands, this 400 kV equipment will help improve grid stability and enable the use of existing switchgear without major replacements.

U.K.-based manufacturer of roof-integrated solar panels, Viridian Solar, has added two new monocrystalline PERC half-cut panels with power outputs of 335 and 340 W to its Clearline fusion range of roof-integrated solar panels.
The company claims that the two products can be integrated with a clean, low-profile aesthetic through rapid installation which is claimed to take less than 45 minutes per kilowatt installed. “The two modules are designed and engineered at our headquarters in Cambridge, U.K. and manufactured by sub-contract partners in Asia,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, without disclosing details on current manufacturing capacity.
The smallest device, called the PV16-335, has a power conversion efficiency of 20.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 42 V and a short-circuit current of 10.3 A. The biggest panel, dubbed PV16-340, features an efficiency of 21%, open-circuit voltage of 42.4 V and a short-circuit current of 10.4 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.

The fresh round of investment takes the startup’s total funds raised to INR 2 crore. It also marks Solavio Labs as the only Indian startup in the cleantech space to receive support from three government bodies—India, Dubai and Canada—in the last one year.
Coinciding with the investment, Solavio Labs also announced its expansion into the Middle East and North American Market. And, to support the growing global demand for PV technology, it intends to scale its manufacturing base in India with the production of 12,000 units by the end of the FY 2021-22.
Suraj Mohan, co-founder, Solavio Labs, said their company had witnessed a phenomenal growth of 125 times in the last year with orders secured from leading developers in India and Dubai. “The recent funding by Canadian province New Brunswick via New Brunswick Innovation Fund is encouraging and we intend to expand our manufacturing facilities in the country to meet the global demand,” he stated, adding PV technology has been the core of Solavio’s accelerated growth.
Started by two engineers, Coimbatore-based Solavio Labs develops artificial intelligence-based solutions to enable autonomous solar panel cleaning. Its system is purportedly compatible with most structures, mounting areas, and climate conditions, and almost 30% lighter than most bots in the market. 
The company recently entered into a long-term Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA). As part of this MoU, it successfully commissioned its first set of autonomous solar panel cleaning bots to pilot at the 1.8MW solar PV carport located within the DEWA head office campus. Solavio Labs has also bagged orders for 100 MW of solar plants globally.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/22/waaree-commissions-16-mw-solar-project-to-power-agriculture-feeder/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,GROUND MOUNTED,MAHARASHTRA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 22, 2021",Waaree commissions 16 MW solar project to power agriculture feeder,"Waaree Energies has announced the commissioning of a 16 MW ground-mounted solar project under Maharashtra’s solar-powered agriculture feeder scheme. The solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor executed the plant for Waacox Energy using its own modules.
Under the solar agriculture feeder program, the Maharashtra State Power Generation Company (MAHAGENCO) awards the installation of 1-10 MW community-scale solar PV power plants interconnected to the 33/11 kV sub-station. The major advantage of this scheme is that apart from ensuring reliable day-time power for the farmers, it requires no capital subsidy from the government. 
Developed in the Warud Taluka of Amravati District, the Waaree plant is expected to generate more than 78,600 MWh power annually. It uses 60,660 numbers of 330Wp polycrystalline solar modules, two inverter duty transformers (rated 6250kVA and 3500kVA), five inverters of 3125 kW. The evacuation shall be at 33kV voltage Level at Temburkhera and Shendurjana Substation.
 “Two-thirds of India’s total irrigated area is powered by more than two crore electric and 75 lakh diesel pumps. [Solar-powered agri-feeders] offer a win-win solution for the farmers, government and discoms. They not only provide a reliable supply of electricity but will also help reduce the subsidy outgo of State”—read a Waaree statement.
