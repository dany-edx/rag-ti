“This partnership advances the [two] organizations’ mutual goal of increasing the deployment of solar, to improve energy access, ensure energy security, and drive the energy transition around the world,” stated ISA in a media release.
Africa50 works with African governments and project sponsors to develop bankable projects that can be financed by the private sector and invest equity in infrastructure projects. Its recent investment in this area is the 400 MW Benban Solar Plants in Egypt, the largest in Africa, which is currently supplying clean power to over 1.5 million people in the country.
The ISA is an international organization with 116 member and signatory countries. It works with governments to ease solar deployment and promote solar power as a sustainable transition to a carbon-neutral future. In addition to strengthening capacity, synergizing policy change, and promoting investments in solar capacity amongst its member countries, ISA is initiating a Solar Finance Facility to mitigate investment risk and a SolarX Startup Challenge to identify and support innovative solar projects for investment.
“There are huge needs for infrastructure, without which development is not possible in Africa. This is at the heart of our roadmap,” said Faure Gnassingbé, President of the Republic of Togo. “The involvement of the private sector in infrastructure is unavoidable and this means we must develop more bankable projects. Government involvement is also essential to attract foreign capital, and this is why governments need to provide a stable, and transparent economic environment that is receptive to economic actors.”
Africa50 and the ISA will engage in mutual capacity building and leverage each other’s networks to mobilize funding and raise awareness of African solar projects in European and Indian markets.
Alain Ebobissé, chief executive officer of Africa50, said, “Clean energy and a sustainable transition are core pillars of Africa50’s investment strategy. ISA and its network represent a wealth of knowledge and connectivity in the solar space that the African continent can benefit from. We are excited to work with ISA to identify, fund, and develop bankable solar projects in Africa which will support the continent’s transition to Net-zero.”
Dr. Ajay Mathur, director general of International Solar Alliance, noted, “Together, ISA and Africa50 embody the potential to empower millions of individuals, ushering in a new era of sustainable prosperity. The collaboration between ISA and Africa50 promises to power many households with clean and affordable energy necessary for progress in countries like Togo and the African continent at large.”
“Together we hope to work on the provision of technical expertise to facilitate the development and execution of solar projects across African nations, joint mobilization of funds to co-finance solar initiatives within the region, leveraging ISA’s extensive network of Member Countries and partners, and Africa50’s access to robust capital markets. Focus will also be on raising public awareness and fortifying capacity-building endeavors for African solar power projects.”

The study found a growing inequality in metal footprints, which are defined in the paper as the total metal ores embodied in the renewable power value chains. The authors said this kind of uneven activity may “hinder the just net-zero transition and climate change mitigation actions” and that there is an urgency “to establish a metal-efficient and green supply chain for upstream suppliers [source countries of metals] as well as downstream renewable power installers for just transition in the power sector across the globe.”
Noting that the amount of metal used in renewable energy infrastructure has increased by 97% in the ten-year period from 2005 to 2015, the paper’s authors examined the flow of metals in seven value chains, including solar, solar thermal, ocean, wind, hydro, bioenergy, and geothermal.
They developed a multi-regional input-output model and a value chain decomposition model that are said to enable the analysis of the activity for worldwide regions and individual countries. They sourced data from Exiobase, a dataset used that estimates emissions and resource extractions by industry, developed by a consortium of research institutes in projects financed by the European research framework programs.
The scientists found imbalances within the global value chains studied and attributed them to the continuous outsourcing of metal demand for the renewable power sector to developing economies. “Developed economies occupy the high-end segments of the renewable power value chain, while allocating metal-intensive (but low value-added) production activities to developing economies,” they also stated, noting that some economies are contributing a considerable amount of metal from their reserves to fulfill foreign demand but have only minimal economic benefit.
The academics presented their findings in the paper “Tracing metal footprints via global renewable power value chains,” published in nature communications. The research group comprises scientists from China’s Shandong University, Fudan University, Guangxi University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), as well as from the University of Maryland in the United States.
“Our results indicate that the trade structure can be modified to mitigate metal supply risk and consumption inequality along global renewable power value chains (RPVCs) among economies,” they concluded. “Import-dependent developed economies can adjust the distribution of traded goods towards metal-efficient sources.”

Water settling at the edges of the panel leads to the accumulation of mud and dirt. If this dirty water is stagnant for long periods, it leads to the formation of hotspots, scaling, and shadowing effects, reducing the panel’s life and power generation.
Prasham’s water-draining clamps can be easily fitted to the frame of the panel to drain the accumulated water and prevent the soiling effect. The company claims its water-draining clamps can improve power generation by 2-10%.
The clamps are made of an ABS-based composite material for high tensile strength and high resistance to physical impacts and chemical corrosion. These are cost-effective, non-toxic, and harmless when recycled.
“Only ABS material is not enough to sustain for a long period in sunlight as it gets brittle. So, we add four types of different chemicals to improve its lifespan to around 10 to 12 years,” Jainam Shah, CEO of Prasham Greens, told pv magazine.
The clamps are available in sizes suitable for 35 mm and 40mm PV panel frames.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/06/solar-to-reach-unassailable-position-as-cheapest-electricity-source-says-dnv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 6, 2023","Solar to reach ‘unassailable position’ as cheapest electricity source, says DNV","From pv magazine USA
DNV, a global risk management firm, has offered its annual outlook on the global energy transition. It placed solar in the spotlight as the frontrunner in renewable energy supply.
“In 2050, solar PV will be in unassailable position as the cheapest source of new electricity globally,” said DNV. 
As the world transitions toward carbon emissions-free electricity generation, DNV expects the share in the generation mix for coal to decrease 4% and gas to fall by 8% by mid-century. As the global fossil fuel industry becomes a metaphorical fossil itself, DNV expects the world energy mix to be 70% reliant on variable renewable sources like solar and wind power. Fossil fuels will represent just over 10% of the energy mix by that time. 
Along this path, solar capacity increases 22-fold in DNV’s energy transition vision. The firm said it views variable renewables as the cheapest and quickest route to both decarbonization and energy security. 

 
Costs are expected to improve by mid-decade. The global weighted average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar is currently around $50/MWh for solar and $120/MWh for solar-plus-storage. DNV expects solar LCOE to drop to $30/MWh by mid-century, with some individual project costs well under $20/MWh.
“The main driver for this reduction in LCOE is the reduction of unit investments costs, which are around $900 per kW as a global average now,” said DNV. “This will fall significantly with every doubling of solar PV installation globally, reaching $650 per kW in 2050.”
Currently, the levelized cost of solar-plus-storage is currently more than double that of standalone solar. A continuous decline in battery prices will narrow this gap to around 50% by mid-century, said DNV.
Despite its higher costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.
“PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants,” said DNV.
In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%. 
“By mid-century, total installed capacity will be 9.5 TW for solar PV and 5 TW for solar and storage. The resulting 14.5 TW of solar capacity is 24 times greater than in 2020,” said DNV. “While solar will have a share of 54% of installed capacity in mid-century, it will account for 30% of global on-grid electricity generation.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/06/japanese-provider-launches-new-aluminum-cables-for-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 6, 2023",Japanese provider launches new aluminum cables for PV systems,"From pv magazine Global
Japanese technology provider GBP Co., Ltd. released last week new aluminum cables for PV installations.
The company claims that the new product offers the advantage of being an antitheft solution, as aluminum costs significantly less than copper, and aluminum cables are less targeted by thieves than their copper counterparts.
GBP said the new aluminum cables are compatible with the international standards 4 mm² x 95 mm², 4 mm² x 120 mm², 1 mm² x 150 mm², 1 mm² x 185 mm², 1 mm² x 240 mm², and 1 mm² x 300 mm².
“The conductivity of aluminum cables is around 60% that of copper cables,” the manufacturer said. “But by selecting an appropriate size, it is possible to achieve the same performance as copper conductors. In addition, since aluminum cables are 30 to 50% lighter and more flexible than copper cables, they ensure an easier installation process, shorten the construction period, and save labor costs.”
GBP claimed that the use of its new cable may reduce the cost of a PV project by up to 10%. “It complies with German standards,” the provider said. “Anti-theft measures such as our aluminum cables are also attracting attention overseas.”
Aluminum is less expensive than copper, but it is susceptible to oxidation. Furthermore, aluminum is also more brittle even at normal temperatures and breaks more easily than copper.
In practice, aluminum cables are rarely used in smaller roof installations and are mostly utilized in large scale PV facilities. These cables require a thicker cross-section than copper cables for the same output and thus also a little more space.

Brazil deployed 4.2 GW of new distributed-generation solar in the first six months of 2023, according to Aneel, the country’s regulator. This included the connection of 365,000 new systems to the grid under the net-metering regime.
By the end of June, the cumulative capacity of distributed PV systems in Brazil, including installations up to 5 MW in size, reached 22 GW. These installations were distributed across more than 2 million arrays.
In the first half of the year, the residential segment accounted for approximately 2.12 GW of the newly installed capacity, while the commercial segment contributed around 1 GW. The remaining capacity was represented by small-scale solar parks.
Among the states, São Paulo demonstrated the highest growth, adding 656 MW in the first six months, followed by Minas Gerais with an additional 460 MW. Minas Gerais currently leads in cumulative capacity with 3,002 MW, slightly ahead of São Paulo’s 3,000 MW.
Eight states in Brazil have surpassed the milestone of 1 GW of installed capacity each by the end of June. Apart from Minas Gerais and São Paulo, these states include Rio Grande do Sul with 2,272 MW, Paraná with 2,140 MW, Santa Catarina with 1,365 MW, Mato Grosso with 1,286 MW, Goiás with 1,023 MW, and Bahia as the sole Northeastern state with over 1 GW, specifically 1,000.235 MW.
Most of the capacity added in the first half of the year came from on-site installations, accounting for 77% of the observed expansion in 2023, totaling 3,264 MW. In cumulative terms, on-site distributed generation represents 77% of the total with 17,229 MW.
