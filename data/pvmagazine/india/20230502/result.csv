The company makes solar inverter and battery storage products and has been exporting 90% of its production.
“We target INR 100 crore exports this fiscal year. We have designed semi-automated/automated machines to enable production with minimal human intervention. These machines span various stages of production like wire cutting and core stacking for transformers,” Kunwer Sachdev, founder of Su-kam brand inverters and now a mentor for Su-vastika Systems, told pv magazine. 
The latest from Su-vastika is an 80 kW lithium battery storage system, which it is pilot testing at its factory. The company has been using this battery storage system together with a 125 kVA diesel generator to run 110 kVA of electricity load at its factory. Whenever the battery goes low, the generator springs into action. 
“This, however, is very rare,” Sachdev said. “Installing the system has helped us to reduce our monthly diesel bill to just INR 3,000 from INR 1.75 lakh.”

The battery of the system can also be charged through solar panels by adding a charge controller. 
“We are designing storage such that you don’t need grid feed. Storage systems designed nowadays keep charging throughout the day via solar. On the other hand, our storage systems can start powering the systems as soon as their battery gets charged up to 25%.”
Su-vastika has also developed a lithium battery tester that it claims to be the first made-in-India product that can test a battery storage system at the cell level.  
“The main reason for battery failure is the voltage imbalance across the cells in the battery bank. The lithium battery testing system developed by us can test the performance and reliability of each cell in the battery bank,” Sachdev told pv magazine.

Su-vastika is banking on lithium ferro phosphate cells for its lithium battery products as these are much safer than NMC and other high-density chemistries. 
“The main reason behind the recent incidences of electric scooter fire was the use of NMC batteries. OEMs used these batteries for their high density and small size. However, after the fire incidences, almost all have switched back to LFP chemistry.”
The company is planning big on lithium battery storage as these are much more reliable, safer, and space-efficient than conventional lead-acid batteries. 
“Our focus is not just to introduce new products in this segment but also to convert the lead-acid batteries in existing inverters with lithium batteries,” said Sachdev. 
“We can make any existing lead-battery inverter lithium battery compatible by adding a battery management system to it,” said Sachdev. “In fact, a normal inverter can also be made solar-compatible by adding a module called a charge controller.”

Researchers from Pandit Deendayal Energy University in India created a model to select the best locations to build new hybrid solar and wind power plants in India. They also analyzed the viability of retrofitting existing standalone PV and wind plants into hybrid installations.
The scientists gathered data about wind and solar resources in India from 1979 to 2019 using the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts software (ECMWF ERA5). They only considered hybrid solar and wind potential installations with installed capacities of 2.8 MW.
The results show that hybridization could increase yearly power output to 10 GWh in most of India and to a maximum of 18 GWh in the west of the country. The peak of standalone solar generation is registered in the northern region of the country at around 7 GWh. Peak standalone wind generation is around 14 GWh in the western region.
The hybrid power exploitability index indicates that most Indian regions are suitable for peak-load demand hybrid installations. Southwestern India is ideal for addressing base-load demand.
The academics also found that seven of the eight solar or wind plants could successfully be retrofitted into hybrid power plants.
“The viability of hybridization has been determined by calculating the growth in electricity generation through hybridization,” they said. “Technically, the project may be regarded as viable if the yearly rise in electricity generation is larger than 50% because 50% of the capacity is new to the system.”
Three standalone PV plants generate 4.94 GWh, 4.82 GWh, and 4.59 GWh per year. Hybridization could boost power generation by 67.4%, 62.9%, and 26.0%, so only two of the three PV plants could be viably hybridized. However, hybridization would be successful in all assessed standalone wind installations, with the increase in electricity generation ranging from 62.3% to 399.2%.
The researchers shared their findings in “Hybrid wind–solar energy and resource simultaneity: An Indian case study for site selection and feasibility check,” which was recently published in the proceedings of The 5th International Conference on Renewable Energy and Environment Engineering.
They said their approach took India as a case study, but could be used for any other part of the world.
“The current approach will also help project developers and policymakers choose the optimum sites for more reliable [hybrid wind and solar] power plants,” they concluded.

Researchers at the University of Mauritius have designed a tracking system that can be used with portable, lightweight PV systems for use in remote areas in tropical climates.
The scientists describe the tracker as a low-cost device using a simplified and mechanically driven tracking mechanism. It can be connected to one solar panel and is able to orientate its linear displacement at each of the four corners of the module itself and make it rotate along the three principal axes. A power screw arrangement driven by DC motors enables the movement of the tracker.
“A motor coupler was used as a connector between the DC motors and lead screw,” they said. “The lead screw had pitch and diameter specifications of 1 mm and 8 mm respectively.”
Through the direction and rotational speed of the motors, PV system owners can achieve their desired tilt angles by precisely adjusting each corner of the solar panel.
“For smooth operation of the solar tracker, the four linear actuators were linked to the main stage by considering a ball-joint system based on aluminum balls of 18 mm in diameter,” they said. “To protect the motor components and electronic circuit from adverse weather conditions, a lightweight protective casing made from aluminum composite panel (ACP) namely, alucobond was used. The protective casing had cross-sectional area and height dimensions of 25 by 25 cm and 20 cm respectively.”
The system moves the panel in accordance with the positioning of the sun based on the sensor data transmitted and processed by the Arduino Uno open-source microcontroller, which follows a voltage difference observed in the corresponding paired sensors due to variation in light intensity.
“The paired motors operate in synchronization but in the opposite direction in order to induce a tilting effect to the solar panels,” they said. “To achieve an optimized orientation in the three principle axes, the remaining two motors also operate in a similar fashion to compensate for tilting of the solar panel in accordance with variation in light intensity as detected by the two additional sensors.”
The academics built a system prototype with a solar module measuring 450 mm x 170 mm with a power output of 22.5 W. The research group said the system was able to generate 37% more current than a reference panel without the tracker.
“The proposed device is projected to produce a total energy output of up to 8100 Wh if operated for 12 h over a 30-day period and if meeting the set target of maximum power output of 22.5 W,” it concluded.
The team described the device in “Low-cost solar tracker to maximize the capture of solar energy in tropical countries,” which was recently published in Energy Reports.
“Rhe cost analysis and portability test showed that the final designed system met the initially set targets in this study,” they said.
