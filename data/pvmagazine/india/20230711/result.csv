SECL plans to develop these projects at a cost of more than INR 1,000 crore ($121.33 million). Some of these projects would be implemented in RESCO (Renewable Energy Service Company) or build-own-operate mode.
Solar power projects of more than 180 MW are already in various phases of development in the operational areas of SECL spread over Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.
“The largest two solar projects under implementation are of 40 MW capacity each. A 40 MW ground-mounted, grid-connected solar PV plant is being developed on the company’s land in Bhatgaon and Bishrampur areas located in Chattisgarh’s Surajpur district. The project is under execution and likely to be commissioned within this fiscal,” stated SECL.
“SECL is also working on a project report for the installation of another 40 MW ground-mounted solar PV plant in the Johilla area in Madhya Pradesh.”
Coal India Ltd targets net-zero status by installing 3 GW of renewable energy projects by 2026 as part of a broader plan to reduce the company’s carbon footprint and move towards a more sustainable future. Recently, it has teamed up with Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd (SJVNL) to explore potential sites for pumped storage power (PSP) projects within its abandoned mines.

The technology holds particular significance for land-scarce countries, including numerous Southeast Asian island nations, as they seek to transition to emission-free economies.
NREL collaborated with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Development Mission for Asia to assess the technical potential of floating PV throughout the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN has set a goal of achieving 35% installed capacity from renewable energy sources by 2025.
NREL has assessed the technical potential of floating photovoltaics (FPV) in 10 ASEAN countries, using a solar data explorer tool.
“[Floating PV] arrays are situated on water bodies such as lakes, reservoirs, or water treatment ponds, where they can be installed alone or in combination with hydropower dams,” said NREL.  
NREL said floating PV is particularly attractive in locations where hydropower infrastructure is planned or already in place and increased frequency or severity of drought may raise pose reliability concerns for hydropower production. Southeast Asia is particularly exposed to this hydropower underproduction risk as it has a strong network of established facilities.
“Additionally, much of the region is covered by rainforest ecosystems,” said Evan Rosenlieb, a geospatial data scientist for NREL. “Siting PV on water can be a way to increase renewable energy generation without deforestation.” 
Southeast Asia is also a hotbed for the growing practice of aquaculture, or raising fish, crustaceans, and aquatic plants in a controlled water body. These sites are targeted as another potential match for floating PV. 
“This emerging combination of aquaculture and photovoltaics, commonly referred to as AquaPV, can allow countries to co-locate energy and food production on existing natural or artificially created water bodies while minimizing the overall environmental impact of both sectors,” said Prateek Joshi, NREL energy engineer.
Joshi and the NREL team said aquaculture and solar may help boost food security in the region, offering dedicated, resilient energy production to critical food sources.
The data accompanying the report are publicly available as a resource for developers interested in learning more about the technical and economic potential of floating PV in the region.
“This data will lead to more discussions and can inform decisions on the potential role of [floating PV] in the region. It wouldn’t have been possible without all the existing work of previous [floating PV] studies and previous RE Data Explorer tool development,” Sika Gadzanku, the NREL energy technology and policy researcher.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/11/dutch-government-mulling-pv-ban-on-agricultural-sites/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 11, 2023",Dutch government mulling PV ban on agricultural sites,"Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy Micky Adriaansens stated in a parliamentary letter that new restrictions are being considered for ground-mounted solar plants on agricultural land.
The provisions could be implemented in July 2024, with initial details expected to be announced in September of this year. It appears that the ban will cover nature grounds and agricultural land.
“With this unclear statement, the dutch solar sector is unable to develop solar plants on agricultural land,” a spokesperson for Dutch PV association Holland Solar told pv magazine. “We think this will have a great impact on of the energy transition.”
The trade body said in a press release that the Dutch authorities implemented initial soft restrictions for solar parks on agricultural land in 2019. These regulations stipulated that large-scale solar projects had to adhere to the “Zonneladder” preference scheme, commonly used by local entities, but it has not yet been formalized as part of the law.
The preference scheme, known as the “Zonneladder,” prioritizes solar rooftop locations over ground-mounted projects. It establishes a hierarchy for assessing location suitability, with large solar parks only allowed if no higher-ranking alternatives are viable.
Holland Solar said the new ban could harm farmers and solar developers. It also noted the importance of local administrations having a final say on authorizations.
“Municipalities can properly assess the situation on site,” it said. “There could be exceptions to the ban, but they have not yet been determined.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/11/using-existing-fences-as-near-zero-cost-racking-solution-for-pv-deployment/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RACKING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 11, 2023",Using existing fences as near-zero-cost racking solution for PV deployment,"From pv magazine Global
 
A US-Canadian group of scientists has suggested using existing fences in animal farms as a low-cost racking solution for solar modules.
“This is perhaps the lowest-cost approach to racking,” the research’s corresponding author, Joshua M. Pearce, told pv magazine. “What we did is show that at least one PV module between two upright posts is mechanically acceptable for every type of conventional farm fencing. In this case, the racking is almost free.”
The researchers identified three main typologies of fencing: fences based on multiple battens placed between the main posts to support the fence wire; fences using posts on which the fence wires or mesh are attached; and fences utilizing prefabricated meshes of various designs suitable to the need and sometimes aesthetics. “Normally for fences, high tensile steel wires and mild steel wire are predominantly used,” they noted. “Their diametric dimensions are generally 4 mm, 3.15 mm and 2.5 mm for high tensile (HT) wire and mild steel wires.”
In order to ascertain if an existing fence may be used for solar deployment, developers should first investigate if the fence can withstand a certain wind load in a specific location with the addition of PV panels, as well as the region’s topological, geographical and climatic challenges. In this regard, the group said special attention should be given to line post size and spacing play, adding that the main factors to be carefully considered are the height of the fence, footing depth, design and size of mesh fabric, as well as the material strength of the posts.
The scientists also explained that wind load measurements should be taken via the Main Wind Force Resisting System (MWFRS) and Components & Cladding (C&C) procedures, as well as by the Open Source Wind Load Calculator, which is a tool used to calculate the wind load on a fence in a given region in the United States. “The program outputs the wind loads in terms of the base shear force in pound force (lbf) and base moment in feet pound force (ft- lbf),” they specified, adding that they calculated for a range of wind loads from 80 mph to 150 mph (129 km/h to 241 km/h).
The academics conducted a series of field tests using three Cheetah HC 72 M monocrystalline PERC panels manufactured by China-based JinkoSolar. They said their installation was performed quickly by two people, with the mounting of a single module requiring seven minutes and a total of four zip-ties.

They also conducted a series of simulations for retrofitting existing farm fencing for a wide range of farms, including sheep, goats, pigs, cows, and alpaca, and found solar projects based on the proposed approach would be economically viable in the United States.
“The cost of the racking retrofit is only the cost of four stainless steel zip ties per module, which can be purchased in 120 packs for $11 or about 37 cents per module,” they explained. “If the modules range in power from 250 to 500 W then the racking cost of an existing fence is less than a penny a Watt.”
Pearce said the research group also laid out what would be an optimal inverter strategy depending on how much energy a farmer would need. “Small-scale farmers can use the free ebook to set up the design for the system, do the install with metal zip ties themselves, and then only need to call an electrician to attach to the grid,” he concluded.
The scientists presented their findings in the paper “The potential for fencing to be used as low-cost solar photovoltaic racking,” published in Solar Energy. “Future work is necessary to determine the full scope of the benefits of this approach of vertical PV agricultural fencing on a global scale,” they said, looking forward to how to improve the proposed methodology.
The research team comprises academics from the Western University in Canada and the Michigan Technological University in the United States.
