In my experience, people who are interested in renewable energy also tend to enjoy nature. Many of us like birdwatching and spotting creatures in their natural habitat but there’s one place wildlife doesn’t belong: near our solar panels.
The biggest problem? Bird droppings.
Birds and other animals are attracted to solar arrays for a variety of reasons. Some like the shine or the shelter they provide, others enjoy the heat they radiate and many like all of those aspects.
As a result, solar panels can pull uninvited guests toward them like magnets. Not being tutored in proper manners, birds and other animals can defecate all over them. This waste is a big problem since it blocks the photovoltaic cells from accessing sunlight.
Indeed, of all the various kinds of dirt, dust, and debris that can fall on solar panels, one study concluded avian excrement has the most deleterious effect on performance. According to the paper, “Bird droppings accounted for about 46.42% to 89.18% of efficiency loss [in solar panels].”
This waste is also unpleasant to look at and if that’s not gross enough, when it is left to bake onto panels, it can cause permanent damage.
The natural movement of birds and animals can loosen panel wiring. When connections are compromised, it can have a negative effect on an entire system and efficiency can suffer. Squirrels also like to gnaw on the wires, for some reason known only to themselves.
Birds and other animals sometimes decide to build nests or burrows among solar panels. The new residents then constantly move around the system, increasing the risk of poor connections.
A build-up of nesting matter can also interfere with the panel ventilation. The empty space between a roof and the panels mounted on it, as well as between the panels, keeps systems cool. The accumulated material that comes with a bird or other animal infestation can lead a solar system to build up heat.
Electrical fires can result from damaged solar panels, and nests can serve as kindling for an even bigger blaze. With this in mind, bird nests and animal dens also constitute a fire hazard.
Moreover, just as high winds and storms can knock panels out of their brackets, so can the jostling of animals. As solar industry professionals know, the angle at which a panel is set is carefully chosen and depends on particular geographic locations, to maximize energy production. Installers measure this angle with pinpoint precision to ensure panel efficiency. Having a raccoon or other critter come along and push the panel out of position can undo much of that painstaking work.
There have even been cases of dangerous insects, such as hornets and wasps building hives in, under, and around solar panels, presenting an obvious risk to people and pets in the vicinity. Nobody wants to get stung and for those who are severely allergic to stings, just one could be potentially fatal.
The good news is that there are ways to dissuade birds and other animals from approaching your solar array. If they don’t dare go near it, they won’t choose to set up house there.
To frighten birds and other critters away from a solar system, the first thing any owner should do is keep their array immaculate. Regularly scheduled cleaning and maintenance, from professionals, is the best way to ensure this.
A predator decoy can also deter animals from moving in. While inert statues of owls and raptors can serve this purpose, in my experience many creatures will quickly detect they aren’t real and might even start using them as roosts themselves.
Technology that moves and appears lifelike is more effective. For instance, kites in the shape of a predator bird can be hoisted onto rods to fly in any breeze. Robotic birds that flap their wings and make other convincing movements are also available.
The more concerned you are with the presence of wildlife around your installation, the more you might want to consider adding audio components to your predator decoy. Soundtracks of attack cries scare animals away and can be pitched at a frequency that humans don’t hear.
In cases of infestation, more drastic measures may be necessary. For instance, after removing all traces of wildlife, system owners may want to put up netting to prevent critters from returning.
Since netting can be unsightly, and may interfere with panel performance, another solution would be to install an electric fence — the same kind of invisible barrier many dog owners use to ensure their pets don’t escape. If an animal crosses the barrier, they receive a minor electric shock that teaches them to stay away in future.
Spikes can also prevent birds from landing on a roof or near a solar array.
Permitting animals to roost in solar panels can cause a massive headache, which is why it’s best to address the issue before it occurs.
Keep wildlife where it belongs — in its natural habitat, rather than rooftop solar arrays.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/22/evaluating-the-performance-of-mono-and-poly-si-solar-pv-technologies-in-eastern-india/,"POLYCRYSTALLINE,SILICON SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WEST BENGAL",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 22, 2024",Evaluating the performance of mono- and poly-Si solar PV technologies in Eastern India,"A study by researchers from the SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ghaziabad, shows monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) solar PV technology outperforms polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) in the tropical wet region of eastern India.
For their study, the researchers chose a remote region in West Bengal known as Krishnanagar owing to its geographical position, attributed to the passing of the Tropic of Cancer and its frequent power outage issues with limited possibilities for expanding the utility grid. As such, the region requires a self-sustainable power generation system. The annual average solar radiation at the selected site measures 4.79 kWh/m2/day, demonstrating the region’s substantial potential for harnessing solar energy.
The study aimed to determine the most suitable solar PV technology for the region.
The researchers evaluated mono-Si PV and poly-Si solar PV technologies on various performance indices such as yield outcomes, losses, capacity factor (CF) and performance ratio (PR), under the region’s tropical wet climate. Meteorological and climatic data was obtained using the PDAV tool of NASA and simulated using HOMER pro software.
The Linear regression (LR) method was employed to assess the degradation rate of both technologies.
The study showed mono-Si PV offered better performance than its Poly-Si PV counterpart, in terms of yield outcomes and losses. The yield outcome with mono-Si PV is approximately 12% higher, whereas losses are around 32% lower than poly-Si PV. The annual average PR for mono-Si PV is 77.5%, against Poly-Si PV’s 72.42%. Correspondingly, the average yearly CF is 16.78% for mono-Si PV and 15.44% for Poly-Si PV.
Results also show that poly-Si PV degrades faster than mono-Si PV; the annual average degradation rate is 0.67% for mono-Si PV and 0.73% for poly-Si PV.
The economic analysis of the two systems reveals that mono-Si PV provides energy at a 9% lower cost than Poly-Si PV, with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.248/kWh for mono-Si PV and $0.273/kWh for poly-Si PV.
The annual average solar radiation at the selected site measures 4.79 kWh/m2/day, demonstrating the region’s substantial potential for harnessing solar energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/22/tiamat-secures-funding-for-sodium-ion-gigafactory-in-france/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV BATTERIES,SODIUM-ION BATERIES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 22, 2024",Tiamat secures funding for sodium-ion gigafactory in France,"Tiamat has announced that it is ready to launch the industrialization of its sodium-ion batteries, which will involve the construction of 5 GWh production plant in northern France.
The commissioning of the first phase of the manufacturing facility with an annual capacity of 700 MWh is planned for the end of 2025, with the full production potential to be reached in 2029. The facility in the Hauts-de-France region will eventually employ more than 1,000 people.
The company will initially manufacture sodium-ion cells for power tools and stationary storage applications in its factory “to fulfill the first orders that have already been received.” It will later target to scale-up production of second-generation products for battery electric vehicle applications.
According to Timat, the new financing round, which brought in €30 million ($32.6 million) in the first phase, will enable the start of the gigafactory construction. Stellantis, Arkema and MBDA were among the new investors, alongside existing investors and the French investment bank Bpifrance.
“We are very pleased to be able to start the industrial project of this project thanks to the renewed support of historical investors and our new partners,” said Tiamat Managing Director Herve Beuffe. “We will be able to produce our technology locally and mass-market it, and this address the issues of sovereignty and availability of materials generated by conventional energy storage technologies.”
Tiamat expects to complete the financing of its industrial project in the coming months with “an additional equity raising of a similar size with the entry of new investors, as well as a mix of debt and subsidies”, bringing the total financing to around €150 million.
Tiamat is a spin-off of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and was founded in Amiens in 2017. It recently became the first company in the world to have commercialized a sodium-ion technology in an electrified product.
The company’s first gigafatory will be located in the so-called “battery valley,” in the Hauts de France region, which has recently become the hotspot of battery manufacturing in the country, after the closure of its mines and most of the steel industry.
Previously, lithium-ion battery makers AESC, ACC, Verkor unveiled plans to establish gigafactories in the region. Taiwanese solid-state battery specialist ProLogium has picked Hauts-de-France for its first manufacturing plant abroad.
Mining and metals group Eramet and environmental services group Suez have decided to locate their EV battery recycling plant in Dunkirk, near the border with Belgium, whereas Chinese group XTC and France’s Orano have unveiled plans for the production of cathode material for lithium-ion batteries not far away.
