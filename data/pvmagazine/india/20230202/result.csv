Greenko order builds on its existing partnership with John Cockerill, including joint development of a 2 GW per year electrolyzer manufacturing plant in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh.
The 300 metric tonnes per day plant is being jointly developed by Greenko ZeroC (GZC), a subsidiary of Greenko Group, and John Cockerill. It will purportedly be the largest green ammonia plant in India to date and will contribute to the country’s efforts to build large-scale green hydrogen production capacity.
“The electrolyzer units will be installed at the Una site.. and will enable hydrogen production with the highest levels of purity (99.999%),” stated Greenko.
The electrolyzers are due to be delivered in March 2024 and the plant is set for commissioning by June 2024.
“Combined with Greenko’s lowest cost round-the-clock renewable energy solutions, utilization of the electrolyzers will make it possible for Greenko to achieve the globally lowest Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH), a metric that indicates how much it costs to produce one kilogram of green hydrogen,” Greenko stated.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/02/tata-power-to-deploy-ai-enabled-smart-energy-management-program-in-mumbai/,"ENERGY EFFICIENCY,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,IOT,RENEWABLE ENERGY,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,MAHARASHTRA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Tata Power to deploy AI-enabled smart energy management program in Mumbai,"Tata Power, one of India’s largest integrated power companies, has expanded its partnership with US-based AutoGrid to deploy a demand response program across its residential, commercial and industrial customers in Mumbai. 
AutoGrid develops flexibility management software applications that allow utilities, electricity retailers, renewable energy project developers, and energy service providers to deliver clean, affordable, and reliable energy by managing networked distributed energy resources in real time and at scale.
The Tata Power demand response program in Mumbai aims to engage 55,000 residential and 6,000 large C&I customers who will earn incentives by curtailing their load in response to the text or email alerts in times of critical need. Tata’s goal is 75 MW of peak capacity reduction within the first six months, and then continue to scale up to 200 MW by the summer of 2025.
“With Tata Power’s new demand response program built on the AutoGrid Flex platform, consumers can earn incentives by choosing to curtail their load in response to signals relayed via text messages and/or email during times of critical need. Because India’s predominant source of energy is thermal power, aggregating small adjustments by consumers can eliminate the need for costly and heavy-polluting plants,” stated AutoGrid.
Consumers’ small adjustments will help India eliminate the need for costly and heavy-polluting power plants. 
Tata Power’s collaboration with AutoGrid started in 2021 with Tata Power Delhi Distribution’s residential customers in Delhi. Based on the success of this engagement, Tata Power significantly expanded the initiative within the Delhi distribution region in 2022. AutoGrid is now extending this program across Tata Power’s distribution territories to include all segments. 
Over the last two decades, India has seen rapid growth in DERs, including solar, smart meters, electric vehicles (EVs), and EV charging infrastructure. The country has a huge opportunity to harness demand-side flexibility, strengthen the grid, and advance sustainability, but the lack of a singular, scalable program has hindered progress in the past. Additionally, the lack of adequate regulatory approval prevents these resources from being utilized at the incredible scale the Indian market has to offer. AutoGrid’s platform has been proven to scale DER management programs from thousands to millions and is, therefore, uniquely positioned to take advantage of India’s opportunity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/02/australian-scientists-unveil-method-to-produce-hydrogen-straight-from-ocean/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Australian scientists unveil method to produce hydrogen straight from ocean,"From pv magazine Global
University of Adelaide researchers have led an international team to the discovery of a method under which water straight from the ocean can be used in a commercial electrolyzer to efficiently produce green hydrogen.
“We used seawater as a feedstock without the need for any pre-treatment processes like reverse osmosis desolation, purification, or alkalisation,” said Associate Professor Yao Zheng, from the University of Adelaide’s School of Chemical Engineering.
The team simply filtered the seawater, which came from the Huanghai Sea in China, to remove solids and microorganisms.
“The performance of a commercial electrolyser with our catalysts running in seawater is close to the performance of platinum/iridium catalysts running in a feedstock of highly purified deionised water,” said Zheng.
The discovery addresses concerns about water scarcity that have lingered around green hydrogen discussions. The researchers have described the ocean as an “almost infinite resource,” accounting for 96.5% of the earth’s water reserves, but it has proven challenging due to the complexities of the water profile. The team’s solution boils down to adjusting the local reaction environment of the catalyst.
The team consists of researchers from China’s Tianjin University and Nankai University, as well as Kent State University in the United States. They published their research in Nature Energy this week.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/02/solar-may-cover-the-worlds-electricity-demand-with-0-3-of-its-land-area/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Solar may cover the world’s electricity demand with 0.3% of its land area,"From pv magazine Global
Solar energy could theoretically cover the world’s electricity demand by just 0.3% of its land area. This is one of the main conclusions of new research by a group of academic institutions, led by Aarhus University in Denmark. The researchers claim that raw materials and land availability will not present real barriers to PV in its race to dominate the global energy landscape.
The scientists claim that, for an average annual generation for solar of 1,370 kWh/kW, 38 million hectares would be needed. They noted that the world has a total area of 13,003 million hectares.
“Hence, our current electricity consumption could be supplied by solar PV covering 0.3% of the available land,” researcher Marta Victoria told pv magazine.
The researchers said conventional assumptions about global PV deployment for the years to come are generally based on land cover and cost projections that chiefly consider classic, densely packed, utility-scale power plants. They claim such projections ignore the potential of vertical PV, floating installations, agrivoltaics, and building-integrated arrays, as well as other innovative PV system configurations.
“Nevertheless, these embryonic applications show that there is still room for innovation at the system level,” the academics said. “In summary, although available land can limit solar PV at local levels, it will not be a limitation at a larger scale, and therefore, we recommend that models include accurate and up-to-date constraints based on materials and land availability.”
The scientists described their findings in “Solar photovoltaics is ready to power a sustainable future,” which was recently published in Joule. They said the efficiency of solar cell technologies will improve significantly in the future, and that could help to address land-limitation issues in specific locations. They also claimed that raw material availability might only be an issue only for thin-film PV tech, and not for crystalline silicon cells, which currently account for 95% of the global market.
“Thanks to the increase in efficiency and the use of thinner contact fingers, the use of silver per watt has significantly reduced in the last years, and copper or aluminum could be used as a replacement if necessary,” the research group stressed. “The noncell materials in PV (glass, plastic, aluminum, concrete, and steel) are not expected to represent a limit either.”
The researchers also reported that solar maintained a learning rate of 23% since 1976 and that the cost of the PV technology dropped by 23% every time the capacity doubled.
“Given that the learning rate is based on module prices, it also includes the elimination of big parts of the margins in PV manufacturing due to strong competition between suppliers,” the scientists said, noting that the main factors for cost reduction are efficiency increases, economies of scale, and scientific work on silicon materials.
The study also presents some challenges PV should face in the next decade. These include the creation of regulatory frameworks that reduce soft costs, reducing capital expenditure, enabling the electrification of other energy sectors via proper tax schemes, and strengthening research on improving PV efficiency and reliability.
