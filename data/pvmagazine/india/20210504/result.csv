The PLI scheme – which aims to drive integrated PV manufacturing, from polysilicon to finished panels – uses the performance of the resulting products and planned manufacturing capacity as parameters for eligibility.
Bharat Bhut, co-founder and director of Gujarat-based Goldi Solar, told pv magazine the PLI scheme provides a much-needed push to build a photovoltaic supply chain in India and sets the bar high for manufacturers. However, he said he felt the policy ignores micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), which will find it difficult to survive against bigger, integrated manufacturers targeted by the scheme.
“Very few companies or joint ventures will be eligible to apply for the scheme, completely leaving out MSMEs,” said Bhut. “Indian businesses usually start as small companies and expand to become bigger and larger organizations. With an integrated approach, only those with large manufacturing capacities will be able to sustain [operations] in such a competitive environment.” The Goldi Solar director said the government should include standalone module, cell, and raw material facilities under the scope of the program.
“Manufacturers from other countries will have an advantage, given their track record, R&D, capital, and experience,” added Bhut. “Indian companies will have to up the ante through R&D to offer better efficiency modules than the current offerings.”
Hitesh Doshi, chairman and MD of Mumbai’s Waaree Group, said the PLI scheme was vitally needed. “India is the third largest solar market in the world but the country imports over 85% of its panel requirements,” he said. “The nation can no longer afford to depend on imports [because of] concerns of losing huge employment opportunities. Hence, this is a great, welcome step, and it will benefit our country in many ways.”
In fact, Doshi called on the government to significantly enhance the budget of the INR4500 crore scheme, to have a chance of weaning the nation off solar imports.
Gyanesh Chaudhary, managing director of Kolkata-based Vikram Solar, is hopeful the government will provide a second tranche of PLI cash for solar manufacturers. “Vikram Solar welcomes the MNRE’s [Ministry for New and Renewable Energy] latest guidelines for the PLI scheme, which is a great and decisive step towards making India aatmanirbhar,” he said. “As a domestic solar manufacturer, we have high hopes from the PLI scheme as it promises to promote solar manufacturing in the country. This would solve the energy crisis, create jobs, increase investment, and bring technological innovation in the sector. It would also help India to achieve the renewable energy target set at the Paris Agreement well within the timeline.”
Chiranjeev Saluja, managing director of Telangana-based Premier Energies, told pv magazine Indian manufacturers are planning significant investments in new cell and module production capacity, buoyed by supportive policies such as state projects which mandate domestic content, the national PLI scheme, and a customs duty on imports proposed from April 1, next year. As a result, India could have a cell manufacturing capacity of more than 10 GW per annum next year. That would create demand for Indian solar ingot and wafer manufacture and, coupled with the PLI and proposed tariff on imported wafers, could drive investment in such ‘upstream’ manufacturing.
Chinese solar manufacturers currently enjoy a cost advantage over Indian rivals due to their large, mature supply chain. Saluja told pv magazine Indian solar manufacturing will be large within three to five years, and populated by multiple companies across the value chain. That will level the playing field for Indian manufacturers, enabling them to further invest in scale and technology and take significant market shares domestically and worldwide, said the spokesperson.
“Some Chinese manufacturers may invest in India to set up large plants but we see that happening in partnership with existing Indian players in solar manufacturing or power project developers,” said Saluja. “The existing cell [and] module manufacturers and power developers in India will be leading the charge.”

The developer bagged the total capacity auctioned by Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (Mahagenco) by quoting a tariff of INR 2.51 (U$0.033) per kWh.
The auction saw state-run SJVN and NTPC Renewable Energy also participate with bids of INR 2.53 ($0.034) and INR 2.82 ($0.038), respectively.
In January this year, Mahagenco had invited bids from solar power developers for setting up 250 MW of grid-connected solar projects at the Dondaicha Solar Park in Dhule. The ceiling price for the procurement exercise had been set at INR 2.83/kWh ($0.038/kWh), valid for 25 years.
The project, spread over a 499.27 hectare area, must be commissioned within 15 months from the power purchase agreement (PPA) date. It must also achieve financial closure within nine months from the PPA.
The project will be divided into three blocks of 50 MW, 75 MW, and 125 MW.
As per the tender document, “For developing solar projects and solar park facilities for 250 MW solar park, Mahagenco has identified 504.71 hectare land, out of which 5.44 ha is already handed over to MSETCL for developing 220/33kV pooling substation. The remaining 499.27 ha (1233.20 acre) land will be handed over to the developer for developing 250 MW solar projects.”
In July last year, Tata Power had also emerged winner of a 225 MW hybrid renewable power project. The project was awarded to its another wholly-owned subsidiary, Tata Power Green Energy Limited.

With federal policymakers pushing to establish a domestic solar manufacturing industry, it has emerged India will provide $131 million (INR968 crore) of soft loans for the government of Bangladesh to develop a 100 MW solar park.
The 325-acre solar project, to be built on a mainly government-owned khas site leased from the Bangladesh Ministry of Land, will take shape with the help of at least 75% of Indian goods and services, under the terms of New Delhi’s foreign credit rules.
Dhaka will directly provide $40 million for the project, with its state-owned Rural Power Company Ltd supplying a further $5.9 million (INR43.6 crore). The solar farm, near the Jamuna river in Bangladesh’s northeastern Jamalpur district, is expected to come online by December 2023 and the authorities are already planning a second 100 MW solar project nearby, with an unnamed Chinese company.
The solar park will provide power to the nearby Mymensingh and Dhaka districts, according to Rural Power Company MD Abdus Sabur.
The Bangladesh Planning Commission has directed a dam planned to surround the renewables project be planted with trees.
Rural Power Company’s Sabur said he hoped development could start soon, provided the plan is approved by the executive committee of the National Economic Council, the highest decision making body in Bangladesh.
The Indian-financed solar park was originally planned for the Bagerhat district in the southwest of Bangladesh but was moved on ecological grounds because bodies of water on that site would have had to be landfilled to make way for the panels.
Dhaka is cranking up its renewable energy efforts after falling far short of its ambition to draw 10% of its electricity from renewables by last year. With around 730 MW of clean energy generation capacity, renewables made up around 3% of the energy mix in 2020.
The nation’s latest five-year plan, which runs until 2025, features “aggressive efforts” to support renewables development and work is under way to update a decade-old national clean energy policy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/04/meyer-burger-unveils-400-w-heterojunction-solar-module/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MAY 4, 2021",Meyer Burger unveils 400 W heterojunction solar module,"From pv magazine International
Switzerland-based solar module manufacturer Meyer Burger Technology AG has unveiled a high-performance heterojunction half-cell solar module, which it claims will provide an additional yield of up to 20% compared to conventional PERC modules.
The module features efficiency up to 21.8% and weighs just under 20kg. “We achieve these industry-leading energy yields and up to 400 W nominal power per module without having to make the modules bigger and bigger like our competitors”, said the company’s managing director, Moritz Borgmann, adding that the new product is significantly lighter than standard panels.
The Meyer Burger White panel measures 1767 x 1041 x 35 mm and weighs 19.7 kg. It is available with wattages ranging from 380 to 400 W and efficiencies between 20.7% and 21.7%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.23% per degree Celsius and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V. It is made with 120 monocrystalline heterojunction half-cells and 3.2mm antireflective glass.
The Meyer Burger Black product has the same weight and dimensions as the white module, as well as its components and electric performance data. It is available in five versions with power ratings between 375 and 395 W and efficiency ranging from 20.4% to 21.5%.
As for the glass-glass version; the module weighs 24.4 kg and measures 1722 x 1041 x 35 mm, its power rating ranges between 370 and 390 W, efficiency up to 21.8%, and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The manufacturer also explained that, due to its bifaciality, it can achieve a combined power of more than 430 W under standard measurement conditions. Bifaciality is commonly defined as the ratio of the output measured from the rear-side of a panel over the output measured from its front side. According to Meyer Burger, the bifaciality of its glass-glass module is around 90%.
The manufacturer also said that, despite the half-cell architecture, the front side of the new products has a homogeneous “full-cell” look. They are being manufactured with the company’s Smartwire technology, which Meyer Burger said prevents microcracks.
The white and black products come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. Their average annual degradation is 0.25% for 30 years and 2% in the first year of its lifetime. The output warranty for the glass-glass panels is 30 years and at least 93% of initial performance is guaranteed.
For the module distribution, Meyer Burger has signed contracts with well-known partners such as Baywa re, IBC Solar, KdiSolar, Krannich Solar, Memodo, Solarmarkt, Solen Energy Europe, and Sonepar Germany. This means that the panel manufacturer is able to cover markets such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Benelux region, Italy, France, Poland, Great Britain, the Nordic countries, and the USA. Further sales partnerships will follow in the coming weeks.
Meyer Burger operates a heterojunction cell production facility in Bitterfeld-Wolfen and a highly automated module factory in Freiberg, Germany. Production at both sites is expected to begin by the end of May. The first modules could then be delivered to customers from July. The initial annual capacity of both factories is 400 MW each, which the manufacturer wants to increase to 5 GW by 2026.

Large-scale solar, with 2.5 GW capacity addition, accounted for 78% of the total annual installations, according to India Solar Market Leaderboard 2021 report by consulting firm Mercom Capital Group.
The Mercom report stated the nation had a robust pipeline of 47.5 GW of utility-scale projects under development at the end of 2020, with another 24.5 GW of tenders pending auction.
The report covers market share and shipment rankings across the Indian solar supply chain for 2020. It shows a shuffle in leadership positions in seven categories during the year characterized by Covid-induced disruption. 
Leading developers and EPC partners
The top ten large-scale project developers, led by Adani, accounted for 69% of the projects installed in 2020.
Engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) service providers saw many projects pushed into 2021 due to delays caused by the Covid-induced disruption and issues in land acquisition, evacuation, etc. 
Sterling & Wilson was the preferred EPC partner, followed by Tata Power Solar.
Rooftop installations totaled 719 MW in 2020, a 35% drop year-over-year. The top ten players installed 66% of the rooftop solar addition. Tata Power Solar led the installations, followed by Fourth Partner. 
Open-access installations grew 56% increase year-on-year due to the increasing interest from corporates. Rays Power Experts, Amplus Solar and CleanMax led open-access project development.
Suppliers
The increase in customs duty on solar inverters didn’t dent market shares of foreign suppliers as many of them already have manufacturing units in India. China’s Sungrow supplied the biggest chunk of central inverters. Rival Huawei led in string inverter supplies, followed by Growatt, GoodWe, and Solis.
The top ten module suppliers, including several Indian manufacturers, accounted for over 68% of the market in 2020. China’s Trina Solar led in terms of cumulative shipments.
Solar mounting structures saw many new players make their place among the top ten suppliers. Domestic manufacturer SNS Corporation supplied most solar mounting structures in 2020, followed by rivals Purshotam Profiles, Strolar and Ganges Internationale Solar. China’s Arctech Solar and USA’s NEXTracker dominated the solar tracker market.
Domestic player Solabot Technologies took the biggest share of solar panel-cleaning robot sales.
