“With rampant imported fossil fuel inflation, energy security is a key national priority,” says report author Shantanu Srivastava, an energy finance analyst at IEEFA. “India is tackling climate change through ambitious domestic clean energy targets and bold policies and reforms to support them.” 
Some of the “big bang” policies include the green hydrogen and green ammonia policy, production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for solar modules and batteries, and market-based economic dispatch to democratize the electricity markets. Other initiatives include general network access and green energy corridor schemes encouraging investment in the grid sector, as well as private ownership through the National Monetization Pipeline and the privatization of distribution companies (discoms).
Key trends
Domestic and international players across the power sector are rapidly scaling up renewable infrastructure capacity in India and are preparing for the next wave of sectoral reforms, states the report. Key trends among large power sector companies include diversifying across the value chain, leapfrogging the competition to adopt zero-emissions technologies, and value-added products and services such as peak power supply, round-the-clock supply, and corporate decarbonization solutions.
Companies are betting on rapidly falling costs of green hydrogen production to exploit its use in energy storage, mobility, fertilizers, refining, and industry. They are also moving into the manufacturing of electrolyzers. Reliance Industries and Adani Group aim to produce green hydrogen at or below the cost of its fossil fuel counterpart, states the report. 
In energy storage, companies are betting on pumped hydro, virtual power plants, demand response management, and battery storage to provide dispatchable and controllable renewables and grid reliability.
Players have participated in the government’s PLI scheme for solar manufacturing, while also acquiring stakes in state discom businesses – integrating the last link of the power sector value chain. One example is private-sector integrated utility Tata Power, which recently acquired the Odisha discom.
In transmission, operators such as IndiGrid InvIT (infrastructure investment trust) and Adani Transmission have been vying for both greenfield and brownfield assets, as government agencies look to evacuate the large renewables generation capacity planned in the country. As power markets become more democratized and integrated, companies see opportunities in power trading through exchanges and contracting with customers through open access and merchant capacities. 
Several industry players have diversified from commoditized electricity generation, distribution, and transmission to providing value-added products such as peak power supply, round-the-clock supply and corporate decarbonization solutions, which fetch higher margins and offer growth prospects in a fast-evolving energy economy.
“For India to accelerate its transition path,” Srivastava says, “it is imperative to build momentum in clean energy investments through such policies and corporate actions. This, in turn, depends on clarity and integrity on the policy front and the availability of cost-effective, long-term financing to fuel the ambitious long-dated infrastructure plans of industry players.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/04/transport-minister-calls-for-needs-based-research-on-battery-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ASIA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 4, 2022",Transport minister calls for needs-based research on battery storage,"Nitin Gadkari, India’s minister of road transport and highways, has called for the development of appropriate battery storage chemistries for specific Indian conditions. He said manufacturers and developers need to consider economic and social factors, including the availability and cost of raw materials, while also stressing the need for battery standardization.
Annual battery demand in India could rise to 260 GWh by 2030, said the minister.
“Lithium-ion is an important battery chemistry, but it needs more research, especially considering the recent fire incidences,” he said at the 8th edition of India Energy Storage Week (IESW) 2022, which kicked off this week in New Delhi.
Vikram Handa, managing director of Maharashtra-based Epsilon Materials, said energy is a significant part of the battery cost structure. And India is very well positioned to develop the battery supply chain, owing to its advantage in one of the key raw materials: renewable power.
“A 30 GWh NCM li-ion factory consumes 80,000 tonnes of flake graphite, 45,000 tonnes of synthetic graphite, 25,000 tonnes of lithium, 6,000 tonnes of cobalt, and 19,000 tonnes of nickel annually. But it’s interesting to understand that the biggest contributor to the cost of a battery cell is not the raw materials, but energy,” said Handa.
Epsilon Carbon is a coal tar derivatives company that announced its foray into the lithium-ion battery materials business last year with the commissioning of a facility to produce 5000 tonnes of synthetic graphite anode materials per year. The company plans to triple this unit capacity to 15,000 tonnes in 2021 and further expand to 50,000 tonnes per annum by 2025. 
Neogen, another company from Maharashtra, focuses on electrolyte salt manufacturing, customized electrolytes, and lithium ferro phosphate (LFP) cathode materials.
“With its own salt manufacturing, Neogen can increase value addition and reduce supply chain complexity for electrolyte supply,” said Harin Kanani, managing director of Neogen Chemicals, a company specializing in bromine-based compounds and inorganic lithium salts.  
The India Energy Storage Alliance forecasts that the Indian energy storage industry will grow at around 24% per year, primarily driven by demand from the electric mobility sector. It expects the Indian electric vehicle industry to expand at 36% per year until 2026. The EV battery market is expected to increase by 30% per year during the forecast period.

The UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) recently granted GBP 350,000 to a consortium featuring the Birmingham Centre for Energy Storage (BCES), Aggregate Industries, and Innovatium, a developer of liquid air energy storage (LAES) systems.
“The funding will be used to take the innovative Peak Reduction by Integrated Storage and Management of Air (Prisma) system from laboratory scale testing to demonstration level at Aggregate Industries’ Cauldon Cement Works in Staffordshire,” the BCES said in a statement. “This will be a key step in the Prisma system’s journey to full commercialization.”
The Prisma systems will be manufactured in northeastern England, with the aim of installing the first industrial-scale, behind-the- meter system in early 2023. “On the back of the demonstration at Aggregate Industries, Innovatium have currently closed an investment round of GBP 900,000 for product development of Prisma,” the director of the BCES, Yulong Ding, told pv magazine.
The LAES system stores thermal energy in liquid air form to provide onsite compressed air and works through a latent energy cold storage tank filled with a phase-change material (PCM) designed and tested by Innovatium, in partnership with the University of Birmingham. It is applied in an existing compressed air network operated by Aggregate Industries. PCMs can absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range and have often been used, at the research level, for PV module cooling.
The PCM materials used for liquid air energy storage operate at cryogenic temperatures below -150 C. They store and discharge huge amounts of thermal energy between the freezing and melting cycle.
“Innovatium’s is currently working with researchers at Birmingham and Strathclyde University to develop a special formulation that does not degrade over time and is safer and environmentally friendlier than conventional batteries,” Ding said.
Two PCMs were developed with phase-change temperatures of around -100 C and -160 C. The PCMs are composite materials, typically made of a PCM, a structural stabilization material and a heat transfer enhancement material.
During the charging phase, which takes place in off-peak hours, the system utilizes excess electricity from renewable energy sources and stores it in the form of liquid air through an air liquefaction process. During this process, liquid air is compressed, cooled down by a packed bed cold store, liquified by the stored cold in the PCM store and, eventually, during discharge it is expanded to produce compressed air for the client’s factory.
The cold energy of liquid air is also stored during discharge for re-use in the liquefaction process to reduce power consumption. This technology can be applied to generate electricity in an air expansion turbine when combined with a heat store or heat source.
The Prisma system uses liquid air as its energy storage medium that is 700 times as dense as ambient air.
“This system can provide hours of backup compressed air to industrial consumers and act as a large buffer store that allows air compressors to run more efficiently by reducing the part-load inefficiencies that are common to all compressed air systems,” Ding emphasized.
The consortium said the system design and the integration of the equipment and components has never been attempted for the provision of compressed air in an industrial setting. The fully developed system has a targeted installed cost of GBP 400/kWh.
“Innovatium do point out however that there is no degradation or limit to cycling that gives an expected levelized cost of storage of GBP 114/MWh. Their feedback from the market suggests that the commercial offering would suit a PPA especially when coupled with a solar PPA,” Ding concluded. “Our estimated LCOE is $0.15/kWh to $0.30/kWh.”

Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp has unveiled the NB-JD540 solar panel, a bifacial double-glass monocrystalline PERC product with a 20.9% efficiency rating and 540 W of power output.
The IEC 61215- and IEC 61730-certified panel features 144 half-cells based on M10 wafers and a 10-busbar design. It has overall dimensions of 2,278 mm × 1,134 mm × 3.0 mm and weighs in at 32.5 kg, with the front and back glass layers measuring 2 mm thick.
The panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V and an operating temperature between -40 C and 85 C. It comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.349% per degree Celsius and its power tolerance reaches up to 5%, the manufacturer claims.
“Like all Sharp half-cell modules, the NB-JD540 has three small junction boxes instead of just one, each fitted with one bypass diode,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “These junction boxes are transferring less heat to the cells above and in turn boost the longevity of the panels and the overall performance of the system.”
The new product is purportedly resistant under extreme conditions, as it has passed tests for ammonia, salt mist, sand and potential induced degradation (PID) resistance.
