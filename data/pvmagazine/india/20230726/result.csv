The two companies, through their arms ReNew Power and Gentari Renewables India, executed key terms for a 50:50 joint venture in clean energy solutions. The term sheet was exchanged between Sushil Purohit, chief executive officer of Gentari, and Sumant Sinha, founder, chairman and CEO of ReNew.
The proposed joint venture between Gentari and ReNew will explore investments into the development of renewable assets including solar, wind, and energy storage, targeting 5 GW of renewable energy capacity. The collaboration follows Gentari’s initial investment for a 49% equity stake in ReNew’s 403 MW peak power project in May this year.
“As partners, Gentari and ReNew can accelerate their decarbonization objectives, enabling Gentari to make substantial progress in expanding its renewable energy portfolio and achieving its global ambition to build over 30 GW in renewable energy capacity by 2030. For ReNew, this partnership ties in with its strategy of collaborating with long-term partners, accelerating renewable energy transition, and meeting its net zero target by 2040,” read a joint statement by the two companies.

Brenmiller Energy provides thermal energy storage systems to the global industrial and utility market. Its MoU with Waaree marks Brenmiller’s entry into the Indian market, adding to the company’s growing global presence including Israel, Europe, and the U.S.
Under the terms of the MoU, Brenmiller and Waaree will jointly explore, develop, and deploy solar-powered TES systems in India, subject to entry into a definitive agreement.
Brenmiller’s patented bGen thermal storage technology enables the use of renewable energy resources, as well as waste heat, to heat crushed rocks to very high temperatures. They can then store this heat for minutes, hours, or even days before using it for industrial and power generation processes. 
“We’ve seen a massive uptick in demand for our TES systems in response to climate-forward policies, rising energy costs, and challenges to reliability,” said Avi Brenmiller, president and Chief Executive Officer of Brenmiller. “Our team is thrilled to collaborate with Waaree to bring bGen TES to India’s industrial and utility markets.”
“In India, steam and other high-temperature processes for industrials are primarily powered by coal, accounting for roughly 25% of India’s carbon emissions,” said Hitesh Doshi, chairman of Waaree. “We are focused on helping large industrial corporations, including beverage, pharmaceutical, chemical, paper manufacturers, and more, to help them meet ambitious ESG goals. Partnering with Brenmiller to deploy its innovative thermal energy storage technology will enable us to significantly reduce dependence on fossil fuels.”

The 187 KW installation will cover nearly 10% of the overall consumption of the MSA facility, which is located in Châtillon-sur-Chalaronne, Ain department, France.
The PV system is removable, as its PV modules are placed and ballasted on the ground. CVE said the assembly required only 10 months of work, compared to 24 months for a traditional installation.
“This solution … has greatly facilitated the validation stages within the MSA group,” Christophe Laurent, Maintenance and Infrastructure Manager at MSA, said. “Our group insurer was able to give the green light quickly.”
Businesses that have a land reserve with no short-term use can utilize these small PV plants to produce part of their electricity for a limited period of time. Beyond this date, they can choose to extend their contract or stop it in order to use the land for other purposes.
“In this case, CVE, which owns the fleet of panels, dismantles them and reinstalls them at another customer,” said Pierre de Froidefond, co-founder of CVE. “Today we have five other projects of this type under development and multiple requests.”

HFE will use the cumulative amount of INR 6,200 crore to develop renewable projects across India including solar and wind for commercial and industrial customers, utility projects, and green hydrogen derivatives. The funding ensures the financial closure for HFE’s future projects in the pipeline.
The Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for the debt funding were signed on the sidelines of the 4th G20 Energy Transition Working Group (ETWG) meetings at Goa. 
Srivatsan Iyer, global CEO of Hero Future Energies, said, “The company aims to grow five times in the next 5 years and this significant financial backing will accelerate our business expansion across geographies. “
Hero Future Energies currently has a portfolio of 1.8 GW of wind, grid-connected solar, and rooftop solar power generating assets operating in India and Europe with another 2 GW of shovel-ready projects across India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and the UK.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/26/australian-startup-unveils-new-wall-mounted-residential-ev-chargers/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV CHARGERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 26, 2023",Australian startup unveils new wall-mounted residential EV chargers,"From pv magazine Australia
Brisbane-based Evos said the Australian-made SB7 charger is compatible with all EVs. It has been designed to help homeowners to charge their vehicles safely and conveniently, while also empowering them to make smart energy decisions.
Evos Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Salgado said the SB7 charger would connect to an app that allows drivers to monitor the cost of charging and features a built-in energy management system that can be programmed to charge EVs during off-peak periods or to leverage solar or battery power. The charger is also Wi-Fi connection capable, ensuring Evos and/or the homeowner can monitor and control the charger.
“We asked ourselves what the EV owner needs from a charger,” Salgado said. “It has to be easy to install with no restrictions as to where it can go on a property, be easy to monitor remotely and help them manage their costs in an era when everyone is concerned with energy prices. And it has to look good.”
The SB7, which will be manufactured in Australia, is the first Evos equipment designed for residential applications after the company released a 22 kW charger for business fleets in 2021. The charger is expected to be available between September and October, although its price had yet to be determined.
The SB7 charger and the Fleet Home22 Charger will be sold through Ampol. Ampol Energy General Manager James Myatt said the company became “acutely aware” that its customer’s needs were changing, so it moved into electricity distribution last year. Myatt said the deal with Evos would help meet the needs of customers who plan to power up their vehicles outside service stations in future.
“The technology allows us to support customers wherever their journey is, whether they’re starting their journey at home, on the road, wherever they park their cars, or on the way home from work,” he said. “If people are going to need charging at home, we want to provide the infrastructure to do that.”
Ampol said it will sell EV equipment directly to consumers and potentially through partners such as automotive brand BYD. It is also investing in public charging points at its petrol stations and intends to install 300 charging bays by 2024.
The launch of the SB7 EV charger comes after Evos earlier this month announced it had completed a funding round, securing AUD 5 million ($3.41 million) from existing investors to help commercialiZe its charging and energy management software technology. The capital raise came after the company initially raised AUD 1.7 million in 2021.

Subject to a final investment decision, construction of the 1,040 MW/ 2,080 MWh BESS project could kick off in the first quarter of 2024 with it slated to enter commercial operation in the final quarter of 2025.
Carton Power said it is “in advanced talks with companies to finance, build and operate the Trafford BESS.”
The Trafford BESS is the company’s second major energy project that has received council permission for the c12 hectare Trafford Low Carbon Energy Park, eight miles south of Manchester, which formerly hosted a coal-fired power plant.
The other project is Carlton’s 200 MW Trafford Green Hydrogen scheme. Its first phase of 15 MW to 20 MW is set to go into commercial operation in the final quarter of 2025.
“Carlton Power acquired the former coal fired power station in 2008 to redevelop the site for new energy projects,” said Keith Clarke, founder and chief executive of Carlton Power. “With the approval of the BESS, this brings the total investment value of the site to £2 billion, which will deliver significant economic benefits to the Greater Manchester region and help to deliver the regional net zero targets.”
In addition to Carlton Power’s two projects, Highview Power Storage plans to build a 250 MWh long-duration, liquid air energy storage system for GBP 250 million on the Trafford Low Carbon Energy Park. These projects will support the region’s goal of net zero-carbon emissions by 2038.
