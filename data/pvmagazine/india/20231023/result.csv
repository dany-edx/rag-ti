The first patent relates to a system and method that enables third-party entities to control load shifting in a BESS. The technology allows third-party entities, such as utilities or aggregators, to optimize using BESS assets to provide grid services.
The second patent relates to a system and method for effectively channeling energy from a renewable energy source, such as solar or wind, into a BESS. The technology optimizes the use of renewable energy by ensuring that it is stored in the BESS when it is most valuable.
Servotech stated that both technologies are applicable across a broad spectrum of fields, including solar and electric vehicle charging systems.
