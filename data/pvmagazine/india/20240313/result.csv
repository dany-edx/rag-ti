1,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/13/perovskite-thin-film-out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,2024-03-13,"Perovskite thin film: Out with the old, in with the new","High conversion efficiency, earth-abundant material composition, and lower cost of manufacturing make perovskites a potential game changer for the solar industry. But what is the best path forward for commercialization of this exciting technology?
There has been a strong focus in the United States and in the media on perovskite-silicon tandem devices due to their potential to boost the efficiency of traditional silicon-based modules and leverage the existing silicon manufacturing base. However, research by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) shows that single junction perovskites can help the nation scale domestic solar quickly and free itself from a reliance on imported silicon-based products. When it comes to design, the climate crisis, energy security, and cost performance, perovskite thin film just makes more sense.
Less is more when it comes to product design, and the environmental benefit of a clean transition away from silicon is compelling. NREL says silicon makes up 76% of the embodied energy of a PV module, whereas thin film cells make up less than 1%. Columbia University found perovskite thin film manufacturing can reduce cumulative energy use below that of both silicon and perovskite-silicon tandems by 80% or more, regardless of production method. While silicon wafers are very thin, at 160-240 micrometers, perovskite solar cells are thinner than 1.5 micrometers – less than the thickness of a red blood cell. With thin film PV modules requiring significantly less material to manufacture, less waste passes to the end user. With perovskite-silicon tandem devices, that waste is perpetuated.
Efforts are being made to keep more PV modules out of landfills, but recycling is costly and energy intensive. To become economically viable, the recycling industry is developing more efficient methods to recover high value materials such as precious metals and silicon. The alternative is to eliminate those materials entirely and design for recyclability of a more sustainably manufactured product. Life cycle analysis by German research body Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin found a transition from carbon-intensive silicon to perovskites added more value than any effort to improve the PV module recycling rate. If we can eliminate the highest carbon emitting component of a PV module and replace it with a more sustainable, lower cost technology, why not choose that over the hybrid? This is a no-brainer for utility power, where lowest cost of energy is the most important metric. Higher-efficiency solar solutions are often relegated to space constrained niche markets due to their cost.
China has become the global leader of PV module manufacturing but there are, quite literally, cracks in that dominance: silicon cells are inherently fragile and susceptible to microcracks. Despite efforts to minimize that risk, a recent report by Clean Energy Associates noted an exponential growth in cell crack cases in 2023, increasing 47% from the year prior. NREL research of 170 crystalline silicon systems in its PV Fleet Database found a trend of power loss after high wind and hail events, which could likely be attributed to microcracks when no glass breakage is found. This problem will not disappear with silicon perovskite tandems, but it can be resolved with thin film manufacturing. Case in point, First Solar is the only major manufacturer to offer a cell crack power loss guarantee due to the resilience of its thin film cells to mechanical stress.
Perovskites have reliability challenges to be overcome as part of commercialization, but these are challenges for both single junction and tandem technology. Beyond microcrack risk, silicon tandems face compatibility issues due to the need to optimize two technologies simultaneously to justify the added cost. How will degradation or discoloration of perovskite top cells affect performance of silicon bottom cells over time? What are the potential power measurement and sorting complications? If different manufacturers are responsible for the top and bottom cell, who will take responsibility for warranties?
It is not clear yet whether tandem startups are positioning as cell suppliers, seeking to be bought by module makers, or establishing their own manufacturing capacity. A simpler, lower cost product made by one supplier appears to be a less risky path to market.
From an energy security perspective, developing a component in the United States that supports a product made almost entirely in China does not sound like a winning strategy. As the Inflation Reduction Act’s domestic content waiver for Asian silicon and wafers demonstrates, there is little hope the United States will be able to compete with China on silicon. Japan understands this and has invested heavily in thin film perovskite R&D. If the United States focuses only on perovskite-silicon tandem development, it could inadvertently forfeit perovskite technology to other countries.
The United States must build on past successes, not repeat the same mistakes. While US efforts to build a viable silicon supply chain have faltered, cadmium telluride (CadTel) thin-film solar has weathered the storm with a focus on manufacturing innovation and development of a more reliable, responsible supply chain. This is clearly the best way for the United States to compete with China, and perovskites have the potential to leapfrog CadTel on cost with the help of high-speed roll-to-roll manufacturing. Technoeconomic analysis by the NREL indicates capital expenditure for perovskites can be cut in half with a shift away from sheet-to-sheet manufacturing. With strong industry investment and the continued support of consortiums like US-MAP and PACT, we can push that gap even wider and scale United States manufacturing capacity faster than ever.

7,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/13/longi-introduces-hpbc-photovoltaic-modules-with-22-8-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",VINCENT SHAW,2024-03-13,Longi introduces HPBC photovoltaic modules with 22.8% efficiency,"Chinese solar module manufacturer Longi has unveiled two new modules based on its proprietary hybrid passivated back contact (HPBC) cell technology.
The company has yet to explain exactly what HPBC is, but it is believed to be an extension of p-type interdigitated back-contact (IBC) technology that combines the structural advantages of PERC, TOPCon, and IBC solar. Additionally, BC technology can be combined with p-type wafers, for which Longi has substantial production capacities, giving it an advantage over the more common IBC technology.
The two new modules are called Hi-MO X6 Explorer and Hi-MO X6 Guardian. They have identical dimensions of 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and the same weight of 31.8 kg. Their power output ranges from 565 W to 590 W and their efficiency spans from 21.9% to 22.8%.
The modules have a temperature coefficient of -0.28%/C.
According to the manufacturer, the Explorer panels offer a first-year degradation of 1.5% and subsequent annual degradation of 0.4% per year, while for the Guardian module, which was specifically engineered to endure high temperatures and humidity levels, the expected degradation is 1% in the first year and 0.35% in the following years.
Longi attributes the strong “heat and humidity resistant” performance of the Hi-MO X6 Guardian to the unique properties of the HPBC cell. It said the absence of silver aluminum alloy in the electrode material reduces the likelihood of electrochemical reactions. Additionally, the module incorporates a double-sided polyolefin elastomer (POE) encapsulant, which reportedly offers seven times more resistance to water vapor compared to traditional ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). The encapsulation process includes a high water-blocking sealant with a molecular structure that enhances water-blocking effectiveness.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output warranty, with the 30-year end power output being guaranteed to be no less than 88.85% of the nominal output power.

Presently, the combined solar capacity installed by leading coal companies, including Coal India Ltd, NLC India Ltd, and SCCL, stands at around 1.7 GW, supplemented by an additional 51 MW from wind mills.
The Ministry of Coal has set ambitious net-zero electricity consumption plan for state-owned coal/lignite companies. It is actively promoting the deployment of both rooftop solar and ground-mounted solar projects across mining facilities.
Furthermore, innovative plans are underway to develop solar parks within the reclaimed mining areas as well as other suitable lands, leveraging underutilized land resources for sustainable energy generation. This strategic initiative is aligned with the government’s updated NDC target to achieve 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.
To minimize the carbon footprints of mining, the Ministry of Coal has issued directives to coal companies to accelerate the adoption of solar energy solutions. This includes the installation of rooftop solar panels on all government buildings and the establishment of solar projects in de-coaled areas and other suitable lands, effectively harnessing solar potential in previously utilized spaces.

All perovskite PV devices offer the advantage of effectively harnessing sunlight across a wide range of wavelengths. “By strategically applying two-step filtered spectrum and current matching techniques, our team has fully realized the capabilities of the three-junction tandem solar cell design,” the research’s corresponding author, Jaya Madan, told pv magazine.
The scientists used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel cell configuration. “This device simulator is known for its reliability in modeling standalone and two-junction tandem solar cells. However, until now, there hasn’t been a method for simulating three-junction tandem solar cells using SCAPS-1D. Thus, our work fills this gap.”
The solar cell relies on a 287 nm-thick top cell comprising an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin oxide (SnO2) and buckminsterfullerene (C60), a perovskite active layer with a bandgap of 1.99 eV, and a hole transport layer (HTL) made of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz).
Moving down the tandem structure, the 500 nm-thick middle cell features a perovskite absorber layer with a bandgap of 1.6 eV. The top and bottom subcells are interconnected through an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, facilitating efficient charge transport between the layers. The 670 nm-thick subcell integrates a perovskite absorber with a bandgap of 1.20 eV.
The performance of the cell was simulated under standard illumination conditions and, according to the scientists, it achieved remarkable photovoltaic parameters. The device reached an efficiency of 26.24%, an open-circuit voltage of 3.76 V, a short-circuit density of 10.70 mA/cm², and a fill factor of 69.00%.
The researchers explained that the precise determination of the filtered spectrum and the current matching points played a crucial role in the cell optimization.
The novel cell concept was described in the study “Design and simulation of three-junction all perovskite tandem solar cells: A path to enhanced photovoltaic performance,” published in Materials Letters.
