Under the partnership, it shall set up 450kW of solar rooftop projects to power around 350 houses and public areas such as anganwadis and gram panchayat.
Once complete, this would be the first village to be completely powered with solar panels. The solar rooftop systems will empower close to 2,000 people to earn their livelihood.
Ishver Dholakiya, founder and managing director, Goldi Solar said, “This plan has been undertaken under Shri Govindbhai Dholakia’s mentorship and vision to give back to society. It is a proud moment for Goldi Solar to take up this project in empowering people with better quality of life. We also believe that this project truly captures the true spirit of PM Modi’s Atmanirbhar campaign and takes a step towards providing 24×7 power for all. We thank SRKKF for giving us the opportunity to truly make a difference to the lives of many.”
SRKKF is the CSR arm of Shree Ramkrishna Exports, an Indian diamond company. Apart from funding renewable energy projects, the foundation will provide free wi-fi services, healthcare, medical infrastructure and service to Dudhala.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/28/india-installed-10-gw-of-solar-in-2021/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COVID-19,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 28, 2022",India installed 10 GW of solar in 2021,"India added 10GW of new solar capacity in the calendar year (CY) 2021, a 210% increase compared to 3.2GW installed in CY 2020, according to the newly released Q4 and Annual 2021 India Solar Market Update by Mercom India Research.
Large-scale solar projects with 8.3GW accounted for 83% of overall PV installations and saw a 230% surge YoY. Rooftop solar installations made up the remaining 17% by adding 1.7 GW, a 138% increase YoY.
A significant number of projects stretched from 2020 to 2021 due to project timeline extensions provided by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy on account of Covid-19. This boosted the overall installation in 2021.
India’s cumulative installed PV capacity reached approximately 49 GW at the end of 2021.
The report projects strong PV growth in 2022, despite the module supply constraints due to the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) mandate. It identifies basic customs duty and rising component prices among other challenges facing the industry on the supply side.
“Demand outlook for 2022 is strong, but significant challenges await the industry, beginning with the basic customs duty, import restrictions, and the goods and services tax on top of global supply chain issues, and high component prices. Challenges aside, the Indian solar market has significant growth potential and is only just starting to take off,” said Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer of Mercom Capital Group.
The report noted the average project cost rose in CY 2021 due to higher module and raw material prices, and freight charges. Average large-scale project costs in Q4 increased 21.6% YoY in 2021 – the highest ever rise over the past ten years. Average rooftop solar costs in Q4 2021 rose 14.8% YoY.
“Developers are procuring solar cells and modules in large quantities and stockpiling them ahead of the steep BCD that takes effect April 1, 2022. The industry is uncertain if DISCOMs will procure solar at higher prices when the 40% BCD becomes effective,” it stated.

The PV plant is SJVN’s first floating solar project and will come up at Nangal pond, near village Neilla in the Bilaspur district.
Nand Lal Sharma, chairman and managing director, SJVN Limited, informed that SJVN bagged the full quoted capacity of 15MW at an INR 3.26/kWh tariff in an e-reverse auction held by the Solar Energy Corporation of India.
The cost of developing this floating solar project shall be approximately INR 100 crore. The project is expected to generate 32.85 million units (MU) of electricity in the first year and the cumulative energy generation over a period of 25 years will be approximately 756 MU. The power purchase agreement between SJVN and Bhakra Beas Management Board will be signed shortly.
SJVN has also received the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s approval to develop a 400MW solar park in the Kinnaur district in Himachal Pradesh.
These projects will assist SJVN in achieving its ambitious shared vision of 5GW by 2023, 25GW by 2030, and 50GW by 2040 and simultaneously contribute towards the government of India’s RE capacity addition target of 500GW by 2030, it stated.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/28/first-attempt-to-build-tandem-perovskite-perc-polo-solar-cells-achieves-21-3-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 28, 2022",First attempt to build tandem perovskite-PERC/POLO solar cells achieves 21.3% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists in Germany have developed for the first time a tandem perovskite silicon solar cell based on an n+-type polysilicon on oxide (POLO) front junction and a passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) side.
“This is an important achievement, since PERC silicon cells on p-type silicon are the ‘workhorse’ of photovoltaics, with a market share of about 50% of all solar cells produced worldwide,” the scientists said. “Our bottom cells comprise all components of industrial PERC cells, except for the substitution of phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) diffusion by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) of in situ n+-type p-doped poly-Si,” they further explained, noting that the process flow for this bottom cell is compatible with commercial mainstream PERC technologies.
The cell was fabricated with a p-type gallium-doped M2 Czochralski (Cz) wafer with 156.75 μm edge length and a diameter of 210 mm, with the stacks of Al2O3 and SiNx being deposited on both sides of the wafer. “The rear-side 15 nm Al2O3/100 nm SiNx stack serves for passivation just as in an industrial PERC cell,” the research team explained. “The front-side 10 nm Al2O3/40 nm SiNx stack passivates the perimeter region around the active cell area. It also serves the rather fundamental purpose to stabilize the POLO junction passivation during the subsequent firing process and is therefore removed in the active area only after firing.”

The perovskite top cell was developed with a p−i−n device architecture and a triple-halide perovskite with a bandgap of 1.68 eV known as CsFAPb(IBrCl)3. “As its thickness strongly influences the current density generated in the top cell, adapting its fabrication process is crucial to achieve current matching between the subcells,” the academics emphasized. “To reduce the current mismatch, we deposit a thinner perovskite layer by increasing the spin-coating speed to 5000 revolutions per minute (rpm) resulting in a film thickness of about 470 nm.”
The two-terminal perovskite−POLO−PERC tandem solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% and the scientists said this proof-of-concept tandem device has potential for further efficiency improvements. “For this purpose, one could adapt the surface of the silicon wafers and thus quickly increase the efficiency to about 25%,” said the research’s corresponding author, Silvia Mariotti.
The German group believes the efficiency of these devices may reach much higher values through adjustments in the perovskite thickness and bandgap that were not considered so far. “Based on our experimental findings and supporting optical simulations, we identify major process enhancements and estimate a PCE potential of 29.5%,” it further explained.
A full description of the cell can be found in the study Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Fabricated Using Industrial p-Type Polycrystalline Silicon on Oxide/Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell Silicon Bottom Cell Technology, published in RRL Solar. The research group comprises scientists from the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie (HZB).
