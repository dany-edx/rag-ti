The two state-run power producers have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore the formation of a joint venture company for exploring and setting up hydropower and pump storage projects. The MoU envisages the joint development of mutually identified projects.
NHPC is also foraying into green hydrogen production. It recently signed two MoUs to establish pilot green hydrogen projects in Leh and Kargil districts of the Indian union territory of Ladakh.
In Leh, NHPC will develop a pilot green hydrogen fuel cell-based microgrid, including hydrogen production, to meet the power requirement of the NHPC guest house at Nimmo Bazgo Power Station (Leh) within NHPC premises.
The hydrogen generated in Kargil will be used in fuel cells to run two buses for up to 8 hours in the local area of Kargil.
NHPC will upscale hydrogen production on a commercial scale to meet the hydrogen need of the Ladakh region in different sectors like mobility, transportation, heating, and micro-grid.
“These two pilot [green hydrogen] projects will create a roadmap for future development of green hydrogen and subsequent reduction of carbon emission in the transportation/heating sector and will also attract long-term investment in the hydrogen economy creating different revenue streams and job opportunities for the youth of Ladakh,” stated NHPC.

The company has supplied more than 1,000 chargers under an agreement with Tata Power Company Limited. It has also installed over 60 EV chargers for several sites operated by Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) and has supplied 114 EV chargers to Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (BESCOM).
Moreover, a single site features 11 fast chargers for one of the largest bus OEMs in India. Delta also supplied a portfolio of EV chargers to a Kerala state utility company.
The company plans to increase the localized content of its product and solution offering to 80% within a few years, said Benjamin Lin, Delta Electronics India’s President and GM. “We welcome government initiatives to develop the local manufacturing sector. In fact, Delta India’s R&D and engineering teams are working on more and more indigenous solutions, such as battery swapping systems for electric scooters as well as fast EV chargers.”
Delta offers a one-stop solution enabling EV charging infrastructure, from site survey to design the specifications, installation, and aftersales service. It is also one of the first providers of fully-integrated EV charging solutions in India with solar PV inverters, energy storage systems and energy management software to a Bangalore utility company.
In alignment with the “Make In India” initiative, Delta is enhancing its R&D and manufacturing capabilities in India. More than 50% content of its product offering in the country is now manufactured locally.
For the Indian market, Delta India currently offers a complete range of EV chargers for 4-wheeler and e-Bus applications. Its wall-mount DC Wallbox EV Charger allows fast charging while occupying a small footprint. It is ideal for commercial applications such as public parking lots, office buildings, fleets, hotels and shopping malls.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/20/novel-method-to-turn-existing-solar-parks-into-agrivoltaic-facilities/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 20, 2022",Novel method to turn existing solar parks into agrivoltaic facilities,"From pv magazine Global
An international research team has developed a new approach to improve land use at ground-mounted solar plants, which they claim could be used to add important wildlife habitats or even agricultural activity to land already in use by a conventional PV system.
“We initially developed our approach for existing solar plants installed in the region of Apulia in southern Italy, but it could be utilized in other regions or countries with different vegetation,” Teodoro Semeraro, an environmental scientist at Italy’s University of Salento who led the research, told pv magazine.”It could also be used for new projects that include agricultural use or rooftop installations combining green roofs with solar power generation, where the agricultural aspect would have less importance.”
The approach would see new vegetated land cover cultivated below and around solar installations, as potential habitat for pollinating insects or for agricultural activities including beekeeping and medicinal herb production. This approach would provide a series of additional advantages such as reduction of maintenance costs of green areas in solar parks, fire risk reduction, potential development of small-scale agricultural activities, and positive media coverage, among others.
The scientists pointed out that the selected vegetation to be grown at the solar parks should be able to adapt to the ground’s environmental conditions, water scarcity, and nutritional deficiency. “Our approach may also consider non-indigenous species, but from the point of view of the landscape and the protection of local biodiversity, the use of indigenous vegetation is desirable,” Semeraro stated. “Moreover, the local species are adapted to the climate and the lack of water, which is chronic in Apulia, so they could respond better. But, having said that, the use of non-native species is technically feasible at conditions that respond to specific project needs.”
According to the research, Beekeeping at these sites would not require invasive structures and hives could be laid on the ground during the blooming time. “The biodiversity and ecosystem services could persist over time even after ground-mounted PV systems are dismantled and continuing to support population welfare at both local and larger scale, guaranteeing sustainability,” they further explained, noting that beekeeping may help overcome the issue of monoculture, which is typical of the Apulia region.
The research listed a range of ecosystem services which solar parks could provide without additional human input, on the basis of the intrinsic value of the vegetation in sustaining ecosystem services. This would turn the solar parks into semi-natural areas, or Agro-Ecological Photovoltaic Gardens, which would host melliferous species blooming in different periods to be harvested and marketed as medicinal herbs. Furthermore, the solar panels may reduce the water stress for the vegetation, while improving soil quality thanks to their shading function.
When asked about what exactly defines agrivoltaics and make it differ from conventional ground-mounted solar facilities, Semeraro said that the crucial element is the presence of an agricultural enterprise in a project. “We cannot speak of agrivoltaics if a stakeholder in the agricultural field is not involved in the project or if there is no farm interested in the cultivation or use of the soil,” he stated. “There is a risk that a plant will be created without there being someone who cultivates it.”
The scientists introduced their approach in the study “An innovative approach to combine solar photovoltaic gardens with agricultural production and ecosystem services,” published in Ecosystem Services.
The group includes scientists from the University of Salento and the Institute of Science of Food Production C.N.R. Unit of Lecce, in Italy, as well as from the Glasgow Caledonian University in the United Kingdom.
“A transdisciplinary approach is important to share knowledge across the different stakeholders and bridge the information gaps typical of a sectoral perspective, creating a holistic vision of the involved professional skills and experiences,” the paper reads. “Its proper implementation requires the joint effort of all economic stakeholders together with technical and scientific experts to promote multifunctional land-use in ground-mounted solar farms.”

This will be HFE’s first utility-scale battery energy storage system project. HFE will have 15 months from the date of signing of the agreement to commission the project.
HFE’s current portfolio includes 1.6 GW of wind and solar projects in India. The company has a 2024 growth target of 5 GW of installed and operating capacity globally. Alongside traditional solar and wind projects, HFE focuses on delivering renewable energy projects utilizing technologies including battery storage, floating solar and green hydrogen.
“The experience [gained from the 10 MW/ 20 MWh energy storage plant] will enable us to execute similar projects with more states likely to issue storage tenders in the days ahead,” stated the company. “We believe that storage will be integral to the next phase of growth of renewables in India and as such will continue to be a key thrust area for HFE.”
