This would mean a massive 55-fold increase in the use of non-hydro renewables in electricity generation within the coming three decades, from only 160 TWh (10%) in 2019, the report stated. 
The report estimated that to achieve net-zero by 2050, over two-thirds of India’s industrial energy use and new vehicle sales would have to be electrified, compared to a 20.3% share of electricity in industrial energy use and negligible share in transport energy use as of now. 
“The share of electricity in India’s industrial energy use must rise three-fold, from 20.3% in 2018 to 70% in 2050. The share of electric vehicles in passenger car sales would also have to rise to 76% in 2050 from just 0.1% in 2019,” it stated. 
To meet net-zero, India would need to either eliminate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or balance these by sequestering GHG emissions, the report said.
The CEEW study outlines multiple pathways for India to attain net-zero emissions, presenting four alternative scenarios: 2030 peak–2050 net-zero, 2030 peak–2060 net-zero, 2040 peak–2070 net-zero, and 2050 peak–2080 net-zero. 
It said that India would need to reach peak emissions (the highest level before starting to fall) within this decade if it were to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. 
Feasibility
The report stated 2030 as a peaking year would give India an extremely narrow (20-year) window to ensure a smooth and equitable transition to a net-zero year. In comparison, advanced economies, including China, Japan, the UK, and the USA, will have taken at least 30, and at times well over 40 years for this transition. Advanced economies peaked emissions at much higher development levels, slower rates of growth and would have had longer transition periods.
The CEEW study also found that if India were to peak in 2030 and reach net-zero in 2060 like China, its cumulative carbon emissions for 2021-2100 would be 80 GtCO2. For the same period, China and the USA’s cumulative carbon emissions, even after incorporating their net-zero ambitions, would be 349 GtCO2 and 104 GtCO2, respectively. 
The report presents key considerations in selecting peaking and net-zero years for India to get sufficient time to develop while ensuring minimal climate impact. These include the average per capita income, economic growth rate, a ‘reasonable’ pace of transition determined by the gap between peaking and net-zero years, the possibility of lock-ins and stranded assets, the cumulative emissions across the alternative peaking year–net-zero year combinations, and the economic trade-offs. 
Dr Vaibhav Chaturvedi, Fellow, CEEW, and author of the study, said, [their] analysis is intended to provide policymakers with different options in making a critical decision for India’s future. 
“We find that India would need to undergo a double transition, through faster electrification of sectors and an increasing share of renewables in power generation, if it were to announce an ambitious net-zero target. Policymakers would also need to identify manufacturing sectors where electricity could replace fossil fuels. Reducing the cost of electricity to make it competitive would be equally critical. Finally, the rate of decline in India’s emission intensity of primary energy would have to be ramped up drastically to peak within the coming two decades,” he added.
Dr Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, said, “India has already demonstrated climate leadership and is the only G20 nation on track to surpass its Paris Agreement targets. However, if India were to announce a net-zero target, it must choose a year that not only minimizes climate impacts but also gives it enough space to develop. 
“Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or 2060 would need rapid systemic changes across all sectors and sections of society. This, in turn, would require significant international financial investments and technological transfer from or technology co-development with the developed world. It would be equally important for India to closely examine trade-offs such as increasing cost of household electricity, increasing railways passenger fares, fiscal challenges for coal-dependent states, job losses for over half a million coal mining workers, and the shifting geopolitics around energy trade and the energy transition before announcing its net-zero targets.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/22/indias-122-billion-energy-stimulus-may-benefit-fossil-fuels-more-than-renewables/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 22, 2021",India’s $122bn energy stimulus spending may benefit fossil fuels most,"The Indian government’s $122 billion (INR8.83 lakh crore) commitment to support the energy sector since January 2020 could chiefly benefit the fossil fuel sector, even though spending has allocated renewables almost twice the amount earmarked for greenhouse-gas (GHG)-heavy fuels—according to a new report.
The How Green is India’s Stimulus for Economic Recovery? study stated, out of the $122 billion in energy-related funding announced since January 2020, the Indian government had committed $35 billion (28.5%) to renewables, almost twice the $18 billion (15%) flowing to fossil fuels. However, a large proportion–amounting to $69 billion (56.5%)–supported ‘other’ energy finance.
The report–published by U.S. thinktank the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and Canadian peer the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD)–stated, at the moment, India’s policies for ‘other energy’ primarily support power transmission and distribution companies and, therefore, may disproportionately benefit fossil fuels even if not targeted explicitly at GHG-emitting production or consumption. For example, the liquidity support to electricity distribution companies to build infrastructure, modernize the grid and settle payment dues to generators, could support the dominant fossil fuel generators more than renewable energy providers.
State-level fuel and transport policies, the development of power projects, and transmission infrastructure are also categorized as ‘other energy’, the thinktank report added.
The publication reviewed energy-related policies using the Energy Policy Tracker (EPT) developed by IISD to determine how India could better drive a green economic recovery.
“According to the EPT, India has committed more public money to the energy sector than any other economy globally since January 2020,” said lead author and IEEFA energy economist Vibhuti Garg. “We estimate that around 22% of the value of these public money commitments [is] primarily to deal with the impact of Covid-19, and the rest is to meet the government’s ongoing policy objectives on energy security, air pollution and climate change.”
The Energy Policy Tracker indicated, as of March 3, some 31 major economies had pledged more than $686 billion to support energy through new or amended policies since January last year–with that statistic excluding energy-related funding from U.S. president Joe Biden’s new $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.
Of that global figure, $274 billion (40%) has been committed to fossil fuels, $259 billion (38%) to renewable energy, and $153 billion (22%) to “other energy,” including nuclear power, first-generation biofuels or policies to support multiple sources of energy. 
By comparison, more than half (56.5%) of all the public money committed to energy in India will support ‘other energy’.
The report points out India’s commitments in the Energy Policy Tracker are only an “at least” value and could, in fact, be much higher than $122 billion.
“The EPT only quantifies the cost of a policy that can be drawn from publicly available sources,” said report co-author Max Schmidt, a Carlo Schmid Fellow with IISD, who tracks and analyses energy policy developments for the tracker tool.
“With more transparent reporting, we would likely see support skewed towards fossil fuels rather than renewable energy. But as of now, the picture in India is incomplete,” said Schmidt.
Study co-author Christopher Beaton, lead for sustainable energy consumption at IISD, stressed India needs to raise the bar for a green economic recovery, and increase its commitment to renewable energy as it strives to achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by mid century.
“There is still time for India to shift energy policies towards a truly green recovery–a move that would bring the government closer to achieving its long-term objectives on energy security, air pollution, and climate change,” said Beaton.
The report makes six recommendations for India’s green recovery:
1. Strengthen green industrial policy: As part of restarting the economy, the government should invest in India’s capacity to manufacture for the green energy revolution.
2. Invest in large scale renewables grid integration: Instead of just investing in trying to fix the problems of its electricity distribution system, India needs to start investing in the distributed-generation system of tomorrow.
3. Improve energy access: Increase adoption of distributed rooftop solar energy sources and energy efficiency measures. These are low-hanging fruit that would help alleviate electricity utility woes while making power more reliable and supplying job creation.
4. Compliance with environmental norms: Avoid further rollbacks in standards and the lock-in of fossil fuel assets. Achieve energy security through domestic production that does not exacerbate air pollution, undermine forests, or worsen the climate crisis.
5. Improved targeting of subsidies and fossil fuel taxation: Allocate subsidies to the intended beneficiaries with any savings redirected to promote clean technology. Increase fossil fuel taxation and attach more conditionality to new fossil projects to level the playing field.
6. Unlocking finance: The government should resolve policy and legacy issues, to attract global and Indian financial institutions to bring in more capital to the deflationary, domestic renewables sector.
