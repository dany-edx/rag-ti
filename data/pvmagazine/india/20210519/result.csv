Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh led large-scale solar installations, with most of the share coming from these States.
Rooftop solar posted strong deployment figures despite Covid-induced lockdown and restrictions. About 2 GW of new rooftop PV capacity was added in FY2021. Gujarat and Maharashtra together contributed nearly 50% of all rooftop solar installations in FY2021. Other states that added maximum rooftop solar capacity during the year included Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. 
JMK Research expects about 10 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity and 3.5 GW of new wind capacity to be installed in the current FY2022—about 25% less than its initial estimate made before the second wave of Covid-19 hit India. 
Explaining the contraction in outlook, the analysts quoted the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s recent notification dated May 12, 2021, which stated, “renewable energy projects having their commissioning dates on or after April 1, 2021, can claim extension owing to the second surge of the Covid-19 pandemic.” MNRE also mentioned that, on receipt of an application for the time extension, the implementing agency would not initiate any coercive action on the project to recover the penalty against delayed commissioning until the extended time frame is decided upon.
According to JMK Research, lockdowns imposed across several states could lead to a shortage of labor and interruptions in equipment supplies, delaying the commissioning of nearly 3-4 GW of solar and wind projects. 
It, however, forecasts rooftop solar capacity addition to exceed the FY2021 figure in the current financial year. India could add about 2.5-3 GW of rooftop solar in FY2022, it stated.

The project was developed for Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation (SPIC) Limited on a water storage pond in its Thoothukudi plant.
“It is India’s largest installed floating solar plant as of date,” stated the company, adding that “while there are other projects of a bigger scale started in India, they are yet to reach the completion stage.”
Ciel & Terre India’s work scope included plant engineering, float supply, and supervision.
The plant uses Ciel & Terre’s proprietary Hydrelio Equato floating platforms, manufactured locally, to support the solar panels. An aggregate 37,632 number of 390 Wp solar panels were used, spanning an area of 15.6 hectares. SPIC is expected to avoid more than 18,686 tonnes of CO2 emissions by substituting the grid electricity with the electricity generated from the PV plant. 
Ciel & Terre India managing director Deepak Ushadevi said, “A captive project like this will benefit the industry from a competitive price compared to the grid, and we can replicate the same model on other industrial reservoirs such as steel, thermal, fertilizers, cement, chemical, etc.”
Over the years, Ciel & Terre has gained vast expertise and substantial experience in the installation of large-scale floating PV plants on artificial and freshwater reservoirs.
“Our team has a thorough understanding of floating PV challenges and accordingly assisted our SPIC customer in the realization of the biggest floating plant in this country despite the Covid-19 pandemic challenges,” said Ushadevi. 
Ciel & Terre India commissioned its first pilot, a 452 KWp project at Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL), Cochin, in 2019. This was followed by a 5.4 MWp at Sagardighi thermal power plant in West Bengal last year. 
Currently, Ciel & Terre India is executing a mega floating project of 75 MWp in South India, which it expects to commission by October this year. The Hydrelio floats for the project are being procured from Ciel & Terre India’s Kerala factory. 
Ciel & Terre International has also launched a global R&D center in Bangalore for innovative engineering and new product development activities.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/19/adani-green-to-buy-sb-energys-5-gw-india-renewable-portfolio/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 19, 2021",Adani Green to buy SB Energy’s 5 GW renewable portfolio in India,"Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) today signed an agreement to acquire a 100% stake in SB Energy India for approximately US$ 3.5 billion (INR 26,000 crore). The move signals the company’s commitment to becoming the leader in sustainable energy transition globally and one of the largest renewable energy platforms in the world.
As part of the deal, the developer will acquire SoftBank Group‘s 80% stake and Bharti Group’s 20% in SB Energy India. 
SB Energy India has a renewable portfolio totaling 4,954 MW across four states in India. 
“The transaction values SB Energy India at an enterprise valuation of approximately US$ 3.5 billion,” AGEL said in a media statement.
This makes it the largest acquisition in India’s renewable energy sector till date. 
The target portfolio comprises large-scale utility assets, including 84% solar capacity (4,180 MW), 9% wind-solar hybrid capacity (450 MW) and 7% wind capacity (324 MW). The solar portfolio comprises 1,400 MW operational capacity and a further 3,554 MW under construction. 
All the projects being acquired benefit from 25-year power purchase agreements with sovereign rated counterparties such as Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), NTPC, and NHPC Limited.
“The operating assets forming part of the portfolio are primarily solar park based projects and have been built following best-in-class governance, project development, construction, and operations and maintenance practices, resulting in this being one of the highest quality renewable portfolios in the country,” read AGEL statement.
The acquisition enables AGEL to achieve its ‘25 GW by 2025’ renewable target four years ahead of the timeline. With the addition, the company will reach a total renewable capacity of 24.3 GW, including 4.9 GW of operational projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/19/iea-calls-for-annual-additions-of-solar-pv-to-reach-630-gw-by-2030/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 19, 2021",IEA calls for annual additions of solar PV to reach 630 GW by 2030,"From pv magazine International
The world has a viable pathway to building a global energy sector with net-zero emissions in 2050, but it is narrow and requires an “unprecedented transformation” of how energy is produced, transported, and used globally. Those are the key findings in a report from the International Energy Agency.
Climate pledges by governments to date – even if fully achieved – would fall “well short” of what is needed to bring global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to net zero by 2050, according to the report, Net Zero by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector.
The report sets what it described as a “cost-effective and economically productive” pathway resulting in an energy economy “dominated by renewables like solar and wind.”
The pathway calls for annual additions of solar PV to reach 630 GW by 2030, and those of wind power to reach 390 GW. The report said this combined capacity is four times what was installed in 2020, a record year. For solar PV, it is equivalent to installing the world’s current largest solar parks–around 1,000 MW–roughly every day.
“The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal… make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director.
The roadmap sets out more than 400 milestones to guide the transition to net zero by 2050. These include no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment for new coal plants without some form of carbon capture technology. By 2035, the roadmap calls for no sales of new internal combustion engine passenger cars, and by 2040, completion of a shift by the global electricity sector to net-zero emissions.
The report said that a worldwide push to increase energy efficiency is an essential part of these efforts. It said that such a push would result in the global rate of energy efficiency improvements averaging 4% a year through 2030, or about three times the average over the last two decades.
Most of the global reductions in CO2 emissions between now and 2030 would come from technologies available today. But in 2050, almost half the reductions would come from technologies that are currently only at the demonstration or prototype phase.
The IEA report said this demands that governments “quickly increase and reprioritize” spending on research and development. Progress in advanced batteries, electrolyzers for hydrogen, and direct air capture and storage could be impactful, the report said.
The IEA report said that total annual energy investment would grow to $5 trillion by 2030 in the net zero pathway, adding an extra 0.4 percentage points a year to global GDP growth, based on a joint analysis with the International Monetary Fund. The increase in private and government spending would create clean energy jobs, including energy efficiency, as well as in the engineering, manufacturing, and construction industries. All of this would put global GDP 4% higher in 2030 than it would be based on current trends, the report said.
By 2050, global energy demand would be around 8% smaller than today, but able to serve an economy more than twice as big and a population with 2 billion more people. The report said that by that date, almost 90% of electricity generation would come from renewable sources, with solar PV and wind together accounting for almost 70%. Most of the remainder would come from nuclear power.
