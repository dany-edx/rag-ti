The project value is worth INR 46.2 crore. Under the project, Servotech will equip petrol pumps in major Indian cities with EV charging capabilities. Execution has already commenced from the state of Delhi. The overall project is expected to be completed by March 31, 2023.
As part of this project, Servotech will take care of the installation, commissioning, and maintenance of DC fast chargers at a range of locations including BPCL’s retail sites and fuel and gas stations, as suggested by BPCL.
The project will help ensure the deployment of e-mobility touchpoints that address transactions, availability, discovery, and navigation to give users of electric vehicles easy access to the charging network.
“This project extends our commitment of providing shared or public-charging devices offering high-speed charging for mass adoption… [Our] high-power charging systems will provide EVs with a virtually fully recharged battery in just a few minutes of charging, for drivers who would want to stop at a fuel station requiring a quick high-powered charge,” said Raman Bhatia, founder and managing director, Servotech Power Systems.

RE plants will be an integrated part of the green hydrogen and ammonia projects, said the developer.
Acme signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Karnataka on the proposed investment, at the Invest Karnataka 2022 organized by the Government of Karnataka.
Acme expects the project to generate over 2,000 employment opportunities after the completion of the plant.
The project is planned by 2027.
The latest announcement follows Acme’s commitment to invest INR 52,474 crore ($6.61 billion) to build a green hydrogen and green ammonia project in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
It signed the initial agreement with the state government during the Tamil Nadu Investment Conclave.

A scientist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel has proposed a way to provide uninterrupted PV power to oxygen factories on the moon without using storage. He recently published his findings in “Uninterrupted photovoltaic power for lunar colonization without the need for storage,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.
According to the study, 10 MW of solar capacity is required to continuously power the oxygen factories. The researcher said that installing PV arrays around a 360-degree latitudinal ring close to one of the moon’s poles, with long transmission lines carrying the electricity to the oxygen plants, would be feasible. There would be no inter-array shading, and both static vertical PV arrays and arrays mounted on single-axis vertical trackers could be viable mounting structures.
The strategy exploits the absence of a lunar atmosphere, the near-zero tilt of the moon’s polar axis with respect to the ecliptic plane, lunar conditions that are amenable to low-mass inexpensive transmission lines, and a lunar diameter far smaller than that of Earth.
The overriding challenge for setting up colonies on the moon is to continuously provide electricity to factories to produce oxygen. Using nuclear energy or solar combined with storage have been studied as promising approaches, but the new research finds that using solar without storage could be the most efficient solution.
“My solution has a specific mass far below all alternatives so far, namely, record low kg/kW, a key figure of merit for affordable and feasible lunar installations, with launch and installation costs currently exceeding $1,000,000/kg,” said the researcher. “Our new strategy is more than a factor of 100 better than solar with battery storage. It is also at least a factor of 6 superior to the solution now being contemplated by NASA of nuclear reactors driving conventional turbines and generators.”
NASA reportedly might replace its plan to power lunar colonies with nuclear energy by using the solar solution instead.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/04/seci-launches-1-2-gw-hybrid-wind-solar-storage-tender/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022",SECI launches 1.2 GW hybrid wind-solar-storage tender,"Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd has opened bids to develop 1.2 GW of hybrid wind-solar power projects along with energy storage for assured peak power supply in India. The projects are to be installed on a ‘build-own-operate’ basis and connected to the interstate transmission network.
The minimum bid capacity will be a minimum of 50 MW and a maximum of 1.2 GW.
SECI will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with hybrid power developers at the tariffs discovered after the e-reverse auction, and back-to-back power sale agreements with the buying entities at the PSA tariff for the total capacity allotted.
“Identification of land, installation, and ownership of the project, along with obtaining connectivity necessary approvals and interconnection with the ISTS network for supply of power to SECI, will be under the scope of the hybrid power developer,” as per the tender document.
The rated capacities of both the solar and wind components will be a minimum of 33% of the total contracted capacity, for a project to qualify as a hybrid project. For example, in case the contracted capacity of a project is 100 MW, the rated capacities of both the wind and solar components shall be a minimum of 33 MW each.
Additionally, the hybrid power developer will install an energy storage system capacity of at least 100 MWh for each 100 MW project being contracted under the PPA.
The energy storage component will be mandatorily co-located either with solar PV or with wind Power generating components, under a single project.
