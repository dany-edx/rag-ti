https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/14/indias-technology-path-key-to-global-steel-decarbonisation/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,INDIA",,"FEBRUARY 14, 2022",India’s technology path key to global steel decarbonisation,"Recent announcements by global steel companies in India highlight how important the nation’s steel technology path will be to achieving global decarbonisation of the steel sector.
ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS) – a joint venture of two of the world’s largest steel producers, Europe-based ArcelorMittal and Japan’s Nippon Steel – has announced a US$13 billion investment in a 24 million tonne per annum (mtpa) steel plant in Odisha and a further US$22 billion investment in Gujarat. Meanwhile South Korean steel giant POSCO is planning US$5 billion of investment with Indian conglomerate Adani to build an integrated steel mill in Gujarat.
The announcements have, to varying extents, promised the use of “green” steel technology without providing any details.
The world’s largest steel producer, China, may have already reached peak of production and therefore, steel-related carbon emissions will likely drop. While China produced 1 billion tons of crude steel during 2021, down 3% year on year, India, the world’s second largest steel producer, produced 118.1 Mt of crude steel, a 17.8% rise from 2020.
In 2020, 56% of India’s steel output was produced via electric furnaces from which less than half was attributed to electric arc furnaces and the rest was produced on induction furnaces. These furnaces are mostly fed with direct reduced iron (DRI). India has a high share of steel production based on DRI utilizing gasified thermal coal which produces more emissions than DRI based on natural gas. The balance of 44% was produced via blast furnace route, using coking coal. Indian steel demand growth has led to significant investment in new blast furnace capacity in recent years.
Hence, the Indian iron and steel sector is the most significant contributor to industrial energy demand, with a high reliance on coal (85% of energy inputs).
Currently India’s steel industry represents almost 23% of total energy inputs and 30% of the industrial carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the industrial sector.
The main reasons for the higher energy intensity of India’s steel sector compared to the global average include its high reliance on coal, lower share of scrap steel recycling, a fragmented and low performance casting sector, and the number of old blast furnaces.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) predicted that India steel production will double by 2030 and quadruple by 2050. Coal demand is also forecasted to increase by 250%.
Curbing CO2 emissions and meeting a growing steel demand seems to be a dilemma for policy and industry decision makers.
Tata Steel, JSW, Steel Authority of India, Jindal and AM/NS are among the largest producers in India.
AM/NS’s new announcements represent a significant increase in its Indian steel capacity and will supposedly use green steelmaking technology at the Odisha plant. The US$22 billion to be invested in Gujarat involves a range of projects including 10 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind development for the decarbonisation of steel production.
POSCO’s move will be its first new steelmaking investment in India after four unsuccessful attempts in the last 17 years.
The lack of steel technology detail in these announcements is in contrast to those made in developed nations whenever companies want to highlight their shift towards low carbon steel.
ArcelorMittal announced it was building a new DRI-EAF in its Spanish operation plant that could reduce carbon emission by 50%. In another agreement with the Government of Canada, ArcelorMittal will install DRI-EAF technology to phase out the current blast furnace and reduce emissions by 60%.
POSCO’s Memorandum of Understanding with Adani is part of its plan to set up “green” steel capacity outside of South Korea.
Investing in any new coal-based steel technology in the 2020s will lock-in carbon emissions for decades. Steel production assets are durable, and the average operational life of a blast furnace is up to 50 years.
Investing in blast furnace technology in the 2020s means new plants would work even after 2070 which is the announced year for India to reach net zero emissions.
India’s fast-growing steel demand denotes that it faces a major challenge in decarbonising its coal-reliant steel industry. However, using low cost renewable electricity, India may have the opportunity to produce cost-competitive green hydrogen to use in the ironmaking process.
DRI can be produced using zero-emissions green hydrogen rather than gas or coal. The current drawback is its cost.
Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd’s huge planned pivot towards new energy technology has the potential to enable an era of cheap green hydrogen in India. Its planned US$75 billion of investment in renewable energy and electrolysers will help push down the cost of green hydrogen – the company is aiming for US$1/kg underpinned by 100GW of renewable energy, both before the end of this decade.
Reliance’s green hydrogen ambition is now being followed by others including Adani.
The global steel industry is poised to shift from coal to hydrogen. With enough high-quality iron ore and low prices for hydrogen, India could play a pivotal role in global steel decarbonisation given its large and growing economy.
We await details of the technology intended to be used by AM/NS and POSCO/Adani – global steel decarbonisation will be difficult if low-carbon steel capacity is built in developed nations whilst older, carbon-intensive technology is built in developing nations where much of the steel demand growth can be expected.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/14/borosil-renewables-to-expand-solar-glass-manufacturing-capacity-to-2000-tonnes-per-day/,"HIGHLIGHTS,SOLAR GLASS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 14, 2022","Borosil Renewables to expand solar glass manufacturing capacity to 2,000 tons per day","Borosil Renewables will expand its solar panel glass manufacturing capacity from 450 tons per day to 2,000 as it continues to see strong growth in demand. The company is adding a third solar line with a capacity of 550 metric tons which is expected to start production by September and will enhance the manufacturer’s daily production capacity to 1,000 tons. 
Another doubling in capacity, through the addition of two more solar glass lines, has already been approved by the company’s board. Of those, one is expected to come on stream in the third quarter of next year. 
Thinner glass – 2mm, 2.5mm, and 2.8mm – occupies almost 30% of Borosil’s production capacity at present and the company expects its 2mm products to account for at least a similar slice of its expanded capacity, based on rising demand for bifacial solar panels.
Borosil recorded net sales of INR169 crore in the October-to-December quarter, up 20% on the figures posted a year earlier. Exports, including to customers in special economic zones, stood at INR44.6 crore to account for 26.5% of quarterly turnover. The glassmaker banked net profits of INR45.7 crore for the three-month window.
That meant net sales for the nine months of the fiscal year to the end of December came in at INR465 crore, up 51% on the same period of fiscal year 2021.
The manufacturer has said it expects domestic demand to be driven by the big volumes of solar capacity which are being commissioned by government policies.
Presenting the company’s report card for the third quarter of the fiscal year, Borosil executive chairman PK Kheruka said: “The government has announced three major steps underlining its commitment to the establishment of a strong domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem. The first is the announcement of an additional allocation of INR19,500 crore under the PLI [production-linked incentive] scheme [to incentivize manufacturing capacity for] solar cells and modules, raising the total allocation to a very impressive INR24,000 crore. The second is the formal announcement of basic customs duty on solar panels at 40%, and on solar cells at 25%, effective from April 1, 2022. The third is the scheme of the approved list of models and manufacturers introduced some months ago, whereby effectively only Indian manufacturers of solar modules are able to supply to many types of government tenders, which have now been extended to open access and net metering projects as well. As a result, we are expecting that large incremental capacities, already announced, will now be implemented.” 
“Even though 14GW of solar module manufacturing capacity exists in India, actual production was about 5.5GW during the financial year 2021. We see installed capacity rising to 50GW of solar panels within the next three years. This will give a great boost to the domestic production of solar equipment in India, causing a major shift away from imports from China to sourcing from domestic manufacturers. Consequently, we expect increased demand for solar glass in India.” 
Kheruka said Borosil is in advanced discussions with many domestic manufacturers seeking Indian-made solar glass. The manufacturer is also anticipating attractive future growth in exports on the back of an expected rise in the production of solar modules in major markets such as Europe and the USA.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/14/residential-based-energy-storage-will-become-the-new-boiler-2-0/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"FEBRUARY 14, 2022",Residential based energy storage will become the new ‘Boiler 2.0,"From pv magazine Global
As we transition away from natural gas and other fossil fuels, we can – and will – make better use of renewable energy, storing it as electricity to provide space heating, hot water, and power for every socket and appliance in the home. This will then offset the power needed for the inevitable EV parked outside and in need of charging.
Using a battery energy storage system (BESS) combined with renewable technology and connected to the grid enables a home to store excess clean energy either for its own use or for selling back to the grid. The system can then recharge from the grid automatically during off-peak hours, capitalizing on cheaper tariffs. This setup creates a more flexible energy system, increasing the possibilities for renewable energy and helping to decarbonize the grid.
The most promising thing about this setup is that we already have the technology and skills to make it happen. We have the battery technology, solar panels, electricians (to connect the system to the grid) and we have compliances and standards in place for a smooth, safe integration.
We have a way to go before such a system is widely available and in place but energy storage is being adopted at a very rapid rate. According to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Energy Storage Tracking Report (last updated in November 2021) it is expected that installed global energy storage capacity will reach 585GW by 2030. 17GW was reported globally in 2020.
BESS is a swiftly evolving technology with a wide range of storage capabilities so what we don’t want is to create a system or components that will become obsolete as the technology advances. As with existing boilers, energy storage products will need to be serviced and maintained in order to extend their lifespan.
Boilers currently last for between 10-15 years before having to be stripped out and replaced, which no one likes to do; it is costly, messy, and wasteful. Another drawback with existing boilers is that, if a home is extended, to accommodate a growing family, for instance, the boiler and/or water tank may need replacing (even if it’s relatively new) to meet increased demand.
The beauty of battery storage is that it is often modular. If demand for power increases, it is possible to just add more batteries without the upheaval and waste of stripping everything out and starting again.
I don’t want to overlook the fact that battery waste is a very serious concern and, as our reliance on energy storage rises, consideration must be given to what will happen to a system or its parts when it no longer has a use in its current state.
As demand for batteries increases, so do the amounts of battery parts that will eventually go to recycling. Aceleron was set up to help the battery industry extract more value before batteries reach the material recovery stage. We bought and took apart a variety of batteries to see how they were built and discovered that most lithium-ion cells were assembled using permanent assembly methods like spot welding and adhesives. This has made recycling a challenge and reuse of viable components uneconomical. From this insight, we developed our own battery assembly technology and technique which provides the same performance as welding and can be disassembled for repair, reuse, and recycling.
Where this technology comes to life from a sustainability point of view, is unlocking reuse and repurposing. This additional extraction of value before recycling is where the technology adds value to the circular economy. We work in a number of countries around the world, where we can build second-life batteries using discarded parts that still have a purpose. These go on to provide power in a variety of ways, for instance for communities that are off-grid or to power fishing boats in Africa.
The bottom line with a circular economy battery such as this is, no part should ever need to go to landfill. They must be designed specifically so that every part will have second, third, fourth (etc) life opportunities.
There are repairable, upgradeable products already available which, with the proper care, updates and maintenance, can last a lifetime. Individual parts can be upgraded as technology advances and the components that need replacing over time can be easily recycled. The service engineer who services the system once a year (just like with existing boilers), can take those parts away, sending them into various recycling channels, ensuring that they are not contributing to a waste problem.
That is not to say, however, that we are in a position (yet) to install energy storage systems that can work independently everywhere, harnessing renewable energy to heat and power a home as well as recharge one, two, or possibly even three EV’s parked outside and power a heat pump. However, energy storage provides the flexibility to capture and use as much renewable energy available as possible from the grid, locally generated sources, or both, to supply our growing energy needs.
Energy storage is also a cleantech force ‘multiplier’; if a property has other clean technology installed, such as heat pumps, the renewable energy stored in the batteries can also be used as a power source for them.
The challenge with renewable energy is that we have no control whatsoever over whether the sun shines or the wind blows. This means that there are times when there is an abundance of clean energy and little or no demand – which is of course where energy storage comes into play.
If as many properties as possible have ‘clean energy buckets’, there is the potential to create a virtual power plant. This distributed network of batteries enables the grid to send excess renewable energy to the various locations during low demand, high generation periods, for later use by the property owner, or to resupply to the grid when demand is high. This ultimately reduces the requirement for fossil fuel by the network.
It also removes the ‘facilities burden’ for utility companies as there is no need for a massive, city-sized energy storage plant. Instead of building an energy storage plant to store around 20,000kWh – 30,000kWh, it can be broken down into small home energy storage systems (approximately 10kWh per home). In markets where the incentive model is right, property owners have even self-invested in energy storage, mitigating the capital and operational expense for the utility company as well.
This will work particularly well for countries where space is at a premium – cities in the UK for instance, where energy demand is high, but utility space is constrained. However, where the home already exists and the boiler space already exists, we are simply repurposing existing space and using it to store new, clean technology.
Of course, not every residential property will have the space or capacity to install an energy storage system for their own use so a more collaborative approach will be needed. In Spain for instance, solar communities are springing up, where groups of people are coming together to share the electricity generated on roofs. A battery-based solution allows everyone to participate.
The first thing we need to address, however, is the cost of these installations. Currently, the installation of a new boiler will cost £1,500 – £2,500 whereas a home energy storage system is likely to cost three to four times as much.
This is where governments need to step in. Just as there used to be financial incentives for installing solar panels 15 years ago, now we need incentives in the form of grants, tax rebates, and cashback schemes. Government incentives are going to be absolutely key to encouraging people to take the plunge.
Governments are more than aware that we have deadlines to hit our net zero goals and the only way for us to meet them is to find a way to store clean energy.
Homeowners also need to understand that there is a longer-term return on investment. Energy storage products with a longer operating life mean that a homeowner will continually reap the benefits over time. Longevity and reliability are how we will make the longer-lasting storage solutions a reality.
It will take a while and there are still several hurdles to overcome before battery storage replaces boilers entirely but when we get there, global carbon emissions will plummet as domestic reliance on natural gas practically disappears.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/14/new-agrivoltaic-system-design-from-germany/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"FEBRUARY 14, 2022",New agrivoltaic system design from Germany,"From pv magazine Global
German start-up Sunfarming Group has developed two new agrivoltaic systems in cooperation with Germany’s Forschungszentrum Jülich and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.
One of the two arrays is an evolution of the company’s Sunfarming Food & Energy system type, in which glass-glass modules are placed at a height of 2.5 meters and the mounting system is designed with a large post spacing to enable the use of big agricultural machines.
The second type of installation, the Sunfarming Food & Energy Tracking System, was developed with custom-made solar modules equipped with trackers and a total height of over 6 meters and a headroom of 4 meters. This system is used to research various shading scenarios for the plants as well as more efficient rainwater management in order to make plant cultivation more climate-resilient.
The demonstration plants in Morschenich-Alt Ende, in the North Rhine-Westphalia region, are expected to be completed in February. Their construction began at the end of the year after nine months of development. Comprehensive research work on plant cultivation in agri-photovoltaic systems is set to begin when the plants are completed. The system is expected to produce some 300,000 kWh of solar power annually. The solar power generated will also be used to supply the research site.
“We have been working successfully with the research center Jülich for many years, especially in the field of agrivoltaic systems,” explained David Morr, head of Food & Energy Projects at Sunfarming. The company operates its own research and innovation park in Rathenow, Brandenburg. The knowledge gained there was incorporated into the new developments.
“Based on the requirements of our clients, we were able to build two Food & Energy plant types for Morschenich-Alt, which are suitable for multiple use of space, with regard to the production of solar energy and the cultivation options for berries, medicinal, oil and fiber plants demonstrate new solutions under changing climatic conditions,” he continued.
Sunfarming is also currently realizing an “eco-solar plant” on a former gravel pit about 20 kilometers away from the demonstration plants. According to the company, this is the first photovoltaic system of this type in the Rhineland. Completion is scheduled for April. In addition, further photovoltaic systems are being planned in the district of Heinsberg.
