https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/20/indias-first-solar-microgrid-with-mw-scale-hybrid-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MICROGRID,ROOFTOP SOLAR,HARYANA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 20, 2021",India’s first solar microgrid with MW-scale hybrid energy storage,"Maharashtra-based Vision Mechatronics has delivered India’s first solar microgrid with megawatt (MW)-scale hybrid energy storage. The system is installed at Om Shanti Retreat Centre (ORC) in the Gurugram district of the Indian State of Haryana. 
In the system, 200kWp of solar panels have been connected to the energy storage combination of 614.4 kWh Lithium batteries with 480kWh tubular-gel lead-acid battery. The 1 MWh hybrid energy storage system is recharged by solar power throughout the day and used during power outages and at night hours. 
The hybrid battery storage system utilizes the center’s existing old lead-acid batteries with new lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) batteries, thus economically prolonging the backup duration to ensure zero-blackout scenarios.
Vision Mechatronics director Rashi Gupta told pv magazine, “Lithium energy storage beyond four hours is not economically viable as the system cost is prohibitory. So we combined it with a lead-acid battery to give a longer 18 hours of backup for smaller loads and about eight hours on median loads.”
The hybrid energy storage systems could allow commercial entities to reduce their capex investment in battery energy storage system by 35-40%. 
The microgrid system ensures an uninterrupted, flicker-free power supply with a response time of less than ten milliseconds, which keeps all electronic items at Om Shanti Retreat Centre unaffected by power cuts and fluctuations.
The Centre has a total electricity load of roughly about 500 kW. Heavy loads include three 40.2HP submersible water pumps that run for 10 hours a day, full air-conditioning throughout the halls of the campus, equipment in the community kitchen, big baking ovens, etc. Then there are lighting and other requirements too.
Vision Mechatronics
Through its hybrid energy storage arrangement, Vision Mechatronics is supporting three staggered types of loads at the Om Shanti Centre. “When the campus is on full load, electricity consumption goes up to approximately 450-500 kW. The minimum average daily load is 125-150 kilowatts daily, that’s a semi-load or median load kind of condition. The night load is generally constant at about 40 kilowatts. So, the whole concept here was to run the median load for at least eight hours, and the baseload for at least 18 hours. That’s how we arrived at the combination energy storage system capacity,” said Rashi Gupta. 
Solar generation starts at 5:30 am and continues till 6:30 pm in the evening. After that, the Center can choose to either use the grid electricity or the stored battery power.
The system is also connected to a diesel generator set, though it’s not used much. “Minimizing the use of the diesel generator at the Center was important. Their diesel tank storage capacity is about 7000 liters, so refueling the tank at today’s rising diesel prices is not viable”.  
Vision Mechatronics has specifically used a low-voltage system, unlike the traditional MW scale storages which have a high-voltage DC bus. Solar panels are DC coupled to the batteries, which maximizes the efficiency of the system as compared to AC-coupled solar generation. 
The Lithium battery used in the system has a special feature of active balancing and internet of things (IoT) capabilities along with predictive and preventive monitoring, maximizing the efficiency and life of the battery.

The mono PERC module facility will be capable of handling module wattage up to 640 watts. It is forward compatible with upcoming technologies such as M12 cell modules and high-efficiency bi-facial modules.
The new facility is located at Indospace Industrial Park in the Chennai district of Tamil Nadu.
Vikram Solar already has a 1.2 GW module facility in Falta, West Bengal. With the latest unit, its cumulative PV module manufacturing capacity has reached 2.5 GW—the largest in India.
Vikram Solar plans to add another 3 GW in the next five years, reaching an overall capacity of 5.5 GW. The proposed addition will be aimed at backward integration and will include cell and wafer capacity. The facility will be located close to 1.3 GW fab in Chennai.
Vikram Solar
The Chennai fab occupies a production area of 1.3 lac square feet. It is located close to the seaport, allowing for faster exports. The fab is equipped with high-tech automation and complies with Industry 4.0 standards. It is Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled and employs AI-enabled inspection for zero defects.
Speaking on the occasion, Gyanesh Chaudhary, Managing Director, Vikram Solar, said, “We believe that the exponential demand surge for solar energy coupled with a clarion call globally to diversify trade markets and supply chain presents a huge opportunity for indigenous solar manufacturing… our new facility further strengthens not just Vikram Solar but the Nation’s solar manufacturing prowess and ecosystem. Apart from bridging the demand-supply gap for modules, our state-of-the-art facility will propel technological innovation, job creation and aid India’s renewable energy targets.”

It has partnered with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) to source cells for its lithium battery packs. CATL is known to supply to global auto-giants like Tesla, BMW, and Mercedes.
“Using these high-grade cells, we can reduce the charging time to less than two hours by providing fast charging option to achieve 200 km range/day and a life of 200,000 km or up to 8 years by our estimates,” said Jayant Gupta, Founder and CEO, Grevol.
Based on trials and customer feedback, Grevol believes that its upcoming L5N category vehicle can consistently deliver a longer range with a higher payload capacity than other EVs in the three-wheeler segment. 
“We had to insist the E-commerce delivery partners to take our vehicles for longer routes as they were not confident with electric vehicle capabilities based on earlier experience with other electric three-wheelers they have used so far. The delivery partners were pleasantly surprised to note that Grevol vehicles provide a much superior range with heavier payloads,” informed Jayant.
An EV is essentially a battery pack on wheels, comprising 40-50% of the vehicle cost. The four elements that, together, create this ideal lithium battery pack are cell sourcing, a dynamic battery management system with cell balancing, an active thermal management system, and last but not least, the design and packaging of the battery pack.
“We conducted comprehensive lab and on-road tests to identify and resolve the challenges associated with the adaptability of lithium-ion batteries in the warmer climatic and tough road conditions prevalent in India,” said Grevol’s chief technology officer, Sanjay Aggarwal.

Module manufacturer Hyundai Energy Solutions, a unit of South Korean shipbuilding group Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd, announced it has secured a KRW33.5 billion ($29.3 million) order for the supply of solar modules for a floating PV project located in Haechang Bay, in Goheung county, in the South Korean province of Jeollanam.
“The project will have a capacity of 88 MW and will rely on our AquaMax product which has been especially designed for floating PV,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The module, which is produced at the company’s 1.35 GW factory in Eumseong County, in South Korea’s North Chungcheong province, is called AquaMax and is a half-cut monocrystalline PERC panel built with 156 cells with a size of 166x83mm each.
The product is offered in five versions, with power ratings ranging from 465 W to 485 W, and efficiencies between 20.1% and 21%.
The open-circuit voltage is between 53.2 V and 54.1 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 11.13 A to 11.38 A. The product measures 2,228×1,038x40mm and weighs in at 25.3kg.
It is encapsulated with polyolefin elastomer (POE) and also features an IP68 enclosure rating, anti–reflection coated, tempered glass, a transparent backsheet, and an anodized aluminum alloy frame.
South Korea is currently seeing increasing interest in floating PV due to land constraints. Local specialist Scotra finished building a 25 MW floating solar plant on a reservoir in Goheung county in August 2020. Furthermore, the Korean government is planning to construct the 2.1 GW floating solar complex near the Saemangeum tidal flat, on the coast of the Yellow Sea.
Korean manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells unveiled a special panel for floating solar in November 2020. A few months later, it secured a 320 MW order for the product from Saemangeum Solar Power Co Ltd, which is the Korean state-owned company responsible for the construction of the 2.1 GW floating solar complex.
