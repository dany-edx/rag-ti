https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/15/ornate-commissions-roof-integrated-solar-system-for-ashirvad-pipes/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,KARNATAKA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 15, 2023",Ornate commissions roof-integrated solar system for Ashirvad Pipes,"Ornate Solar, a building-integrated PV and Integrated Roofing (InRoof) solar solutions provider in India, has commissioned a roof-integrated solar system for leading PVC pipe manufacturer & water engineering expert Ashirvad Pipes. 
The 91 kW energy-generating roof made exclusively of solar panels has replaced 6,630 sq. ft. of asbestos roofs at Ashirvad Pipes’ production facility in Bengaluru.
“The InRoof is installed at the height of 10 meters (33 ft.) and covers the roof with integrated solar panels, walkways, safety lines, and a fall arrest system to meet with global safety requirements of Ashirvad Pipes (an Aliaxis Group company),” stated Ornate Solar.
Ornate Solar tested the system against water ingress in Bangalore’s inclement and unpredictable weather conditions and completed the installation in 30 days.

The Ornate InRoof uses 200 high-efficiency mono PERC modules with dual-cell technology. Each panel is equipped with IQ7 microinverters from Enphase Energy, which allows complete panel-level monitoring from anywhere in real time.
The patented assembly is the first-of-its-kind integrated solar system that can incorporate panels of any shape and size to replace conventional sheet metal to serve as a primary roof for industries, claims Ornate Solar, which designed, engineered, and manufactured the InRoof. According to Ornate, its InRoof solar system can accommodate up to 26% more solar panels than conventional roof-mounted solar systems.
By eliminating sheet roofing and leaving space for free air circulation, the structure is said to reduce module backsheet temperature by 15℃ and raise panel generation by approximately 10%.
Since the existing PV structure at the Ashirvad factory was not equipped to handle the weight of solar modules, it was reinforced with additional bracing. The engineering team developed a strategy to complete the installation without causing any disruptions to the factory operations below.
The InRoof solution is expected to generate 150,000 units of energy annually, resulting in an estimated savings of INR 10.5 lakh for Ashirvad Pipes. Further, the system will prevent 2,875 tons of C02 emissions by generating clean energy.

The study, titled “Pathways to Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India), examines India’s three most energy-intensive sectors (power, transport, and industry) and determines that achieving energy independence will generate significant economic, environmental, and energy benefits. This includes $2.5 trillion in consumer savings through 2047, reducing fossil fuel import expenditure by 90% or $240 billion per year by 2047, enhancing India’s industrial competitiveness globally, and enabling India’s net-zero commitment ahead of schedule.
India is the world’s third largest energy consumer, and its energy demand will quadruple in the coming decades, thanks to rapid economic growth. Currently, it must import 90% of its oil demand, 80% of industrial coal, and 40% of its natural gas consumption. Price and supply volatility in the global energy markets, as witnessed in recent years, strain India’s foreign exchange reserves, resulting in economy-wide inflation.
“The case for clean energy has never been stronger. India has achieved the world’s lowest renewable energy prices and has found some of the world’s largest lithium reserves,” said Nikit Abhyankar, Berkeley Lab scientist and the study’s lead author. “This can propel India towards cost-effective energy independence in an economically and environmentally advantageous way.”
The study shows that India’s energy independence pathway would involve the power sector installing more than 500 GW of non-fossil electricity generation capacity by 2030, a goal already announced by the government, followed by an 80% clean grid by 2040 and 90% by 2047. Nearly 100% of new vehicle sales could be electric by 2035. Heavy industrial production (90% of iron and steel, 90% of cement, and 100% of fertilizers) could shift primarily to green hydrogen and electrification by 2047. Most of the lithium demand (estimated 2 million tons by 2040) for manufacturing new electric vehicles and grid-scale battery storage systems could be produced domestically using newly discovered reserves.
In addition, the Indian industry must transition to clean technologies such as EV and green steel manufacturing. India is one of the world’s largest auto and steel exporters, with their largest markets in EU countries committed to carbon neutrality and a potential carbon border adjustment tariff.
“India’s energy infrastructure requires a $3 trillion investment in the coming decades, and our study finds that prioritizing new energy assets that are cost-effective and clean is crucial for long-term financial sustainability,” said Amol Phadke, Berkeley Lab scientist and a co-author. “India can leverage the existing policy framework it has laid out to expand the clean energy deployment.”
The study finds that India has a unique advantage to leapfrog to a clean energy future since the bulk of its energy infrastructure is yet to be built. India’s growing energy demand offers a significant runway of fifteen years for the existing fossil energy assets to transition to clean energy.
This energy transition would require significant policy support, including deployment mandates for clean technologies, financial and policy support for emerging technologies such as green hydrogen, and investment in domestic manufacturing capacity.
“We find that India will embark on an ambitious energy transition in the coming decades,” said Priyanka Mohanty, a co-author, and researcher at Berkeley Lab. “However, the transition runway provides time to strategically deploy clean technologies at scale and plan for a just transition.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/15/solar-arrays-on-sloping-terrain-with-narrow-land-width/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MIZORAM",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 15, 2023",Solar arrays on sloping terrain with narrow land-width ,"The hilly state of Mizoram now hosts a 28 MW DC (20 MW AC) solar power plant defying the challenge of sloping, uneven terrain with narrow strips of land separated by gorges. The plant is shaped like a hand palm with 15 solar array fingers connected by a perimeter road and a 33kV transmission line for power evacuation. 
The solar park is located near Vankal village in the Khawzawl district. It spans 194 acres, with around 100 acres available for solar plant installation and the remaining area consisting of a gorge and steep valley. The uneven terrain of the site makes it difficult to install solar panels in a way that maximizes their exposure to sunlight. The PV modules’ orientation and angle needed to be adjusted to account for the slope of the terrain. 
“The plant is shaped like a hand palm with 15 fingers connected by a perimeter road and 33kV transmission line for power evacuation to maximize module installation while minimizing shading effectively. Overall, our thoughtful approach to the design of the entire solar power plant should help us achieve optimal energy production and efficiency,” Kamalesh Saraswat, DGM-Engineering (solar & module line infra.), SAEL Ltd, told pv magazine. 
SAEL, through its wholly owned subsidiary Sunfree North East Renewable Energy, has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with the power and electricity department of the Mizoram government. SAEL’s in-house EPC team executed the plant installation and commissioning. 

Saraswat said the major challenge before their team was identifying the plant area where they could install the module mounting structure easily and achieve the desired capacity of the plant as per the agreement with the client [PED Mizoram]. 
“Our team conducted a contour and drone survey of the entire area to identify the flat area, gorge, and steep valley area and optimize module angle through our latest software and tools. We also followed the natural contour and minimized the steep area to reduce mismatch losses/efficiency of the plant,” said Saraswat. 
Further, Mizoram experiences high winds and heavy rainfall, which can damage or dislodge solar modules. So, the SAEL team provided additional structural support to ensure the panels remained securely in place. The module mounting structure differs from conventional flat-terrain solar power plants. 
The plant is built with high-efficiency mono-PERC modules and high-wattage string inverter. Further, containerized solution for the LT/HT switchgear room has been used to ensure optimal temperature and ingress protection.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/15/agrivoltaics-market-valued-at-9-3-billion/,"AGRIVOLTAICS,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 15, 2023",Agrivoltaics market valued at $9.3 billion,"From pv magazine Global
Agrivoltaics, the combination of farming practices with energy produced by solar photovoltaics (PV), is forecast to become a $9.3 billion marketplace by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1% in that timeframe from $3.6 billion a year ago, according to a research note by India-based market research company Allied Analytics.
Experts believe agrivoltaics can minimize barriers to food security and the transition to clean energy, Allied Analytics said. While the agrivoltaics market is still in the growth stages, it is expected to grow as the solar market continues to boom, owing to demand for clean energy and sustainability.
The agrivoltaics sub-sector market has seen progress as the industry learning curve grows around best use cases in recent years, with the global installed output of agrivoltaics rising from 5 MW in 2012 to around 2.9 GW in 2020, according to Allied Analytics.
To promote a healthy growth environment, subsidies from governing authorities will be required. The implementation of agrivoltaic solutions will require joint ventures, lease agreements, reduced loan rates, and risk exposures, said the market research note. In addition, since there is a significant reduction in crop yield, regulations regarding solar installations need to be enforced for minimizing land exploitation.
Based on climate change and increasing drought and extreme weather events, agrivoltaics offers key advantages such as zero-emission solar power coupled with food production and the protection of crops from drought and damage caused by hail or heavy rain.
To date, the world’s largest agrivoltaics installation has been built on the edge of the Gobi Desert in China, where berries are cultivated underneath solar modules, with total output of 700 MW, set to increase to 1 GW.
According to Allied Analytics, major agrivoltaic market developers include BayWa, Insolight SA, JA Solar, Enel Green Power, Sunseed APV, Mirai Solar, Namaste Solar, Ombrea, Sun’Agri and Next2Sun.
