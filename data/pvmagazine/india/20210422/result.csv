https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/22/gujarat-falling-short-of-its-2021-22-solar-pv-rooftop-targets/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,ROOFTOP SOLAR,GUJARAT",,"APRIL 22, 2021",Gujarat is progressing towards its solar PV rooftop target 2021-22,"Growing concerns over climate change and issues of sustainable development have drawn global attention towards clean energy transitions. India being among the leading nations in terms of installed Renewable Energy (RE) capacity, has set an ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of achieving  40 percent of its total installed energy capacity through non-fossil fuel-based sources by 2030 under the Paris Agreement 2015. 
In line with this ambitious target, the initial Renewable Energy (RE) targets were set at 175 GW by 2022; this has now been revised to 227 GW by 2022.  Out of the 227 GW, 114 GW will be contributed by grid-connected and off-grid solar energy utilities. 
Solar PV installations in India are chiefly comprised of ground-mounted (large and medium scale) plants and solar PV rooftop systems. The Central agency for RE capacity building, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), has launched several schemes for stimulating the adoption and diffusion of solar technologies since 2016. Some of these initiatives include: Jawahar Lal Nehru National Solar Mission (Phase II); Development of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Projects (e.g., Badla Solar Park in Rajasthan, Charanka Solar Park in Gujarat and Kurnool Ultra Mega Solar Park in Andhra Pradesh, etc.); and Grid Connected Solar Rooftop Programme. 
Although the capacity addition in terms of solar PV utilities has grown from 6.7 GW in 2015-16 to a current cumulative capacity of 41.7 GW in the first quarter of 2021 (i.e. approximately 5 times of the 2015-16 levels), capacity additions in the PV rooftop segment have been unsatisfactory given the nationally determined target of achieving 40 GW of installed capacity by 2022.  
As per recent estimates (as of February 28, 2021), the cumulative capacity of solar PV rooftop systems stands at 4324.58 MW. This falls far behind the target, i.e., around 10% of the capacity to be achieved by 2022. 
Recent MNRE statistics reveal that Gujarat tops the list of Indian states with installed solar rooftop capacity, at 943. 13 MW. The persisting pandemic has slowed down the pace of capacity addition but policy incentives like SURYA-Gujarat are paving the way towards Gujarat’s clean energy transition. Other states that follow are: Maharashtra with 647.73 MW; Rajasthan with 419 MW; Tamil Nadu with 313.33 MW; and Haryana with 277.03 MW of installed solar rooftop capacity
In sync with the National Solar Mission’s target, the Centre has given Gujarat a target of 8.024 GW by 2022. Out of this, 3.2 GW should comprise rooftop installations. Solar rooftop utilities are distributed among commercial, industrial, public sector, and residential consumers. Even though Gujarat fares better than other Indian states in terms of installed solar PV rooftop capacity, it has only achieved around 30% of the allotted target, as of the first quarter of 2021. 
There is a large untapped potential for capacity development of rooftop systems by promoting the diffusion of solar PV rooftop technologies, particularly among residential households. Since the majority of commercial, public, and industrial sector utilities are medium- or large-scale ground-mounted solar plants, the solar PV rooftop technology adoption by residential consumers is a potential way forward to achieving Gujarat’s rooftop PV targets by 2022. 
Moreover, as rooftop utilities do not require additional land allocation and the energy generated is consumed at source, this is a superior alternative with respect to the transition towards a clean energy future.  
Acknowledging the potential of solar PV rooftops and realizing the necessity of tapping this still underexplored market, Gujarat state nodal agencies, such as Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) and Gujarat Energy Development Agency (GEDA) have implemented schemes for incentivizing the uptake of solar rooftop adoption, especially among residential consumers. 
The Gujarat Solar Policy 2021 and Surya Urja Rooftop Yojana – Gujarat (SURYA- Gujarat) are state-level policy initiatives that focus on providing technical assistance and financial support to residential rooftop users. The SURYA – Gujarat scheme targets coverage of 8 lakh residential consumers by the end of FY 2021-22. However, as of December 31, 2020, the commissioned residential rooftop capacity was around 632.26 MW (GEDA). 
With respect to the number of consumers catered to by the end of 2020, Gujarat has only been able to achieve around 2 lakh residential consumers for Solar PV rooftops. This is merely one-fourth of the target allocated to Gujarat.  
In this context, there is a need to understand what factors determine the decisions made by residential consumers. Despite incentives such as net-metering systems (@ Rs 2.25/ unit) and state subsidies of 40% for grid-connected PV utilities up to 3 KW and 20% for above 3 KW to 10 KW capacity made available for private residential consumers in Gujarat, the adoption rate of solar rooftops is considerably lagging with respect to Gujarat’s residential segment target for the end of 2021-22. 
A recent study funded by the Climate Change Department, Government of Gujarat aimed to explore the adoption determinants of solar PV rooftops among residential households. The preliminary findings suggested that PV rooftops are mainly being adopted by high income households. Although middle-income and low-income households are aware of the economic and environmental benefits of solar PV rooftops, they are unable to adopt this technology due to high installation costs which must be incurred as a one-time payment. 
Also most users of solar PV rooftops are urban residents, and the penetration of this technology is quite low in rural areas of Gujarat. Interestingly, cultural factors such as the kite flying festival in Gujarat also inhibit consumers from sacrificing their roof areas to install PV systems. Moreover, many of the non-users are still unaware of the benefits and promotional schemes of MNRE, GEDA, and GUVNL. This indicates a need for more exhaustive marketing campaigns for rooftop PV adoption and diffusion among rural as well as urban households.  
To cater to the financial challenge of middle- and low-income households regarding large one-time installation costs of solar panels, provisions for partial payment such as monthly or quarterly installments can be aided by the state nodal agencies. 
There is also a need to boost investment in R&D to fund the government and private laboratories and promote innovative businesses so that more efficient PV panels that would generate more electricity per KW and require less installation space, can be produced. This will also make it easier for consumers who are reluctant to do away with their roof spaces to install PV rooftops. 
Additionally, the study also revealed that the adoption of rooftops is lowest among households living in flats or residential societies in Gujarat. Policy incentives to facilitate cooperative ownership of solar PV rooftops can help expand the consumer base further with regards to private consumers living in premises with shared rooftops.  
In light of this discussion, it is important to streamline Gujarat’s solar energy policies to fill the gaps in the market expansion of solar PV systems among residential households. Incorporation of measures to cater to the cultural requirements and financial challenges of middle income and low -income households, and intensive marketing and advertisement drives to spread awareness in rural as well as urban regions, are some of the steps to ensure achievement of Gujarat’s 8.024 GW target. 
Furthermore, developing policies conducive to innovation and R&D activities, specifically focusing on product innovations, would help in increasing efficiency and coming up with more cost-saving and space-saving designs. 
It is only through chiseling the rough edges in the existing Solar Policy and Rooftop scheme that Gujarat can achieve is ambitious solar rooftop target by 2022.

The project, located in the Patan District, benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement with the state Discom Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) at a tariff of INR 2.68/kWh (US$0.036/kWh). 
Renew Power has deployed advanced mono PERC solar modules with seasonal tilt structure design at the solar farm to ensure greater generation efficiency and maximum utilization of assets.
The latest addition takes ReNew’s total operational solar capacity in Gujarat to 145 MW and all-India PV capacity to 4.7 GW. It follows the commissioning of a 300 MW wind farm in Gujarat and 110 MW solar farm in Rajasthan since March this year.
As announced earlier, ReNew Power has entered into a merger agreement with a US-based special-purpose acquisition corporation as it seeks to become a publicly listed company on the NASDAQ.
The Goldman Sachs-backed renewable power producer’s transaction with NASDAQ-listed RMG Acquisition Corporation II (RMG II) implies an enterprise valuation of around $8 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. 
Upon completion of the transaction with RMG II, the combined entity would be named ReNew Energy Global PLC and expected to be listed on the NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol “RNW.”
Founded in 2011, ReNew is India’s leading renewable energy independent power producer (IPP), and among the top 15 largest renewable IPPs globally by capacity, with a portfolio of more than 100 operational utility-scale wind and solar energy projects spread across nine Indian states. The company also owns and operates distributed solar energy projects for more than 150 commercial and industrial customers across India.
ReNew is presently the only company in the Indian renewable energy sector with over 5 GW of operational capacity.
The company currently has an aggregate wind and solar capacity of close to 10 GW (including the capacity won in competitive bids).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/22/one-stop-portal-launched-to-provide-all-india-renewable-energy-generation-data/,"DATA ANALYSIS,HIGHLIGHTS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 22, 2021",One-stop portal launched to provide all-India renewable energy generation data,"The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and CEEW’s Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) have jointly launched the India Renewables Dashboard that provides detailed operational information on renewable energy (RE) projects in India. This information is freely available to policymakers, developers, financiers, and the public. 
The dashboard, supported by the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, captures daily generation data at the state, regional and national levels for the aggregate 93 GW of installed RE capacity in India. It also captures this data at a plant level for a subset of projects. 
Previously, such data required manual aggregation and was not easily accessible. The India Renewables Dashboard addresses this challenge by automating the process of updating daily RE generation. Further, users can download the data in multiple formats and conduct their bespoke analyses. This will allow them to gain invaluable insights for improving project implementation, infrastructure planning, and power generation forecasting in the renewables sector.
Gagan Sidhu, director, CEEW-CEF, said, “Data accessibility is crucial for India to attract the hundreds of billions of dollars in investments that it needs to grow its RE capacity to five times the current 93 GW. In this context, the India Renewables Dashboard can help mitigate risk perception and make capital available for India’s green transition at more affordable rates. By doing so, it can help accelerate India’s much-needed energy transition.”  
According to the India Renewables Dashboard, India’s solar power generation on April 20, 2021 was 172.3 million kWh and its total wind power generation on the same day was 168.3 million kWh. This represented a combined 8.3% share for the two sources in total electricity generation on that day. The highest daily generation figures recorded in the last twelve months for solar and wind are 216.5 million kWh and 444.5 million kWh, respectively.
The India Renewables Dashboard not only tracks data on RE generation but also quantifies the mitigation of CO2 emissions achieved as a result. It has also automated the creation and publication of key reports by CEA’s Renewable Energy Monitoring division, reducing the possibility of human error. 
In the next phase, CEA and CEEW-CEF will extend the number of projects covered by the dashboard and collect additional project-level information on parameters like location, project capacity, developers, offtakers, discoms, and tariffs.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/22/first-solar-claims-lowest-module-degradation-rate-in-the-industry/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 22, 2021",First Solar claims lowest module degradation rate in the industry,"From pv magazine International
US cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar module manufacturer First Solar has announced that its most powerful products — the Series 6 CuRe panels — have achieved what it claims to be the lowest degradation rate in the PV industry.
The company said the panel degradation rate was 0.2% per year and its temperature coefficient -0.28% per degree Celsius. “This unprecedented degradation rate is up to 60% lower than conventional crystalline silicon (c-Si) products, and ensures that the module will retain at least 92% of its original performance at the end of its 30-year warranty,” it explained, without disclosing whether the results were confirmed by an independent entity.
The panel maker specified the module’s increased stability was achieved thanks to its Copper Replacement (CuRe) program, through which it replaced copper with elements from the fifth column of the periodic table (Group V). This group includes elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.
Copper was removed as it may easily change energy states and diffuse spatially, thus creating a risk of instabilities. The novel doping technology was developed in 2019 in partnership with the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and presented in a study published in nature. The NREL said at the time that elements from the fifth column of the periodic table (Group V), such as antimony or arsenic, were placed onto tellurium crystal sites.
“Series 6 CuRe represents innovation in its truest form,” said First Solar CEO Mark Widmar. “From engineering the atoms in the semiconductor to its ability to withstand extreme weather events such as hailstorms, and from the social license that comes built-in to being able to recycle over 90% of each module, this responsibly-produced technology is packed with innovation designed to address many of our customers’ biggest challenges.”
According to the product sheet, the module is available in six wattages from 450 to 480 W and has a power conversion efficiency ranging from 17.9% to 19.0%. It has a size of 2,024×1,245 mm and a weight of up to 34.9 kg. The open-circuit voltage is between 221.7 and 226.0 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 2.66 to 2.67 A. The maximum system voltage for the module is 1,500 V.
The panels can be used with operating temperatures of between -40°C and 85°C. They come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee.
