These integrated PV systems developed by Silicon Valley based startup Arka Energy turn roof and open spaces in most homes into an energy generating asset, without compromising on aesthetics.
Unlike conventional PV systems assembled with discrete components like modules, inverters and racking, the Arka collection offers an integrated solution with custom components and pretested systems.
Arka PowerRoof and PowerGazebo deliver pleasing aesthetics with glass-on-glass solar tiles built with advanced shingling technology and mounted on custom interlocking brackets for a lifetime weatherproof solution.
Arka solar tiles are tested and approved by the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) to the IEC 60215 standard. These can withstand wind speeds of up to 160 km/hour (equivalent to a category 2 hurricane).
The Arka PowerRoof can be installed on a concrete roof facet or a hoisted metal truss. It offers a stylish integrated solar roof with a jet-black glass finish. It will soon be available in other conventional roofing tile colors like terracotta.
The PowerGazebo is suitable for villa terraces and gardens. It is a fully integrated weatherproof solution with a custom wooden finish, false ceiling, integrated LED lighting and power sockets –providing a great space for festivals or parties.
“SunEdison has adapted our solutions to the Indian market. Our aim is to develop elegant solar solutions because the customer should not have to choose between style and sustainability! The PowerGazebo expands the living space in a garden or a terrace, while PowerRoof in an integrated solar roof that functions as the normal roof and additionally generates solar energy thereby reducing energy costs and carbon footprint,” said Surya Potharaju, CEO of Arka Energy.
SunEdison has completed its first customer project in a luxury villa society in Sarjapur Road, Bengaluru and has also delivered PowerGazebo orders in Hyderabad. The system also comes with a 99% efficiency inverter and monitoring app Spotlight, which helps homeowners track energy generation and system performance. SunEdison’s advanced cloud analytics detect any abnormal dip in production and send out a maintenance alert, indicating that it is time to clean the panels.

The successful developers will supply the power from their proposed or under-construction PV projects.
Out of 1.5 GW capacity, 750 MW will be awarded under the Greenshoe option.
GUVNL may enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders.
The bidders selected by GUVNL shall set up solar power projects in Gujarat, including the electrical network up to the delivery point. They can opt for connectivity at a state transmission utility (STU) or central transmission utility (CTU) Sub-station.
Projects under construction and not having any PPA with existing buyers shall also be eligible to participate in the tender.
Solar projects can be set up in an existing wind farm that is already connected to the grid, subject to the availability of spare capacity for RE integration at the corresponding GETCO/CTU substation.
The minimum project capacity will be 25 MW.

It will be one of world’s largest, most advanced cell R&D facilities, set up with a $500 million investment. The facility will employ more than 500 engineers and researchers.
The electric mobility company is investing deeply in core R&D to create advanced cell technologies as it plans large-scale manufacturing of batteries. With this, it will have a complete electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem in India with R&D across 2W, 4W, and cell, and manufacturing at a global scale.
Ola has already applied for the government of India’s $2.4-billion production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to develop advanced cells. And it will set up a cutting-edge cell manufacturing facility with up to 50 GWh capacity in India.
The company has appointed the former CEO of LG Chem Power, Prabhakar Patil, to the Ola Electric board. Patil brings to Ola his tremendous expertise in designing batteries for some of the leading EVs around the world.
Ola has also invested in Israel-based extreme-fast charging EV battery developer StoreDot. The investment gives Ola Electric access to StoreDot’s battery technology that charges a battery from 0 to 100% in just five minutes. Ola will also have exclusive rights to manufacture batteries integrating StoreDot’s fast charge technology in India.
