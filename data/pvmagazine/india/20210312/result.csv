The New Jersey-headquartered Triton-EV is the electric mobility arm of Triton Solar, a US-based solar panel and battery engineering firm. It has registered the Indian subsidiary by the name of Triton Electric Vehicles India in New Delhi.
Like Tesla, Triton EV plans to produce electric cars in India. The company is in discussion with a few Indian states for setting up a well-equipped EV car manufacturing base in India with all the advanced technologies and state-of-the-art infrastructure.
Production
The India manufacturing facility will produce electric cars for India and other countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Middle East, and Africa. It is estimated to employ over 21,000 people over the next three years. 
“We are considering our India’s entry very critical and important for the company as well as for the entire industry. EV has a robust future for Indian roads as well as for many parts of the world. The government authorities are also working very seriously in pushing the culture of EVs in India. We at Triton EV are committed to producing best-in-class EVs for India,” said Himanshu B Patel, founder and chief executive officer of Triton EV.
The company expects a substantial amount of export revenue from its manufacturing setup. 
The India factory will not be just an assembly line for the cars, but will produce most of the critical products and components required in an EV. 
The company recently signed a memorandum of understanding with state-run engineering major Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited to supply the identified products, including energy storage systems. As per the MoU, BHEL will manufacture these products with Triton providing the requisite know-how and technical documentation.
Triton EV is involved in the energy storage system business ranging from transportable small battery packs to a 10 MWh battery storage unit for customers in the USA and abroad for applications like energy generation, load management, EV charging stations, etc. It is also involved in the manufacturing of electric vehicles using battery technologies developed by them.

However, the challenges of adding sufficient solar capacity are daunting, given the sheer man-hours required to install, maintain, and repair the nation’s growing PV infrastructure. 
A typical 250 MW plant, for example, spans over 1,000 acres. And it takes anywhere from 6 to 12 months to properly install and configure the millions of individual PV components, solar panels, and combiner boxes before that facility can come online. 
Even before Covid-19, designing and building solar plants represented major engineering challenges. But with lockdown restrictions and travel advisories, it’s become even harder to get “boots on the ground”—both to survey potential sites and to monitor the staggering number of electrical components required for continuous operation.
Fortunately, a host of emerging technologies are reshaping India’s energy landscape, bringing the country closer to its goal of powering 60% of its economy with renewable power by 2030.
The most conspicuous aspect of this technological shift is drones’ growing use throughout each solar plant’s lifecycle. 
Application
When deployed correctly, drones can:
In addition to cost savings, outsourcing the above tasks to drones is also safer—resulting in fewer accidents and injuries among ground personnel.
The real-time imaging, spectral, and geographic information system (GIS) data captured on each drone flight is used to train the next generation of AI tools and be made available to ground teams using mobile technology. And this marriage is helping to drive powerful insights, allowing teams to make better-informed decisions throughout the project development lifecycle:
We’re still in the early days of this digital revolution – in India and the rest of the world. But already, drone technology has proven useful in helping project developers overcome travel restrictions and reduce costs. And increasingly, this technology is also being used to:
 Add to this the growing use of artificial intelligence, mobile technology, and the Internet of Things – and it becomes clear that India’s solar industry is headed for a very bright future.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/12/indias-biggest-floating-solar-power-plant-to-go-online-by-june/,"FLOATING SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 12, 2021",India’s largest floating solar power plant to go online by June,"India could have its largest floating solar plant of 100 MW operational in the next two-three months. 
The floating solar plant is coming upon the Sri Ram Sagar Project reservoir [across Godavari river] that meets NTPC Ramagundam site’s water requirements in Telangana. It spans 450 acres of water surface area and is being set up at an investment of INR 430 crore. The plant will be commissioned by May-June this year, NTPC’s southern region executive director CV Anand told reporters in a press meet.
When completed, it will be the nation’s largest single-site floating solar plant to date, he said. 
Among other ambitious projects, India is working towards setting up a 600 MW floating solar plant in Madhya Pradesh’s Khandwa district. The plant is expected to complete and begin power generation in two years (by 2022-23). 
According to the state’s new and renewable energy minister, Hardeep Singh Dang, the array planned for the reservoir formed by the Omkareshwar dam across the Narmada river will be the world’s largest.
That title is reportedly held at present by a 150 MW plant in Anhui, China which has been in operation since November 2017.
The 2,000ha Madhya Pradesh facility will require an estimated INR 3,000 crore investment.
