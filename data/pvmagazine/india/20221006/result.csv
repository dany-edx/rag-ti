The two companies will jointly explore the pathways to reduce CO2 emissions from Kawas gas power plant and further implementation at scale across NTPC’s installed units in India.
NTPC’s Kawas gas power plant is powered by four GE 9E gas turbines operating in a combined-cycle mode and has an installed capacity of 645 MW.
GE’s advance E-Class gas turbine portfolio currently has the capability to burn up to 100% by volume of hydrogen when blended with natural gas. This capability varies depending on the type of combustion system used. For fuels with over 5% hydrogen by volume, gas turbine accessories need to be evaluated and possibly modified to reliably deliver the fuel to the combustors.
In this first-of-its-kind MoU with NTPC in India, GE Gas Power will evaluate the possible modifications in the gas turbine unit and auxiliaries required for blending of H2 with natural gas. Thereafter, a pilot project for 5% co-firing of hydrogen may be implemented at the Kawas gas power plant in a safe environment based on the feasibility report.
NTPC shall provide H2 required for the project.
“As our collaboration with GE grows deeper, we are more focused to use advanced technology and leverage our gas power assets with higher percentage of zero-carbon fuels such as H2, as the availability of the fuel becomes viable,” said Ujjwal Kanti Bhattacharya, Director (Projects), NTPC Ltd.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/06/waaree-energies-raises-122-4-million-to-expand-solar-manufacturing/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 6, 2022",Waaree Energies raises $122.4 million to expand solar manufacturing,"Mumbai-headquartered Waaree Energies Ltd announced this week it has raised around INR 1,000 crore ($122.4 million) from various private investors including high-net-worth individuals and offices. The promoters also participated in this equity raise at the same valuation.
Waaree will use the proceeds to increase its solar module manufacturing capacity in India to 9 GW per year. Currently, it has 5 GW of PV module capacity operational and expects to commission the balance 4 GW by January next year.
Waaree also plans backward integration into the manufacturing of solar cells with a capacity of 5.4 GW.
Owing to the fund raise, the company recently withdrew its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed with capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). It had filed the draft papers in September last year as it sought to raise money for PV manufacturing expansion and other purposes.
Waaree recently emerged as India’s largest exporter of solar panels. It is purportedly the only manufacturer in India on the government’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) for 650 Wp solar panels.
The ALMM list includes eligible models and manufacturers of solar modules that comply with the Bureau of Indian Standards. Only the models and manufacturers included on the ALMM list can qualify for use in government projects and projects set up under government schemes and programs.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/06/indias-residential-rooftop-solar-capacity-expected-to-rise-by-60-this-fiscal-year/,"COST AND PRICES,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 6, 2022",India’s residential rooftop solar capacity expected to rise by 60% this fiscal year,"India’s cumulative residential rooftop solar capacity will reach 3.2 GW by the end of the current fiscal year FY2022-23, nearly a 60% increase from 2 GW as of FY 2021-22—according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research & Analytics.
The report states the increasing need for cost savings and growing awareness among residential consumers, along with a strong push by the central government, is helping accelerate the pace of rooftop solar installations in India’s residential segment.
“India has more than 300 million households and is endowed with abundant sunshine almost throughout the year, with an annual average of 300 sunny days. This shows that the potential for rooftop solar installations in residential spaces is huge in India. We expect the growth of residential rooftop solar installations to accelerate in the near term across India because of the strong policy push and resurgent market demand,” said report’s co-author Vibhuti Garg, director – South Asia, IEEFA.
The report says Gujarat is the most favourable state for rooftop PV installations, followed by Haryana and Maharashtra. It ranked states in their attractiveness for rooftop solar based on their scores across electricity cost savings, net metering favourability, subsidy availability and disbursal, and electricity distribution company (Discom) rating.
The report highlights that there has been a key change brought about in consumer behaviour and demands after Covid-19.
“The lack of consumer awareness had been one of the major impediments to adoption, especially in the pre-Covid-19 era. However, post-Covid-19, there has been a strong surge in demand, backed by enhanced consciousness about cost savings, the environment, etc,” said co-author Jyoti Gulia, founder, JMK Research.
Interestingly, while the pace of the solarization of India’s residential segment has been underwhelming, the country has been the world’s least expensive residential solar power market for about a decade.
In 2020, the average cost of a residential rooftop solar system in India was $658/kW—3.3 to 6.4 times less than in leading residential markets such as Japan, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the USA.
The report adds that the central government’s recent push by launching a single national digital portal to simplify the process of residential rooftop solar installations and formalising a direct benefit transfer mechanism will boost capacity addition.
“The new Central Financial Assistance (CFA) scheme will allow residential consumers to buy rooftop solar systems from any registered supplier of their choice. This broadens consumers’ options for quality products and services,” says co-author Prabhakar Sharma, senior research associate, JMK Research.
The report also finds that some policy hurdles persist at the state level. For example, state governments must resolve issues such as delays in net metering approvals and proper communication of the benefits of rooftop solar installations. Sometimes, state Discoms delay subsidy payments to the installers, disrupting the latter’s working capital flow.
“Concerning the residential solar regulations, all Discoms must grant net metering approvals to the consumers within a strict and short timeline. In the case of residential rooftop solar systems, Discoms, in general, need to be restricted to carrying out two activities: inspecting solar plants and selling the net meters,” said co-author Akhil Thayillam, senior research associate, JMK Research.
In addition, the residential rooftop solar segment currently faces the challenges of increasing overall system costs and weak financing support.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/06/morningstar-unveils-dc-ac-inverters-for-off-grid-applications/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,OFF-GRID SOLAR,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 6, 2022",Morningstar unveils DC/AC inverters for off-grid applications,"From pv magazine Global
Morningstar, a US-based solar controllers manufacturer, has unveiled a new line of inverters for off-grid applications. Its SureSine DC-AC inverters come in six models, ranging from 150 W to 2500 W, 50 or 60Hz AC frequency, and 12 V, 24 V or 48 V (DC) input options.
“That wide range of choices, along with multiple AC terminal options, results in a total of some 70-plus SureSine variations capable of providing remote power in mission-critical solar electric systems around the globe,” said the US manufacturer.
The smallest inverter measures 312 mm x 190 mm x 96 mm and weighs in at 3.8 kg. The largest measures 544 mm x 247 mm x 156 mm and weighs in at 22.1 kg. The six models have output voltages of 120 V or 230 V and an operating temperature range of -40 C to 60 C. They also feature National Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTL) certification for the US market.
“We secured industry-leading NRTL certification as well as meeting all relevant CE and UL requirements,” said Jim McGrath, Morningstar’s director of sales. “After all, our solar controllers are already standard equipment in rural telecom, oil & gas, security, large-scale rural electrification projects, and other applications where failure isn’t an option. We made sure the new SureSines live up to our long-established reputation.”
The company developed the inverters in response to client requests for inverters with system-level integration and communication with Morningstar charge controllers. It unveiled the new products last week at RE+ in Anaheim, California, and at a pv magazine webinar.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/06/how-long-do-residential-solar-inverters-last-2/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 6, 2022",How long do residential solar inverters last?,"From pv magazine Global
In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we examine residential solar inverters in their various forms, how long they last, and how resilient they are.
The inverter, a device that converts the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, can come in a few different configurations. The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters. In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE) called DC optimizers. Microinverters and DC optimizers are generally used for roofs with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientation (not south-facing).
In applications where the roof has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
In a string inverter, there is generally less complicated wiring and a centralized location for easier repairs by solar technicians. Typically they are less expensive, said Solar Reviews. Inverters can typically cost 10-20% of the total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly aging components. A common source of failure in inverters is the electro-mechanical wear on the capacitor in the inverter. The electrolyte capacitors have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralized residential string inverter will last about 10 to 15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life.
String inverters generally have standard warranties ranging from five to 10 years, many with the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring through the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.
Microinverters have a longer life, EnergySage said they can often last 25 years, nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Usually, these inverters have a 20 to 25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfill its 20-plus year promise.
The same goes for DC optimizers, which are typically paired with a centralized string inverter. These components are designed to last for 20 to 25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.
Failure points 
A study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of solar array failures occur at the inverter level. There are numerous causes of this.
According to Fallon Solutions, one cause is grid faults. High or low voltage due to grid fault can cause the inverter to stop working, and circuit breakers or fuses can be activated to protect the inverter from high-voltage failure.
Sometimes failure can occur at the MLPE level, where the components of power optimizers are exposed to higher temperatures on the roof. If reduced production is being experienced, it could be a fault in the MLPE.
Installation must be done properly as well. As a rule of thumb, Fallon recommended that the solar panel capacity should be up to 133% of the inverter capacity. If the panels are not properly matched to a right-size inverter, they will not perform efficiently.
To keep an inverter running more efficiently for a longer period, residential installer Those Solar Guys recommended choosing a cool, dry place with lots of circulating fresh air. It also suggested avoiding installing in areas with direct sunlight, though specific brands of outdoor inverters are designed to withstand more sunlight than others. And, in multi-inverter installations, it is important to be sure there is proper clearance between each inverter, so that there isn’t heat transfer between inverters.
Those Solar Guys said it is best practice to inspect the outside of the inverter (if it is accessible) quarterly, making sure there are no physical signs of damage, and all vents and cooling fins are free from dirt and dust.
It is also recommended to schedule an inspection through a licensed solar installer every five years. Inspections typically cost $200 to $300, though some solar contracts have free maintenance and monitoring for 20-25 years. During the checkup, the inspector should check inside the inverter for signs of corrosion, damage, or pests.
In the next edition of the series, pv magazine will examine the life of residential battery energy storage applications.
