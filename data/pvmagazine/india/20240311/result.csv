SPDA is an independent industry association dedicated to advancing the energy transition in India.
The Indian business delegation, led by the representative from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India, included key officials from leading companies significantly contributing to the production of green hydrogen and its derivatives in India, such as Acme, Avaada Group, Hygenco, and Torrent Power.
The Indian delegation emphasized India’s readiness to support Korea’s ambitious decarbonization goals, offering competitive prices for fuels such as green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol. An invitation was extended to Korean counterparts to explore mutually beneficial opportunities, including establishing joint ventures with Indian organizations, facilitating technology transfer, engaging in joint Research & Development efforts, and signing offtake agreements.
The delegation engaged with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT), the two nodal ministries of the Government of South Korea behind the hydrogen policy development and its implementation across Korea. During the meetings, the emphasis was on India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission and the capability of Indian developers to supply green fuels earlier than their global counterparts.
Later the delegation met with prominent legal firms, Kim & Chang, and BKL, to understand legal provisions for facilitating green fuel export from India to Korea. The delegation also visited the Hydrogen Bus Refueling station in Incheon wherein the delegation was apprised with the on-site hydrogen production mechanism and refuelling system.
Mitsui said that it has successfully run a 50-bore MAN B&W two-stroke engine on hydrogen at its Tamano facility in Japan, which it claims is a world-first for the maritime industry. ” Mitsui converted one of the four cylinders of an MAN B&W ME-GI (-Gas Injection) engine to hydrogen operation,” said MAN Energy Solutions. “The hydrogen was supplied from a hydrogen gas-supply system that MITSUI developed in 2023.” The companies reported stable operation at various loads and operating conditions, including successful hydrogen combustion up to 100% load.
HD Hyundai Korea Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (KSOE) and 3M have signed a joint research project agreement to develop large liquid hydrogen storage tanks using Glass Bubbles from 3M. “The collaborative research will focus on developing a high-performance vacuum insulation system for liquified hydrogen storage and transportation,” said 3M.

NatPower UK, an arm of global energy transition developer NatPower Group, has said it will invest over GBP 10 billion in the United Kingdom‘s green energy market, including the nationwide deployment of battery energy storage projects.
The company said in a March 7 statement that it is committed to deploying more than 60 GWh of battery storage capacity by 2040, which it claims will provide 15% to 20% of UK energy storage. It said large-scale solar and wind projects will be announced later this year.
Plans for a nationwide large-scale battery storage roll out include the development of “GigaParks,” with the first three to go for planning permission this year, followed by 10 next year, confirmed NatPower UK.
It has earmarked GBP 600 million for the development of substations in this initial phase. It said this will help overcome grid bottlenecks and connection delays, which remain a key obstacle in the country’s transition to green energy.
A statement from the company said that battery storage is “an essential element of the net-zero jigsaw” and will help to reduce curtailment, which it estimates could cost GBP 3.5 billion per year by 2030.
 “To solve the bottlenecks that are slowing the shift to clean energy, we will drive investment into the grid itself, collaborating with grid operators to deliver more than 20% of the new substations required,” said Stefano D. M. Sommadossi, NatPower UK CEO. “By investing in substations and focusing on energy storage first, we will enable the next phase of the energy transition and bring down the cost of energy for consumers. We plan to deliver the benefits of the energy transition to all corners of the UK and our portfolio will play a big part in the UK achieving 100% of its targets.”
The UK government has set a target of delivering 100% renewable power by 2035. This includes plans to deploy up to 70 GW of solar by the same year.
In November, the National Grid said it is “speeding up” the connection of around 10 GW of battery energy storage projects in England and Wales.

9,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/11/polysilicon-prices-further-decouple-adverse-factors-thwart-contract-negotiations/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,2024-03-11,"Polysilicon prices further decouple, adverse factors thwart contract negotiations","The Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), the OPIS benchmark for polysilicon outside China, was assessed at $24.25/kg this week, down $0.55/kg, or 2.22% from the previous week, reflecting buy-sell indications heard.
According to market sources, conversations regarding contract negotiations between buyers and certain non-Chinese polysilicon vendors have encountered challenges. It has been reported that there are disagreements between the buyer and seller regarding certain aspects of the new long-term contract, as stated by an integrated player.
According to a China-based source, the pricing mechanism is considered the most challenging aspect of long-term contracts for both buyers and sellers to agree upon. The source further explained that disputes may arise between the parties regarding whether the pricing mechanism should be linked to the fluctuations in Chinese polysilicon prices.
An industry veteran has highlighted the high manufacturing costs as another major obstacle for the operation of polysilicon producers outside of China. The insider explained that the production cost for polysilicon manufactured outside of China has risen to a range between $15 and over $20. Factors contributing to this increase include global inflation and the growing trend of certain firms purchasing metal silicon from sources outside of China.

China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon prices in the country were assessed at CNY61.25 ($8.52)/kg, up CNY0.58/kg, or 0.96% from the previous week amid a rise in wafer producers’ demand for p-type polysilicon.
As per an upstream source, the product quality of certain polysilicon manufacturers, particularly the newer ones, has reached a stable level. Consequently, wafer producers have augmented their procurement of premium p-type polysilicon and blended them with n-type polysilicon to generate n-type wafers, thereby reducing production costs.
To produce n-type wafers, it is technically required that the metal impurities in the n-type polysilicon do not exceed 0.5 parts per billion by weight (ppbw). However, in practice, wafer producers usually blend n-type polysilicon in a specific ratio with polysilicon that contains metal impurities up to 10 ppbw, the source added.
The increase in production costs, primarily manifested by the rise in power prices, has played a role in driving up the price of polysilicon in China. A market observer asserts that Yunnan and Sichuan, which are home to several significant polysilicon factories, have seen an increase in electricity prices due to their low hydropower output during the current dry season.
Nevertheless, the duration of the rising polysilicon pricing trend in the domestic market of China is uncertain. A market participant notes that the sales volume of polysilicon for the previous week was moderate, suggesting that there is still a divergence of opinion between buyers and sellers regarding the pricing of polysilicon for the upcoming round. Furthermore, polysilicon factories currently hold approximately 80,000 MT of inventory, equivalent to approximately two weeks’ worth of production. It is important to note that this figure does not include the stock of polysilicon held by wafer companies.
According to this source, the present circumstances place a lot of strain on the new polysilicon players. This source further mentioned that a brand-new, 100,000 MT polysilicon project, whose construction had begun in February last year, was recently found to have been put on hold midway through. In addition, the producer of a 50,000 MT polysilicon project, which commenced production in June of last year, is presently seeking buyers; however, the process was said to have encountered some difficulties.
As per a market expert specializing in the polysilicon segment, it is projected that polysilicon prices will likely remain around the current level until June. However, as production of polysilicon intensifies in the second half of the year, prices are expected to decrease again, potentially falling within the range of CNY50 to CNY55/kg. At this point, there may be a possibility of certain capacities being phased out.
