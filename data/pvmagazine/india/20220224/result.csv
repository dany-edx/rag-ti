India, which targets 300GW of installed solar power generation capacity by 2030, has a PV cell manufacturing capacity of 4.3GW and a module manufacturing capacity of 18GW. The actual output is even lower as most of these manufacturing facilities have been operating below their nameplate capacities at a capacity utilization factor (CUF) of 40-50% or less.
The nation has been a laggard in manufacturing not just upstream PV components such as wafers and cells but also modules.
In comparison, China accounts for about 61% of the global solar module manufacturing capacity of 358 GW. India’s manufacturing capacity of 18GW is roughly equal to the annual capacity addition of the top individual Chinese PV brands, a comparison that shows the vast scope for Indian companies to match their economies of scale, states the report.
For raw materials, Indian manufacturers rely on imports mainly from China and face associated risks of shortages and price hikes. This highlights the need for a sustainable, vertically integrated domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem.
“Without large-scale domestic manufacturing, from raw materials through to modules, the overarching risks of logistics and commodity price fluctuations for imports will persist,” says co-author Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist and Lead India, IEEFA.
The report notes that the ambitious PV installation target, coupled with government support, has made the prospects for indigenous photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing increasingly vibrant. Dozens of companies are vying to make a mark in the Indian solar sector.
The Government of India’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for integrated PV manufacturing with an initial outlay of INR 4,500 crore (US$616 million), plus the additional allocation of Rs19,500 crore (US$2.5 billion) in Budget 2022, would have the combined potential to produce at least 40GW of solar modules.
Co-author Jyoti Gulia, Founder, JMK Research, says: “The PLI scheme alone, if judiciously implemented, can increase the integrated solar module, cell and wafer domestic manufacturing capacity several times over in the next three to four years.
“This will help in creating a huge demand potential for the PV ancillary market – solar glass, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), etc – and skilled workforce. The direct investment in the country on account of PLI budget expansion would potentially rise to about Rs90,000 crore (US$11.5 billion).”
Among issues before the Indian industry are the relatively low capacity utilization in factories producing solar cells and the type of solar cells being produced. The majority of domestic production (60-70%) employs multi-Si module technology – which is nearing obsolescence.
New major manufacturers who are planning to expand or enter the market aim to install machinery to produce mono-Si modules, the prevailing technology. This development will aid domestic players in competing with global rivals on quality and price.
The Indian PV industry also faces mid- to long-term challenges of high manufacturing expenses, inadequate research and development (R&D), and a shortage of skilled manpower.
Garg says, “Developing significant manufacturing capacities in raw materials, especially polysilicon, will be highly capital intensive and technologically complex. Domestic manufacturing companies need to have a proactive technology partnership with innovators or research institutes.
“Rather than focusing solely on output, it’s imperative for the domestic solar manufacturing industry to create a strong foundation for sustainable development overall.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/24/sify-partners-vibrant-energy-for-231-mw-of-solar-and-wind-power/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",Sify partners Vibrant Energy for 231 MW of solar and wind power,"Sify Technologies Limited has signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Vibrant Energy Holdings for a total 231 MW of solar and wind energy capacity to power its latest hyperscale data centers in India.
Vibrant Energy Holdings (Vibrant) is a majority-owned subsidiary of Blue Leaf Energy Asia, which is a portfolio company indirectly invested in by Macquarie’s Green Investment Group (GIG) and operating on a standalone basis.
Out of 231 MW of green power, PPA for 67 MW solar had been signed in March 2021 and the capacity was recently commissioned.
By simultaneously investing in both solar and wind energy, Sify will be able to meet most of the power required for its flagship data centers in Mumbai from renewable sources.
This partnership is the first step in minimizing the company’s dependence on fossil fuels to power its data centers.
Raju Vegesna, Chairman, Sify, said, “There is intensifying dialogue about adopting green energy. We decided to lead by action, as we always have done in the ICT space. With the constantly expanding need for world-class data center facilities to meet the burgeoning data-centric transformation of Indian businesses, we believe that investing in clean energy sources to fuel this transformation is a social imperative. Sify is proud to be doing its part to help our customers become a part of this clean energy future.”
Oliver Lewis, Chairman of Vibrant and Executive Director of GIG said: “We are very excited by Vibrant’s continued growth in capacity to provide green energy solutions to businesses in India, supporting India’s decarbonization. The partnership with Sify Technologies marks a new milestone on Vibrant’s journey of providing green energy and tailored solutions to meet the growing business demand.”

French start-up Solar Cloth has developed a copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) solar module for housing, greenhouses, aeronautics, mobility, sports and leisure applications.
The modules are manufactured with CIGS solar cells provided by US manufacturer Miasolé and have a power conversion efficiency of 17.6%.
“We are currently planning to set up a manufacturing facility in Mandelieu, near Cannes, together with our partner Soy PV, which is a new French CIGS platform for the manufacture of CIGS cells with electrolytic deposition,” Solar Cloth’s CEO, Alain Janet, told pv magazine. “The new production unit should be operational in April, with a capacity of 20 MW.”

The panels measure 1400 x 820mm and weigh 1.5 kg/m². The products are described by the manufacturers as rollable and extremely flexible modules, which do not contain breakable silicon or glass. “CIGS has a low carbon footprint of 12g to 20g CO2/kWh, and its recycling process has low impact and high value,” the manufacturer claims.
The module is also said to be adaptable to all kinds of textiles and was recently used for several tent lodges at the Paradise Springs California resort in the United States. The panels were deployed with a west-east orientation on both slopes of the tent lodges and connected to a battery with a capacity of 75Ah.
According to Solar Cloth, each of the tent lodges can now use on average 1,300 Wh per day and power a fridge, three portable lights, one lamp in the bathroom, one in the main room, a computer, three mobile phones, and other minor applications for a total output of 379 W.
“Solar Cloth participated last month in a European call for tenders, joining a consortium for the development of the perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells,” Janet stated, referring to the latest steps the company has taken to further scale up its module technology.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/24/lg-exits-solar-module-business/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",LG exits solar module business,"From pv magazine Global
Korean electronics manufacturer LG announced that it will close its solar module business by the end of June.
“The decision comes as uncertainties in the global solar panel business continue to increase due to a variety of contributing factors, including the intensification of price competition and the rising cost of raw materials,” the company said in a statement. “LG will continue to stand behind its brand and the company will maintain support for customers of existing LG solar panels for a period of time after the business’s closure has been completed. Solar panel production itself will continue until the second quarter this year to maintain adequate inventory for future service support.”
According to the company, the employees working at the PV unit, which is part of the company’s Business Solutions (BS) division, will be offered transition support and severance packages commensurate with their tenure with the company.
In its latest financial results, LG reported a slight increase in revenue for the BS division despite the “sluggish performance” of its solar module business.
