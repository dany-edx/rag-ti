https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/12/solar-manufacturing-pli-results-module-supply-to-remain-constrained/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,INDIA",,"APRIL 12, 2023",Solar manufacturing PLI results: module supply to remain constrained,"SECI has announced winners of tranche-II of the solar manufacturing Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. 11 companies have been awarded total PLI of INR 139 billion (USD 1.7 billion) to set up combined manufacturing capacity of 39.6 GW. Reliance and Shirdi Sai have each been awarded PLI for another 6 GW fully integrated capacity taking their total awarded capacity to 10 GW each, maximum permissible under the scheme. First Solar is the only other winner in the fully integrated category with a capacity of 3.4 GW. There are five winners including Waaree, ReNew, Avaada, Grew and JSW in the wafer-module category with a combined capacity of 16.8 GW; and three winners including Tata Power, Vikram and Amp in the cell-module category with a combined capacity of 7.4 GW.
Average PLI amount per GW of awarded capacity for the three categories works out to INR 5 billion, INR 3 billion and INR 2 billion respectively, approximately 25% of capital cost.

In total, PLI will be available for 48 GW manufacturing capacity. The second tranche was 4.3x bigger than the first tranche and yet the total response was 32% lesser in comparison. Overall, it was undersubscribed to the extent of 28% but the biggest shortfall of 37% was seen in the fully integrated category. Many bidders from the first round chose not to participate, most prominently Adani. Having earlier set ambitious plans, the group chose to sat out this round focusing instead on capital discipline in the aftermath of Hindenburg allegations.
The muted response is mainly down to the overly generous US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and massive overcapacity in China. Both countries are seeing a spate of investments leading to concerns about competitiveness of India-made modules in the international market. China’s polysilicon capacity is expected to double this year to an equivalent of about 800 GW of modules, while its total cell and module capacity is expected to jump to a whopping 1,000 GW, as against estimated global demand of about 300 GW. Meanwhile, the US module production capacity is also expected to grow multi-fold to about 70 GW by 2026.
It is worth noting that almost 50% of the PLI bid capacity has come from project developers (Reliance, Tata Power, ReNew, JSW, Avaada and Amp), who, alarmed by market disruption over last two years and stiff import barriers, are seeking mainly to meet their captive demand.
Commenting on the scheme, Vinay Rustagi, Managing Director, BRIDGE TO INDIA said: “The bid result shows immense competitive disadvantage facing domestic manufacturers. Despite strong trade barriers and offering a plethora of incentives, we expect domestic polysilicon and cell capacity to reach only 30 GW and 42 GW respectively by December 2026, barely enough to meet domestic demand. Unfortunately, market uncertainty seems set to continue for both manufacturers and project developers.”

The year 2020 saw the launch of solar modules exceeding 500 W of rated power generation capacity, in a leap from the previous standard of between 400 W and 450 W.
The solar market experienced an unprecedented power-per-unit boost in comparison to the then-steady 10 W to 15 W, year-to-year, average power growth trend driven by cell efficiency improvements.
Manufacturers said the motivation behind this disruptive product innovation was economic and aimed at adjusting the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from solar by using fewer modules per megawatt-peak of generation capacity, as well as optimizing balance of systems (BOS) expenditure and other construction and operations and maintenance costs.
At module design level, just as mainstream passivated emitter, rear contact (PERC) cell efficiency was reaching its practical maximum, two key features defined the development of the new PV module technology paradigm.
The first was a transition from regular, 156.75 mm “M2,” 158.75 mm “M3,” and 166 mm “M6” silicon wafer cells to 182 mm “M10,” and 210 mm “M12” sizes, all presented in cut-like forms with multi-busbar connections.
Secondly, module-surface non-active regions were reduced via high-density cell layouts, implementing novel cell interconnection approaches such as cell paving and tiling or shingling.
Today, modules with 550 W-plus nominal power – based on 182 mm wafers – and 210 mm-based, 650 W-plus products, are mainstream options for utility scale sites, typically with bifacial cells. Such panels require more, and larger cells, meaning larger, heavier modules, higher currents and lower voltage values. That has resulted in the most pluralized range of cell-to-module options ever seen.
Like any new PV technology, large-format modules come with hotly debated benefits and downsides. Despite impressive performance, larger modules are still not clear of challenges in terms of controlled and reliable use.
Developers and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies must consider the implications when deploying larger modules, including product quality and panel manufacturing processes, packaging and transportation, and tracker and inverter compatibility. These aspects must be taken into account before project design and procurement, to safeguard bankability.
In the factory, a key, still unsettled issue to tackle during the manufacturing of larger modules is the so-called “cross-crack defect,” which is detectable by electroluminescence testing. As mentioned before, larger solar modules are based on new PV cell interconnections which can enable the reduction of non-active areas between solar cells to up to just a few millimeters, which partially mitigates product enlargement.
Still, these novel welding processes might lead to tiny, cross-shaped cracks in the vicinity of cell edges, seldom reported by manufacturers as a formal product defect despite their widespread occurrence. Unless it is duly negotiated and improved during the supply-agreement negotiation phase, this subtle defect may imply major on-site micro-crack propagation risks. Stress arising during cell soldering and lamination, plus the potential presence of chips at the wafer’s cut edges, facilitate the formation of such small cracks which can harmfully propagate upon mechanical loading application.
Larger modules are intrinsically prone to significant body deflections and torsions, free from any International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) or Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards. This stems from big surface areas – often exceeding 3 m2 – with the use of aluminum frames thinner than the typical 35 mm used in 400 W designs, driven by the need to optimize module weight of up to 40 kg. Weight reduction compels 3.2 mm glass substrates to be switched to the current 2 mm-plus-2 mm, dual glass architecture. Merging variables including higher area, shorter frame width, and thinner but heavier glass means a weaker module.
Glass quality is indeed a current challenge to consider, underscoring the need for bill-of-materials evaluation and approval prior to module production. Most suppliers declare in their constructional data forms and other documents that both front and rear glass are tempered, even though a simple audit check reveals quite the opposite on many occasions. Datasheets are confusing about the type of thermal treatment used in glass manufacturing, if any was used at all. As a result, sudden and unusually regular glass breakage incidences on mounted modules, mostly affecting the rear glass substrates, are being reported in many PV plants worldwide.
The flash test measurement of bifacial larger modules deserves further consideration when defining supply power bin distributions. The common 5 W datasheet’s interval, within the same module series, remains unchanged since early PV industry times, when around three-times-lower-powered panels were used. This may lead to less controlled nameplate power and module class sorting distribution, especially if several nameplate values are involved in the supply agreement – questioning whether more than one nameplate power is actually needed – and often triggering eventual changes in the total quantity of panels to comply with the total purchased power.

Also, the virtually, not-so-properly-established plus or minus 3% flash test uncertainty standard – amounting to a 16.5 W difference in a 550 W module – can lead to greater difficulties in filing power warranty claims and in rejecting lower-power, pre-shipment, laboratory inspection results, limiting the success ratio if test conditions and acceptance criteria are not duly settled in the supply agreement.
Finally, when measuring a larger module, the spatial uniformity of solar simulators should be a basic checkpoint to report during factory inspections, to avoid systematic errors potentially affecting the whole power output under purchase. Likewise, the use of more and larger cells per module may tend to a certain bifacial coefficient scattered distribution, which could play a role in determining PV plant design. Fortunately, as per our extensive experience of auditing factories and inspecting larger modules, manufacturers are making efforts to control these aspects properly, especially in brand-new production workshops and lines that do not require flash test system retrofits.
Larger modules are defined by increased area and weight. Consequently, logistics are affected one way or another. For instance, turning from a 400 W, M6-based module to an M12’s 650 W-plus implies an extra 30% surface area and load to pack and transport by sea and road. Despite cargo costs gradually decreasing since the container crisis hit worldwide markets in recent years, module manufacturers have built up innovative box packaging designs to optimize the kilowatts-peak of generation capacity shipped to sites.
Two main features were considered. The placement of modules in a portrait disposition within the box, implying new handling and safety guidelines to consider; and the use of thinner aluminum frames, even if module areas beyond 3 m2 were involved. Weight excess is also relevant in some locations, including some US states, because of regulated restrictions for road transportation, leading to potential situations in which container filling is limited, leaving empty spaces inside that must be properly managed in advance, outside the factory.
Besides the aforementioned considerations and challenges ultimately impacting site activity and performance, a core concern was fast highlighted right after larger modules showed up on the market. That is, to what extent are solar trackers and inverters prepared for these devices?
The overall management of considerably bigger and heavier modules, based on lower voltages and greater currents, did bring about an intricate recipe to cook. At first, larger modules led to problematic situations requiring major re-engineering tasks, as the 400 W-based versions used at development stages were no longer available a couple of years later when construction activity was set to commence.
Fortunately, this is no longer a major issue to address unless the context is associated with revamping or repowering activity, which requires a change from much older module designs to larger solar PV panels.
For DC/AC inverters, one can arguably say that most inverter manufacturers have become well adapted to the management of high current values. High currents do not imply significant challenges any more, beyond paying attention to the proper match between a maximum admissible current per input or maximum power point tracker in a string inverter and the maximum current of module output, including bifacial gains.
The same cannot be said about solar trackers, a problem caused by the still-suboptimal collaboration between modules which come in a range of dimensions, and tracker manufacturers. EPC contractors complete the trio as they juggle to optimize risk-cost ratios in a context of increased structure height and wind-exposed area, regardless of the use of 1P or 2P orientation configurations.
Tracker suppliers must reconsider several variables to enhance structural stiffness and reduce mechanical aeroelastic effects. Structural stiffness can be enhanced by using thicker hardware and reinforcements, at a cost. Mechanical aeroelastic effects such as torsional galloping at particular tilt angles, at even moderate wind speeds, can also be improved. Wind tunnel testing is not always available and not all laboratories are ready to test larger modules. And the occurrence of abnormally frequent windstorm events related to climate change, even in historically calm locations, makes tracker design tougher than ever.
Additionally, the module’s cantilever and deflection effects remain uncontrolled and unregulated by IEC/UL standards and manufacturer installation guidelines, regardless of the use of panel rails, clamps, or bolts in a structure.
Finally, the well-known unique current-voltage characteristics of larger modules makes possible the arrangement of longer module strings, potentially optimizing project costs. Yet, in some cases, this feature may lead to design issues when trying to match the use of complete strings – based on 35 modules, for example – with tracker unit length.
Larger modules are here to stay as standard solar devices. Though all developers, EPC contractors, and technical advisors have been learning how to overcome the challenges stemming from the use of these big panels, there is an industry sentiment that module-area growth should cease at some point, and that PV module makers should eventually reach a standard product series that can be effortlessly adapted to any BOS equipment. The upcoming era of negatively-doped, n-type cells should pave the way to high-power modules based on device efficiency, rather than size.

NREL and US-based thin-film PV manufacturer First Solar have built a cadmium telluride (CdTe) bifacial solar cell based on a rear interface buffer made of copper, gallium and monoxide (CuGaOx ). The scientists claim to have achieved a higher bifacial power density than any polycrystalline absorber currently manufactured at scale. They used cracked film lithography (CFL)-patterned metal grids to integrate the CuGaOx rear interface buffer in the solar cell.
“Common passivating layers, such as Al2O3 and other oxides, are highly resistive, need to be applied directly to the CdTe surface, and require a high-temperature CdCl2 treatment after they are deposited,” they said, noting that they used CFL to overcome this issue. “CFL is a low-cost method to pattern metal microgrids that have ideal properties for high resistance applications like CdTe.”
Researcher Chris Muzzillo said CFL is particularly suitable for CdTe cells due to its low cost. “We found that relative to photolithography, CFL has lower materials and equipment cost for patterning metal grids in III-V photovoltaics,” he told pv magazine.
Muzzillo and his team described their findings in “Cracked Film Lithography with CuGaOx Buffers for Bifacial CdTe Photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Nano-Micro Small. In all CFL processes, metal is grown directly on the semiconductor surface, resulting in high-quality interfaces with low contact resistance and improved durability.
In the proposed cell configuration, the CuGaOx/CFL grid samples’ showed superior passivation to their reduced gold (Au) coverage area, which in turn resulted in a higher open-circuit voltage for the solar cell. They also helped improve the device’s fill factor from 70.8% to 73.3%.
“We estimate that the previous CdTe bifacial record, with 1 sun front and rear efficiencies of 12.5% and 7.6%, respectively, generates 16.3 mW cm−2 at 1 sun front + 0.5 sun rear,” the research group said. “On the other hand, our best CFL grid produces 20.3 mW cm−2 at 1 sun front + 0.5 sun rear—a 25% jump in record bifacial CdTe power density, and at 1 sun front + 0.1 sun rear, our cell has 39% higher power density.”
Muzzilo said that commercialization of the cell is up for consideration.
“Compared to bifacial silicon, the rear efficiency of bifacial CdTe remains relatively low,” he concluded. “We will continue to work on boosting front and rear efficiency, with a goal of demonstrating high enough added power density to justify the added process complexity of CFL-patterned bifacial CdTe.”
