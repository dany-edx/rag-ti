The power generated from this project shall be supplied to GUVNL under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) for 25 years from the scheduled commercial operation date.
The Company has won this capacity at an INR 2.20/kWh tariff in a 500 MW tender floated by GUVNL in January 2021. The project has to be commissioned within 18 months from the date of PPA execution.
As per the tender document, the bidders selected by GUVNL shall set up solar power projects, including the transmission network up to the delivery point. The minimum project capacity shall be 25 MW.
With this award, Tata Power’s cumulative solar capacity under development in Gujarat would be 580 MW. 
The plant is expected to generate about 156 million units of electricity per year and annually offset approximately 156 million Kg of CO2.
Tata Power’s renewable capacity will increase to 4,007 MW, out of which 2,687 MW is operational and 1,320 MW (including 60 MW won under this PPA) under implementation.

The projects are located at Supa in the Mahoba district of the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh.
As per the agreement, AGEL has acquired 100% of the share capital and all the securities of Spinel Energy & Infrastructure Limited—a special purpose vehicle floated by Hindustan Power Projects’ arms Hindustan Cleanenergy Limited and Peridot Power Ventures Limited to set up the 20 MW solar power unit. 
The projects were commissioned in October 2017 and benefit from a long-term power purchase agreement with Uttar Pradesh state discom at INR 7.54/kWh.
Spinel Energy’s revenue for the year 2019-20 stood at INR 1,619 lakh.
The latest addition by Adani Green Energy follows its acquisition of 75 MW operating solar projects from Sterling & Wilson.
The projects, located in Telangana, were owned by Sterling & Wilson’s two special purpose vehicles, Surajkiran Solar Technologies and Dinkar Technologies.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/30/ihs-markit-forecasts-181-gw-of-new-pv-capacity-for-this-year/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 30, 2021",IHS Markit forecasts 181 GW of new PV capacity for this year,"From pv magazine International
U.K.-based market observer IHS Markit has significantly raised its forecast PV installation figures for this year, from 158 GW to 181 GW.
In the white paper IHS Markit Top 10 Cleantech Trends in 2021, the analyst said this growth would represent a 27% year-on-year increase compared to 2020 and would materialize in a scenario that the analysts described as characterized by strong demand despite increased module prices, long lead times, and rising freight costs.
“Leading module manufacturers are sold out for the first half of the year,” said Josefin Berg, research manager for clean energy technology at IHS Markit. “There is no indication of price weakness for July shipments yet, manufacturing capacity remains sufficient and no major material bottlenecks have arisen to change our forecast for 181 GW in global solar PV installations.”
Increasing prices for polysilicon, copper and steel will contribute to maintaining PV module prices at current levels, although prices of solar glass may begin declining from the second quarter of the year. Demand, on the other hand, is expected to grow from May, both in China and the international markets.
“The solar supply chain is entering a new phase with a bigger focus on profitability, technology leadership, and consolidation,” IHS Markit stated. “Increasing consolidation on the manufacturing side–approximately 72% of modules were produced by the top 10 companies in 2020, according to IHS Markit research–in addition to high production costs and investors’ pressure to increase profitability, will be major factors in maintaining stable module prices this year.”
Profitability in the PV supply chain remains critical for all major manufacturers, as they require liquidity and capital for new investments in research and development and plans to roll-out the mass production of innovative PV technologies from 2023. “Investments will also be needed to adapt [the] module supply chain to [the] lower-carbon and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards demanded by the market,” said Edurne Zoco, executive director for clean energy technology at IHS Markit.
China is expected to be, once again, the world’s largest PV market in 2021, with around 60 GW of newly installed solar power.
