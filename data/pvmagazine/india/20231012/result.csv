https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/12/bangladesh-introduces-rooftop-pv-requirement-for-big-new-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,BANGLADESH",PV MAGAZINE,"OCTOBER 12, 2023","Bangladesh introduces rooftop PV requirement for big, new buildings","Bangladesh is poised to witness a substantial increase in rooftop PV generation as the government mandates the installation of net-metered solar systems in newly constructed residential, educational, medical, industrial, and commercial buildings as a prerequisite for new grid connections.
For buildings with rooftop spaces exceeding 92.2 square meters, net-metered solar power systems is obligatory. Owners seeking single-phase grid connections must install a net-metered solar system with a minimum capacity of 1 kW, while those requiring three-phase connections must meet a 3 kW capacity requirement. The same rules apply to schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations with at least 1,000 square feet of rooftop space.
Additionally, the new regulation stipulates that industrial and commercial customers in need of grid connections up to 80 kW must install a rooftop PV system equivalent to 15% of their total load. Customers requiring connections between 80 kW and 500 kW must install a PV system representing up to 12% of their load capacity, while those with loads exceeding 500 kW must install a rooftop array representing up to 10% of their load capacity.
Furthermore, existing buildings wishing to enhance their grid connection load capacity must adhere to the same rules by installing additional rooftop solar systems. Dipal C. Barua, former president and current adviser of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, told pv magazine that there is strong support for this new measure.
“Hundreds of megawatts of electricity now will be added from rooftop solar every year,” he said. “The implementation of the rules of mandatory net-metered pv system will be easier in case of new buildings since they will be obliged to follow the rules as they need grid connection.”
Barua stated that every year, approximately 40,000 new residential buildings are built in Bangladesh, and if, on average, each of them installs a 2 kW system, this would contribute about 80 MW of power. He also noted that industrial and commercial buildings, which require a substantial electricity load, would install larger rooftop solar systems, further increasing electricity generation.
Bangladesh has the capacity to produce a total of 1194.63 MW of clean electricity. Of this capacity, 84.837 MW is generated from net-metered rooftop solar systems, while 70.301 MW is derived from non-net-metered rooftop PV systems.

If both domestic consumption and exports are factored, it has a $300-400 billion cumulative market opportunity to harness within this decade, according to a new report by KPMG.

India envisages to be climate neutral by 2070. The nation aims to become energy-independent by 2047. (An energy independent nation is one which need not import energy resources to meet its energy demand.) The government’s plan involves green hydrogen as an alternate fuel to fossil-based product.
The KPMG report estimates India will need to invest $350-400 billion per year until 2047 to achieve its energy transition commitments. This investment will be required in clean energy technologies, necessary infrastructure and energy efficiency measures.
Achieving the 2047 target translates into an 85% share of non-fossil fuel in power capacity mix with ten times increase in the installed RE capacity from 160 GW in 2022 to 1,600 GW by 2047. EVs should make up 100% of new passenger vehicle sales by 2047, among other energy transitions. Also, the nation must reach green hydrogen production capacity of 25 mmt in 2047, requiring 180 GW of electrolyzer capacity.
Globally, energy transition might involve an annual investment of $4.5 trillion a year until 2050, according to the report.
The report adds successful energy transition within India and globally will require supply chains to be reimagined.
Currently, China owns 79% of solar, 64% wind, 76% battery and 41% of electrolyzer manufacturing globally. As a result, there is a global attempt to diversify and secure renewable energy supply chains by adopting approaches such as the ‘China + 1’ strategy.
High captive demand, increased supplier base, government support, regulatory enablers and unique domestic capabilities make India a strong contender in this space, according to the report.
The report adds energy transition could create 5-6 million jobs by 2030 and 9-10 million by 2047 in India. Almost 30% of the 8-9 million jobs will be in manufacturing and the rest in construction and installation, operations and maintenance, and fuel supply.
India needs to develop a strong skilling strategy for areas such as R&D, where there are significant skill gaps. New technologies such as batteries, green hydrogen, and carbon capture utilisation and storage demand deep skills and would need a more aggressive approach to talent development. Cost competitiveness in electrolyzers would need capabilities to be enhanced in R&D, design, engineering, etc.
The cost of green hydrogen is almost twice that of grey hydrogen– cost differential will need to be brought down significantly through innovation in RE as well as the entire green hydrogen value chain.
The report highlights Indian manufacturers need to rapidly evolve a strategy to enhance their capabilities. They must strengthen their manufacturing and sourcing strategy and focus on value engineering, manufacturing efficiency through visual and digital enablers, and effective capacity expansion management. In sourcing they need to widen their base to include significant non-Chinese players and eventually develop a more domestic ecosystem of research and innovation.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/12/japanese-scientists-design-flexible-crystalline-silicon-solar-modules-with-pet-front-cover/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 12, 2023",Japanese scientists design flexible crystalline silicon solar modules with PET front cover,"Researchers at Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) have fabricated lightweight, curved crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar modules with a front cover made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) instead of conventional glass material.
“Our research demonstrates that crystalline silicon solar cell modules with a PET film cover are highly reliable under high-temperature and high-humidity conditions,” the research’s corresponding author, Tomihisa Tachibana, told pv magazine. “While we haven’t yet calculated the system cost, we anticipate that the weight reduction will likely lower transportation and installation expenses.”
In the paper “Development of lightweight and flexible crystalline silicon solar cell modules with PET film cover for high reliability in high temperature and humidity conditions,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the Japanese group explained that PET films represent a viable alternative to glass covers, due to their excellent electrical insulation and optical transmittance.
The scientists built the modules with 156 mm2 × 156 mm2 c-Si polycrystalline aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) structured solar cells with a thickness of approximately 250 μm. “The strings at the busbar were connected by machine soldering, and the strings of the four-cell modules were connected in series by hand soldering,” they noted.
They used a 0.025 mm-thick PET film for both the module’s front cover and the backsheet and encapsulated the panels with ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA). “The module structure was PET/EVA/c-Si cell/EVA/PET or Backsheet,” they added.
The team compared the thermal behavior of the new module with that of a reference panel using a 3.2 mm-thick glass as the front-cover material and found the former exhibited greater flexibility than that fabricated using glass.
It also ascertained, however, that the module based on PET has a 10% lower current value, as the PET film, unlike the glass, has an anti-reflectance structure. The voltage and fill factor values were found to be approximately the same as those of the benchmark glass module. “The absence of a glass cover also imparts the fabricated modules with flexibility, and no cracks or other defects were observed after the modules were placed on and then removed from a measurement stage with a 200 mm radius of curvature,” it further explained.
The scientists emphasized the modules with a PET film cover also have the advantage of reduced weight, approximately “one-fourth per cell size”, which they said makes them ideal for installation in locations with loading restrictions.
They also tested the modules in a series of damp heat (DH) tests at 85 C and under 85% relative humidity and found that the glass-based panel showed degradation in the fill factor and current values after 3000 h because of corrosion of the silver (Ag) front electrodes. “By contrast, the lightweight modules (PET/Backsheet or PET/PET) showed only slightly diminished I–V properties, with about 10% degradation from the initial value after 6000 h of DH testing,” they stated.
The research group believes the PET-packaged modules with their impact-absorbing capacity may accelerate solar deployment in areas such as weight-limited factory roofs and agricultural applications.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/12/world-solar-pv-lcoe-expected-to-slide-to-0-021-kwh-by-2050-says-dnv/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 12, 2023","World: Solar PV LCOE expected to slide to $0.021/kWh by 2050, says DNV","From pv magazine Global
By 2050 the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar PV will be $0.021/kWh, the international registrar and risk management company DNV, based in Norway, predicts in a new report published today. The Energy Transition Outlook 2023 – a 211-page document charting global and regional renewable energy trends until mid-century – prophesizes some solar PV’s LCOE will be already close to $0.020/kWh by 2025.
A reduction in unit investment costs, now valued at $870/kW, led to the decline, the report states. “As solar PV installations continue to double, these numbers are bound to drop, landing below $700/kW shortly after 2030 and shrinking further to $560/kW by 2050.”
The learning rate for solar is predicted to decrease from 26% to 17% by 2050, with the figure settling as cost components “adjust to decreasing expenses.” By the middle of the century, solar PV will retain its position as the world’s cheapest energy source, with a combined capacity of 15.3 TW – a 13-fold growth from 2022. But as solar grows so will storage, with the report stating, “We predict most of the global solar capacity additions to integrate storage”.

The Energy Transition Outlook 2023 expects solar to reach 54% of installed generation capacity by 2050, but only represent 39% of the world’s grid electricity generation. “The efficiency or the capacity factory of solar power stations trail behind other renewable energy sources like wind and hydropower,” the document states, “nevertheless, the underlying cause of solar’s rapid proliferation lies in its dwindling costs.”
DNV expects China and the United States to continue leading global solar PV installations for the next two-and-a-half decades, however, both countries will experience “a slight dip” by 2050 as they reach installation saturation. India, the Middle East and North Africa will creep up in the solar hierarchy, nearly tripling their shares, from 6% and 3% in 2022 to 14% and 12% by mid-century, respectively.
Non-fossil fuel energy – solar PV, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and nuclear – is expected to make up 52% of the primary energy mix by 2050, which is a different prediction from DNV’s 2022 forecast, the new outlook report states.
*The article has been updated on October 11 to specify that the world’s cumulative PV capacity will reach 15.3 TW by 2050, and not 8.8 TW, as we previously reported.
