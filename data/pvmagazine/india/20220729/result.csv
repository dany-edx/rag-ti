It provided the modules for a ground-mounted project with Mahanadi Coal Fields Ltd commissioned in July 2022.
Founded in 2011, Goldi Solar manufactures panels, provides EPC services, and is also an independent power producer. It has two PV module production facilities with a cumulative capacity of 2.5 GW at Pipodara and Navsari in Surat, Gujarat. The company s looking to expand to 6 GW soon.
Bharat Bhut, co-founder and director, Goldi Solar, said, “Odisha is a growing and important market for us. This is only the first of many projects that we will supply in this region. We have a robust order pipeline.”

The three companies emerged winners in the 50 GWh PLI tender, which attracted ten bids for an overall manufacturing capacity of 128 GWh. 
Under the ACC PLI program, the winners must set up a manufacturing facility within two years from the appointed date. The incentive will be disbursed after that over a period of five years on the sale of batteries manufactured in India. 
“This embarks a new chapter in India’s manufacturing industry as we set the vision for battery manufacturing and compete globally with other nations in this sunrise sector. This will be favorable to EV ecosystem and energy storage market as it will support the demand for EVs and renewable and attract investment in this sector,” said union cabinet minister for heavy industries Mahendra Nath Pandey.
In addition to the capacities allocated by the Ministry of Heavy Industries under the PLI Program, private players are expected to create battery manufacturing capacity to the tune of 95 GWh. 
The PLI Scheme is designed in such a manner that it is technology agnostic. The beneficiary firm shall be free to choose suitable advanced technology and the corresponding plant and machinery, raw material, and other intermediate goods for setting up the cell manufacturing facility to cater to any application.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/29/india-has-installed-more-than-57-7-gw-of-solar/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 29, 2022",India has installed more than 57.7 GW of solar,"India has installed a cumulative 57.7 GW of solar power generation capacity as of June 30, 2022. It has a further 48.7 GW of PV projects under installation and 16.7 GW under bidding. This information was given by power minister RK Singh in the lower parliament recently. 
Most of these solar power projects are installed by private sector developers. Considering the normative cost of INR 4.5 crore ($ 568,063) per MW, an expenditure of approximately INR 2.60 lakh crore (US$ 32,821 million) has been incurred on installing the cumulative solar capacity of 57.7 GW.
Rajasthan tops in solar installations, accounting for 25% (14.4 GW) of the cumulative PV capacity installed in the nation. It is followed by Gujarat (7.8 GW) and Karnataka (7.6 GW)
The Ministry of New and Renewable energy released INR 2,633.92 crore ($332 million) of funds under its various solar schemes during FY 2021-22, compared to INR 1,854.28 crore ($234 million) in 2020-21 and INR 1,591.15 crore ($201 million) in 2019-20.
The nation has been assessed by state body the National Institute of Solar Energy as having around 750 GWp of solar capacity potential, based on land availability and solar irradiation.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/29/cooling-down-solar-modules-with-cotton-wicks-immersed-in-water/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 29, 2022",Cooling down solar modules with cotton wicks immersed in water,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the University of Miskolc in Hungary have developed a passive cooling technique for photovoltaic modules which they claim is able to lower the panels’ operating temperature by up to 22%.
The novel technique consists of attaching cotton wicks immersed in the water (CWIWs) to the backside of the photovoltaic module. The water is supplied to cotton wicks from top to bottom by gravity which the scientists said helps the effective absorption of cotton and reduces water consumption. “Exposure of the wetted cotton wicks to the surrounding air decreases dry air temperature and increases humidity, producing evaporating cooling that can exploit it to absorb the rising heat from the backside of the PV module,” they explained. “The technique contributes by creating a continuous cooling environment with less water consumption and better performance under hot conditions than in other studies.”
The CWs were arranged as serpentine forms avoiding any space between them. The scientists fixed them by using thermal silicon. They also placed two plastic bottles full of water at the top edge of the PV module. “The gravity-free flow of water helps transmit the water to the CWs without extra power,” they emphasized. “Thus, this method helps to distribute the water entirely from cotton wicks throughout the PV module.”
The performance of a polycrystalline solar module with a size of 0.65 m × 0.55 m and equipped with CWIWs was compared with that of a reference panel without the cooling system. They used a data logger with two voltage sensors and two current sensors. It recorded temperature, voltage, and current values every ten minutes during the experiment days. “The experiments were conducted according to climatic conditions of Basra City, Iraq, from 20 to 29 of August 2021,” the specified. “August is characterized by a sunny month with high temperatures and low humidity on most days with moderate winds.”
Through their measurements, the academics found that the PV module with CWIWs cooling showed thermal behavior closer to the ambient temperature throughout the experiment period due to evaporating cooling of CWs. “The highest temperature recorded of the PV module with the CWIWs was 46.2 C at 12:20 PM, while the ambient temperature was 43.8 C,” they stated.
Compared to the module without cooling, the CWs-equipped module had an operating temperature that was 22% lower. “The moist condition resulting from the cotton bristles immersed in water and exposed to the wind has provided appropriate cooling that enhances efficiency to 7.25% and the power yield increment about 16.3 W,” they further explained. “Using CWIWs decreases entropy generation by about 14% due to reducing the lost exergy of the PV module than the PV module without cooling.”
The Hungarian group presented the passive technique in the paper Effect of Evaporative Cooling on Photovoltaic Module Performance, which was recently published in Process Integration and Optimization for Sustainability. “The passive cooling applied in this work enhanced the performance of the PV module higher than in other similar studies, making it more reliable for application,” it concluded.
