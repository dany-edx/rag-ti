Although solar technology has advanced significantly, more work is needed before it can compete effectively with fossil fuels. Employing novel materials might hold the key.
Today, and thus far, silicon makes up the largest number of solar panel semiconductors. However, silicon has a low efficiency, which generally doesn’t exceed 25% for the most popular panels. Cost is also a problem. It is also no secret that the extreme heat needed to remove impurities from silicon makes the process of creating solar panels cumbersome, which is why researchers and businesses have been seeking alternatives.
Perovskite solar cells are a promising technology that offers easy production and highly effective photovoltaics.
This breakthrough material has the potential to produce more solar energy at costs significantly lower than those of conventional silicon PV cells. The expense of laminating a perovskite layer onto the glass of solar panels might be kept to a minimum.
Perovskite is a potential material for improving solar power efficiency because of its low cost and unique features. According to the producers, it is almost ready for commercial application. Perovskites, however, have so far necessitated a lot of testing and trial-and-error, and no application has progressed to the point of commercialization.
Today’s commercially accessible silicon solar panels typically have 18 to 22% efficiency. However, a single perovskite panel has the potential to produce efficiencies that are close to 33%. And the efficiency can be raised even higher, possibly to above 40%, by manufacturing perovskites that are sensitive to various wavelengths of solar radiation and stacking them to form a tandem cell.
Perovskites are theoretically less expensive to make in large quantities than silicon solar cells because they are intrinsically better at capturing sunlight than silicon. These can be produced at low temperatures using inexpensive and easily accessible materials with much less energy. On the other hand, silicon must be purified from quartz in furnaces at a high temperature.
The opportunity exists for manufacturers to explore a range of low-cost methods for depositing perovskites on a horizontal beam, such as a sheet of glass, to convert that surface into a translucent solar cell. This would include roll-to-roll manufacturing processes like those used in paper and digital printing and perovskite-based aerosols.
Perovskite increases solar panels’ efficiency by widening the silicon components’ energy gap. According to research, the ideal material for solar panels ought to have a band gap of 1.4 electron volts, enabling it to absorb the most photons from solar radiation. With a bandgap of approximately 1.1 eV, silicon is an excellent but not ideal element.
The bandgap of the silicon can be increased by including a fine coating of perovskite which will be able to absorb additional photons, even higher-energy ones, even though it won’t precisely reach 1.4 eV. Perovskite solar cells are more effective because more photons convert into more energy.
Manufacturing perovskite crystals is also easy, typically requiring only inexpensive salt solutions. Additionally, mass-producing perovskite solar cells may be less expensive.
These advantages of perovskite solar cells will translate into increasing accessibility, affordability, and efficiency of solar energy. Consumers and businesses that care about the environment could switch to renewable energy without making a big investment. The increased efficiency would finally allow processes with high power density to rely on renewable energy sources.
Despite all the benefits, perovskite solar power hasn’t yet gained mainstream acceptance as perovskite is still not a material that’s perfected. Perovskite’s instability is a significant issue under certain ambient conditions. Plus, solar panels require mounting brackets using durable metal components. Due to its thin crystalline structure, perovskite might not be robust enough for such uses.
Perovskite solutions frequently dissolve in water and are less heat-resistant than silicon. When exposed to direct sunshine, a solar panel’s surface can reach 71-72 degrees Celsius. At this temperature, the ions begin to migrate fast, deteriorating the molecular structure of the materials. As a result, perovskite solar cells may not maintain their efficiency for very long.
The presence of lead in the most effective perovskite cells is another possible source of worry. Manufacturers would need to exercise extreme caution to make sure that none of this poisonous metal spills into the environment or puts workers in danger. Any perovskite solar panel that contains lead is ineligible for use in single-use items.
Perovskite solar cells still need to overcome a number of obstacles before they find widespread application.
On an optimistic note, tremendous headway has been made in a recent study. Enclosing the perovskite in glass or plastic reduces its susceptibility to heat and humidity. New compounds can be added to strengthen the perovskite framework and make it more resistant to structural changes brought on by heat and moisture. If present trends persist, we may soon have perovskite panels that are reliable, effective, and long-lasting.

Swiss renewable energy producer Alpiq announced last week that a 900 MW pumped-hydro storage facility built in Finhaut, in the canton of Valais, Switzerland, has started commercial operations.
The hydropower station is owned by Alpiq itself (39%), Swiss Federal Railways (36%), Industrielle Werke Basel (15%), and Forces Motrices Valaisannes (10%). Its construction started in 2008 and it uses two different water reservoirs at the Émosson Dam, which was completed in 1974.
Located in a cave 600 m underground between the Emosson and Vieux Emosson reservoirs, the Nant de Drance power plant relies on six pump turbines, each with a power capacity of 150 MW. It uses the Emosson and Vieux Emosson reservoirs to operate. The water stored in the upper reservoir of Vieux-Emosson, which has a storage capacity of 227,000,000 m3, or 20 million kWh, falls into the underground power station via two vertical shafts that are 425 m high.
The project was built at a cost of approximately CHF 2 billion ($2.09 billion) and saw the participation of 60 enterprises. It required the excavation of 400,000 m3 of rock and the drilling of 17 km of galleries.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revealed that more than 30% of the integrated companies operating in the solar module manufacturing business worldwide are at medium or high risk of bankruptcy.
In the Special Report on Solar PV Global Supply Chains, the agency stressed that only 15% of these manufacturers are at high risk of bankruptcy and that in 2018 their share was around 28%. As for polysilicon suppliers, around 11% of them are currently at a high risk of bankruptcy, while another 49% are estimated to have a medium risk. “Owing to high polysilicon prices, the bankruptcy risk of polysilicon businesses dropped considerably in 2021,” the report reads. “A return to low polysilicon prices could, however, reverse this change.”
According to the IEA experts, the support that the Chinese government is awarding to polysilicon manufacturers in the form of financing and subsidies makes this market segment particularly vulnerable from a financial point of view. “For instance, the largest polysilicon company posted net losses between 2018 and 2020 despite government support,” they state without naming the producer. “From a security-of-supply perspective, consistently poor financial performance within and across the solar PV value chain reinforces supply chain vulnerability to bankruptcies and underinvestment, which can reduce its resiliency, raise prices and limit PV deployment.”
The agency warned about possible changes in subsidy regulations for the PV industry in China, claiming these may lead to higher bankruptcy risks, even for the most competitive manufacturers. “Should competitive companies go bankrupt, this could lead to broader price increases and supply impacts, in addition to loss of the subsidy,” the report says.
The paper also describes thoroughly the main vulnerabilities of the global PV supply chain while highlighting the need for a wide geographical diversification of the industry. “China has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for solar PV, with multiple benefits for clean energy transitions,” the IEA analysts emphasize. “At the same time, the level of geographical concentration in global supply chains also creates potential challenges that governments need to address.”
According to their estimates, the world will almost completely rely on China for solar panel production through 2025. “Based on manufacturing capacity under construction, China’s share of global polysilicon, ingot and wafer production will soon reach almost 95%,” they note. China’s Xinjiang Province currently accounts for 40% of global polysilicon manufacturing, the report points out. “This level of concentration in any global supply chain would represent a considerable vulnerability; solar PV is no exception.”
