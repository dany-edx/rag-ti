With a proposed investment of INR 425 crore ($51.4), the new facility will consolidate six out of the ten existing factories of the company in Bengaluru, under one roof. It will have a 1 million sq. feet of industrial setup against the current 500,000 sq. ft.
The new factory will manufacture products ranging from single-phase UPS, three-phase UPS, power distribution units, and low-voltage drives to digital energy products related to meters, pre-fabricated data centers, relays, and renewable energy products.
The new factory will create 1000+ job opportunities, taking the current headcount to 3,000 +. It will have an 80% export volume capacity to serve customers in 30 countries across the world.
“India is the 3rd largest market for Schneider Electric and a huge base for export operations…Deemed as the Factory of the Future, our new manufacturing campus will be one of our largest smart factories, globally, to be based in India,” said Anil Chaudhry, zone president, India and CEO and MD Schneider Electric India.
Javed Ahmad, senior vice president, Global Supply Chain, International Region, Schneider Electric, added, “With a projected sale of over INR. 5200 crores by 2026, this manufacturing base expansion in Karnataka will also amplify our investments in Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies to ensure operational, efficiency, and sustainability.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/22/arctech-signs-2-8-gw-solar-tracker-deal-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,SOLAR TRACKERS,CHINA,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 22, 2022",Arctech signs 2.8 GW solar tracker deal in India,"China’s Arctech has signed a deal to supply 2.8 GW of its SkyLine II single-axis solar trackers for a PV project with a total capacity of 15 GW in the Khavda district of Gujarat. The project is scheduled for commissioning in the third quarter of 2023 and is expected to become the largest operational solar site in the country.
Since entering the Indian market in 2015, Arctech has supplied 7 GW of solar tracking and racking solutions to the Indian region. Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables ranked Arctech as the leading solar tracker supplier in India in 2020. And in 2021, Arctech accounted for a 45% market share.
Arctech said its SkyLine II product has a peculiar edge in the Indian market.
“It is a 1P (one-in-portrait) tracker designed with a pentagonal torque tube and synchronous multi-point drive mechanism. This enables a new possibility of designing the plant using trackers with identical pile configurations, overcoming the uncertainty faced in the early stage of plant design and construction,” as per the company.

The modules are built with 144 half-cut M10 cells and ten busbars. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 49.15 V to 49.45 V, and the short-circuit current is 13.35 A to 13.90 A.
The modules undergo triple EL checking to ensure zero defect, according to SunBond, which has a 7-stage inline testing facility.
Each module measures 2,300 x 1,140 x 40 mm and weighs 28.5 kg. It features IP67/68 junction box, an anodized aluminum frame with a twin wall profile, tri-layer backsheet, low-shrinkage PID-resistant ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulation, and high transmittance anti-reflective glass. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V DC. Pmax temperature coefficient is -0.39% per degree Celsius.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/22/adani-solar-becomes-indias-sole-producer-of-large-sized-monocrystalline-silicon-ingots/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 22, 2022",Adani Solar becomes India’s sole producer of large-sized monocrystalline silicon ingots,"Adani Solar, the photovoltaic manufacturing and research arm of the Adani Group, has become India’s sole producer of large-sized monocrystalline silicon ingots for M10 and G12 wafers.
The ingots were unveiled by Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group, at their Mundra facility recently. “These monocrystalline ingots will drive indigenization to produce renewable electricity from silicon-based PV modules with efficiencies ranging from 21% to 24%,” stated the company.
Adani Solar is a part of Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), which strives to develop the world’s largest green hydrogen ecosystem. It completed the backward integration of ingot line infrastructure in a record time of about 7 months.
The new manufacturing line will produce silicon ingots exclusively for Adani solar wafers, cells, and modules production.
While the company’s initial production has already begun, it intends to add 2 GW of ingot and wafer capacity by the end of 2023. By 2025, it will scale up to 10 GW.
“We have made remarkable technological progress in every aspect of solar manufacturing in the past, from cells to modules, and we intend to replicate our past successes in our future endeavors as we backward integrate all the way to producing metallurgical grade silicon from quartz,” said Dr Puneet Gupta, CTO, Adani Solar, “Our Chairman’s vision is ambitious, and we are fully committed to achieving accelerated growth in this business by establishing a fully integrated and comprehensive ecosystem of 10 GW solar PV manufacturing–an ecosystem that not only is vertically integrated but also hosts all ancillary units in the same geography.”
Adani Solar established India’s first GW-scale silicon-based cell and module factory that started production in 2016. It ramped up its annual production capacity of solar PV cells and modules from 1.2 GW in 2017 to 4 GW in 2022, to become the nation’s largest vertically integrated PV manufacturer.
