The capacity of this project is 4 MW and will be installed on 13 stations and depot.
With this, Amp Energy’s total project capacity for L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) has reached 11.8 MWp.
Amp Energy India commissioned the first-phase PV capacity of 7.805 MW in December 2020. This plant—one of India’s largest behind-the-meter solar projects—supplies solar power to L&T metro rail’s 24 stations and two depots in Hyderabad, Telangana.

It seeks to engage a business consultant to realize potential opportunities in electrolyzer manufacturing and the green hydrogen value chain.
“BHEL has identified the hydrogen economy value chain as a potential business play and has started efforts to realize the same. This is in line with the company’s aspirations of identification and diversification into emerging technology areas for growth and sustainability and simultaneously increasing the share of the non-coal business,” stated BHEL.
BHEL intends to appoint a consulting firm with a proven track record and requisite competence for the scope of work encompassing strategy and roadmap creation (including a recommendation on probable partners), business build support in electrolyzer manufacturing, and green hydrogen value chain (optional on BHEL).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/27/strong-policy-focus-needed-to-drive-pumped-storage-development/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 27, 2023",Strong policy focus needed to drive pumped storage development,"ICRA’s new report says India needs a strong policy focus on pumped storage hydro with a series of measures notified for demand and supply push. 
The analysts expect the share of renewable power in electricity generation to increase from 11.5% in FY2022 to 28% by FY2030. In this scenario, they say pumped storage hydro remains systemically important from the grid stability perspective, given its benefits over battery energy storage systems (BESS).
Pumped storage hydro projects have a long economic life of 40 years, are based on very mature and indigenous technology, and are efficient. These are also cost-competitive. The levelized cost (considering capital cost of $250/kWh) using BESS is estimated at INR 11.1 ($0.14)/kWh, which is twice the base-case cost estimate (conversion) of INR 4.98/kWh for pumped storage hydro projects.
ICRA analysts estimate a huge potential of 96.5 GW for pumped storage hydro. However, the operational capacity of pumped storage hydro remains very low at 3.3 GW because of high development costs and inherent challenges in the construction of pumped storage schemes. The untapped potential is 62.4 GW, considering the capacity not yet working in pumping mode/under survey and investigation at 27.8 GW. 
The analysts say the development of pumped storage hydro projects is hindered by factors such as the delay in receipt of environmental clearances/ forest clearances, resettlement and rehabilitation issues in case of large dams and reservoirs for on-river schemes, elongated construction schedules resulting from geological surprises/ difficult terrain, high construction cost resulting in increased conversion/ landed tariff, and Availability of water for initial filling of off-river schemes.
The Ministry of Power (MoP) in April 2023 finalized guidelines which are positive for the pumped storage projects. The guidelines comprise various measures such as monetizing ancillary services, exemption from free power obligation/local area development fund, state GST reimbursement, and rationalization of environment clearance. 
Grishkumar Kadam, senior vice president & co-group head – Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd, says, “The levelized tariff for pumped storage hydro projects in the base case, assuming a capital cost of INR 6.5 crore/MW, is estimated at INR 5/kWh, and the landed tariff, including the cost of energy required for pumping, is estimated at INR 9/kWh. While the tariff competitiveness of the storage component for pumped storage hydro projects is modest, PSPs benefit from a long economic life of 40 years with a very mature and indigenous technology available. Pumped storage hydro projects are also estimated to remain cost competitive against the storage cost associated with battery energy storage. Nonetheless, the timely implementation of market reform measures as highlighted in the guidelines remains important to improve the financial viability of pumped storage hydro projects.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/27/pv-powered-robotic-lawn-mower-from-new-zealand/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 27, 2023",PV-powered robotic lawn mower from New Zealand,"From pv magazine Global
A Massey AgriFood Digital Lab team based at Massey University in New Zealand has developed a PV-powered robotic lawn mower.
The Sun Scout Pro features three fully integrated 50 W solar panels that charge a 20 Ah lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4) battery. One of the PV panels is located on top of the robot, while two additional modules are fixed onto a sliding, retractable structure.
“By stripping down the solar module to its essentials and adopting more efficient protective designs in conjunction with our flagship stacked panel configuration, we were able to create lightweight solar panel solutions that are perfect for mobile applications,” the research team says on the product’s website.
The PV system has a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) voltage range between 15 V and 45 V. The MPPT solar charger has an efficiency of over 99% and the maximum solar power input is 400 W. The LiFePO4 battery has a rated voltage of 38,4 V and an energy capacity of 768 Wh. The team claims it features 5,000 charge cycles.
“Assuming that the Sunscout Pro charges its batteries an average of four times per week, which is equivalent to 208 times annually, the guaranteed 5,000 charging cycles would provide up to 24 years of usage,” says the research team.
When the robotic lawn mower’s batteries are low, it slides out its two extra PV panels and tracks the sun for faster recharging. The average battery charging time is four hours at 70% discharge. The device measures 850 mm x 450 mm x 400 mm and weighs 45 kg. Its cutting width is 40 cm and the cutting height is programmable between 25 mm to 75 mm. It mulches grass at a speed of 50 meters per minute, covering an area of 1,200 square meters per charge.
The concept was first developed in 2020 and its feasibility was reportedly confirmed by a Massey University study in 2021. The project underwent prototype testing in December 2022 and a working prototype was completed in January 2023. The Massey University team started setting up assembly lines in New Zealand and Germany in February this year and is now trying to gather customer support through a Kickstarter campaign. If successful, it plans to launch the product in June and start shipments by August.
The products will feature a two-year warranty and cost $,2630 according to the Kickstarter campaign page.
