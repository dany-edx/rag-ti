Solar and wind power will dominate the global energy market at the end of the decade as they become cheaper to install than the operational costs of fossil fuel facilities, according to a report published today by U.S.-based management consultancy McKinsey & Company.
The 2021 Global Energy Perspective study predicts solar and wind power plants will make up almost half the world’s power generation capacity by 2035 and cites the cost competitiveness of renewables-powered green hydrogen by 2030 as another game changer for the energy transition.
With global coal-fired power demand having already peaked, according to the report, the high point for oil will be hit in 2029 and for gas, in 2037, McKinsey has predicted. That would add up to the world’s thirst for all fossil fuels combined peaking in 2027.

The plant, at the 200 MW Kasargod Solar Park, went online on December 31, 2020.
The 50 MW project work was awarded to Tata Power Solar in August 2019, with its work scope including design, engineering, procurement & supply, construction & erection, testing, commissioning and comprehensive operation & maintenance (O&M) for ten years. The scheduled time period of completion was nine months.
With the Kasargod project, the commissioned as well as commercial capacity of THDC India Limited and NTPC group has become 1,587 MW and 62,975 MW, respectively, NTPC said in a BSE filing.
NTPC plans to become a 130 GW company by the year 2032. In line with the global trend towards renewables, which is a cleaner source of energy, it plans to achieve 32 GW of this capacity through renewables or 25% of its overall power portfolio at the beginning of the next decade.
As of October 2020 end, NTPC had 2,404 MW of RE projects under implementation, including 237 MW floating solar projects located in reservoirs at its existing stations. In fact, Ramagundam 100 MW Floating Solar, being set up under non-PPA mode, is the largest in the country.
