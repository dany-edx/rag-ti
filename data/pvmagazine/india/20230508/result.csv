The construction of the factory is set to commence by the end of this month.
Vikramadithya Gourineni, executive director at Amara Raja Batteries, told pv magazine, “The factory will produce both LFP and NMC chemistry cells. However, the mix of technology will be a little dynamic depending on the market and what technology we have available at that point of time.”
The facility will achieve 16 GWh cell capacity over the next 10 years. Production will start in phases, with the initial 2 GWh set to become operational in 24 months.
Gourineni said, “Phase 1 will be a commercial pilot plant with mutli-cell muti-form factor capability which should be ready in about 18 months, followed by 2 GWh of manufacturing about six months after that. After that, subsequent additions of  about 4 GWh until we achieve full planned capacity.”
Amara Raja will use its own battery technology that it has been developing for the last few years. “We also have a couple of investors and partners we keep working with. One is Log9 Materials. We are also working with a couple of players from Europe. Log9 is developing a technology that we also find interesting for commercial production,” said Gourineni.
Amara Raja Batteries’ li-ion facility will initially target the electric mobility segment and also focus on stationary storage in the future.
The facility is estimated to create direct employment for about 4,500 people and a similar number of indirect jobs. It would also include a first-of-its-kind advanced energy research and innovation center, dubbed the Amara Raja E +Ve Energy Labs. This facility will be equipped with advanced laboratories and testing infrastructure for material research, prototyping, product life-cycle analysis, and Proof of Concept demonstration. This will cater to the development needs of the Amara Raja as well as provide a range of facilities open to other players in the energy and mobility ecosystem.

Its net profit (profit after tax) also grew 77% y-o-y at INR 3,810 crore.
The company attributed the increase in revenue to the robust addition in the renewables portfolio, higher availability in Mundra Thermal Plant, and higher sales across distribution companies.
Consolidated revenue in Q4 FY2022-23 was up by 6% at INR 12,755 crore, compared to INR 12,085 crore in Q4 FY2021-22. Q4 PAT grew by 48% y-o-y at INR 939 crore supported by strong performance across all businesses.
Praveer Sinha, CEO and MD of Tata Power, said, “Tata Power has delivered a strong performance in FY23 with robust growth across all our business clusters, including generation, transmission, distribution, and renewables. The growing need for power has enabled us to keep our momentum strong..Our distribution business has performed exceptionally well, which is evident from the continuous reduction in AT&C losses in Odisha Discoms and the high performance ratings of our Mumbai, Delhi, and Odisha Discoms.”
“Our renewable energy business has expanded significantly across EPC, utility-scale and rooftop verticals and is well poised to lead India’s green energy transition. The completion of INR 4,000 crore ($525 million) worth capital infusion into our renewables business, one of the biggest value unlocks in renewable business globally, will enable us to fuel the next leg of growth. We have also made rapid strides in our EV charging business and have emerged as the largest network in the country with a presence across 350+ cities and towns.”

The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), OPIS’s price assessment for free-on-board (FOB) China M10 mono module, was unchanged from the previous week to remain at a 13-week low of $0.224/W on May 2 (see chart), OPIS data show.
The market traded sideways for the week with several Asian countries, including China, on a brief hiatus for the May 1 Labor Day holiday.

Lower-than-expected overseas demand helped to keep CMM at multi-week low but price movements were again mixed across the rest of the photovoltaic chain with the Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon produced outside of China, falling 3.01% week on week to $35.831/kg.
Despite the falling raw material costs, expectations of firm domestic demand in China might have helped to offset the subdued overseas demand for modules, allowing sellers to resist lowering their offers for FOB China modules.
The price spread between FOB China module and FOB China M10 cell however remained at a narrow $0.084/W on May 2, an over 30% drop from a high of $0.123/W on January 12 (see chart). The spread has stayed under $0.10/W since January 31, suggesting sliding margins for non-integrated module producers. The price premium n-type modules command over p-type will add to margins but availability for the former is largely limited to the Tier-1 manufacturers for now.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.

Japanese chemical company and solar module manufacturer Kaneka announced that Japan-based car and battery manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation has selected its 180cm², 26.63%-efficient crystalline silicon solar cells featuring heterojunction and back-contact technology for deployment in one of its electric vehicles.
Kaneka said the cells will be utilized, in particular, in the roof glass of Toyota’s Prius PHEV car. “Our solar cells were selected by Toyota for use in an automobile following their use on Toyota bZ4X due to recognition of its curved surface design enabling itself to be mounted on a car body in addition to the high conversion efficiency and excellent exterior design of our proprietary technology,” Kaneka said in a statement, noting that the back-contact design with no wiring on the surface has an appearance similar to vehicle roof glass.
Kaneka’s solar cell has been for years recognized as the most efficient crystalline silicon PV device developed at both the industry and research levels. In November, however, Chinese manufacturer Longi announced it crossed this threshold by achieving a power conversion efficiency of 26.81% for an unspecified heterojunction (HJT) solar cell, based on a full-size silicon wafer, in mass production.
The Japanese manufacturer started supplying bifacial heterojunction solar modules based on its cell technology in 2019.
In its latest financial report published in February, the company said it was ready to start the operation of an additional production line for heterojunction PV panels during this fiscal year to respond to the strong demand. “We plan to begin full–scale delivery of in–vehicle PV this spring,” it also stated.
