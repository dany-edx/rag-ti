In Maharashtra, it has added 16 MWp of solar capacity to a 30 MWp solar project that has been operational at Tuljapur since January. The plant supplies renewable energy for its manufacturing units in Maharashtra.
It commissioned the Maharashtra project in partnership with Amp Energy India. It is one of the largest solar open-access projects in the state to be set up by a corporate entity. It supplies green energy to Cipla’s manufacturing units at Kurkumbh and Patalganga and the R&D center at Vikhroli in Maharashtra.
In Karnataka, CleanMax Enviro Energy Solutions has commissioned a hybrid captive power plant for Cipla featuring 9 MWp of solar and 2.7 MW of wind. This project will help Cipla to replace 85% of the power requirements for its Karnataka manufacturing units with renewables.
Cipla aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. It wants to continue to expand the share of renewable energy across its corporate sites to achieve this aim. Over the last three years, it has added 66 MWp of equivalent solar power capacity via initiatives such as on-site solar rooftop and ground-mounted solar projects. In fiscal 2021-22, iots sourced 68.2 GWh of renewables for its operations across India, leading to 56,000 tons of CO2 reductions.

Rooftop solar installations rose 34% year on year in the January-March period. They accounted for 15% of 3 GW of quarterly solar installations.
The commercial and industrial segment once again accounted for most of the rooftop solar installations in the first quarter. The industrial segment contributed 47% of total quarterly additions.
About 71% of rooftop solar installations were under the capex model. The operating expenditure/renewable energy service company model contributed 29%, said Mercom.
“States have been empaneling vendors and commissioning the allocated capacities under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s Phase II Rooftop Solar Program, driving capex installations,” said the report.
Gujarat leads other states in cumulative solar rooftop installations, with about 1.8 GW installed byon March 31. Maharashtra and Rajasthan rank second and third, said Mercom.
Overall project margins have fallen with the rise in component prices, the imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on module and cell imports, and the hike in the goods and service tax. In the first quarter of 2022, the average cost of a rooftop solar system increased by 6% on a quarterly basis from the final three months of 2021. Year over year, rooftop solar system costs increased by 17%.
“It was another great quarter for the rooftop solar market as post-covid installations continued to surge. Rooftop installations have topped 400 MW for four quarters in a row, which is a first,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “However, future growth is dependent on system costs. If the prices continue to go up and project economics deteriorate, demand is bound to contract in the short term.”

Green hydrogen is considered essential when it comes to decarbonization and future energy supplies. The hydrogen economy is still in its infancy, but the German government says generation capacity will be increased to 10 GW by 2030.
German consultancy Aurora Energy Research has reported that hydrogen projects with a total output of 21 GW have already been announced in Germany, but only a fraction of them have been realized. The analysts estimate that the industry will need up to 300 TWh of green hydrogen by 2050.
They assumed that the average costs for the renewables-powered production of green hydrogen will fall to around €5 per kg by 2025. They also assumed that industrial buyers will be ready to pay more than €5 per kg in the coming years. But from 2030 onwards, they are optimistic that green hydrogen imports will continue to reduce costs. That said, transport infrastructure such as ports and pipelines will need to be set up first.
Aurora Energy Research has determined that at prices of more than €5 per kg, the combination of solar with onshore wind farms is the most profitable option. However, maximum project profitability can only be achieved if wind and solar parks are coupled together with small electrolyzers for the production of green hydrogen. Aurora Energy Research sees the lowest green hydrogen production costs via the combination of 50 MW of wind power, 50 MW of PV, and 20 MW of electrolysis.
The analysts also assumed that if green hydrogen is generated via power purchase agreements, without direct co-location of a renewables plant, the production costs could also reach €5 per kg.
“Since the locations for the renewable systems can be optimized in these cases and the electrolyzer can be built closer to the customers, the costs for hydrogen transport and potentially also for hydrogen storage decrease,” they said.
