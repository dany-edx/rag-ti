In light of the climate change mitigation goal, the government has been supporting the development of framework conditions for the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The aim is to reach 30% EV penetration by 2030. The government has also formulated guidelines for EV charging and EV registration. Moreover, the Automobile Industry Development Policy 2021 has provisions for incentivising local EV manufacturers.
While the number of electric three-wheelers has increased drastically in recent years, electric cars are yet to gain a significant foothold in the country. Consumers’ purchasing capacity and motivation remain difficult hurdles to the uptake of electric cars. Stakeholders believe that the rollout of electric cars would require further policy support.
The economic burden of air pollution in Bangladesh, for which transport is one of the major reasons, calls for strong policy-level intervention to increase the adoption of electric cars.
The electric car market is very small in the country. Several reasons, such as high cost, lack of incentives and insufficient charging facilities, can explain the current dilly-dally approach of people in adopting electric cars.
Customs duty and supplementary duty of 72% and 20%, respectively, make the import of electric cars quite expensive in the absence of available local substitutes. While the neighbouring country, India, recently raised the customs duty from 60% to 70% for imported completely built units (CBUs) of EVs costing over US$40,000, it will not have much impact as local companies are already manufacturing electric cars.
Different Indian states offer cash incentives for a certain number of electric car owners under specific conditions. Moreover, India allows personal income tax benefits on the interest component if the owner avails of a loan to purchase an electric car. This scheme is applicable for a specified period.
While a cash incentive to electric car owners may not be a viable option amid the challenges Bangladesh is grappling with, it may reduce the import duties for a fixed period, say one year, to encourage people to buy electric cars. Like India, the government of Bangladesh may consider providing tax benefits to electric car owners.
Moreover, the proposed environmental surcharge on the second vehicle, based on engine capacity in cubic centimetres (cc) and equivalent kilowatt (kW), will dissuade an individual willing to buy the second car, whether electric or not. The government should waive this surcharge for electric cars, allowing individuals to switch to an electric car from the first car with an internal combustion engine within a reasonable timeframe.
In addition to creating demand for electric cars through policy support, charging facilities should be readily available for car owners away from home to allow them to enjoy long-distance travel.
Electric car owners will prefer convenient locations with quick charging facilities. Likewise, conscious car owners will value quality charging systems. The capital expenditure required for sufficient charging facilities may not make the business viable for the private sector. However, given that the primary goal of utilities is to sell electricity, the charging stations will further help enlarge their consumer base and increase revenue.
Additionally, the growing popularity of electric cars and the demand for charging stations in the future will help reduce the significant unused capacity of Bangladesh’s current power system. As the government of Bangladesh wishes to withdraw subsidies from the power sector, capacity utilisation of the power sector would remain key to minimise the increasing trajectory of losses that the sector has been incurring.
Utilities may further explore the opportunities to make the future charging ecosystem for electric cars greener, supported by solar energy.
Finally, looming on the horizon, the government should devise well-coordinated policy measures alongside the imperative of achieving the NDC goal of mitigating CO2 emissions. The government should closely monitor the impacts of the policy interventions on the growth of electric cars.
The utilities should also be ready to facilitate convenient, high-quality and quick charging facilities. The economics will favour utilities to invest in charging infrastructures if policy measures drive the country’s rapid growth of electric cars. Of course, the prevailing unused power sector capacity is another motivation for utilities to enter the business.

Asia is home to more than 50 percent of the world’s population, and in recent years, the region has experienced phenomenal economic growth. With the rise of local economies, the energy demand in the region is increasing faster than anywhere else in the world. Even though the power markets on the continent are tremendously diverse, they share one thing in common: a positive forecast for power demand.
Governments in the region have outlined aspirational plans to accelerate the development of renewable energy. As a result of these efforts, Asia has surpassed North America and Europe in terms of its renewable energy generation.
IRENA’s report Renewable Capacity Statistics 2023 shows that in 2022, Asia accounted for nearly 60 percent of the worldwide increase in renewable energy generating capacity, resulting in a total of 1.63 Terawatt (TW) of renewable capacity by year end. A huge part of this increase occurred in China. The country makes up the lion’s share of global renewable energy, adding 141 GW to the continent’s new capacity. With its commitment to achieve net-zero emission by 2060, the country is one of the key destination for renewable-energy development. There are several factors boosting the impact of renewables on China’s energy landscape, such as decline in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) which is happening hand in hand with an expansion of emerging technologies.
“Thanks to China’s “30/60 dual-carbon” ambition and its targets imposed on energy state-owned-enterprises and local governments, as well as the robust development of local supply chain, wind and solar installed capacity has increased massively in 2022, setting a record high regardless of the pandemic impact,” said Sharon Feng, Research and Advisory Service Director, Azure International.
Meanwhile, the Middle East recorded its largest increase in renewable energy capacity to date last year, commissioning 3.2 gigawatts of new capacity, reflecting a 12.8 percent increase, the report said.
“With a 12.8 percent growth rate in installed capacity of renewable energy, albeit from a relatively low starting base of 25.3GW, the Middle East region has a significant transition ahead to achieve the Paris commitments and net zero targets some countries have committed to,” said Mohammed Atif, Area Manager Middle East, DNV. “A firm pledge to the right policy, regulation and financing frameworks is going to be essential to drive additional renewable capacity growth. COP28 will be a pivotal inflection point for accelerated transformation,” he added.
Globally, renewable capacity grew by 9.6 percent in 2022, adding a record 295 GW worldwide. This accounts for 83 percent of all power capacity added last year and brings the global renewable generation capacity to 3,372 GW by the end of last year, the report said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/14/green-hydrogen-market-to-grow-six-fold-to-1-4-trillion-said-deloitte/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 14, 2023","US green hydrogen market to grow six-fold to $1.4 trillion, said Deloitte","From pv magazine USA
A new report from the Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress (DCSP) outlines the potential of green hydrogen, or hydrogen fuel produced by renewable energy sources, to meet the demands of heavy industry. 
The report set global market milestones of $642 billion by 2030, $980 billion by 2040, and $1.4 trillion by 2050, with growth in the industry split among the major global economies relatively evenly by mid-century, as seen below. This level of investment would represent a cumulative $9 trillion push by the global economy by 2050. 
Hard-to-abate sectors like steelmaking, chemical manufacturing, aviation and global shipping require high amounts of energy dispatch, something that can be difficult for electrochemical batteries to achieve. While batteries may serve mobile devices, electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage, hydrogen may present a viable path forward for decarbonizing these high-dispatch use cases.
The report said that these sectors may drive hydrogen demand and use six-fold by 2050, leading to nearly 600 million tons of hydrogen fuel use. While hydrogen electrolysis requires large amounts of electricity, the only byproduct of burning hydrogen fuel is water, making it an emissions-free source when created by renewable sources.
However, based on current green hydrogen project announcements, the global community could only provide a collective production capacity to meet one quarter of the projected demand in 2030, said Deloitte.
The firm estimates that green hydrogen could abate 85 gigatons of cumulative emissions by 2050, which equates to more than twice the annual total emissions in the year 2021.
Deloitte said that decisive climate action can help push the competitiveness of green hydrogen. After about 10 years, green hydrogen can become cost-competitive, said Deloitte, leading to the creation of 2 million jobs per year between 2030 and 2050. The firm said that as much as 70% of this job growth could occur in developing countries.
“Money is not the problem—though the average annual investment over the time period is significantly less than the $417 billion that was spent on oil and gas production in 2022 globally,” said Prof. Dr. Bernhard Lorentz, founding chair of the DCSP. “It’s just a question of redirecting the investment to clean energy sources, and Deloitte sees that the global finance industry has an increasing appetite for major investments.”
The projections come from Deloitte’s Hydrogen Pathway Explorer (HyPE) model, which delivers analysis of the global hydrogen supply. Deloitte’s outlook provides extensive detail into the cost, production, and market of hydrogen, even analyzing the business challenges facing the successful implementation of clean hydrogen, and providing insights into various market dynamics, such as optimal infrastructure sizing, investment needs, and technology choices.
“This analysis reveals a compelling opportunity for private and public leaders to accelerate the green energy transition,” said Joe Ucuzoglu, global chief executive officer, Deloitte. “While wind, solar, and other more traditional forms of renewable power are essential to a net-zero future, Deloitte’s research demonstrates how clean hydrogen can help tackle decarbonization of some of the world’s most emissions intensive and hardest-to-abate sectors, further mitigating the effects of climate change while fueling economic growth, particularly in developing countries.”
Deloitte notes that interregional trade and diversified transport infrastructure may be a large driver in green hydrogen development adoption.
“Regions that are currently able to produce cost-competitive hydrogen in quantities that exceed domestic needs are already positioning themselves as future hydrogen exporters—supplying other less-competitive regions and helping to smoothly facilitate the energy transition,” said the report.
Notably, interregional hydrogen trade is projected to generate more than $280 billion in annual export revenues by 2050.
Deloitte has undergone some recent actions to support green hydrogen adoption, including the establishment of a Hydrogen Investment Corridor initiative to help establish multilateral collaboration across key hydrogen trade and investment pathways, with an initial focus on Germany, Australia, Africa, and Japan.
The firm also launched the Deloitte Global Hydrogen Center of Excellence, which helps hydrogen developers scale up their businesses through advisory, implementation, and operational guidance services.

The country scored 62.9, compared to its nearest rival China’s 61.6, and the United States’ 58.5.
Germany, Australia, Israel, France, Egypt, Spain, and Brazil, in that order, completed EY’s top 10 for PV investment.
For overall renewables investment, the United States retained the top position. Among different RE technologies, it had almost 360 GW of solar and 258 GW of standalone battery storage in queues. Germany overtook China in the Index, targeting 80% renewables in its power mix by 2030. 
India moved up to sixth place in the renewables index as it strives to become a major producer and exporter of green hydrogen.
India’s renewables industry, in particular solar, is already rising driven by ambitious government targets and private-sector actions. The nation targets 500 GW of renewables capacity by 2030 (including around 280 GW from solar) and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070. Meanwhile, under its National Green Hydrogen Mission — which has an initial outlay of $2.4 billion — India is targeting the production of five million metric tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.
Expansion of the green hydrogen industry is expected to drive demand for the renewable energy that it requires for production.
“India has the fastest rate of renewable electricity growth of any major economy, with new capacity additions on track to double between the start of 2022 and 2026. As of February 2023, renewables accounted for around 42.5% of India’s installed power generation capacity,” EY quoted from a report by International Energy Agency.
India is also promoting domestic manufacturing of components like PV cells and modules with incentives to meet its RE goals. As of early 2023, the nation reached a cell and module manufacturing capacity of around 44 GW per year. 
“India is making significant efforts to establish itself as an attractive and investible market for renewable energy,” said Somesh Kumar, EY India Power & Utilities Leader. “The Indian government has been implementing various policies and initiatives to promote renewable energy development and attract both domestic and foreign investments.”
“With the increasing adoption of renewable electricity across the private sector and commercial and industrial consumers, intermittency and nonavailability of round-the-clock (RTC) power is a growing concern,” said Kumar. “Pumped hydro storage can play a significant role in ensuring RTC power to consumers.”
The biannual RECAI ranks the world’s top 40 markets on the attractiveness of their renewable energy investment and deployment opportunities. It uses various criteria to compare the attractiveness of renewables markets, such as the magnitude of the development pipeline, that reflect the absolute size of the renewable investment opportunity. The index is normalized with the gross domestic product (GDP) to see which markets are performing above expectations for their economic size.

SolarPower Europe published the latest edition of its Global Market Outlook 2023-2027 during Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany.
It says the world installed 239 GW of new solar capacity in 2022, equivalent to a 45% annual growth rate – the highest since 2016. It was another record year for solar, driven once again by China, with almost 100 GW added in a single year and a 72% growth rate. The United States held onto second place, despite a 6.9% drop in installations to 21.9 GW, followed by India with 17.4 GW, and Brazil with 10.9 GW. Spain is also becoming Europe’s largest PV market with 8.4 GW, according to SolarPower Europe. The figures differ slightly from other research firms. BloombergNEF, for example, said that global capacity additions hit 268 GW in 2022.
Overall, 26 countries added more than 1 GW of solar in 2022. These countries include China, the United States, India, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Japan, Poland, The Netherlands, Australia, South Korea, Italy, France, Taiwan, Chile, Denmark, Turkey, Greece, South Africa, Austria, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Hungary, Pakistan, Israel, and Switzerland.
The rooftop segment grew by 50% last year, with installations reaching 118 GW from 79 GW in 2021. Utility-scale solar grew by 41% to hit 121 GW, despite high module prices in 2021 and 2022.
“Large-scale systems remained the main contributor to the total capacity, but the shares of utility and rooftop solar have not been this close to each in three years; utility-scale contributed to 50.5% of total installations and rooftop contributed to 49.5%,” said SolarPower Europe.
Among the top 20 solar markets, Australia, South Korea, and Japan installed less rooftop solar compared to the previous year, with reductions of 2.3 GW, 1.1 GW, and 0.5 GW, respectively. However, all other top 20 markets posted growth in the rooftop segment.
“The most impressive progress could be witnessed in Brazil, which added an additional 5.3 GW. This giant 193% growth rate from 2021 was pushed by the rush of installations that sought to benefit [from] the generous conditions of the net-metering scheme before the rule changes in 2023,” said SolarPower Europe.
Italy and Spain posted rooftop market growth rates of 127% and 105%, respectively, driven by residential installations in Italy and self-consumption in Spain. Denmark, India, Austria, China, Greece, and South Africa all experienced rooftop growth rates exceeding 50%. China led the market with 51.1 GW of installed systems, accounting for 54% of its total installations in 2022.
SolarPower Europe predicts a 35% growth in the rooftop segment in 2023, with an anticipated addition of 159 GW. The figure could rise to 183 GW by 2024 and potentially reach 268 GW by 2027, according to the medium scenario. The growth will be more consistent compared to 2022, as it will be driven by energy prices returning to lower levels.
On a global scale, the utility-scale segment is expected to reach 182 GW in 2023, marking a 51% growth from the previous year. The forecast for 2024 is 218 GW, with further growth projected to reach 349 GW by 2027.
“The forecast is bright – between 341 and 402 GW of solar will be installed worldwide in 2023. From a total TW solar fleet today, the world could be installing 1 TW of solar annually by the end of the decade – hitting up to 800 GW per year already in 2027,” concluded SolarPower Europe.

Pexapark, a Swiss consultancy, said in its April monthly report that electricity markets are now recovering, following a series of uncontrollable events that have affected the European energy industry.
On the price front, the Pexa Euro Composite Index fell by 2.5% month-on-month due to declining electricity and raw material prices. The Netherlands experienced the largest decline of 9.5% to €56.72/MWh, while Spain and Portugal saw drops of 6.4% and 6.2% respectively, reaching €40.90/MWh and €39.60/MWh.
However, prices in the United Kingdom rose by 3.5% to €82.29/MWh in April, and Scandinavian countries increased by 1% to €50/MWh, while Italy saw a 0.7% increase to €75.60/MWh.
After a strong first quarter of 2023, PPA activity slowed down in April, with 16 announcements totaling approximately 922 MW, a 55% decrease compared to March. This represents the lowest monthly capacity since last September, with eight fewer agreements registered, reflecting a decrease of 33%.
The notable deal this month involved Statkraft’s acquisition of NextEnergy’s 210 MW Portuguese solar portfolio, resulting in a purchase of 341 GWh per year.
