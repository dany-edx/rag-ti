The 144-half-cell, multibusbar modules are based on 182mm wafer and offer a peak power output of 540W. 
The multi-busbars approach contributes to increased light absorption and uniform load sharing, hence better performance.
Tanmoy Duari, chief executive officer of Axitec Energy India, told pv magazine, “Currently, the company is producing 445Wp multibusbar, mono PERC modules through its Indian subsidiary Axitec Energy India at the Hyderabad plant in the Indian State of Telangana. The current capacity of the Hyderabad plant is 750 MW.”
“Sample production of 540Wp modules in India has already started, and commercial production of these modules will start from next month onwards,” he added.
Axitec Energy India plans to increase the module capacity of the Hyderabad plant to 2.4 GW eventually.

However, the current low active cases in Delhi and the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh where the event is taking place (377 and 175 as of September 14, respectively) seemed to have worked for the organizers to go ahead with the event in its usual format within a small period of time.

The Covid impact on the scale of the event is visible. This year, the show reduced to three halls from 11 halls occupied in pre-Covid times. As of the time of writing this article, the number of registrations stood at 14,000.
Yogesh Mudras, managing director of Informa Markets India, cited less international participation and big players going for smaller booths fearing less visitors due to Covid as the reasons for reduced floor scale of the event.
However, the show is keeping the spirts high with major Indian players including Waaree, Vikram Solar, Jakson, Premier Energies, etc having booths at the expo. The organizers have taken appropriate measures to remove the attendee anxiety by following strict Covid protocols, and going by the attendees on the first day (despite the pandemic) the efforts seemed to have paid off!

The power ministry has recently proposed a market-based economic dispatch (MBED) mechanism for procuring bulk power to begin in April 2022. In another progressive market development, India’s Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has come up with regulations for Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS).
The IEEFA note looks at the benefits and potential roadblocks to the implementation of these two key reforms and argues that they are important steps towards transforming India’s power sector into a low-emissions, low-cost, and profitable part of the economy.
“Both developments will improve efficiency, competition, and liquidity in the power market,” says the note’s author Kashish Shah, Research Analyst at IEEFA.
Under the Ministry of Power’s proposed MBED mechanism, power would be dispatched through a central pool instead of at the state level, helping to optimize India’s power generation resources.
Efficient price discovery would reduce power procurement costs by INR 12,000 crore (US$1.6 billion) annually, according to government estimates, leading to an improvement in the financial situation of the state-owned distribution companies (discoms).
This would, in effect, create a virtuous circle, reducing delays in discoms’ payments to generators and adding protection to renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs), says Shah.
“Improved bankability of PPAs can potentially lower the cost of capital which will, in turn, reduce the cost of renewable energy and make the market even more conducive to renewables.”
Shah also points out that as the market becomes more competitive, cheaper plants would be dispatched first. This would raise the stranded asset risk for expensive thermal power plants.
Increased frequency and voltage variability on the grid requires supporting services broadly defined as Frequency Control and Ancillary Services.
The note also discusses the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (CERC) draft regulations for procurement, deployment, and payment of ancillary services to maintain the grid frequency at 50 Hertz.
“The integration of high shares of solar and wind will require an increase in India’s reserve resources, particularly primary and secondary reserves, to manage deviations in the frequency due to the intermittency of renewable energy,” says Shah. 
“Delivery of Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) will allow competitive price signaling for investment into important grid flexibility tools, such as utility-scale batteries and pumped hydropower storage.
“The development of a formal market for FCAS will provide another substantial revenue stream for utility-scale batteries and allow them to operate as an important grid management asset.”
The note says the proposed reforms will need further finessing and calls for the FCAS regulations to be tightened to include battery storage among Primary Response Ancillary Services.
“These reforms will lay solid foundations for a modern and competitive market necessary to transform India’s power market.”

German renewable energy company Baywa r.e. and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have completed construction on a 258 kW agrivoltaic project located in Gelsdorf, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, in the frame of a five-year research project financed by the regional Ministry of Climate Protection, Environment, Energy and Mobility.
The Bio-Obsthof Nachtwey project occupies a surface of 9,100 square meters and covers a third of a plot of agricultural land devoted to crop cultivation for eight different apple varieties. Experts from the two entities explained that apples are currently being grown on the entire plot under four different crop protection systems: a foil roofing that blocks rain; hail protection nets that do not block rain; an agrivoltaic technology with permanent, light-permeable PV modules that blocks rain; and a tracking PV module tech that blocks rain only if necessary.
“Two different types of modules are used, with solar cells arranged either in strips or in a block pattern,” the Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “The aim is to determine to what extent the agrivoltaic systems protect the plants and fruit from harmful environmental influences such as hail, heavy rainfall, sunburn, frost or extreme temperatures.”
The electricity generated by the PV system is used for both upstream and downstream applications related to the production of apples, such as an electric tractor or an irrigation system, among others. The proposed system is also claimed to be suitable for the cultivation of pears, cherries, kiwis and other kinds of crops.
“Researchers will also investigate to what extent different approaches to light management, by way of different PV module configurations, influence plant growth and crop yields,” the Fraunhofer ISE further explained. “Other aspects of the system, relating to landscape aesthetics, economic viability, social compatibility, and plant cultivation parameters will also be examined.”
Baywa r.e. completed a 1.2 MWp array at Rini Kusters’ fruit farm in Wadenoijen, in the Netherlands in March. A first analysis of its performance showed the facility is able to reduce extreme high temperatures on the crop and also shield the plants from damp. The German company has also developed a special monocrystalline solar panel for agrivoltaic projects. These panels are able to absorb some of the incoming radiation and are set up in such a way that the air can pass through them. The natural airflow ensures that the atmosphere under the plants is cooler than ambient conditions, and much cooler than standard foil coverings.
The Fraunhofer ISE recently estimated the LCOE of agrivoltaic projects in Germany and found it currently ranges between €0.07 and €0.12 per kWh, for an average value of €0.093 per kWh.
