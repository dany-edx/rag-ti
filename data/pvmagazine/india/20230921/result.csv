The company has released new product lines, spanning residential, commercial, and utility-scale applications. The modules have been certified by UL, a prominent global testing and certification company based in the U.S.
“N-type TOPCon solar modules experience lower degradation (1% in first-year and 0.4% year-on-year) than P-type solar modules (2% in first-year and 0.55% year-on-year) which ensures longevity of the solar project,” said Gautam Solar. “They provide 5% more generation every year and BOS Savings of 3.26% and LCOE reduction of 1.56%.”
Gautam Solar’s new lineup includes:
The modules incorporate half-cut cells based on larger M10 wafers to enable more power production per unit area as compared to polycrystalline and full-cell monocrystalline modules, said the company. Improved levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and low-light performance are enabled by the half-cut cell design, it said. 
Gautam also uses round ribbon connectors in its cells to boost light utilization, and non-destructive cell cutting to minimize microcracking. Its cells integrate multi-busbars for lowered electrical losses. Further, the M10 cells ensure maximum space utilization in a standard 40 foot shipping container.
Monofacial and bifacial variants are available for the N-type modules, with the bifacial module incorporating a lightweight transparent back sheet to add 10% to 30% more production. 
“We’re also adding solar power plant design and remote monitoring services at no extra cost for our customers to provide a more comprehensive solar solutions package,” said Gautam Mohanka, chief executive officer, Gautam Solar.
Gautam manufactures the modules at its facility in Haridwar, India. The company has announced plans to add a 1 GW manufacturing facility in the United States, joining the solar manufacturing gold rush.

The vessels will be among the world’s first of their kind to use hydrogen as a fuel.
Built by Cochin Shipyard Ltd, the largest shipbuilding and maintenance facility in India, the 135-meter ships are due for delivery in the third and fourth quarters of 2025, respectively. Both vessels will operate between Oslo Fjord and Rotterdam, a distance of approximately 700 nautical miles.
“In addition to the integration of hydrogen fuel cells, ABB’s comprehensive package includes the new, compact version of ABB Onboard DC Grid power distribution system that will ensure the optimal use of energy on board. The vessels will also feature ABB’s energy storage solution control, with ABB Ability System 800xA automation solution, ensuring seamless operation of onboard equipment. Leveraging ABB Ability Remote Diagnostic Systems, the vessels will benefit from optimized safety and performance through 24/7 remote support,” stated ABB.
Fuel cells turn the chemical energy from hydrogen into electricity through an electrochemical reaction. With the use of renewables to produce hydrogen, the entire energy chain will be clean. Hydrogen fuel cell technology is considered one of the most promising solutions to support the shipping industry’s decarbonization agenda, with the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency.
Samskip’s vessels will be powered by a 3.2 MW hydrogen fuel cell each, with diesel generators installed for backup. The logistics group, which aims to achieve net zero by 2040, anticipates that each vessel will be able to avoid around 25,000 tons of CO2 emissions a year when powered by fuel cells and by using green shore power at the port of call.  
The project is co-funded by Norwegian state enterprise ENOVA. Operating under Norway’s Ministry of Climate and Environment, ENOVA promotes a shift towards more environmentally friendly energy consumption and production, as well as the development of energy and climate technology.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/21/enabling-indias-self-reliance-in-lithium-battery-grade-materials/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV BATTERIES,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION CELLS,RECYCLING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",Enabling India’s self-reliance in lithium battery-grade materials,"pv magazine: Attero has announced the successful recovery of refined battery-grade lithium carbonate from lithium reserves found in Jammu and Kashmir. Please tell us how your recycling prowess helped in the refining capability.
We are a deep tech company with a solid focus on sustainability. We have today 39 granted global patents on recycling technologies developed in India. The patents are in China, Taiwan, Singapore, and other parts of Asia including India, USA, and Europe. And we have filed more than 200 patent applications.
We’re also the only lithium battery and e-waste recycling company in the world to get carbon credits per ton of waste recycled. The carbon grade methodology is approved by the United Nations and is based on the fact that the amount of energy involved in Attero’s processes to extract pure gold, pure copper, pure aluminum, pure cobalt, and pure lithium carbonate is significantly lower than the amount of energy involved to extract these metals from either a virgin mine or any other known secondary sources.
We have already been the leader in electronic waste recycling in India by far on any single metric, whether you look at revenue, profitability, market share, collection network across the country, revenues, or whichever ESG or IP.
On the lithium-ion battery side, our recycling technology, which has been existing and running commercially for the last few years, is the best in the world. We are today, and over the last few years, collecting all kinds of end-of-life lithium batteries and extracting pure battery-grade cobalt, battery-grade lithium carbonate, battery-grade graphite, battery-grade nickel, manganese sulfate and putting them back in the circular economy ecosystem.
Our battery recycling technology enables us to extract more than 98% of pure battery-grade materials, while internationally, the number is around 75%. So, there is significant technological arbitrage that we have built.
The same technology we have for battery recycling is being used for refining output from mines, so we’ve taken samples from the Jammu & Kashmir lithium reserves that the Government of India found out and prospected. We were able to successfully extract 200 parts per million (ppm) of pure battery-grade lithium carbonate from it.
From a mining perspective, when you mine a lithium mine, you come out with some intermediate product that needs to be refined further into battery-grade lithium carbonate. Today, 90% of that market is controlled by China, and India does not have anybody to do that. So, we wanted to see whether we could leverage our battery recycling technology for extracting lithium carbonate and use it on the intermediate output of the mine, which we were able to do. It’s a great step for the country.
We plan to have roughly 300,000 tons per annum of lithium refining capacity in the next five years.
pv magazine: What is the next step after extracting lithium carbonate? What does it take before lithium from these reserves can actually be used by battery manufacturers? 
The Government of India is planning to auction these reserves. We expect the auction to be out any time within this calendar year. Once they auction the reserves, they’ll have some more conditions for that auction part of it. That’s the commercial angle. We’ll see how that goes.
The technical angle is any reserves from the stage that they are in the Jammu & Kashmir mine to a full production mine is broadly a four-year process. That’s from a timing perspective. From a technology standpoint, there are two technologies involved. One is a pure mining technology where you crush the stone, pick out the sand, make sure that you mine it, and get it to a certain intermediate stage. That’s technology No. 1, which is essentially mechanical and some bit of chemical in nature. After that comes refining part of it, which, as I said, 90% is done by China and nobody in India does it apart from us. That refining involves chemical processes largely.
So that’s the entire process. Commercially, these mines will be auctioned. From a timing perspective, it’s four years. From a technology perspective, there are two different parts to it. First is the mining technology and second is the refining technology. Our process is extremely useful for the refining part of it.
After mining, we take the intermediate output as an input and pass it through various chemical steps to extract pure battery-grade lithium carbonate. That is essentially the work we do.
pv magazine: India has found reserves in Jammu and Kashmir and now Rajasthan also. How significant is the discovery of these reserves for India’s transition to electric mobility and net zero? 
These are two big discoveries from a lithium reserves perspective. India did not have any lithium reserves. Most of the lithium reserves are concentrated in Bolivia and Argentina and some in Australia.
So India wanted to make sure that geopolitically it’s not dependent on any other country for lithium, which is a critical material for energy transition and carbon neutrality goal achievement.
From that angle, India created a public-sector unit called Khanij Bidesh India Limited (KABIL), with Nalco and others as its shareholders. KABIL’s job was to go and buy mines outside India for lithium and cobalt and ensure India attained self-sufficiency in these materials.
Buying a mine is one part of it, and having the technology to refine it is another. With these two mines [in Jammu and Kashmir and Rajsthan] being prospected in India, at least India does not need to go out and look for lithium mines.
And with these two reserves being figured out, we are on the world’s top five reserves of lithium, which is an extremely great thing. Not only will we become self-dependent, but we can also start exporting lithium.
So, the first problem of finding the reserves is sorted out. Now, the second part of ensuring we have the right process and technology for refining them is what Attero has done.
pv magazine: Do you plan to scale up your lithium refining capacity? 
Obviously, we will need to scale up, and we are in the process of scaling up. We plan to have roughly 300,000 tons per annum of lithium refining capacity in the next five years.
PV magazine: The adoption of electric vehicles is growing in India, as is the buildup of lithium battery waste. How do you see a true recycling mechanism in this entire ecosystem? 
Electric vehicle adoption in India is bound to grow mainly because of two factors. One is climate change. Electric vehicles are better for the environment, and there’s a growing recognition of that. So, both from a consumer standpoint as well as from an automobile OEM standpoint, everybody is keen to move towards electric vehicles rather than Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.
Second, the government is pushing electrification [of vehicles] to have a better environment in place and reduce the nation’s oil imports bill.
With both of these drivers, an EV boom in India was supposed to happen. It has already happened in two-wheelers. And it’s happening in four-wheelers and large-format vehicles as we speak. In fact, a significant number of electric buses are being ordered by various state governments.
For that electric boom, the battery is the most critical component. And for the battery, the most critical components are lithium and cobalt. Attero, as a technology leader, is making sure that India can be self-reliant in both these critical materials without depending on China or any other country.
PV magazine: What are you doing to make the entire recycling process low-cost, sustainable, and energy-efficient? 
By design, our process is low-cost and energy-efficient. If you look at the Capex per ton of lithium battery recycling, our capex is at least 45% lower than anybody else in the world, including companies in China, USA and Europe. Our revenue efficiency, which is related to extraction efficiency, is 35% higher than anybody else in the world.
PV magazine: A lot of investment is being made in lithium battery recycling globally, but the extraction efficiency still needs to be improved. How does Attero stand out with its patented method?
Rightly said, more than $4 billion has been invested in lithium battery recycling globally. We are also in the process of raising various kinds of capital sources. We are a profitable company. Whether it’s debt or equity, we continue to engage with the right stakeholders.
From a technology standpoint, worldwide, even after a $4 billion investment, all the companies are sitting at a maximum 75% recovery efficiency. Attero can recover 98%. So, we already have a significant technological advantage based in India compared to anybody else in the world.
Today, we’re recycling all kinds of lithium batteries. We don’t distinguish between various types of batteries.
pv magazine: As you expand, how do you plan to collect the battery waste and recycle it? 
Right now also, we have a significant collection network of battery waste. The battery waste comes to us from four different channels. One is the e-waste aggregator channel we’ve already built, where we collect nearly 100,000 tonnes of e-waste every year. The same channel can supply around 20,000 tons of lithium battery waste annually. These aggregators essentially collect from the dealers, some consumers, and other kinds of service networks.
The second is directly from manufacturers, whether OEM manufacturers or the cell manufacturers outside India that we already have contracts with.
The third is from the service centers or various OEMs.
All of this battery collection network that we’ve already built gives us a substantial input volume based on the capacity we’re building.
pv magazine: Going forward, how do you see Attero’s role in achieving India’s electric mobility and net-zero emissions goals? Do you also plan to venture into battery cell manufacturing? 
We don’t plan to get into battery cell manufacturing as of now. Our hands are full with ensuring we can get the best battery-grade materials out there. We are looking at all kinds of inputs for getting battery-grade materials, whether from end-of-life lithium batteries, lithium mines, or mine tailings. So, whatever input is there, our job right now is to ensure that we can extract the maximum amount of battery-grade materials and put these back in the circular economy. And we’re focused on that.
Attero’s role is super-critical today for the world and especially for India, from a circular economy and net-zero perspective. The more we’re able to recycle efficiently at a low cost, at a low opex, and put it back in the circular economy, that’s a fantastic job. For India, it becomes even more critical that an Indian company does this because most of the battery-grade material output comes from China.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/21/benchmarks-for-solar-energy-data-methods/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023","Benchmarks for solar energy data, methods","In the ever-evolving world of solar energy applications, access to accurate and reliable modeled irradiance data is crucial. Modeled irradiance data based on satellite products and numerical weather prediction models are frequently used. Many of such sources of data are offered by institutional or commercial providers. However, it is difficult and time consuming for users to independently identify the best provider for their specific application and location.
Benchmarking Solar Data
In our Task 16 report “Worldwide Benchmark of Modelled Solar Irradiance Data” we address this challenge. The report presents a benchmark of model-derived direct normal irradiance (DNI) as well as global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data that considers 129 globally distributed sites where ground-based radiation measurement stations are or have been installed. DNI and GHI estimates are compared against high-quality observations from these stations. The performance of the modeled data is analyzed with respect to different regions and climate zones. This study helps the solar industry make better informed decisions about solar resource assessments.
Building a reference database
Big efforts were made to build the reference database. We finally used data from 25 different providers with 129 stations during 2015–2020. Only quality-assured data has been considered in this benchmark through a comprehensive set of best practices and newly implemented quality-control procedures. These include automatic as well as manual data quality-control tests carried out by a team of experts led by CSP Services GmbH for all stations and result in flags describing the quality for each time stamp. The bulk of the quality-controlled data, covering all continents and many climate zones, has been published within this benchmark.
Global representation
One of the strengths of this benchmark is its global reach. The 129 ground-based stations are strategically distributed worldwide, encompassing diverse regions and climate zones. This global representation includes 31 stations in Africa, 31 in Asia, 27 in North America, 20 in Europe, 13 in Australia, 5 in South America, and even 2 in Antarctica. By spanning such a wide geographical scope, this benchmark provides insights into the performance of model-derived data in various environmental conditions, from arid deserts to polar extremes
Assessing model-derived data
Ten different models were tested, although not all provide estimates for all stations. Amongst other statistical performance parameters, the mean bias deviation, root mean square deviation, and standard deviation are calculated for each year and per station. The results for the relative mean bias deviation affecting GHI are shown in Figure 1.
Benchmark findings
Based on the results of the statistical analysis, the most appropriate dataset might depend on site, climate, or continent of interest. The model errors and the differences between the various modeled datasets are much higher for DNI than for GHI.


Figure 1: Relative mean bias deviation (rMDB) for GHI and all stations and years. Magenta color indicates results out of the color bar range. The point size corresponds to the total number of datapoints in the tested data from 2015 to 2020.
Solar irradiance measurements and time series play a decisive role in supporting solar resource assessments, especially for medium and large PV installations. Not only they represent the foundation of solar resource assessment and forecasting, but they also drive prospective PV yield studies, and can be used as a calibration reference when using satellite data, evaluating PV systems’ performance, or developing forecasting algorithms.
Challenge: data gaps
However, such datasets inevitably have gaps – periods with missing data – as a result of defaults during data-logging, sensor failures or quality check procedures that can compromise their applicability and value. An additional issue is that data gaps can be further enlarged when computing temporal aggregations, notably for intra-daily to daily, daily to monthly and yearly averages, thus further degrading the dataset.
This has raised the need for gap-filling methods that can post‑process either static historical datasets or more dynamic real-time data streams. Each case is characterized by different constraints, such as the access to data that follows a given data gap or the acceptable time lag for generating the replacement synthetic data.
Benchmark for GHI gap-filling methods
In our report “Framework for Benchmarking of GHI Gap-Filling Methods”, led by Mines Paris PSL, we propose a gap-filling benchmark framework and evaluate a set of possible baseline algorithms for intra-hourly and daily sums of GHI time series. Five methods have been compared for different lengths of gaps: Nearest neighbors, linear interpolation, two machine learning approaches and use of satellite data. For short gaps linear interpolation works best, as for longer gaps the use of satellite data is suggested.
Conclusion
With access to comprehensive statistical performance parameters and insights into model errors, analysts can make informed decisions about which data providers and models align with their needs. Our recently published reports serve as a guiding light, making the uncertainty of data and models comparable for solar industry professionals and researchers, ultimately advancing the field and promoting sustainable energy solutions worldwide.
