The company has collaborated with NC State University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Ensyn, The Battery Innovation Center (BIC), and Yale University to develop and scale up the production of biocrude-derived graphite.
“As a key player in this collaboration project, Birla Carbon will convert the biocrude-derived coke to battery-grade graphite using a new-to-the-world graphitization technology, which greatly improves the sustainability of battery materials production by both increasing product output and decreasing energy usage, said Dr. Ann Schoeb, Chief Research and Development Officer, Birla Carbon.
Birla Carbon will purportedly perform graphitization utilizing existing equipment at its facility, where it processes carbon products as part of its regular course of business.
The project aims to produce graphite more sustainably using renewable feedstocks and aligns with Birla Carbon’s goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The increase in demand for electric vehicles is primarily fueling the lithium-ion battery market, and portable electronic devices, power tools, residential energy storage, and grid-level storage applications are becoming increasingly dependent on this technology.
Graphite is one of the materials in a lithium-ion battery that stores lithium. Producing battery-grade graphite from biocrude offers a more sustainable pathway toward producing these valuable materials.

Of the new additions, 2,602 MW came from utility-scale solar, 485 MW from the rooftop, and 251 MW from off-grid installations, according to Bridge to India’s latest report, India Solar Compass Q3 2022.
Capacity installations in Q3 declined 13% over the preceding quarter as developers postponed projects in anticipation of a fall in module prices next year. Lack of clarity about concessional basic customs duty (BCD) for projects auctioned before March 2021 also slowed progress, said the analysts.
“Prices of both international and domestic modules softened slightly and are expected to continue easing gradually through all of 2023. EPC cost for utility-scale solar saw a 7% QOQ decline to INR 43.3 ($0.53)/Wp,” stated the report.
Module imports picked up marginally during the quarter, but exports too picked up rapidly to record an all-time high.
The total PV capacity in the pipeline stood at 53,405 MW as of September 30. This includes projects allocated to developers and in various stages of development.
The analysts expect the nation to add about 3.2 GW of PV capacity in Q4 2022 and 3 GW in Q1 2023.

It is developing these projects in four blocks of 300 MW each at Khavda RE Power Park in Rann of Kutch.
The prospective contractor’s scope of work includes design, engineering, manufacturing, supply, packing and forwarding, transportation, unloading, storage, installation, testing, and commissioning of the solar plant, excluding the supply of PV modules. It will also provide comprehensive operation and maintenance of the solar plant for three years from the date of commissioning of the full project capacity.
“PV modules shall be supplied by NTPC REL as free issue item,” reads the tender document.
To be eligible, the bidder’s average annual turnover during the preceding three financial years should be a minimum of INR 75 crore ($9.17 million) if it bids for one block of 300 MW, INR 225 crore for two blocks of 300 MW each, Rs 520 Crore for three blocks of 300 MW each, and Rs 965 Crore for four blocks of 300 MW each.

Qcells and a group of European research institutes led by HZB have started a project with the aim of producing high-efficiency tandem solar cells and modules. The so-called Pepperoni project will establish a pilot manufacturing line in Thalheim, Qcell’s headquarters in Germany. The name stems from the broader project titled ‘Pilot line for European Production of PEROvskite-Silicon taNdem modules on Industrial scale’ or PEPPERONI.
The silicon-perovskite tandem cells will have a bottom silicon cell based on Qcell’s Q.ANTUM technology. “The project aims to scale up the active area of perovskite/Si tandems from the 1cm2 of today’s record devices to industry-relevant dimensions,” the group said in a statement.
The project will identify and address barriers to speeding up the technology’s mass manufacturing and market penetration. One of the project’s goals is to minimize scaling losses by using innovative materials and equipment. It will also develop thin-film deposition processers and equipment, with the ultimate goal of building a new production capacity in Europe.
“At HZB we have developed the tandem technology to world-record efficiency level on lab scale,” said Bernd Stannowski, head of group industry compatible processes at HZB. “We are now looking forward to cooperate in the Pepperoni consortium with partners from science and industry to jointly scale this new and very promising technology up and transfer it to industry.”
The four-year project is partly funded by Horizon Europe, to a total of €14.5 million ($14.9 million). It includes 17 partners from 12 countries across Europe, with a key objective to demonstrate 26%-efficient modules or higher on industrial scale
