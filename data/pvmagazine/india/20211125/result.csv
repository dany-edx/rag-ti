https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/25/automation-in-solar-om-delivering-plant-roi/,"DATA ANALYSIS,DRONES,HIGHLIGHTS,IOT,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 25, 2021",Automation in solar O&M delivering plant ROI,"The global non-residential solar operations & maintenance (O&M) business is predicted to more than double to US$ 9 billion by 2025 from being a US$ 4 billion market in 2019, according to global research & analytics firm Wood Mackenzie. A steady growth in the global solar power industry has led to an unprecedented and rising demand for O&M services.
With solar energy playing a noteworthy role in India’s energy transition too, an ever-appealing opportunity transcends the solar O&M industry. India’s solar footprint has matured from 3.7 GW in 2015 to over 40 GW in FY2021. With this, domestic solar O&M has emerged as a separate market with its own landscape and dynamics. As more and more solar plants get stable, an increasing number of O&M contracts are getting re-tendered, presenting a growing opportunity for O&M providers.
Until a few years ago, solar O&M was limited only to module cleaning, plant security, optimal spares management and overall plant upkeep. As large-scale solar assets mature and plant sizes increase, asset owners are realising the value of a strategic data-driven approach for maintenance. Timely reporting and accuracy of plant performance metrics, and plant availability is a critical requirement of the asset owners. With smart technology becoming a powerful competitive advantage, the solar O&M market is fast changing from being conventional to tech driven.
New technologies are being implemented to improve asset cycle management, remote sensing (powered by Industrial Internet of Things), cloud computing and aerial techniques for visual imaging. With the solar M&A market booming and with a drop in tariffs, digitisation is facilitating sellers find buyers easily and operate assets more efficiently. It also helps reduce manpower dependency and create better insights for improved operations. Technology-driven O&M is now a prerequisite to attracting investment into the sector and maximising Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for the investor.
The need of the hour is continuous performance monitoring, trend analysis and forecasting, and predictive analytics to ensure maximum plant performance and reduce plant downtime.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as important tech solutions in the quest for better monitoring and predictive maintenance. These technologies have the potential to analyse big data, optimise the present and forecast future trends.
AI can monitor patterns and trends in data to better predict and potentially optimise future maintenance and performance activities. And with ML, more data can lead to better analysis and greater accuracy. Predictive and prescriptive analytics-based maintenance cuts down cost and reduces the potential for unforeseen failures, whereas automation assists in plant monitoring, efficient robotic cleaning, better data capturing and advanced analytics, thus resulting in better performance. For example, drone-based remote monitoring and other aerial techniques have reduced inspection time and site visits. And autonomous drone inspections and mobile vans are utilised to evaluate and detect component and cable faults and make rectifications.
Market forces are also causing higher investments in R&D to make the equipment uptime more reliable. This advancement, supported by AI and ML, is leading to higher reliability on equipment life and decrease in downtime.
Cost composition in a solar O&M project is rapidly changing owing to increased automation and advanced tools. With prices reducing, there is an enhanced pressure on process and cost optimisation. As developers and asset owners explore newer methods on cost optimisation, service providers remain focused on enhancing profitability, streamlining availability and performance, minimising consumption, and lowering operating costs. Tech-based solutions significantly reduce maintenance costs on module cleaning and associated manpower and help maintain profitability.
A holistic approach is needed in operating and maintaining solar projects in order to deliver the highest plant efficiency. There must be dedicated teams to conduct regular plant performance, recommend preventive and corrective maintenance, and optimise plant yield. They must integrate proven state-of-the-art and best-in-class digital tools and tracks to analyse real-time data in order to improve preventive maintenance and plant performance.
Following the above approach, Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy consistently surpasses performance guaranteed to its customers. Our average availability is 99.7% in most O&M plants – higher than the current norm of 99.5%. Our internationally certified mobile module testing lab facilitates efficient testing of modules at plant sites, while our state-of-the-art network operations centre gives instant business insights as a value-added service.
Moving forward, the future appears more exciting as the entire lifecycle of a solar asset gradually converts into a digital blockchain where assets will be sold and purchased on a transparent platform and financial transactions will get streamlined. Digitisation will lead to completely automated operations and uberization of manpower in surveillance, module cleaning and remote monitoring for enhanced plant performance. As the solar O&M story continues to be on a growth path, cutting-edge technologies have the potential to optimise critical components, stay competitive and revolutionise the solar O&M industry.

The electrolyzer has been manufactured by Ohmium at its Bengaluru plant, India’s first green hydrogen electrolyzer Gigafactory. 
The Ohmium gigafab in Bengaluru manufactures Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology-based electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen. The factory has a capacity of producing about 500 MW of electrolysis equipment per annum, which is eventually planned for expansion to 2 GW per annum.
Currently, most hydrogen in India is produced using natural gas through steam methane (CH4) reforming and used in the refinery and fertilizer industries. 
As announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the recent Climate Summit (COP26) in Glasgow, green hydrogen is a key component of India’s goal to achieve net-zero emissions. India aims to alter the present state of play wherein its entire hydrogen production comes from fossil fuels. The government is keen to scale up green hydrogen production within the country and mandate its use in industries like petroleum refineries and fertilizer industries. 
“The first shipment of a product is a big moment for any company. This is especially exciting for Ohmium as well as all of our suppliers in India because it proves beyond a doubt that both manufacturing and technology excellence in the field of green hydrogen generation are in India’s wheelhouse. We feel that when we export Ohmium products from India we are pushing the boundaries of the Honorable Prime Minister’s AatmaNirbhar Bharat and National Hydrogen Mission—in a good way—by expanding the global impact of these programs,” said Arne Ballantine, CEO and co-founder, Ohmium.
“We are seeing significant activity in India and around the world in green hydrogen projects. Ohmium is constantly working towards providing innovative, scalable, profitable, flexible, and safe solutions that can be leveraged to achieve competitive levelized costs of hydrogen, supporting the growth of India’s economy. We are confident of Green Hydrogen as the fuel of the future owing to its enormous potential, numerous applications across sectors, and a zero-carbon footprint. Currently, our factory has a manufacturing capacity of approximately ½ GW per year, and we can rapidly expand it to 2 GW per year to facilitate India’s accelerated transition to clean energy systems,” said Ahmad Chatila, Chairman, Ohmium.

German utility RWE is set to sell solar developer Belectric to Czech power utility CEZ Group.
According to the German Federal Cartel Office, which is currently reviewing the transaction, CEZ will buy all shares and take full control of the German developer.
“It is correct that RWE is currently selling parts of Belectric,” an RWE spokesperson told pv magazine. “The transaction has yet to be approved by the relevant authorities.”
Founded in 2001, Belectric is one of the largest EPC companies for photovoltaic power plants in Germany. In 2017, the photovoltaic project developer became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Innogy. In the course of the far-reaching transactions between RWE and Eon, it was transferred to RWE in 2020 and has been part of RWE Renewables since then.
The sale of Belectric by RWE is part of a plan to streamline its renewable energy business. Last week, the energy company announced an investment offensive for wind power, hydrogen and storage. RWE intends to invest €50 billion by 2030 and, among other things, increase its installed photovoltaic capacity worldwide from around 1 GW to 8 GW.
According to the company, the sale of Belectric has no impact on its ambitious growth plans in the solar sector. “We will invest massively in this technology,” the company stated. “We concentrate on the development and operation of systems – but not on construction, for which we will hire service providers.”
