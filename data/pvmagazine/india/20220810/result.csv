The solar developer expects the project to produce 2,40,000 MWh of green energy, while helping to offset almost 1,56,400 tons of CO2 emissions per year.
It executed the entire project through its in-house engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) team, which completed the project within the scheduled time frame. It provided end-to-end services, from securing the land and connectivity to signing bilateral power purchase agreements (PPAs) with commercial and industrial consumers. It also designed the system, procured construction components such as transmission lines, and commissioned the project.
“Rays was able to commission these high-quality plants on time despite facing an extraordinarily challenging execution environment due to the pandemic. The team implemented SAP software to monitor the entire construction schedule effectively to ensure timely project delivery,” said Ketan Mehta, managing director and CEO of Rays Power Infra. “Every safety measure was taken into consideration, along with regular CSR activities like daily food and essential distribution to the community. Apart from this, monthly free health camps were also conducted for everyone directly or indirectly associated with the project.”
Rays Power Infra is looking to establish more power plants in Karnataka and other states. It is currently developing a 500 MWp solar project, set for commissioning within the next nine months. Out of this 500 MWp, 220 MWp will be developed in India, while the remaining 280 MWp will add to the company’s international portfolio. Rays Power is also developing two 900 MW AC solar parks in Rajasthan, which will be used to set up utility-scale and C&I projects.
Rays Power Infra has 1.15 GWp of commissioned PV portfolio. The company has a global presence, including large-scale solar projects in Vietnam and Bangladesh.

The modules are available with peak outputs ranging from 520 W to 550 W, with a power conversion efficiency ranging from 20.18% to 21.03%.
The manufacturer claims the module’s advanced glass and cell surface textured design ensure excellent performance in a low-light environment. The open-circuit voltage is between 49.10 V and 49.70 V, and the short-circuit current is between 13.32 A to 13.82 A.
The panel measures 2,278 mm x 1,133 mm x 35 mm and weighs 28 kg. It features 3.2 mm tempered anti-reflective glass, a silver anodized aluminum alloy frame, and an IP68 enclosure rating. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has a Pmax temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius. Its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/10/study-finds-100-renewables-would-pay-off-within-6-years/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 10, 2022",Study finds 100% renewables would pay off within 6 years,"From pv magazine Global
As renewables come to represent a larger portion of the worldwide energy mix, and as targets are put in place to increase it further still, there are plenty of worries over the cost that radically changing our energy systems will entail. And the intermittent nature of wind and solar also creates concern about insufficient supply and possible blackouts.
The latest energy system models from Stanford University researcher Mark Jacobson, however, show that for 145 countries, the energy transition too 100% wind, water, solar and storage would pay for itself within six years, and ultimately cost less than continuing with the current energy systems.
“Worldwide, WWS reduces end use energy by 56.4%, private annual energy costs by 62.7% (from $17.8 to $6.6 trillion per year), and Social (private plus health plus climate) annual energy costs by 92.0% (from $83.2 to $6.6 trillion per year) at a present-value cost of $61.5 trillion,” Jacobson said in his most recent paper. “Thus, WWS requires less energy, costs less, and creates more jobs than business as usual.”
He described the model in “Low-cost solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy insecurity for 145 countries, which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science. It builds on Jacobson’s previous work by adding new countries, more recent energy consumption data from all regions, and calculations to deal with uncertainty in the future price of battery energy storage, the role batteries will play, and the development of newer technologies such as vehicle to grid. But despite these uncertainties, Jacobson is certain that technological barriers don’t present a major roadblock for the transition.
“(About) 95% of the technologies needed to implement the plans proposed are already commercialized,” he states.
The study also finds that, while jobs would be lost in the mining and fossil fuels segments, 28 million more jobs would be created than lost overall. Only Russia, Canada and parts of Africa are expected to see net job losses as a result, as these regions economies depend heavily on fossil fuels.
Though the study provides clear evidence that a full transition to 100% renewable energy is both technically and economically possible, Jacobson warns that plenty of uncertainty remains.
“Many additional uncertainties exist. One of the greatest is whether sufficient political will can be obtained to affect a transition at the rapid pace needed” he said. “However if political will can be obtained, then transitioning the world entirely to clean, renewable energy should substantially reduce energy needs, costs, air pollution mortality, global warming, and energy insecurity while creating jobs, compared with BAU.”
