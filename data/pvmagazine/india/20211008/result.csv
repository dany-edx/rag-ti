It recently signed the MoU with Tata Power to create a regular AC charging network and a DC fast-charging network at its locations across India. Under the MoU, the two companies will also explore opportunities to use solar energy to power select TVS Motor locations.
Customers of TVS iQube Electric shall also be able to access the widespread charging network by Tata Power through the TVS Motor customer connect app and Tata Power EZ Charge app. 
“TVS Motor Company has always been at the forefront of delivering green vehicles to our customers. This collaboration with Tata Power marks yet another significant milestone towards enabling a greener future for the country. Our partnership will substantially enhance customer convenience through world-class fast-charging solutions. TVS Motor is extremely excited and proud to be the pioneering partner with Tata Power, which is leading the way in creating a wide and sustainable charging infrastructure in the country. Fitting to TVS Motor’s vision of electrification, we envisage a wide and reliable charging infrastructure for two and three-wheeler EV customers across India, powered by renewable sources of energy such as solar,” said,Sudarshan Venu, joint managing director, TVS Motor Company.
“We are happy to join hands with TVS Motor, one of the leading two-wheeler manufacturers globally, to become their EV charging partner. Through this collaboration, we will further leverage our expertise to enhance synergy between sustainable mobility and renewable energy integration resulting in the creation of robust EV charging eco-system across India,” said,Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director, Tata Power.
The company’s MoU with Tata Power is in line with its commitment to expanding the presence of TVS iQube Electric in over 25 cities within the next few months. The electric scooter is presently available in Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Kochi, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Surat, Vizag, Jaipur, and Ahmedabad. 
Tata Power has an expansive network of over 5,000 home chargers and over 700 public chargers in more than 120 cities in India. The company is present across all segments of the EV eco-system– public charging, captive charging, home and workplace charging stations, and has deployed all types of chargers, including DC chargers and AC Chargers.

Called ENVIRO GTI 100 KT, the transformer accepts maximum input DC voltage of 1000V. The inverter offers an efficiency of 98.7%. It measures 99.5 cm x 69.3 cm x 36.8 cm and weighs 90 kg.
The inverter has up to ten independent maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs, with MPPT voltage ranging from 500V-850V. The maximum input current per MPPT is 26 A. 
Other features include a built-in DC switch for solar DC disconnection and smart forced air cooling. Consumers are provided free lifetime web- and app-based monitoring, with the WiFi/GPRS data logger having three months of storage.
The inverter can be operated under ambient temperature ranging from -25 to +60 degrees Celsius. The device features IP65 enclosures.
The inverter is IEC 62116, IEC 61727, IEC 61683, IEC 60068(1,2,14,30), IEC 62109-1/2, EN 61000-6-1,6-2,6-3,6-4 certified. It comes with a ten-year warranty.

Scientists from the University of California-Davis, Lancaster University, and Ludong University in China published research showing that utility-scale solar facilities can have a cooling effect not only on the land covered by the array, but also in the surrounding area.
Solar facilities were found to produce “cool islands” that extend up to 700 meters from the boundaries of the arrays. Land surface temperature was reduced by up to 2.3 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) at 100 meters away; the cooling effects tapered off exponentially to 700 meters.
Studies of two solar parks–the 300 MW Stateline project in California and the 850 MW Longyangxia project in China–were conducted using Landsat satellite images, an approach the researchers said had not previously been applied to solar. The study team compared land surface temperatures around solar facilities before and after they were built. The Stateline solar park measurements were supplemented with ground-collected data.
The researchers hypothesized that the cooling was caused by a combination of shading and insulating the land surface, and by the direct conversion of energy into electricity by the solar panels.

The study authors concluded the effect could have impact on local ecological processes. Productivity, decomposition, and ultimately the carbon balance could be skewed by the cooling. The scale of effect depends on location, and impacts could range from positive, negative, or inconsequential based on local ecosystems.
For example, in California’s Mojave Desert, lower surface temperatures leads to reduced germination rates and a loss of biodiversity. But, in the Tibetan Plateau, lower surface temperatures could potentially reduce the amount of methane lost to the atmosphere, said the scientists.
“This heightens the importance of understanding the implications of renewable energy technologies on the hosting landscape – we need to ensure that the energy transition does not cause undue damage to ecological systems and ideally has net positive consequences on the places where we build them,” said the research, which was published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Transition.
The studies were conducted in arid locations. The researchers said that further study is needed to determine the effect in more temperate climates.
