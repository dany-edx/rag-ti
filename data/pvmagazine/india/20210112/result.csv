The company, which is working on a range of smart, electric two-wheelers based on their in-house developed modular platform ‘OXEN,’ plans to utilize the funding towards its flagship electric scooter offering.
“We have been working on our product offering and the software around it for about four years now. This round of funding will be utilized for the final stages of product development and homologation of our flagship electric scooter,” said Shubham Jain, founder of TresMoto.
TresMoto is designing their scooters to be functional and minimal, optimized exclusively for fleet usage.
The flagship offering will be a sleek urban scooter with a top speed of 75 km/h and an array of compact, ergonomic batteries that can be removed from the vehicle and charged at home for a range of up to 90 km, which is more than enough for daily urban usage. For the weekend rider, the scooter can go further by carrying a range extender battery pack that fits snugly into the vehicle’s boot.  
The scooters will be driven by a software that can be updated over the air. A companion app will offer cutting-edge features like artificial intelligence (AI)-powered remote diagnosis, remote asset tracking, personalized rider profile and ride analytics. 
The modular EV platform ‘OXEN’ lets the company design new products with a fraction of resources and time. It can be adapted for scooters ranging from 2 to 15 bhp. Moreover, these scooters will be built in microfactories with a tiny footprint, which will allow the company to scale to multiple locations much faster and at a fraction of the cost. 
The company will do pilot testing with delivery and rental companies before launching its scooters into the consumer market.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/12/developers-body-seeks-wind-solar-hybrid-relaxations-in-maharashtras-re-policy/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,MAHARASHTRA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 12, 2021",Developers’ body seeks wind-solar hybrid relaxations in Maharashtra’s RE policy,"The National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) has sought relaxations for hybrid project deployment in Maharashtra as the state government has come up with a draft of its renewable energy (RE) policy.
Maharashtra’s ‘Unconventional Energy Generation Policy 2020’ proposes to deploy 17,385 MW of renewable power in the state by 2025, out of which 25 MW capacity will come from new technology-based renewables.  
In a letter written to the State’s Energy department, NSEFI, on behalf of independent power producers (IPPs), has sought a 15-year duty waiver on electricity generated from wind-solar hybrid projects, levy of transmission charges on the entire capacity instead of INR/kWh basis, and delinking of the secondary RE source capacity from the rated power capacity of the primary RE source.
Electricity duty  
Presently, Maharashtra provides a ten-year duty waiver on electricity generated from pure solar and wind projects under respective policies. 
NSEFI has sought a minimum 15-year duty waiver on electricity generated from hybrid projects, citing these projects as high capital-cost intensive compared to pure solar or wind. 
“Wind-solar hybrid projects (hybrid projects) involve complexities in design, project execution, operations and maintenance vis-à-vis pure-play solar or wind projects and therefore it may not be possible for a consumer to invest and maintain hybrid projects on its own and will have to rely only on established renewable energy developers who can provide clean energy to consumers in Maharashtra under third-party/captive-sale mode from hybrid projects,” NSEFI stated. 
Transmission charges 
NSEFI said the state government should encourage and promote new technologies, methods and solutions for optimal and efficient utilization of the transmission infrastructure, land, and other natural resources to facilitate the combined operation of wind and solar plants and promote integration with emerging technologies like energy storage systems. 
“One such way would be to do away with the existing mechanism of levying transmission charges on per unit basis and instead levy these transmission charges on the entire capacity. This will encourage developers to optimize their hybrid projects so that the cost of transmission charges gets minimized against the present mechanism wherein transmission charges are double that for conventional energy,” it suggested. 
Solar/wind ratio
NSEFI said that for the project to get recognized as wind-solar hybrid, secondary RE source capacity should not be linked with the rated power capacity of the primary RE source. Further, there should also not be any restriction on minimum storage capacity for an energy storage project with energy generation source.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/12/new-method-to-build-microgrids-based-on-solar-hydrogen/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MICROGRID,MINIGRID,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 12, 2021","New method to build microgrids based on solar, hydrogen","From pv magazine International
An international research team has developed a new energy management strategy to help manage oversupply in remote solar microgrids that rely on hydrogen fuel cells for backup power generation.
They demonstrated the model through the Transient System simulation program (TRNSYS) software on a PV system that was linked to a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. It provides electricity to the system when the load power exceeds the power generated by the PV plant. The 21.4 kW solar array has an annual power yield of 127.3 kW h/m2 under standard conditions.
“The total area of the PV power plant is approximately 205.3 m2, and the PV model of 100 Wp and a 1 m2 area is chosen,” the academics said. “The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is applied to the PV array to harvest the maximum PV power.”
The electrolyzer was designed with a capacity of 5 kW, which would be enough to absorb electricity generated by the solar plant and produce hydrogen for the fuel cell at times of intermittent PV power, the research group said.
‘”The electrolyzer efficiency in this model was 90%,” they explained. “The voltage of a single cell was 1.64 V for the 220-V stack voltage, which requires a total of 134 cells.”
This combination is able to produce hydrogen at seven bars and with high density. The hydrogen tank was sized at 22 cubic meters to store all the hydrogen production at 150 bars. The fuel cell was sized at the peak load power rate of 3 kW for on-peak loads.
The researchers conducted the simulations on a system in Beijing over a period of 12 months. Their project showed that the fuel cell operated at full capacity between March and September, when the PV system had higher energy production. The academics said the proposed system configuration and sizing ensured that the annual amount of hydrogen that was consumed would be the same as the annual amount that was produced.
“The results verify that the system was sized correctly,” the researchers said. “The overall system efficiency was estimated to be 47.9%, which was higher than that obtained in previous studies with the same configuration.”
They described the energy management system in “Efficient photovoltaics-integrated hydrogen fuel cell-based hybrid system: Energy management and optimal configuration,” which was recently published in the Journal of Sustainable Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/12/budget-expectations-for-solar-manufacturing/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MAKE IN INDIA,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",,"JANUARY 12, 2021",Budget expectations for solar manufacturing,"The Indian solar manufacturing sector is hopeful of targeted initiatives and policies for scaling-up the domestic solar manufacturing aligned to the 450 GW renewables by 2030 target as the Union Budget for the upcoming financial year 2021-22 is scheduled to be presented on February 1.
There is an immediate need to build a robust eco-system for indigenous solar manufacturing and make it cost-competitive to achieve the Government’s vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).
India needs a comprehensive policy framework encompassing both tariff and non-tariff barriers, long-term financial support and direct incentives to make the domestic solar industry cost-competitive. 
The finance ministry should consider 5% interest subvention on term loan and working capital, upfront central financial assistance of 30% on CAPEX, and increase in the export incentive from 2% to 8% under Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP), which will aid indigenous solar manufacturing.
The industry awaits the implementation of basic customs duty (BCD) with exemption to Special Economic Zone (SEZ) based solar manufacturers and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. 
Bringing down Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) for units operating in SEZs, extending Section 10 AA of Income Tax Act till March 31, 2022 for SEZ-based solar manufacturing unit, preferred interest rate support and priority lending support for manufacturing units, availability of National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) for expanding solar R&D are critical to augment domestic solar manufacturing.
Additionally, the Government should consider implementing tariff barriers like basic customs duty, safeguard duty, and anti-dumping duty for at least 4-5 years. 
Offering a capital subsidy of 50% for setting up R&D and quality testing infrastructure within the manufacturing units will help build scale. Also, a 200% super-deduction for the R&D expenditure on new and clean solar technology development should be allowed. 
India already offers a 200% super-deduction for the R&D expenditure in emerging areas such as biotechnology, which has led to the rapid growth of Indian biotech and pharma companies.
Implementing these policy recommendations will encourage economic recovery amidst the pandemic and provide an enabling eco-system to make India the global manufacturing hub for solar.
