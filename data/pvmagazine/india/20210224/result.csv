The bidding deadline, earlier set for February 24, has now been revised to March 10.
In a previous list of tender amendments, SECI had clarified the modules for the project must be domestically manufactured in India. This compliance, however, doesn’t apply to cells.
The tender inviting global bids was floated by SECI in December last year.
As per the tender document, the plant—to be set up in turnkey mode—shall come up at Phyang village in Leh district.
The work scope includes design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing, commissioning of the plant, and comprehensive operation and maintenance for ten years.
Only domestically manufactured bifacial mono-crystalline modules (with front-side efficiency ≥ 19.5%) are allowed for the project. The PV modules manufacturer should have supplied a minimum of 5 GW capacity globally or 500 MW in India in the last five years (as on the last date of bid submission).

The solar power generating systems—in sizes ranging from 2 MW to 10 MW—shall come up in Amravati, Yavatmal, Washim, Chandrapur, Wardha, Buldhana, and Bhandara districts.
The work scope includes design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing, commissioning, and 12 years of comprehensive operation and maintenance of the plants.
The projects should be designed to deliver electricity at the 11/22 kV level of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) substations.
CESL will provide the developed land plot for setting up the plants. 
The EPC work is to be completed within 180 days from the award of the contract.
To be eligible, the bidder should be a solar module manufacturer, grid-tied inverter manufacturer, or system integrator of solar power plants.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/24/bloombergnef-expects-up-to-209-gw-of-new-solar-for-this-year/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",BloombergNEF expects up to 209 GW of new solar for this year,"From pv magazine International
BloombergNEF has forecast that 2021 may become a record year for PV with over 200 GW of newly installed PV capacity.
In the latest 1Q 2021 Global PV Market Outlook, the analyst expects new PV additions for this year will range from 160 to 209 GW. For comparison, in 2020 and 2019, newly deployed solar had reached 135 and 118 GW, respectively.
Looking forward, BloombergNEF provides a conservative scenario and an optimistic one. Under the first scenario, new grid-connected PV systems are expected to total 160 GW this year and 163 and 179 MW in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Under the second scenario, new PV additions are predicted to reach 209 GW this year and 221 and 240 GW in the following two years, respectively.

The analyst’s report added, the 2,520 MW of large scale solar projects added last year accounted for 78% of installations. Some 719 MW of solar rooftop generation capacity made up the balance.
Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat led the large scale additions, contributing around 51% of installations.
“India’s solar installations in 2020 were the lowest in five years,” said Mercom Capital CEO Raj Prabhu. “While other top solar markets in the world have experienced positive growth, India, which had one of the most stringent lockdowns in response to the pandemic, took a while to get back up and running. However, we expect the industry to experience significant positive growth in 2021.”
Solar installations picked up in the second half of 2020 as economic activity resumed after the Covid-19 lockdown. Photovoltaic project additions in the fourth quarter stood at 1,505 MW, a 244% rise on the 438 MW seen in the July-to-September period.
Mercom India expects the nation to add more than 10 GW of solar this year.
“The solar industry has shown incredible resiliency amid all the chaos brought on by the pandemic,” said Prabhu. “The market is on the verge of experiencing two of its best years-to-date, in 2021 and 2022, unless further disruptions, in the form of ill-conceived policies, hurt growth.”
According to the report, India has a robust large scale solar project development pipeline of 47.5 GW, with another 24.5 GW of projects tendered and pending auction at the end of last year.
