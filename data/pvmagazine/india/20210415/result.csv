https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/15/renew-powers-us-585-million-green-bonds-list-on-india-inx/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 15, 2021",ReNew Power’s US$ 585-million green bonds list on India INX,"Bombay Stock Exchange-owned India International Exchange (INX) today said it had listed US$ 585 million in green bonds by India’s leading renewable energy producer ReNew Power. The bonds, issued by Renew Power’s ten subsidiaries, were listed exclusively on INX’ Global Securities Market (GSM) at the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) of the Gujarat International Finance Tech City (GIFT City).
The bonds have a maturity period of 7.25 years, and are assigned expected ratings of BB- (with a positive outlook) by Fitch Ratings and Ba3 rating by Moody’s investor services. These are priced competitively at 4.50% per annum.
Renew Power plans to utilize the proceeds to, among others, repay outstanding debt.
GSM, the primary market platform of India INX, has evoked significant interest since its establishment in 2018 and has more than US$ 50 billion medium-term notes established and over US$ 26 billion of bond listings to date.
Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Renew Power, said, “The success of our bond issue demonstrates continued global investor interest in the ESG space. Investors are keen to invest in environment friendly companies and projects that contribute towards a greener planet and enable India to meet its decarbonization goals. ReNew has raised nearly $1.37 billion dollars through bonds issued in the last six months.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/15/indias-electricity-generation-capacity-addition-in-fy2021-lowest-in-twelve-years/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 15, 2021",India’s electricity generation capacity addition in FY2021 lowest in twelve years,"India installed 9.7 GW of new power generation capacity during the April–February period of FY2020-21. This has been the lowest annualized addition in twelve years and nearly half of that in the same period of FY2019-20 (April- February), according to Care Ratings. 
Conventional energy sources recorded a sharper decline (54% y-o-y) in annual capacity addition than renewable energy (47% y-o-y). 
The analysts attributed the lower capacity addition to supply-side disruptions (which slowed movement of inputs and led to an increase in their prices), labor shortages, and the constrained finances and liquidity pressures faced by the developers triggered by the lockdown. Import restriction on the inputs aggravated the problems for solar power developers. 
Solar led the addition                                                                   
The nation added 6.2 GW of renewable energy generation capacity during April-February of FY2021 against 3.5 GW of conventional energy. 
Solar led the capacity addition, accounting for 48% (4.7 GW) of the 9.7 GW of new installation (renewable plus conventional). 
The cumulative solar power generation capacity currently stands at 39 GW. Coal-based power, which is the dominant source of electricity in the country with 53% of the total generation capacity, added 3.1 GW to generation capacity in the eleven months to February 2021, taking its total installed capacity to 201 GW. 
Of the total domestic electricity generation capacity of 379 GW, the installed capacity of conventional energy is 286 GW (75% share in total) and that of renewable energy 93 GW (25% share).

Researchers at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) have demonstrated a p-type back junction (BJ) front/back‐contacted (FBC) crystalline silicon solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.0% and a fill factor (FF) of 84.3%.
Presented in the study Design rules for high-efficiency both-sides-contacted silicon solar cells with balanced charge carrier transport and recombination losses, recently published in nature energy, the device demonstrates the high performance of the reported back junction solar cell design with a full-area p-n-junction at the back surface, according to the scientists. “Currently, we are working on commercial production technologies to realize such cells at low cost,” research co-author, Armin Richter, told pv magazine.
The cell was built with a full-area passivating contact based on Fraunhofer ISE’s TOPCon technology at the back surface and a highly transparent front surface based on dielectric passivation layers. Compared to conventional industrial cells with a front side p–n junction, the cell features a p–n junction at the back surface in the form of a full-area polycrystalline silicon-based passivating contact.
