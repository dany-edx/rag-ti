The Union Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy R.K. Singh recently chaired a meeting regarding the use of green hydrogen in conjunction with other modes such as solar energy and wind energy, for round-the-clock renewable energy.
The officials had detailed discussions on the various potential options for using green hydrogen as a storage medium for supporting round-the-clock power and peak power demand. The meeting also discussed various government support mechanisms for such projects. The policy mechanisms being considered include one based on the Contract for Difference (CfD) methodology, which is based on the difference between the market price and an agreed “strike price”.
The Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy gave directions to the officials to draft the scheme guidelines, based on the economics, technologies, and current and future market conditions of the green hydrogen and power sector. The Minister underlined the growing power demand and the importance of round-the-clock renewable energy in reducing the cost of renewable energy and making it affordable.
The Minister stated that learnings from the first such project will be used to undertake bigger projects in the future.
Zaha Hadid Architects has unveiled hydrogen refueling stations for marinas in Italy – the world’s first green hydrogen refueling network for recreational boating. NatPower will invest €100 million ($107 million) in the project, to be launched at 25 marinas and ports. The architecture firm said it will start installing green hydrogen infrastructure this summer, with plans to set up 100 refueling stations across the Mediterranean over the next six years, delivering up to 3,650 tons of hydrogen per year. It saied the stations will be built using low-carbon concrete via a 3D-printing process.
A German-Czech consortium has revealed plans to manufacture a drivable hydrogen motorcycle by the end of 2025, in line with European standards. The Czech partners will focus on vehicle development, while the German partners will concentrate on the drivetrain, with WätaS Wärmetauscher Sachsen GmbH developing fuel cell stacks and Fraunhofer IWU supporting production technology and stack functionality enhancement.
NTPC Green Energy Ltd. (NGEL) and the government of the Indian state of Maharashtra have agreed to jointly develop green hydrogen and derivatives with a capacity of up to 1 million tons per year. The plan includes 2 GW of pumped hydro projects and up to up to 5 GW of renewable energy installations, with or without storage. The potential investment could reach INR 800 million ($9.63 million).
Nikola has opened its first HYLA hydrogen refueling station in southern California. The Arizona-based company said that the facility, which includes an advanced modular fueler, marks the latest step in its plans to offer hydrogen refueling solutions for Class 8 trucks.
Spain could produce up to 2.5 million metric tons of green hydrogen per year by 2030, with an electrolysis capacity of 23.3 GW, said Arturo Gonzalo, the CEO of Enagas. This projection exceeds the current demand for green hydrogen in Spain, which is approximately 1 metric ton (MT) per year, surpassing the annual consumption of gray hydrogen at 600,000 tons. In the maximum potential scenario, production could reach 7.9 MT per year, with an electrolysis capacity of 74.3 GW, and consumption at 1.4 MT per year. The baseline scenario suggests a production of 1.6 MT per year, an electrolysis capacity of 13.4 GW, and a consumption forecast of 1 MT per year.

Germany-based PV manufacturer Bauer Solar has warned that its solar modules have been counterfeited. A number of European customs authorities have informed the company about several containers of fake Bauer Solar products now in circulation in Europe.
Bauer Solar said that a Chinese company made the counterfeits and shipped them to Europe. These are purportedly Bauer Solar’s glass-glass modules, with a power output of 420 W.
The manufacturer said there are subtle differences in the packaging, which may be difficult to recognize. The counterfeit versions also lack wooden reinforcements at the bottom of the pallets, which is the usual way to transport Bauer Solar’s glass-glass solar modules.
The authorities confiscated unregistered deliveries during customs inspections, prompting Bauer Solar to take legal action against the counterfeiters.
The counterfeit modules have not undergone any quality controls by accredited testing bodies and therefore do not have certifications, according to Bauer Solar. As a result, the counterfeiters and also the buyers are at risk and liable to prosecution for aiding and abetting product counterfeiting and piracy, it said.
Bauer Solar has asked dealers and installers to exercise particular caution and report counterfeit goods to its team. The fake modules are being offered at very low prices, so “dumping prices should be seen as an alarm signal,” it said. It added that it is seeking additional information on the matter.

5,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/07/the-impact-of-climate-based-pv-panel-degradation-rates-on-inverters/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-07,The impact of climate-based PV panel degradation rates on inverters,"Scientists at Belgium’s Hasselt University have discovered that climate-based solar module degradation rates could have a significant impact on power electronics in PV systems.
In the study “Assessing the impact of PV panel climate-based degradation rates on inverter reliability in grid-connected solar energy systems,” which was recently published in Heliyon, the academics warned that using similar climate-based degradation rates for PV systems in all climate zones worldwide represents an “unrealistic approximation” that can lead to misleading results. “This can result in the over- or underestimation of PV lifetime and subsequently impact the power electronics reliability estimations,” they added.
The research group evaluated the panel degradation rates based on climatic stresses in three distinct geographical locations: Genk in Belgium, Accra in Ghana, and Kabd in Kuwait. These locations represent moderate, hot and humid, and hot and dry climates, respectively.
It used a physics-based approach that considered meteorological data such as ambient temperature, irradiance, wind speed, and direction, as well as material properties like optical, thermal, and electrical constants, and thicknesses of each layer in the module. It also took into account panel parameters such as temperature coefficients, external quantum efficiency, and interconnect layout.
The researchers explained that insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), which are the switching devices in the PV inverter, are extremely sensitive to high temperatures and, without proper management, can lead to failures or reduced lifespan.
“Every time that an IGBT is turned on, there will be power losses generated inside the material layers, and these power losses can generate heat inside the IGBT,” they explained. “Consequently, each activation induces a thermal cycle attributed to these power losses.”
The team analyzed the potential degradation rates in a standard 4 kW PV system including a DC-DC boost converter and a single-phase inverter using four IGBTs with a voltage rating of 700 V and a current rating of 40 A. It considered a scenario without solar module intrinsic degradation rate and a scenario taking into account intrinsic PV degradation rate.
Through a series of simulations, the researchers found that the inverter in the PV system located in Kabd has a much shorter lifespan than inverters located in Genk and Accra.
“The PV inverter in Kabd experiences substantial thermal stresses without the effects of PV degradation, and the IGBT may fail in just 5 years, leading to PV inverter failure in just 3.8 years,” they stressed. “With the introduction of linear PV degradation, the PV inverter’s lifespan in Kabd will increase to 5.8 years, but still falls short of the other two locations. The physics-based PV degradation model will raise Kabd’s lifespan to around 6.5 years.”
The group concluded that deploying PV systems in hot and arid climates could require different parameters for inverter design. “These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating various factors and parameters when assessing the reliability of a PV inverter and its switching device,” it stated.

8,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/07/long-duration-storage-market-to-hit-223-billion-in-20-years-says-idtechex/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-07,"Long-duration storage market to hit $223 billion in 20 years, says IDTechEx","Variable renewable energy (VRE) generation sources like solar and wind are expected to increasingly move toward being the dominant source of electricity globally by mid-century. With the variability of intermittent cycles of electricity generation provided by these sources, energy storage is needed to ensure a stable, balanced supply. 
Demand response programs, distributed home batteries, vehicle-to-grid storage, community level batteries, and many other technologies will play a role in balancing the variable renewables-dominated grid. Along with these technologies is the rise in demand for long duration energy storage (LDES), which typically can store and dispatch electricity for six hours or more. 
A report from IDTechEx modeled growth with LDES, projecting that there may be a $223 billion global market by 2044. The report said this market growth will regionally happen at different rates. For instance, if California reaches its clean energy targets for 2035, it will have a 280% increase in the capacity of renewable energy compared to a 2023 baseline. Other key countries and US states expected to see rapid growth of VRE deployments include Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, India, and Texas, according to the report. 
“Increased VRE penetration will result in longer periods of time when energy is unavailable from these sources, and thus, LDES technologies will be required to dispatch energy over these longer timeframes,” said the report. 
IDTechEx said that once a country or state’s electricity from VRE sources reaches about 45% of the energy mix, the average duration of storage of six hours or more becomes the most cost-optimal option. The report said this 45% threshold will be met on average globally by the late 2030s, though the previously-mentioned hot markets are expected to reach the milestone sooner. 
Aside from pumped hydrogen, which is dependent on local running water sources, lithium-ion batteries dominate the global stationary energy storage market, said the report. However, IDTechEx notes that lithium-ion batteries are unlikely to have low enough capital costs for LDES applications. 
To achieve a lower cost-per-kilowatt-hour, IDTechEx recommends technologies that allow for energy and power decoupling. It said this role could be served by redox flow batteries (RFB). 
“To increase system capacity for RFBs, electrolyte volume and the size of electrolyte storage tanks can be increased, whereas changes to the cell-stack are only needed to increase power output,” said the report. 
IDTechEx said liquid-air energy storage (LAES) is another alternative that may come with cost advantages at scale. 
“For LAES, the size of liquid-air storage tanks can be increased, while turbomachinery only needs to be scaled with power output,” said the report. “This results in faster and non-linear decreases in capex (on a $/kWh basis) for many of these LDES technologies as a function of duration of storage.”
Other technologies evaluated in the report include iron-air (Fe-air), rechargeable zinc batteries (Zn-air, Zn-ion, rechargeable Zn-MnO2, Zn-Br), high-temperature / molten-salt batteries, RFBs, (CAES), liquid-air energy storage (LAES), cryogenic / liquid-CO2 energy storage (LCES), alternative and underground pumped hydro storage (APHS), gravitational energy storage systems (GESS), thermal and electro-thermal energy storage (TES) and (ETES), and hydrogen.
The author of the report – Conrad Nichols, a technology analyst for IDTechEx – will host a free webinar on Feb. 8 titled “The Time for Long Duration Energy Storage is Coming.” The registration link can be found here.
