According to OPIS data, prices have momentarily stabilized at their lowest levels ever this week – Mono M10 and G12 cell prices stayed unchanged at $0.0814 per W and $0.0836/W, respectively; TOPcon M10 cell price this week likewise remained at $0.0856/W.
The majority of industry sources concurred that following the holiday, new record lows for cell prices can be expected. A seller source predicts that the price of P-type M10 cells will decline to around CNY 0.61 ($0.085)/W after the holiday, while the price of TOPCon M10 cells will continue to carry a CNY0.05 ($0.0069)/W premium over p-type M10 cells.

The pricing differential between p-type and n-type M10 cells is confirmed by a second seller source, who predicts that after the holiday, p-type M10 cells may drop to around CNY0.63 ($0.088)/W while TOPCon M10 cells would drop to CNY0.68 ($0.094)/W
According to a market observer, cell producers are currently maintaining a profit margin of about 10-15%. This source therefore expected that there is still room for cell prices to decrease after the holiday.
Insiders anticipate a fall in cell prices, mostly as a result of a decline in demand for cells from downstream module producers due to certain module makers curtailing production. Additionally, module prices are also in the bearish sentiments due to the severe oversupply, as a result, cell prices will inescapably be influenced by downstream pessimism.
A source from an integrated player, on the other hand, expressed skepticism over the prediction that cell prices will continue decreasing following the holiday. “After all, the price of cells has already decreased by about 14% over the last three weeks, which is a significant amount,” the source explained.
The price of polysilicon has a significant role in determining how much cell price will drop after the holiday, a source from a specialized cell manufacturer concluded. There isn’t much room for wafer and cell prices to decrease at present. More significant price cuts must wait until polysilicon’s price drop frees up price reduction space for wafers and cells, the source added.

The project aims to capture 1.5 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of CO2, bringing ADNOC’s carbon capture investment to nearly 4 mtpa, with CO2 captured, transported onshore, stored underground, and low-carbon hydrogen production for emissions reduction. ADNOC awarded $17 billion in contracts, including the first EPC contract for offshore facilities to a joint venture between National Petroleum Construction Company and Saipem and another for onshore scope, including CO2 and sulfur recovery, to Tecnimont.
Essar Oil UK has chosen Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as the technology license partner for its CCS project, the EET Industrial Carbon Capture facility in Stanlow, furthering investments in CCS, hydrogen, and biofuels.
Iveco and Hyundai have revealed the first Iveco Bus E-way H2, a 12-meter low-floor city bus equipped with a 310-kW e-motor and an advanced fuel cell system from Hyundai’s HTWO. The bus features four hydrogen tanks with a total storage capacity of 7.8 kg and a 69 kWh battery pack by FPT Industrial. Production will take place in Annonay, France, and Foggia, Italy, offering a driving range of 450 km under typical operating conditions.
The government of the Philippines has invited all interested parties to provide feedback on the proposed Department Circular regarding a national policy framework for hydrogen in the energy sector. The government noted a preference for hydrogen and its derivatives production from renewables, providing details on funding opportunities as part of the nation’s efforts to establish a policy framework and support infrastructure.
Everfuel and Hy24 have successfully completed the establishment of their joint venture, with Everfuel owning 51% and the Hy24-managed Clean Hydrogen Infrastructure Fund holding 49%. The venture will finance electrolyzer capacity development across the Nordics, focusing on the EU market. The first acquisition by the venture is Everfuel’s HySynergy Phase 1 flagship project, valued at €26.9 million ($28.3 million) with a debt-free asset value of €44.9 million.
Alstom has unveiled the hydrogen-powered Coradia Stream train in collaboration with Italy’s local public transport company, FNM. The train is set to commence commercial operations in Valcamonica between late 2024 and early 2025 along the non-electrified Brescia-Iseo-Edolo line, currently operated by Trenord. This initiative is a key component of the H2iseO project, aimed at establishing Italy’s inaugural Hydrogen Valley in Brescia, northern Italy. The hydrogen-powered Coradia Stream boasts a total seating capacity of 260 and an impressive range exceeding 600 km.
