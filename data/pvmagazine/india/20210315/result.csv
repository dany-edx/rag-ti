Located in Rajasthan, a desert state with the highest irradiation in India, Sitara solar project has an estimated cost of US$ 67 million. The construction of the solar farm started last year, and it is expected to start producing power by June end this year.
Sitara Solar secured a 20-year loan from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) through a 75:25 debt-to-equity financing scheme.
This is a major milestone for UPC-AC Energy Solar, a joint venture of the two developers, as it targets to build more than 1 GW of solar energy portfolio in the next few years, with an initial focus on India, South Korea and Taiwan.
UPC-AC Energy Solar won the power supply agreement for the 100 MW solar project in March 2019, at a tariff of INR 2.48 per kWh fixed over 25 years.
Pranab Kumar Sarmah, CEO of UPC-AC Energy Solar and co-founder of UPC Solar Asia Pacific, said, “We are very thrilled with this financial close during the current challenging environment, where we were able to meet DFC’s high standards for environmental and social compliances.”
This project milestone is the latest in AC Energy’s string of initiatives to sustain its growth momentum and expand its renewables capacity in the Asia Pacific region.
“We are well-positioned to establish a meaningful presence in India and contribute to the country’s renewable energy goals, bringing a total of 450 MW of solar projects under construction and in the pipeline with our partner, UPC Renewables,“ said Patrice Clausse, Chief Operating Officer of AC Energy International. “These sustainable developments highlight our commitment to support the country’s aim to source over 60% of energy capacity from renewable sources in 10 years.”
Sitara Solar will supply energy to the government-owned Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), which facilitates the purchase and resale of electricity of solar projects to the benefit of the distribution companies across various states. SECI received a credit rating of AA+ from ICRA Limited on January 2021.

German solar manufacturer Autarq has announced it will ramp up the capacity of its solar tile manufacturing facility in the eastern German city of Prenzlau, where production started in 2018.
The company says its products have already been used on 205 rooftops in Germany. “The projects range in size from 5 to 8 kW,” a spokesperson from Autarq told pv magazine.
The price for end customers is between €25 and €30 per tile. According to Autarq, a rooftop incorporating its monocrystalline solar tiles may be able to cover up to 70 percent of the electricity requirements of a single-family home.
Each tile has a power output of 10 to 12.5 W, depending on the size, and a power density of 127–135 W per square meter. According to the company, a 5 kW installation would require approximately 500 tiles for a total surface of around 40 m².
Visually, the photovoltaic roof tiles can hardly be distinguished from the original roof tiles. There are also no differences in weight, which is why the roof statics are not affected, according to the manufacturer.
The company also claims that the tile and the PV unit are connected to form a robust component, so that the water flow and tightness of the roofs are preserved. Cables and plug contacts are located under the roof cladding and are thus protected against the effects of the weather.
Autarq also specifies that a photovoltaic system built with the tile is insensitive to shading due to the parallel connection. Skylights, chimneys, ventilation pipes or antennas would also have little influence on the installation and efficient operation of the systems.
The tiles come with a 25-year performance guarantee.

Presenting the budget, chief minister Manohar Lal said the Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited (HPGCL) would develop 77 MW solar power plants on HPGCL land and 16 MW on land owned by village councils (panchayats).
Further, Panchkula will be developed as a solar city with a target of meeting its 20% energy requirement from solar/renewable energy sources.
The last budget had announced a scheme to install 50,000 off-grid solar pumps of 3 HP to 10 HP capacity in the State, under which 15,000 solar pumps were to be installed in the first phase and 35,000 in the second phase. The minister said the State government has started implementing the programme with a 75% subsidy, of which 30% subsidy is provided as central financial assistance under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Surksha Evam Utthan Mahabhiyaan (PM-KUSUM) Scheme and 45% from the State.
Further, the State government has planned to install a cumulative solar capacity of 1991 KW for 330 Gaushalas (cow shelters) in the State. During 2020-21, plants of about 420 KW capacity are being installed in 80 cow shelters. Another 1200 KW capacity is planned for 2021-22.
To promote micro irrigation and utilize the treated waste water from 35 existing sewage treatment plants, a project for installing community-based solar-/grid-powered integrated micro-irrigation infrastructure has also been approved under the Micro Irrigation Fund of NABARD.
The minister said the state government is making concerted efforts to reduce aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses by the DISCOMs. During the last five years, AT&C losses were reduced from 30.02% in 2015-16 to 17.17% in 2019-20.
