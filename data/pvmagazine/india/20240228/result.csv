7,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/28/first-attempt-to-design-cigs-swcnt-tandem-solar-cells-promises-38-91-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-28,First attempt to design CIGS/SWCNT tandem solar cells promises 38.91% efficiency,"Scientists led by the M.M.M. University of Technology, Gorakhpur in India have developed a tandem solar cell based on a copper, indium, gallium and diselenide (CIGS) top cell and a bottom cell relying on a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) absorber.
“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build tandem solar cells based on CIGS and SWCNT,” the research’s corresponding author, Alok Patel, told pv magazine. “In the top cell, we used an ultra-thin WSeTe, which is a compound belonging to the transition metal dichalcogenide group, as a buffer layer to reduce the absorption loss. In the bottom cell, we used a buffer layer made of zirconium disulfide (ZrS2), which also belongs to the transition metal dichalcogenide group.”
SWCNTs were previously used in solar research as an alternative to conventional metal grid contacts or hole transport layers (HTLs), as they are said to combine optoelectronic properties, flexibility, chemical stability, and simple transfer protocols to cover large surface areas.
In the study “Design and performance investigation of CIGS/SWCNT tandem solar cell for efficiency improvement,” published in Optics Communication, the research group explained that they numerically optimized the solar cell via the SCAPS–1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel thin-film cell design.
The academics designed the top cell with a CIGS as an absorber, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on WSeTe, an aluminum contact, and a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO). As for the bottom cell, it was planned to rely on the SWCNT absorber, the ZrS2 buffer layer, and a window layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). The bottom cell has a bandgap of 1.24 eV and the upper device of 1.18 eV, which the scientists said ensures that the bottom device absorbs the higher wavelengths that are transferred from the upper cell.
The CGIS cell with a 2,000 nm thick absorber achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 23.69%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.7437 V, a short-circuit current density of 40.25 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 79.15%. The SWCNT device with a 2,000 nm thick absorber achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 17.10%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.5653 V, a short-circuit current density of 40.36 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 74.96%.
For the tandem cell, the scientists used a version of the CIGS cell with a 22.82% efficiency and a sample of the SWCNT device with an efficiency of 16.05% efficiency, with its combined efficiency reaching 38.91%. “This research work can help in the fabrication of efficient tandem PV cells based on CIGS and SWCNT materials,” the researchers said.

8,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/28/pv-modules-now-selling-in-europe-for-e0-10-w-to-e0-115-w/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-28,PV modules now selling in Europe for €0.10/W to €0.115/W,"From pv magazine Global
Solar modules are currently being sold in Europe for €0.10 ($0.1085)/W for non-tier-1 products and €0.115/W for tier-1 panels, according to Leen van Bellen, business development manager Europe for Search4Solar, a Europe-based purchasing platform for solar panels, inverters and battery solutions.
“We are currently receiving many requests for fast delivery and there is now considerably less stock in Europe,” he told pv magazine, noting that the module market in Europe is currently benefiting from a pull effect instead of a push effect. “Modules sold from European stocks or coming directly from China are now being sold at the same price levels.”
He pointed to a likely departure from the stock levels of 2023 and predicted a temporary shift toward built-to-order (BTO) practices.
“However, I expect that sales will lag behind due to the limited availability of the panels, resulting in more stock being shipped to Europe in a more controlled manner,” he said.
Van Bellen noted that PERC panels still account for around 75% of current panel demand in Europe, with the remaining percentage mostly represented by TOPCon products.
“Based on the trends observed in 2023, TOPCon is poised for further growth and it appears that TOPCon cell technology will overtake traditional PERC and become the new mainstream technology by 2024,” he said. “Especially when the production and stock of the PERC module decrease and the n-Type wafers become cheaper in the long term, TOPCon will boom.”
He noted that he sometimes hears queries about heterojunction (HJT) or interdigitated back contact (IBC) products.
“This does not alter the fact that we do offer them and customers also buy them, but often not specifically because of the intrinsic qualities of HJT or IBC modules, but because of availability and price,” he said. “So, their market share will increase gradually.”
Van Bellen said he expects a vacuum in European stocks and price increases due to the interplay of supply and demand.
“Manufacturers are extremely cautious after the last quarter of 2023 and some are too cautious and maintain lead times of two to three months,” he stated. “This has a positive effect on those who dare to keep stocks.”
Van Bellen expects module prices may increase by up to 5% per month in the future. “This may vary depending on the brands and the power class,” he added. “And if the customer doesn’t want alternatives, the price increase from current levels may be of up to 20%.”
