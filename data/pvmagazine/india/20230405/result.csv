Methanol (CH3OH) is a cleaner alternative fuel that can be used for various purposes, including power generation and transportation. The methanol synthesis plant at NTPC’s Vindhyachal thermal power plant will convert 20 tonnes-per-day (tpd) of CO2 to 10 tpd methanol through a catalytic hydrogenation process, utilizing CO2 from thermal plant flue gas through a carbon capture unit and green hydrogen produced by electrolysis.
Jakson Green will oversee the entire design, engineering, procurement, and construction of this project on a turnkey basis, in partnership with NTPC and their Japanese technology provider for the methanol synthesis process. 
Bikesh Ogra, CEO and managing director of Jakson Green, said, “Methanol production is a key element in India’s transition to a low-carbon economy, and we are proud to be at the forefront of the movement. We are thankful to NTPC for giving us an opportunity to partner with them in developing this useful hydrocarbon and propagating its widespread use for a cleaner and greener world. We are confident that this methanol synthesis plant built in association with NTPC will strengthen India’s vision of becoming a methanol economy, which will, in turn, reduce India’s dependence on crude oil imports and mitigate the pollution.”

The project will meet the substation’s auxiliary consumption requirement.
The BESS solution, coupled with solar generation, will not only help IndiGrid to reduce the environmental impact of its operations but also act as a prototype for expanding its presence in energy transition opportunities in the sector.
Harsh Shah, chief executive officer of IndiGrid, said, “This facility will also act as a test bed for augmenting our capabilities to participate in energy transition opportunities in solar and BESS space. As the operations at this project stabilize, we look forward to replicating similar systems across our other substations and reducing emissions of our operations.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/05/australian-manufacturer-reveals-1-mwh-sodium-chloride-battery-design/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 5, 2023",Australian manufacturer reveals 1 MWh sodium chloride battery design,"From pv magazine Global
Perth-based Altech Batteries has unveiled the design for a new 1 MWh GridPack non-lithium battery energy storage system. It developed it for the renewable energy and grid storage market, as part of its joint venture collaboration with German research organization Fraunhofer IKTS.
The launch of the “plug-and-play” GridPack comes just six months after the two sides signed a joint venture agreement to commercialize Fraunhofer’s Cerenergy sodium alumina solid state battery technology, which relies on sodium ions commonly found in table salt and avoids using rare and expensive metals such as lithium, cobalt, graphite and copper. Altech Batteries said the technology eliminates exposure to critical metal price rises and supply chain concerns. Fraunhofer has estimated that the cost of producing Cerenergy batteries should be about 40% cheaper than lithium-ion batteries, which currently dominate the global energy storage market.
The joint venture is commercializing the sodium chloride battery technology, with plans to construct a 100 MWh production facility on Altech’s land in Germany. It is anticipated that the facility will produce 10,000 individual 10 kWh Cerenergy battery modules every year to provide grid storage solutions to the market.
While the development of the manufacturing facility continues, the companies have now launched the design of the 1.0 MWh GridPack. Each GridPack, to be housed in standard shipping containers, will feature to 20 individual 60 kWh battery packs connected to a power management system. Each unit will have a distinct rating of 600 V (DC) and 100 amp hours and will be able to be arranged in a series to achieve the required rating of several thousand kW for grid functioning.
Altech said the GridPacks are modular and stackable, which reduces their footprint, and have a “plug-and-play” feature that makes them easy to install in remote locations. The company said there are no moving parts such as cooling fans and the batteries can operate in any climate without need for thermal management – a key advantage of sodium-alumina solid state batteries over lithium-ion alternatives.
With a projected lifespan of more than 15 years and unlimited cycling, Altech said it is confident that the technology will become the “preferred choice” for companies seeking a reliable and long-lasting energy storage solution.
“These 1 MWh GridPacks will offer significant benefits for the fast-growing renewable energy and grid storage sectors,” the company said. “They are an excellent means of stabilising the grid by providing a source  of  backup  power  during  periods  of  high  demand  or  when  renewable  energy  sources  are  not producing at capacity. They are also a cost-effective solution for storing and distributing renewable energy across a variety of applications, including grid-scale storage, microgrids, and electric vehicle charging.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/05/dah-solar-unveils-solar-kit-for-balconies-rooftops/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 5, 2023","DAH Solar unveils solar kit for balconies, rooftops","From pv magazine Global
Chinese solar module maker DAH Solar has released an integrated PV system for residential applications. The turnkey system features a plug-in connection that makes it suitable for balconies.
“SolarUnit is like a PV module with an alternating current output, ready to be connected to the electrical grid,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “The bus is formed by a trunk cable supplied by DAH Solar. The trunk cable has spaced tap connectors to allow sequential connection and electrical parallelism of multiple SolarUnits.”
The system can be used with up to six special panels manufactured by DAH Solar itself. The “Full-Screen PV Modules” are available with power outputs of 460 W and 550 W and a power conversion efficiency rating of up to 21.3%. They feature 3.2 mm anti-reflective glass and an IP68 enclosure, with a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius. The operational temperature of the panels ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
It also uses micro-inverters with an efficiency of up to 97.2% and a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency of 99.95%. The device measures 412 mm × 97 mm × 42.5mm and weighs 1.8 kg. The kits can reach a maximum size of 2,279 mm × 1,134 mm × 32mm and a maximum weight of up to 59.8 kg.
“The Full-Screen PV Module and microinverter are integrated when they leave the factory,” the spokesperson said. “SolarUnit could achieve great flexibility for projects because it makes the possibility to install PV modules in different orientations and with different angles of inclination, following the designs of the roofs.”
DAH Solar also offers an energy communication unit (ECU) unit with the system. It communicates with the microinverters through the power line communication (PLC) system. It uses the power cable itself to exchange information.
“The ECU unit allows remote monitoring of the PV system, in addition to allowing the PV system to be turned off with remote control by your electrical devices such as smartphones and PCs,” said the spokesperson.
DAH Solar is based in Hefei, China’s Anhui province. It currently operates a 2 GW solar panel factory.
