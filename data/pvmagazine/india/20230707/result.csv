China Mono Grade, the OPIS assessment for polysilicon prices in the country, held steady at CNY62 ($8.56)/kg on July 4. What looks like a moment of calm – arresting almost six months of successive, sometimes-dramatic downslides – reflects a market busily assessing what happens next.
Industry players diverged on where they saw prices heading after an important polysilicon conference in China last week, with bearishness as the predominant mood. Low values around the CNY60/kg mark, generally regarded as China polysilicon’s cost figure, continued to be the majority of figures revealed during OPIS’ market survey early this week, although talk of a price rebound has emerged.

A source who saw polysilicon climb to CNY67/kg read the lower prices of the prior two weeks as manufacturers are clearing inventories before the second quarter ended. One polysilicon maker’s inventory, estimated at 10,000 MT last week, was said to have halved by the week’s end. Power cuts have affected the operating rates of monocrystalline plants, a source said, noting cuts in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, and claiming the same in Leshan, Sichuan.
Discussions of price upticks even extended downstream. Wafer prices have found their bottom, concurred most market participants, and the wafer segment is starting to signal possible notches up to come. Numerous sources confirmed to OPIS that limited new wafer capacity will come online in the second half of 2023, potentially keeping more than 140 GW of annual nameplate capacity off the market, according to OPIS data.
Chatter aside, the specter of oversupply continues to loom over the China polysilicon market. “It is obvious that polysilicon is in excess,” one contact reiterated, while another said that overall “stockpiles are very large.” A major producer’s new June capacity of around 120,000 MT has been delayed, but only till the third quarter.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

Researchers at the University of Ottawa in Canada have defined a series of formulae for ground coverage ratios (GCRs) in utility scale solar power plants.
In the study “Optimal ground coverage ratios for tracked, fixed-tilt, and vertical photovoltaic systems for latitudes up to 75°N,” published in Solar Energy, the scientists said the new guidelines are applicable to projects based on both monofacial and bifacial modules that are located at latitudes between 17°N and 75°N.
They selected, in particular, 31 locations in Mexico, the United States, and Canada.
“Where possible, the locations represent multiple diffuse fractions within a given latitude range, with diffuse fraction defined as the annually-averaged ratio of diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) to global horizontal irradiance (GHI),” they specified. “The analysis we have presented has been conducted for North American locations, but covers a wide range of operating conditions, including diffuse fractions between 0.23 and 0.55, average GHI-weighted ambient temperatures of −4 C to 31 C, average GHI-weighted albedos between 0.10 and 0.65, and city elevations between 1 and 1600 m.”
The Canadian group used PV performance prediction software Duet, an open-access cloud-based solar project designing tool developed by the University of Ottawa itself, to create 3D models including mounting structures and multiple rows.
“Optical calculations are then completed considering direct beam radiation, anisotropic diffuse sky radiation, and ground-reflected radiation by segmenting the modules, ground, and diffuse sky-dome into patches,” the researchers explained. “A shading algorithm is implemented using a deterministic ray intersection method to capture the effect of objects in the 3D scene.”
The academics said that Duet software is able to translate the irradiance profiles into per-timestep cell I–V curves through a temperature and irradiance-dependent single-diode model, noting that they calculated the effect of ground coverage ratios between 0 and 1 on both monofacial and bifacial fixed-tilt and horizontal single-axis tracked (HSAT) systems.
The research group found that GCR may vary consistently between 0.15–0.68 for fixed-tilt systems and less significantly between 0.17–0.32 for HSAT systems, and said for both cases values depend strongly on latitude. “Similarly, the optimal tilt of fixed-tilt arrays varies widely from 7° above latitude-tilt to 60° below latitude-tilt, depending on the latitude and GCR,” it highlighted, adding that vertical systems are less sensitive to latitude.
The scientists also found that bifacial PV systems require GCRs up to 0.03 lower than monofacial GCRs. “Since latitude was the dominating factor affecting inter-row energy yield loss, our results should provide an estimate of the performance of equivalent PV arrays across the globe,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/07/india-drafts-rd-roadmap-for-green-hydrogen-ecosystem/,"ELECTROLYZER,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 7, 2023",India drafts R&D roadmap for green hydrogen ecosystem,"India’s ministry of new and renewable energy  (MNRE) has released a draft R&D roadmap for the green hydrogen ecosystem. The roadmap recommends research and development actions to improve the efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of green hydrogen production, storage, and transportation as the nation aims to become a global hub of green hydrogen.
“Hydrogen technologies across the value chain are currently under development. Mature technologies like electrolyzers, fuel cells, and carbon composite cylinders are not yet cost-competitive with alternatives; other upcoming technologies promising lower costs are yet to prove long-term performance. The aim is to design affordable, efficient, safe, and reliable pathways,” states the draft document.
The draft roadmap—prepared by experts from the government, industry, and academia—recommends R&D priorities with respective performance targets under three categories: mission mode, grand challenge, and blue sky.
In mission mode, early-stage research action with a 0-5 years impact horizon will be taken up. The draft recommends low PGM catalyst/electrode development for reduced cost, improved performance, and increased durability of PEM electrolyzers; AEM electrocatalyst development with faster oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and catalyst activity; and development of SOEC electrolyzers and feedstock-agnostic biomass gasification technology for hydrogen production on mission mode.
In the grand challenge category, projects with a mid-term (0 – 8 years) impact horizon will be taken up with a focus on demonstration actions for encouraging start-ups and industries to grow. For hydrogen production, the draft recommends the development of an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer and power-to-gas/co-electrolysis technology with solid-oxide electrolyzer (SOEC), demonstration of biomass gasification-based hydrogen generation, compact bio-methane reformers for decentralized hydrogen generation, and integrated net carbon-negative solutions projects in this category.
Under the ‘blue sky’ category, projects with a long-term (0 – 15 years) impact horizon would be taken up with a focus on establishing global IP and competitive advantage for the Indian industry. The following projects are recommended for consideration: seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production; photoelectrochemical water splitting; thermochemical water splitting and integration with nuclear/ solar heat source; microbial electrolysis system for hydrogen production; and novel technologies for the conversion of biomass to hydrogen.
Similarly, the draft provides R&D recommendations for hydrogen storage, transport, and end-use applications.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/07/utilities-can-you-dg-it/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",,"JULY 7, 2023","Utilities, can you DG it?","From pv magazine 06/23
Two of the biggest solar markets, the United States and China, expanded their distributed-generation capacity by more than 65% in 2021 and 2022, against a 4% fall and an 18% rebound in utility scale PV. That means a qualitative shift in financing, in particular to back the integration of mass, networked, distributed-energy resources (DER) under virtual power plants (VPPs) and traditional utilities. Rethink Technology Research believes that utilities, especially in the United States, plan to participate in mass distributed-solar rollout. We think they will offer to partner with residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) property owners and act as a bridge to finance.
While net metering payments and reduced electricity sales might spook utilities, electric companies have tremendous balance sheets to borrow against and can recruit “full scale” distributed-generation (DG) customers, equipped to their maximum solar roof and energy storage potential.
The first power company to embrace this change will be imitated by others because the alternative is to be abandoned by customers wealthy enough to go full scale distributed alone, free from grid reliance. Utilities that rent roofs back to customers unable to purchase PV arrays outright will open the market to more solar customers and safeguard themselves from falling energy prices while retaining control of power generation.
With half of the world’s electricity to come from solar in future – and half of that DG arrays – utilities will have to embrace the VPPs expected to become widespread in the US in the next two years, and later in Australia, parts of Europe, and, potentially strong DER markets such as Japan.
The Rocky Mountain Institute, a sustainability thinktank, announced a virtual power plant partnership in January with General Motors. It also announced agreements with Ford, Sunpower, Sunrun, home-automation specialist Google Nest, and the OhmConnect energy-efficiency program. In addition, it started working with Olivine, an energy demand-response specialist, and SPAN, which provides home energy-consumption panels. It also collaborates with VPP developer SwitchDin and Virtual Peaker, a residential electric demand software platform.
Utilities in the United States and elsewhere are already obliged to enable VPPs on their grids, meaning they must track and model VPP grid participation. More than two-thirds of US electricity meters at the end of 2021 were smart devices, with 120 million now installed.

Independent aggregators are now pushing VPPs, meaning more generation and storage is taken out of the hands of utilities until they join the market. If more than 60% of solar capacity is small scale, a similar volume of storage capacity can be expected, paid for by homeowners or whoever paid for the systems, and will be attached to a revenue-generating VPP.
Despite rising solar prices, Rethink Energy estimates the global PV industry grew 30% last year, with 221 GW added, and will rise 50% this year and in 2024, based on 330 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity last year, plus 45 GW per month more this year.
We estimate rooftop panels accounted for 57% of the solar added last year and will stay above 50% through mid-2025, with DG numbers rising in the US, China, and most other big markets. While high module prices and other supply chain issues affected utility scale plants, war in Ukraine prompted people and businesses to go solar to safeguard energy security.
Rethink Energy expects the pendulum to swing back to utility from 2025 to 2030, as manufacturing bottlenecks ease and module prices – which make up around 40% of project costs – return to the price decline curve which prevailed until mid-2020. Prices topped $300 per kilowatt of generation capacity in late 2021 but have now subsided below $240/kW, before shipping, and will reach $200/kW in 2025.

DG systems will retake the crown from 2031, to hit 63% of all new installations in 2050. Both will boom and while hundreds of gigawatts of capacity in Australian and Chilean deserts alone will power green hydrogen, DG’s potential will be even greater, driven by energy prices.
Distributed solar has so many cost factors that the price spike in polysilicon – which still accounts for more than 25% of module costs – barely changed the financial formula, enabling small-scale PV to dominate. Many countries have boosted rooftop solar with new policies but these are simply riding the wave, not causing it.
In 2027, utility-scale solar will, for a brief moment, once again enjoy the 57% share of new installs it held before the pandemic. From that point on, multiple long-term trends will work in favor of distributed PV – with one of them being the “next big limiting factor” of the solar industry – transmission. In 2031, the two sectors will return to parity, as distributed prepares to take over for the second time.

Genex said the AUD 44.5 million ($29.63 million) structured funding package will be used to shore up financing for the company’s flagship 250 MW/2 GWh Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro project in northern Queensland and to develop its multi-stage Bulli Creek solar and battery project near Toowoomba.
J-Power, which is among Genex’s largest shareholders following an AUD 25 million equity investment announced in 2019, has agreed to provide a corporate loan facility of AUD 35 million as a standby source of funding for the 250 MW, eight-hour pumped hydro project.
Genex said the funding may not be needed but in the wake of a drilling incident late last year that set construction back, the replenishment of the project contingency is considered prudent to ensure the project remains on track for energization in 2024.
It was estimated the incident, which resulted in water unexpectedly leaking into a tunnel, added AUD 10 million to AUD 15 million to the project’s cost.
“While the costs of the water ingress event at the Kidston pumped storage hydro project last year have been fully funded, we consider it prudent that additional funding is secured against any further unforeseen events during the balance of the construction program,” Genex Chief Executive Officer James Harding said. “The loan facility with J-Power gives us significant buffer to complete the construction of the project.”
On top of the loan facility, J-Power will also establish a joint development fund for Genex’s Bulli Creek solar and battery project which is expected to be developed in five stages. The first stage will entail the delivery of a 400 MW/1,600 MWh big battery. while the second proposed stage would deliver a 475 MW to 675 MW solar project.
The joint development agreement gives J-Power a 50% interest in the project courtesy of upfront acquisition funding of AUD 2.5 million and a further $6 million in upfront funding for third party development costs.
