The car, based on the Innova Hycross model, is designed to be compatible with India’s stricter emission norms BS 6 (Stage II).
Electrified flex-fuel vehicles have both a flex-fuel engine as well as an electric powertrain, offering higher use of ethanol combined with better fuel efficiencies. 
The vehicle can run on any of the higher ethanol blends beyond 20%. It can provide 30-50% higher fuel efficiency, running 40-60% in EV mode with the engine shut off. The vehicle uses minimal advanced chemistry batteries (1.3-1.5 kWh compared to 40-60 kWh for battery electric vehicles).
Unveiling the prototype, Gadkari said, “Ethanol, being an indigenous, clean and renewable fuel, holds a promising future for India. The government focuses on ethanol for achieving energy self-reliance, spurring farmers’ incomes, and having a better environmental impact. The Government’s plan is not only to diversify agriculture surpluses towards the energy sector but also generate wealth from waste using 2G technology for producing ethanol from bio-waste.”
India is endowed with renewable energy, surplus sugar, food grains, and biomass. The abundantly available sugarcane, excess food grains, and huge biomass waste can be used to produce ethanol that can substitute a significant amount of petrol used by vehicles in the shortest possible time. Ethanol can also be produced from plant waste or residues, which are otherwise burnt, causing widespread pollution in northern parts of India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/29/scientists-outline-innovation-pathways-for-pv-technologies/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 29, 2023",Scientists outline innovation pathways for PV technologies,"From pv magazine USA
Ten scientists have projected the innovation pathways for the major PV cell technologies over the next five years, in an open-access article in the journal Cell.
Although installed PV capacity worldwide exceeds 1 terawatt (1,000 GW), PV’s contribution to worldwide electricity generation remains small, the authors say, at 5% to 6%. Given an “urgent need” to deploy PV at multi-terawatt (TW) scale over the next two decades to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, “PV device innovation takes on new urgency and impact.”
Continued research that leads to “even relatively small advances” in efficiency, reliability and manufacturing efficiency “will have major future impacts at multi-TW scale,” the authors say, as these factors combine to make “the increasingly compelling value proposition” for PV power generation.
While crystalline silicon PV had a 95% market share in 2022, in a “TW-scale future” with “PV everywhere,” multiple technologies may be complementary, or combined, the authors say.
The silicon PV technology known as TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivating contact), with a market share of 23%, will “overcome” production of PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) PV by 2025 and “is likely to become the technology of choice for new-cell manufacturing in the US,” the article predicts.
Crystalline silicon PV cells are approaching the single-junction theoretical maximum efficiency of 29.4%, the authors say.
Research is still needed, they note, to develop high-temperature, selective area passivating contacts on both sides of the PV cell (“advanced TOPCon”), to improve the transparency and conductivity of heterojunction technology (HJT) contacts (“advanced HJT”), and to combine the latest HJT or TOPCon technologies with an interdigitated back contact (IBC) structure, “which could reach an ultimate practical efficiency of 28% possibly as soon as 2025.”
Yet as the theoretical limit is approached, “several new modes of degradation, called carrier-induced degradation, and metastable defects are unveiled,” the authors say.
The industry “is working to reduce or eliminate” the use of scarce materials such as silver for the formation of grid lines and indium used in transparent conductive oxides, the authors say. Several PV companies and research laboratories have announced HJT PV cell design with reduced indium consumption “or even indium-free” HJT cells.
Tandem technology
Many technologies for tandem solar cells have been proposed to overcome the single-junction efficiency limit, the authors say.
Development of monolithic 2-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem cells, “considered by many as the most probable and cost-effective solution,” is currently the most active research area, and has already yielded a record cell efficiency of 33.7% for a small-area (1 square centimeter) cell.
For a 30% efficient 2-terminal tandem cell, “the efficiency of the top cell is significantly more critical than the efficiency of the bottom cell,” so “a potential contender as a bottom cell” would include “almost any” silicon cell technology.
While “there is no doubt” that efficiencies greater than 30% will soon be commercially available on large-area cells, “stability still needs to be improved,” the authors say. To reach the same levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as established “bankable” technologies, “the tandem device may only degrade less than 0.5% per year.”
Cadmium telluride
Cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV technology accounts for 25% of installed U.S. utility-scale PV, but only 5% of global market share. The researchers projected, based on a First Solar cell with arsenic-doped material that reached 22.3% efficiency, that Cd(Se,Te) cells doped with a Group V material “will become the primary platform for research, development and manufacturing.”
CIGS
Turning to CIGS technology, whose original formulation used copper, indium, gallium and selenium, the authors say that the combination of CIGS in tandem applications is “one major focus of future developments.” CIGS tandem devices “are not limited to pairing CIGS with perovskites,” they add, as “they may be made with numerous materials including CdTe-, Si-, or CIGS-based alloys with different band gaps.”
Multi-junction III-V
Multi-junction III-V PV cells are described by the U.S. Department of Energy as cells that can reach efficiencies over 45% by using multiple bandgaps, or junctions, that are each tuned to absorb a specific region of the solar spectrum. Multi-junction III-V PV cells could enable “significant space-based power generation,” the authors say.
The article, written by five scientists from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory and five others from First Solar and research institutes in Germany, the U.S. and China, is titled “Photovoltaic device innovation for a solar future.”
Three of the co-authors contributed to an article in the journal Science earlier this year titled “Photovoltaics at multi-terawatt scale: Waiting is not an option.”

Dhp Technology, a foldable PV system supplier, plans to deploy its Horizon foldable PV systems at 45 motorway rest areas in the cantons of Valais and Bern, Switzerland. It will install 35 MW of capacity in cooperation with the ABCD-Horizon consortium, which includes Swiss energy company Aventron, BG Consulting Engineers, and Cargo Sous Terrain.
Dhp Technology said its systems will use proprietary technology to retract and extend solar panels based on weather conditions, so they can be retracted based on hail storm forecasts.
“Thanks to the lightweight construction and the patented folding mechanism, wide distances between supports and great heights of up to 6 meters above the ground are possible,” the company said. “This keeps the traffic routes free for large vehicles and goods.”
The structure houses lightweight, glass-free solar panels with folding capabilities, interconnected by cables and built with stainless steel and special plastic, with a rust-resistant coating. The company said the modules maintain performance consistency and experience no mechanical stress during extension and retraction, matching conventional panel performance.
The 45 arrays will primarily supply electricity to EV charging stations, while excess power will be sold to Averton and three other Swiss energy suppliers: Primeo Energie, Stadtwerke Winterthur, and Energie Wasser Bern. Construction will start in early 2024, with all projects to be finalized by 2027, according to the consortium.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/29/global-polysilicon-prices-drop-china-polysilicon-prices-rise/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 29, 2023","Global polysilicon prices drop, China polysilicon prices rise","The Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for polysilicon outside China, fell to $28.2 per kg with a week-to-week decline of 6%. Multiple sources confirmed they saw lower pricing for non-China polysilicon being signed.
One global producer sold polysilicon this month at around $27/kg, and will do so at even lower prices next month, to a major solar manufacturer, according to a source at the latter.
Some sources expressed surprise at the falling prices and could not offer explanations as to why. One source’s comments proved representative of many: “There is a lot of demand for non-China poly,” so “we are not really clear on why” global producers have reduced their prices. Even some sources expressed doubt, stating that it is improbable that the aforementioned global producer will have lowered prices below $30/kg.
“My guess is that customers cannot absorb the big price difference between China and non-China polysilicon anymore” and have pushed for lower figures, a solar market veteran said. Although there are a lot of plans for ingot and wafer capacity in the U.S., moving forward, “the only demand today” is from big Chinese buyers, he added.

Reflecting how the global and China polysilicon markets are essentially bifurcated, this week saw them move in opposite directions. China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon in the country, extended gains for a seventh week running to CNY73.75 ($10.12)/kg.
The 2.57% increase comes as the available supply of China polysilicon is lower than expected. Prices for the material are increasing slowly because of how inventories have been consumed in recent days, and “the slow rate at which new production capacity is being added,” a source explained.
Looking ahead, China polysilicon prices could edge upwards a little more, before ultimately decreasing on the overall picture of oversupply that remains on the horizon. Traders are taking off-grade material again, “which means that prices will be stable or even rise slightly in the next 1-2 months,” according to a market veteran. More broadly, once all new polysilicon production capacity slated to come online this year does, price increases will see a reversal.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
