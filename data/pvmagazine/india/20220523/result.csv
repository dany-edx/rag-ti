The EzUrja solution addresses grid availability constraints for EV charging by tapping decentralized renewables-generating platforms such as solar, compressed biogas, and compressed natural gas as the source of energy input in addition to the grid.
The solution is basically a power bank and a charger on a vehicle. You can prebook it through an app, locate and demand charge as per your requirement, timing, and location. The solution is mobile in that the battery bank can be charged at a decentralized energy generation station and taken to the EV, Ashhok Kapoor, the chief business officer at Ez4EV, told pv magazine.
“In India, charger availability is one aspect, but ultra-fast charger availability is still a little faraway story because of grid issues. If you look at electric buses, 9-meter buses require a 120 kW charger, and 12-meter buses require 240 kW. Providing 240 kW chargers is a challenge in cities,” said Kapoor. “The grid must be equipped to handle a significant rise in peak loads due to the use of fast chargers for EVs. So, we decided to innovate EzUrja EV charging product localized for the Indian scenario. This solution gives the electric buses the juice they need mid-way to complete their routes once they leave the depot. They don’t have to travel back to recharge.”
The EzUrja solution-in-a-box uses a specially designed engine to convert CNG into electricity, an inverter for converting electricity into a DC component, and a DC-DC charger.
US-based C4V is a back-end investor in the EzUrja project. It provides lithium-ion cells for EzUrja chargers. The lithium-ion cells are being manufactured at its 1.8 GWh factory in New York.
“C4V was exploring the application of their battery chemistry, which they developed together with a Nobel laureate. It found a good match in our ultra-fast EV charging concept that is localized for the Indian scenario,” said Kapoor.

With this, the PV capacity at Tata Motors’ Pune plant will expand to 17 MWp, making it India’s largest on-site solar project. The plant’s other 10 MWp, installed earlier, was also developed by Tata Power.
Tata Motors and Tata Power recently signed a power purchase agreement for the solar project. The installation is collectively expected to generate 23 million units of electricity, mitigating 5.23 lakh tonnes of carbon dioxide. 
As a signatory to the RE100, Tata Motors is committed to using 100% renewable energy in its operations. To achieve this objective, the company is gradually increasing the proportion of renewable energy in its operations. It generated 92.39 million kWh of renewable electricity in fiscal 2021-22 – almost 19.4% of its total power usage. 
Tata Power has executed multiple large solar rooftop projects, including a 16 MW rooftop installation at Radhasoami Satsang Beas, Amritsar, and a 2.67 MW at Cochin International Airport. It has also built an 820.8 kWp solar rooftop at the Cricket Club of India (CCI) in Mumbai, and a unique 120 kW solar vertical farm for Dell Technologies in Bangalore.

The capacity is the first portion of a bigger 250 MW solar project it is developing across a site spanning 900 acres, all of which will be connected to the interstate transmission system.
The project will supply electricity to Solar Energy Corporation of India over a period of 25 years at a fixed tariff of INR 2.54/kWh, Saurabh Mehta, Mahindra Susten’s business development and projects lead, told pv magazine.
“Mahindra Susten developed the project with engineering, procurement, and construction work done in-house. Operation and maintenance services for the plant are being provided by Mahindra Teqo [a sister company of Mahindra Susten],” said Mehta.
The project uses bifacial modules to maximize yield and reduce the land requirement. Water-free robots have been deployed to clean the solar panels. The project is purportedly the first of this scale in India to use bifacial module technology. Before implementing the project, Mahindra Susten deployed a prototype at a number of sites to analyze the advantages of bifacial technology.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/23/quantum-well-superlattices-for-a-new-world-record-cell-efficiency-of-39-5/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MAY 23, 2022",Quantum well superlattices for a new world record cell efficiency of 39.5%,"From pv magazine Global 
A group of scientists led by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) set a new world record for solar cell efficiency under normal illumination without a concentrator, achieving 39.5% with their cell based on three layers of III-V materials.
The new record pushes out NREL’s previous record of 39.2%, and with various innovations the group was able to greatly simplify the device – relying on three junctions instead of the previous six. The previous record for a three-junction solar cell was set by Sharp Corporation back in 2013, at 37.9%
The cell is described in full in the paper “Triple-junction solar cells with 39.5% terrestrial and 34.2% space efficiency enabled by thick quantum well superlattices,” recently published in Joule. The group combined layers of gallium-indium-arsenide (GaInAs), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and gallium-indium-phosphide (GaInP) to create a device that could absorb a wide segment of the solar spectrum.
Key to this approach was NREL’s latest work on “quantum wells,” which allowed it to better tune each layer to absorb a different part of the solar spectrum. “While GaAs is an excellent material and generally used in III-V multijunction cells, it does not have quite the correct bandgap for a three-junction cell, meaning that the balance of photocurrents between the three cells is not optimal,” said Ryan France, senior scientist and cell designer at NREL. “Here, we have modified the bandgap while maintaining excellent material quality by using quantum wells, which enables this device and potentially other applications.”
Quantum wells are thin nanostructures inserted into the cell layers to alter the bandgap and other properties. Using these, the group was able to raise the bandgap of the middle GaAs cell layer, to maximize its performance in unison with the other two. While the QW phenomenon is not a new discovery, various challenges working with these materials at the scale of a few nanometers have limited their practical benefits in previous research.
Space spectrum
The group acknowledged that, for now at least, the processes and materials it is working with on these cells are too complex and expensive for most mainstream solar applications. Though NREL is working on a few different methods that could drastically reduce these costs, for now powering satellites and other space technology – where space constraints mean cost can come second to efficiency – are the only likely application for any type of solar cell based on these “III-V” materials, named for their grouping in the periodic table.
NREL also measured its triple junction quantum well cells under the light spectrum they would have to work with outside of Earth’s atmosphere, and reached a beginning of life measurement of 34.2% – which it notes is also a world record for a three-junction cell under this spectrum.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/23/no-end-to-solar-supply-demand-imbalance/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"MAY 23, 2022",No end to solar supply/demand imbalance,"From pv magazine 05/2022
PV InfoLink projects global PV module demand to reach 223 GW this year, with an optimistic forecast of 248 GW. Cumulative installed capacity is expected to reach 1 TW by year’s end.
China still dominates PV demand. The policy-driven 80 GW of module demand will beef up solar market development. In second place is the European market, which is working to accelerate renewables development to wean itself off Russian natural gas. Europe is expected to see 49 GW of module demand this year.
The third-largest market, the United States, has seen diversified supply and demand since last year. Disrupted by the Withhold Release Order (WRO), supply is unable to catch up with demand. Moreover, the investigation into anti-circumvention in Southeast Asia this year causes further uncertainty in cell and module supply for US orders and adds to the low utilization rates in Southeast Asia amid impacts of WRO.
As a result, supply to the US market will fall short of demand throughout this year; module demand will stay at last year’s 26 GW or even lower. The three largest markets together will contribute to around 70% of demand.
Demand in the first quarter of 2022 stayed at around 50 GW, despite persistently high prices. In China, projects deferred from last year were commenced. While ground-mounted projects were postponed due to high module prices over the short term, and demand from distributed-generation projects continued due to lower price sensitivity. In markets outside of China, India witnessed strong inventory draw prior to the introduction of basic custom duty (BCD) on April 1, with 4 GW to 5 GW of demand in the first quarter. Steady demand continued in the US, while Europe saw stronger-than-expected demand with robust order requests and signings. The EU’s market acceptance for higher prices also increased.

Overall, demand in the second quarter may be spurred by distributed generation and some utility-scale projects in China, while Europe’s strong module inventory draws amid the accelerated energy transition, and steady demand from the Asia-Pacific region. The US and India, on the other hand, is expected to see dwindling demand, owing respectively to anti-circumvention investigation and lofty BCD rates. Yet, demand from all regions together amass 52 GW, slightly higher than in the first quarter.
Under current pricing levels, China’s guaranteed installed capacity will drive inventory draws from utility-scale projects in the third and fourth quarter, while distributed generation projects will continue. Against this backdrop, the Chinese market will continue to consume large volumes of modules.
The outlook for the US market will remain obscured until results of the anti-circumvention investigation are unveiled at the end of August. Europe continues to see bullish demand, with no evident high or low seasons throughout the year.
Overall, demand in the second half of the year will surpass that in the first half. PV Infolink predicts a gradual increase over time, reaching a peak in the fourth quarter.
As shown in the graph (left), polysilicon supply has improved from last year and is likely to meet end-user demand. Yet, InfoLink predicts that polysilicon supply will remain short due to the following factors: Firstly, it will take about six months for new production lines to reach full capacity, meaning production is limited. Secondly, the time taken for new capacity to come online varies among manufacturers, with capacity growing slowly during first and second quarter, and then increasing markedly in the third and fourth quarter. Lastly, despite continued polysilicon production, Covid-19’s resurgence in China has disrupted supply, leaving it unable to meet demand from the wafer segment, which holds huge capacity.
Raw material and BOM price trends decide whether module prices will stay on the rise. Like polysilicon, it seems that EVA particle production volume can satisfy demand from the module sector this year, but equipment maintenance and the pandemic will lead to an imbalanced supply-demand relationship in the short term.
Supply chain prices are expected to stay elevated and will not decline until the end of the year, when new polysilicon production capacities come fully online. Next year, the entire supply chain may hopefully recover to a healthy state, allowing the long-stressed module makers and system suppliers to take a deep breath. Unfortunately, striking a balance between high prices and robust demand continues to be major topic of discussion throughout 2022.
