https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/18/hydrogen-as-a-sustainable-alternative-fuel-for-transport/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,POLICY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 18, 2023",Hydrogen as a sustainable alternative fuel for transport,"With India’s reliance on imported crude oil, opportunities exist to plan for and grow the use of green hydrogen as a zero-emissions fuel source for the country’s transport sector, including commercial fleets and aviation.
However, “The commercial credibility of hydrogen development is absolutely key, particularly around securing viable off-takers for the product. There are a few emerging business models that are being studied and developed more closely in India, for domestic consumption and export. This includes the use of hydrogen for transport fleets, the use of hydrogen derivatives as aviation fuel, and the production of green ammonia,” said Ruturaj Govilkar, country manager and managing director, India, Black & Veatch.
Black & Veatch is involved in building 245 MW of electrolysis capacity. The company is building the world’s largest hydrogen hub in the United States.
India serves as an integral part of Black & Veatch’s innovation network exploring and providing hydrogen and other emerging sustainable solutions for clients globally. Countries throughout the world continue to announce new decarbonization and hydrogen strategies, and India recently approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an initial outlay of INR 19,744 crore ($2.3 billion). The Mission aims to make India a global hub for the production, utilization, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives.
Speaking at the Hydrogen India Summit 2023, Govilkar proposed that, together, electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicles powered by hydrogen – in particular, commercial fleets — are an alternate form of transportation that may eventually be more cost-effective that their fossil fuel-powered counterparts, given the rising cost of fossil fuels.
Other promising commercial models include the production of green ammonia for export, whereby importing countries could substitute ammonia directly for natural gas and use it for critical applications like power generation, or the use of ammonia as a fuel for shipping. A significant advantage is that outside the electrolysis process to produce green hydrogen, the production of ammonia is a well-established technology.
Similar to the ammonia synthesis loop, Black & Veatch notes that the basic method for producing synthetic fuel for aviation or other uses is proven, and pending wider usage.
Other than hydrogen, Black & Veatch carries out projects in multiple decarbonization fields. The Green Solutions (TGS) has appointed Black & Veatch to study the production and storage of green hydrogen in Vietnam utilizing solar or wind power supplied through the grid.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/18/emerging-investment-opportunities-in-indias-renewable-energy-sector/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,GROUND MOUNTED,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,INVERTERS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OFF-GRID SOLAR,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 18, 2023",Emerging investment opportunities in India’s renewable energy sector,"India’s renewable energy sector is on the cusp of another growth spurt driven by the next wave of policies and reforms, offering significant investment opportunities for global and domestic investors—says a joint report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and Invest India.
The report highlights several sectoral reforms that will attract more investment to Indian renewable energy companies. The reforms include the green energy corridor scheme, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, and privatization of state electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs). The industry and investors expect announcements about more such reforms in the upcoming Union Budget.
“Ahead of the Union Budget 2023-24, the government’s approval of an initial capital outlay of INR 19,744 crore (about US$2.43 billion) under the green hydrogen mission is the latest example of a policy push that will position India as a green hydrogen export hub and attract global investors,” says report co-author Shantanu Srivastava, energy finance analyst, IEEFA.
“Investors would now be looking forward to a detailed breakup of the outlay for the PLI scheme for green hydrogen production and electrolyzer manufacturing under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) program of the green hydrogen mission,” he added.
Potential areas
The report finds that several new technologies and associated business models are taking shape in India, in line with global developments. It identifies battery energy storage systems (BESS), offshore wind, and green hydrogen as key new technologies offering ample space for global investments.
“India plans to integrate large-scale solar and wind energy into its grid by 2030. In this context, battery storage is a vital technology solution as it allows time to shift the dispatch of solar and wind power,” says the report’s co-author Amit Manohar, sector lead – renewable energy, Invest India.
According to Srivastava, the government should look to use the Union Budget to introduce a PLI scheme for grid-scale storage to scale up domestic capacities. It should also look to offer import duty waivers for setting up local battery manufacturing capacities.
The report also finds strong potential in India’s offshore wind power segment.
“Despite the slowdown, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s announcement of a 4GW tender for offshore wind power off the coasts of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat has reinvigorated the sector. Offshore wind potential in India is pegged at 195GW along the 7,600km coastline with an ability to provide utilization factors of more than 50-55%,” says Manohar.
Here too, Srivastava suggests that the government should provide tax and non-tax incentives in the upcoming Union Budget to facilitate offshore wind projects’ growth, similar to what it did for solar and onshore wind in the past.
The report also identifies emerging trends such as corporate decarbonization and the energy-as-a-service model offering new avenues for investments in India’s renewable energy sector. 
Corporate decarbonization is a growing trend buoyed by increasing net-zero commitments by Indian companies. “The government should also look at providing financing support in the budget for industrial decarbonization. “Rolling out sovereign sustainability-linked bonds linked to India’s updated Nationally Determined Contributions, is a viable option,” says Srivastava.
Energy-as-a-service model offers high margins and growth prospects in a fast-evolving energy economy. Energy efficiency services, demand side management and cloud energy storage offerings are just a few of the new offerings under this model.   
The other key emerging trend is hybridizing solar and wind power for minimizing variability and optimally utilizing the infrastructure.
With an installed capacity of around 104 GW of wind and solar to date, the renewable energy sector is making strides to provide solutions for the intermittency of the two generation sources. And the government is releasing tenders for round-the-clock and hybrid RE projects instead of plain solar or wind tenders.
Srivastava adds that the government should provide incentives in the budget to facilitate the growth of the wind power equipment manufacturing industry and bring in more domestic competition. This will help invigorate the wind-solar hybrid market.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/18/lithium-sulfur-flow-battery-with-250-wh-l-energy-density/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LITHIUM-SULFUR,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 18, 2023",Lithium sulfur flow battery with 250 Wh/L energy density,"From pv magazine Global
Edinburg-based startup StorTera has developed a single liquid flow battery (SLIQ), which is a a novel, long-duration renewable energy storage system. It combines the advantages of lithium-ion technology – namely, high energy density and rapid response – with the benefits of flow batteries, such as a lower levelized cost of storage.
“By combining the concepts, we have overcome the inherent shortcomings of lithium sulfur battery which have prevented it from being successfully commercialized at scale,” StorTera COO Brenda Park told pv magazine.
With an energy density of 250 Wh/L, the SLIQ is touted as the most energy dense flow battery now under development.
“Due to its high energy density, the SLIQ can replace existing lithium technology in any many applications while providing a much longer lifetime (up to 30 years) with minimal degradation of efficiency,” said Park.
The technology purportedly provides millisecond response times and up to eight hours of energy storage for more than 20 years and a minimum of 7,500 cycles. The system is said to offer improved safety with no cooling requirements and high flash point materials.
“We are striving to make this a truly sustainable battery technology, building a circular economy around it using recovered or recycled raw materials where possible and by making it as reusable as possible,” said Park.
StorTera’s system works by pumping energy-dense single liquid through its proprietary membrane stack to provide long-duration storage. The single liquid design means less system components, whereas low-cost materials and manufacturing techniques further contribute to cost savings. StorTera has a stated goal of reaching capital costs of approximately GBP 120 ($146.20)/kW and GBP 75/kWh when commercialized.
“As it can provide both millisecond response time and long duration energy storage, it is well suited to grid scale applications and/or integration with solar or wind farms,” Park said. “Combined with our intelligent control platform, the SLIQ offers distinct advantages to commercial and industrial applications where it can be optimized continuously according to grid and weather data or by predicting demand peaks.”
In late November, StorTera secured about GBP 5 million from the UK government to help build a large-scale, eight- hour demonstrator of the SLIQ, which will be installed in Edinburgh in 2024. The prototype SLIQ will use a novel cylindrical cell architecture in a modular format to optimize the manufacture, installation, and maintenance of the system.
With a focus on sustainability, the system will use recyclable materials and by-products of the wood industry. Toward the end of the project, eight modular units will be combined to build a 200 kW/1.6 MWh demonstrator SLIQ.
“While developing the SLIQ, we have been providing bespoke small and medium scale lithium ferro phosphate (LFP) battery systems integrated with our intelligent platform to public sector, domestic and commercial customers in the UK. We have also piloted innovative smart grids in the UK and Canada that show the benefits that intelligent energy storage can offer to customers,” Park said. “Our commercial projects are paving the way for the SLIQ when it is commercialized in the next few years.”

US battery manufacturer Yoshino Technology has developed solid-state lithium-ion batteries with outputs ranging from 330 W to 4,000 W. They are designed for home backup, off-grid applications, and powering small industrial machinery.
The system can be used in combination with solar panels. The 4,000 W power station has a peak power of 6000 W and 2,611 Wh of capacity. It can be fully recharged by a 600 W solar panel in 5.5 hours, according to the company. Other charging options include AC, DC, and USB-C inputs.
“These portable power stations are built around a state-of-the-art solid electrolyte in place of the bulky and flammable liquid electrolyte found in traditional lithium-ion batteries, which improves performance and represents a giant leap forward for battery technology,” Yoshino said in a statement. “Higher energy density means the same amount of power fits into a smaller, lighter package – up to half the weight per watt compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries.”
The smallest battery measures 25.4 cm x 15.5 cm x 24.1 cm and weighs in at 4.58 kg. The largest one measures 54.3 cm x 25.9 cm x 23.8 cm and weighs 24.99 kg. They can reportedly run for 2,500 cycles to 80% capacity.
The 2,000 W and 4,000 W models feature uninterruptible power supply (UPS) when plugged into wall sockets. Yoshino is selling the products starting at $349 retail. They feature a 36-month warranty.
The solution includes a mobile app to monitor charge level, battery health, and connected devices. The entire product range will be available from May.
