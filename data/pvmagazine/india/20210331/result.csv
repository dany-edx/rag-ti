Ieefa has calculated that in 2021 solar+storage will be cheaper than grid supply for most commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. It finds the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for a 1MW rooftop solar system coupled to 250kW of energy storage with a backup of four hours to reduce to around INR 6.6–6.8/kWh by next year. This is less than the grid tariff for most C&I consumers and well below the cost of power produced by diesel generators.
Co-author Vibhuti Garg, an Ieefa energy economist and Lead India, said, “Policy initiatives by central and state governments are already boosting the adoption of EVs, and although slow, rooftop solar and battery uptake is increasing. What’s missing, however, is the opportunity to integrate distributed energy and therefore maximize the benefit of combining rooftop solar with small-scale storage, smart demand-responsive appliances, and EVs.”
Recommendations
The report suggests the technical integration of rooftop solar with storage and electric vehicles (EVs) as a priority to instill consumer and investor confidence. This encompasses the quality of distributed energy resource (DER) products and installations, integration into the distribution grid and providing certainty of return on investment. 
It states lessons for India to learn from Australia—which has the world’s highest rooftop solar capacity per person (786 watts) and a record rate of new installations (3GW in 2020, a 39% increase on a year-on-year basis). 
Said co-author Dr Gabrielle Kuiper, a DER specialist and Ieefa guest contributor, “Putting in place a technical standards framework, appropriate quality controls and consumer protections for distributed energy products and installations, and appointing a respected agency to ensure compliance, will be critical in shoring up consumer and investor confidence.”
Roughly one in four Australian households – about 2.7 million homes – have rooftop solar systems and increasingly battery storage. 
India, meanwhile, is on the cusp of its own distributed energy transition as the government steps up support for the uptake of rooftop solar and solar irrigation pumps and targets 15% of vehicle sales to be electric by 2023.
Dr Kuiper said, “Combining rooftop solar with storage and EVs is key..[as] it is more cost-effective for private and public consumers to have distributed charging co-located with power generation and to directly charge EVs using behind-the-meter solar.”
Managed charging and discharging of EVs and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology – which enables power to be drawn from or supplied to the grid when most needed – could be a game-changer for India, stated the report.
 An additional time-of-day price signal to incentivize supply in peak demand periods will provide much-needed flexibility in the Indian grid as the proportion of variable renewable energy grows.
 Garg said distribution companies (discoms) could play a greater role in facilitating a system where distributed energy resources like rooftop solar, battery storage and EVs are central, planned for, and taken advantage of, driving deflation and sustainable energy for all.
 “Discoms are watching their high-paying commercial and industrial consumers install private supplies of rooftop solar plus storage, which is undermining discoms’ revenues due to their excessive reliance on unsustainable cross-subsidies.
 “Instead, discoms could proactively offer rooftop solar plus storage packages and change the customer landscape.”

Axitec, a German solar module supplier and battery manufacturer, has launched two new modules with power ratings of 410 W and 540 W.
The two half-cell modules feature 182 mm wafers and will be available from the second quarter of this year, the company said. Its AXIpremium XXL HC (silver/white) and AXIblackpremium XL HC (black backsheets/black frame) will be available throughout the world in 108-cell and 144-cell variants. Axitec said it will continues to improve the power ratings of the PV modules throughout the course of this year.
The company said that its AXIpremium XXL HC modules – featuring 108 cells and a glass area of less than 2 square meters – are ideal for installations on top of buildings in Germany. Its 144-cell modules, on the other hand, cannot be installed on rooftops in Germany, but they are suitable for ground-mounted PV systems, it said.
This year, it plans to devote about 40% of its manufacturing capacity to the production of the new PV modules, rising to 80% in 2022, CEO Steffen Wiedmann told pv magazine. He declined to comment on pricing.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/31/sterling-and-wilson-wins-inr-890-crore-solar-project-in-usa/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 31, 2021",Sterling and Wilson wins INR 890-crore solar project in USA,"Sterling and Wilson Solar, one of the world’s largest solar EPC solution providers, announced today that it has won a second order worth US$ 121.7 million (INR 890 crore) from an existing client in the Pacific Northwest region of the USA.
The company’s US arm Sterling and Wilson Solar Solutions bagged the order from a leading sustainable energy company for the turn-key execution, operation, and maintenance of the solar project. The project is scheduled to be commissioned by March 2022 and will be managed by a strong team of talented professionals based in the Western USA.
Sterling and Wilson Solar Solutions’ latest award follows a US$ 99 million (Rs 747 crore) award for a 194 MW project in the USA. With this, its cumulative orders booked in the country now stand at around US$ 260 million (INR 1,880 crore).
Amit Jain, country head, Sterling and Wilson Solar Solutions, said, “With the renewed commitment by the new administration in renewable energy, that includes rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, investing $2 trillion in clean energy, and fully decarbonizing the power sector by 2035, USA has huge potential. We are confident that as a global solar EPC company with state-of-the-art technology and project execution capabilities, we are well poised to be a significant player in this energy transition.”
Sterling and Wilson Solar has a strong portfolio of more than 10.8 GWp of solar power projects (commissioned and under various construction stages) in various geographies globally. This includes a 1,177 MWp solar plant in Abu Dhabi—the world’s largest single-site solar plant. The company also manages 8.1 GWp of operation and maintenance projects globally.
