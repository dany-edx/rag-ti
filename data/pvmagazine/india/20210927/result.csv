The US manufacturer is hopeful of getting successful in receiving an award or a grant through the production-linked incentive scheme for high-efficiency solar module manufacturing. And will continue with its India plans whatever be the tender outcome.
Widmar said the Indian government’s approach of a strong balance between industrial policy as well as trade policy, makes it an ideal opportunity for companies like First Solar to establish manufacturing in India. The government has committed to ensuring domestic capabilities as it pursues long-term climate goals and objectives with focus on energy independence and security.
“I think the alignment of what the Indian government is trying to accomplish couldn’t be better for companies that are looking to manufacture in India,” said Widmar. “The environment is pro-business and there is more opportunity for us to be successful to help India achieve its goal of establishing [solar] manufacturing base. India is taking a leadership role on a global stage as far as renewable sources of energy are concerned.”
India has set ambitious RE targets of 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030. The Government has taken a number of steps to enhance domestic manufacturing of solar PV cells and modules as it chases these goals. These include Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) Scheme, production-linked incentive scheme for gigawatt-scale manufacturing of high-efficiency solar modules, preference to ‘Make in India’ in public procurement in renewable energy sector, imposition of basic customs duty on import of solar PV cells and modules with effect from April next year.
First Solar is planning a 3.3 GW vertically integrated thin-film solar module manufacturing facility in India. It has bid under the government’s production-linked incentives scheme.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/27/sjvn-to-develop-1-gw-solar-under-cpsu-phase-ii/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2021",SJVN to develop 1 GW solar under CPSU Phase II,"State-owned hydropower producer Satluz Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd (SJVN) has won 1 GW out of the 5 GW grid-connected solar capacity tendered under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme Phase II.
The tender was floated by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (IREDA) under the third tranche of the Scheme.
SJVN had submitted the bid to develop 1 GW and won the full quoted capacity with a viability gap funding (VGF) support of INR 44.72 lakh per MW.
The project construction and development cost is estimated at INR 5,500 crore. The project is expected to generate 2,365 million units (MU) of electricity in the first year and about 55,062 MU over 25 years. 
“These projects will assist SJVN in achieving its ambitious shared vision of 5,000 MW by 2023, 12,000 MW by 2030, and 25,000 MW by 2040 and simultaneously contribute towards RE capacity addition target of 175 GW by 2022 set by the Government of India,” read a statement by SJVN.
As per the tender document for 5 GW under CPSU Scheme Phase-II, State-owned power generators are required to develop this capacity on a build-own-operate basis—either for self-consumption or use by other government entities—using India-made cells and modules. The solar electricity can be supplied to the beneficiary either directly or via power distribution companies on mutually agreed charges.
Under the Scheme, government producers are provided VGF support to cover the cost difference between domestic and imported solar cells and modules.
The selection of the producer was made using the VGF amount as a bid parameter.  
New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) has already agreed to procure 150 MW of solar power from the projects that SJVN will develop under the CPSU Scheme.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/27/how-long-do-residential-storage-batteries-last/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2021",How long do residential storage batteries last?,"From pv magazine International
In Parts 1 and 2 of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of residential solar panels and inverters. Here, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households showed that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents who are actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they plan to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The idea here is to maximize the value of the home’s solar system. And some batteries are optimized to integrate an electric vehicle charger.

Although deployment of energy storage is on a steady climb, attachment rates of batteries remain low. In 2020, just 8.1% of residential solar systems included attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL).
Many options exist with multiple battery chemistries available for home energy storage. The bottom line, however, is that in the United States, two brands dominate the space. More than 90% of the market is served by LG Chem and Tesla Powerwall, which are lithium-ion batteries, according to LBL. Tesla controls more than 60% of the entire market.
The Tesla PowerWall has a limited warranty that says the device will be free from defects for 10 years following installation. It also warrants that the PowerWall will start its life with a capacity of 13.5 kWh, and will retain energy capacity based on a degradation schedule.
LG claims that its system will retain at least 60% of its nominal energy capacity (9.8 kWh) for 10 years. The battery must operate between -10 C and 45 C to remain covered by the warranty. Total throughput of energy within the warranty is limited to 27.4 MWh.
Battery life
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between five to 15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20 to 30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.

Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: overcharge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institute. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said the Faraday Institute. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
Maintenance matters
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but potential threat) can be minimized. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.

NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (build-up on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.
