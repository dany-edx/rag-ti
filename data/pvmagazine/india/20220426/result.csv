The PV plant developed by Indian developer Avaada Group through a special-purpose vehicle called Avaada MHYavat.
Linde purchased 1.13 crore equity shares of Avaada MHYavat for INR 11.4 crore to raise the 26% stake. The investment will help it replace high-tariff grid power with lower-cost and “green” solar power under the open access route.
Avaada Energy has commissioned over 2.2 GW of utility-scale solar PV projects across nine states in India. Last year, it installed 1 GW, the largest among all the renewable energy IPPs in India. The company targets 5 GW of installed capacity by December end of this year and 11 GW by 2025.

The partnership aims at improving the energy efficiency, reliability, and equipment cost for green hydrogen production.
Both the institutions signed an agreement for the collaboration recently. 
L&T will bring to the partnership its engineering expertise, product scale-up, and commercialization know-how, whereas IIT Bombay’s cutting-edge research in hydrogen technologies will help the partnership accomplish its goal. 
L&T, through its renewables business unit, provides single-point EPC turnkey solutions for solar PV projects, along with modularized energy storage solutions, in India and abroad. The company has a cumulative solar portfolio of over 5 GW, including projects built and being built by it. 
Last year, the company announced its intentions to focus on ‘new energy’ areas (such as hydrogen, energy storage, and carbon capture) and operations and maintenance to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Towards that goal, it is positioning itself to drive a green hydrogen economy in India together with its partners.
SN Subrahmanyan, CEO and MD, L&T, said, “Our partners and clients are also looking forward to leveraging our capability to reduce costs and industrialize Green Hydrogen. This collaboration with IIT Bombay and its world-class technologists will support the cause of developing indigenous globally competitive technologies and nudge India towards AatmaNirbhar in Green Hydrogen technology.” 
Subhasis Chaudhuri, a director at IIT Bombay, said, “Given the urgency of the climate crisis and India’s own ambitious target of becoming net-zero by 2070, the transition from fossil fuel to Green Hydrogen will play a key role in this goal. India’s National Hydrogen Mission is a step in the right direction, and I am confident that our partnership with L&T will result in scalable and cost-effective solutions.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/26/polysilicon-maker-predicts-5-year-shortage-of-solar-raw-material/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,CHINA,WORLD",MAX HALL,"APRIL 26, 2022",Polysilicon maker predicts 5-year shortage of solar raw material,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese polysilicon maker Xinte Energy has predicted “a certain shortage in polysilicon production capacity and production volume in the next five years,” as it tries to persuade shareholders to back a CNY 8.8 billion ($1.38 billion) share issuance.
The manufacturer and solar developer, which is owned by electrical equipment company TBEA, wants its investors to back a plan to issue 300 million shares – 17.34% of the stock of the enlarged company. It aims to drum up half the cash required to build a poly fab in Xinjiang capable of producing 200,000 tons of the solar panel raw material annually.
Xinte shareholders will vote on the share issuance at an extraordinary general meeting on May 5.
Solar boom
Pointing to booming global demand for solar, Xinte said even with a 100,000-ton polysilicon fab in Inner Mongolia due to be completed this year, the more than 1 million tons worth of solar wafer orders it has received from companies such as Longi and JA Solar mean it has locked up sales for three to five years.
That Inner Mongolia facility will double Xinte’s annual poly production capacity and the company wants to double the number again by June 2024, with a 200,000-ton, CNY 17.6 billion site at the Changji Zhundong Industrial Park, to be built in two 100,000-ton stages.
Under the manufacturer’s plans, construction of the 12-month first phase of the Xinjiang fab would start next month, with the second stage built from June next year. The other half of the investment cost will be sourced from “bank loans and other methods,” Xinte said in an announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week.
Silicon production in Xinjiang is a controversial issue outside China – particularly the topic of whether forced labor is a part of the solar value chain. The US House of Representatives in December drafted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which proposes banning all imports from Xinjiang unless it can be proven forced labor played no part in their manufacture.
Party plan
Outlining its plans this week, Xinte highlighted the energy-intensity credentials of the “cold hydrogenation technology” to be deployed at its latest proposed manufacturing site.
Shareholders at the May 5 meeting will also be asked to approve changes to the company’s articles of association, which include the formation of a “Communist party” at the business to implement major strategic decisions of the Central Committee of the party and the State Council.
The changes to the articles of association also remove several references to the specific Hong Kong exchange where Xinte Energy is listed and replaces them with references to a generic exchange, hinting that the company may be preparing to move its listing.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/26/borosil-to-acquire-europes-largest-solar-glass-maker-interfloat-group/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,SOLAR GLASS,GERMANY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 26, 2022",Borosil Renewables to acquire Europe’s largest solar glass maker Interfloat Group,"India’s Borosil Renewables has announced the signing of a binding offer for 100% equity in Interfloat Group, Europe’s largest solar glass manufacturer. With this acquisition, Borosil’s solar glass output will grow 66% to 750 tonnes per day (TPD).
The Indian manufacturer currently has a solar glass production capacity of 450 TPD in India, with exports comprising about 16.1% of overall sales. It anticipates attractive future growth in exports to Europe and the USA on the back of an expected rise in the production of solar modules in these markets.
The acquisition of Interfloat will make a broader range of solar glass available to Borosil Renewables’ expanded customer base in Europe. Besides, “Borosil’s expertise in achieving high efficiency in the manufacturing process to enhance throughput and lower costs will bring economies of scale to Interfloat’s expansion and manufacturing plans while reducing the carbon footprint of its European operations,” read a Borosil statement.
Interfloat Group consists of GMB Glasmanufaktur Brandenburg GmbH (GMB), which has a production plant with a current capacity of 300 TPD near Berlin, and Liechtenstein-based Interfloat Corporation, well known as a supplier to the European glass market. Interfloat has been servicing customers in Europe for close to 40 years and has deep-rooted relationships with the glass trade in the region.
Pradeep Kheruka, Executive Chairman of Borosil Renewables Ltd., said, “This acquisition of [Interfloat Group] moves us closer to our vision of being the most customer-centric company in the world. We believe that by leveraging the existing synergies and several complementary skill sets offered by the two companies, we will be able to serve our customers better.”
Christian Kern, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Interfloat Corporation, and former Austrian chancellor, said, “Borosil Renewables, a worldwide innovation leader with a focus on green production of solar panels, is a huge gain for Interfloat and the production in Brandenburg. In such difficult times, when the European industry suffers from soaring gas prices, a strong international partner will ensure the European production of clean energy.”
Kern will remain on the Board of Interfloat.
Borosil is currently expanding its PV glass production capacity in India to 1,000 TPD by September this year. It plans to further grow the capacity to 1,550 TPD by the end of 2023-24, and 2,100 TPD by the end of 2024-25.
The manufacturer will also invest in increasing the capacity at GMB’s Europe plant to 500 TPD by 2023 from the current 300 TPD.
Thus, with about 2,600 TPD manufacturing capacity, Borosil Renewables will be able to supply solar glass for more than 15 gigawatts of solar modules from 2025 while de-risking production from a single location.
Pradeep Kheruka, Borosil Renewables Ltd., said, “With the capacity expansions planned in India and Europe in the near future, we expect to enhance the reliability of our supply chains for our customers. On this journey, our unremitting efforts shall remain focused as always on reducing the overall carbon footprint of our operations.”
