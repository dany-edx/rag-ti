The two partners have signed definitive agreements on the investment.
The latest investment builds on KKR’s $400 million investment in November last year. This will support Serentica Renewables in installing 4 GW of renewable energy capacity to supply clean energy for large-scale industrial customers.
Serentica recently signed power delivery agreements (PDAs) to deliver round-the-clock green energy to some of the leading industrial customers in India. Currently, it is in the process of developing solar and wind power projects across Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. Once commissioned, these projects will supply 9 billion units of green energy every year using the inter-state transmission network.
Serentica Renewables is 100% owned by Twinstar Overseas Ltd, a unit of Volcan Investments. Twinstar Overseas also owns controlling stakes in Sterlite Power Transmission and Sterlite Technologies.

The new 1.2 GW facility will be equipped to produce M10 and G12 mono PERC and TOPCon modules. It is located at Sisodara village in Bharuch district of Gujarat.
Navitas Solar has raised $5 million to fund the expansion. The funding round saw participation from high-net worth individuals. Lead investors included promoters of Parishi Diamond Group and Lemon Emerging Ventures.
The company said with the expansion, it plans to export its products to the US and European countries.
At its existing 500 MW factory in Surat, Navitas Solar manufactures monocrystalline, polycrystalline and mono PERC solar modules ranging from 5 W to 600 W per panel.

German system integrator Badenova has inaugurated the first PV roof for cycle paths in Germany. The 287 kW installation is located in Freiburg, in the southern part of the country, and is based on 900 translucent glass-glass solar modules provided by German panel maker Solarwatt.
The modules in the series have a general technical approval from the German Institute for Building Technology (DIBt). They are therefore regarded as a regulated building product that can be used without restriction in the private and public sector. The solar modules can also be used for overhead and facade installations without individual checks and additional security measures.
The solar array is 300 m long and is located near the SC Freiburg football stadium, which is already equipped with a PV system that utilizes heterojunction modules supplied by Switzerland-based Meyer Burger.
Badenova’s Badenova Wärme Plus subsidiary partnered with the city of Freiburg and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in the construction of the cycle path. Freiburg-based company Clickcon provided the mounting structures.
The energy generated by the facility – around 280 MWh per year – will be primarily used in the laboratories and buildings of Fraunhofer ISE. The Freiburg Institute is also the leaseholder and operator of the facility and will be responsible for monitoring.
“We have to rethink photovoltaics so that we can integrate further projects of this kind into the cityscape. This pilot project shows how urban spaces can be used twice,” said Heinz-Werner Hölscher, a Badenova board member.
