The mission envisages to identify and develop regions capable of supporting large-scale production and/or utilization of hydrogen with central financial assistance (CFA) for developing the core infrastructure.
It is planned to set up at least two such green hydrogen hubs by FY 2025-26 with central financial support of INR 100 crore each for supporting the core infrastructure. The hydrogen hub should have a planned capacity of at least 100,000 mtpa.
A scheme implementing agency nominated by MNRE will invite proposals for the projects. The projects will be evaluated based on the planned production capacity (weightage 50%), technology, applications and end use (weightage 20%), and financial commitment (weightage 30%). Evaluation of proposal on this assessment criteria will be given a weightage of 80% with the balance 20% on the basis of the presentation made before the evaluation committee. The letter of award will be issued to the executing agency upon administrative sanction from MNRE.
The CFA will be disbursed to the winning projects as follows: 20% on the date of issue of administrative approval, 70% based on milestones achieved, and 10% on the completion of construction and commissioning.
The objective of the National Green Hydrogen Mission is to identify and develop regions capable of supporting large-scale production and/or utilisation of hydrogen; develop green hydrogen projects in the hubs in an integrated manner to allow pooling of resources and achievement of scale; enhance the cost-competitiveness of green hydrogen and its derivatives; encourage large-scale utilisation and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives; and enhance the viability of green hydrogen assets across the value chain.
The core infrastructure to be supported includes storage and transportation facilities for green hydrogen and its derivatives, pipeline infrastructure, green hydrogen-powered vehicle re-fuelling facility, hydrogen compression and liquefaction technologies, hydrogen storage systems, water treatment and storage facility, bunkering facilities in case of ports, infrastructure upgradation for shipping, power transmission infrastructure to the nearest existing grid substation, land re-development, energy storage to manage RE intermittency, effluent treatment plants, etc.

However, this burgeoning sector presents a new challenge: the responsible management of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries that power these vehicles.  As the use of Li-ion batteries explodes, India has a unique opportunity to establish itself as a leader in the sustainable and responsible recycling of these critical components.
JMK Research estimates that India’s Li-ion battery market will reach a staggering 132 GWh by 2030, translating to a potential $1 billion opportunity in the battery recycling sector. This growth is driven by the government’s push for electric mobility, with ambitious targets like the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020.
A robust Li-ion battery recycling industry is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability of this sector. Li-ion batteries contain valuable materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, which can be recovered and reused in new batteries.  Effective recycling reduces reliance on virgin resources, minimises environmental impact, and fosters a circular economy for Li-ion batteries.
The Indian government is taking proactive steps to establish a Li-ion battery recycling ecosystem. The Ministry of Power released the Battery Waste Management Rules in August 2022. This policy enforces Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), making manufacturers accountable for battery collection and recycling.
Additionally, NITI Aayog collaborated with the UK government to create a roadmap for the battery reuse and recycling market. This roadmap outlines key strategies for developing a sustainable recycling ecosystem, including establishing collection centres, promoting technological advancements, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders. These initiatives highlight India’s commitment to building a circular economy for Li-ion batteries and mitigating the environmental impact of the EV revolution.
Despite the challenges, India has the opportunity to establish a leadership position in sustainable Li-ion battery recycling by focusing on the following:

6,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/18/solar-asset-underperformance-estimated-to-cause-4-6-billion-in-preventable-losses/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-18,Solar asset underperformance estimated to cause $4.6 billion in preventable losses,"From pv magazine USA
The global solar market continues to grow, as an estimated 413 GW was installed in 2023, rising 58% year-over-year, according to Bloomberg NEF. Along with this growth comes a rising trend in system underperformance, said a report from Raptor Maps.
Raptor Maps analyzed data collected from drones, robotics, application program interfaces (API) and Ínternet of Things (IoT) sensors. The company operates an AI-driven “drone in a box” that it deploys at solar facilities. Its dataset comprises 125 GW of PV assets, spanning 41 countries.
Among the analyzed assets, the company found $177.7 million in preventable annualized revenue losses. Extrapolated to solar assets worldwide, this would equate to $4.6 billion in potential annual revenue losses.
The report found average losses of $4,696 per MW, though losses varied regionally. Since 2019, the average losses from underperformance have increased from a 1.61% average power loss to 4.47% in 2023. Raptor Maps said this equates to an internal rate of return at loss of at least 190 basis points in a 100 MW solar asset.
One factor in increased average power losses is the increase in average system size. Raptor Maps said larger projects tend to have a higher loss percentage. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that average solar project sizes have grown from 13.9 MW in 2019 to 59.6 MW in 2023, contributing to increased average losses.
Furthermore, inefficiencies in operations and maintenance are causing potential revenue losses, said the report. In a 2023 survey, the company found “many operators identified preventative maintenance visual inspections as a significant source of time wastage, and a large number of respondents also identified validating nuisance alarms as another way time is wasted.”
Regionally, preventable losses vary widely. In the Midwest, average annual losses were modeled at $4,052 per MW, while in the Northeast, losses exceeded $6,108 per MW. The report noted that asset underperformance losses are lower in the U.S. than the global average.
What causes underperformance?
Raptor Maps identified several sources of power losses. The largest fault, following a historical trend, was at the system level. Inverter faults, string outages, and combiner faults contributed to power losses of 1.91%, 0.90%, and 0.81% respectively. Instances of tracker issues have also risen from 0.26% in 2022 to 0.46% in 2023.

Raptor Maps noted that module performance has improved slightly, with losses decreasing by about 12% year-over-year. However, with extreme weather events on the rise, median annual power losses attributed to weather events are about 1%. In certain extreme events, weather-related losses can lead to losses of up to 60%, said Raptor Maps. Hail events, particularly in booming solar markets like Texas, are a significant risk for solar asset operations.
Risk profiles vary by module type, said Raptor Maps. Thin-film modules averaged lower power losses from defects and manufacturing anomalies than polycrystalline and monocrystalline. However, thin-film modules were twice as likely to have physical damage as polycrystalline modules, and three-and-a-half times more likely to sustain physical damage than monocrystalline modules.

When testing under ambient conditions, the team recorded an efficiency of 11% for 50 cm² large-scale solar panels consisting of optimized roll-to-roll fabricated hybrid perovskite solar cells and up to 15.5% efficiency on individual small-area cells.
CSIRO said scaling up production while maintaining efficiency has long been a hurdle for printed solar cell technology, with many researchers achieving efficiency levels of 1% to 2% for fully printed flexible solar panels.
The researchers’ hybrid perovskite solar cell modules consist of serially-interconnected cells, produced entirely using industrial roll-to-roll printing tools akin to how a newspaper is printed, and replacing metal electrodes with perovskite-friendly carbon electrodes.
The team used automated fabricated and screening systems capable of producing and testing more than 10,000 solar cells per day. They said this allowed them to quickly pinpoint the ideal settings for various parameters, leading to a substantial increase in efficiency outcomes.
The CSIRO said the results are the culmination of more than a decade of research and development. It it is now actively seeking industry partners to further develop and commercialize the technology.
The researchers said the flexible printed solar cells could be used in industries such as defense, emergency management, construction, agriculture, mining, space exploration and urban infrastructure.
It said their solar cells’ shorter energy payback time and projected low costs make them an economical and environmentally attractive renewable energy solution. The researchers estimate a cost of around $0.70 for a production rate of 1,000,000 m² per year in Australia, with potential for further significant cost reductions.
CSIRO’s project has been completed in collaboration with researchers from the University of Cambridge, Monash University, the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales.
The research, “The first demonstration of entirely roll-to-roll fabricated perovskite solar cell modules under ambient room conditions”, has been published in the 15th edition of the Nature Communications journal.
