“Solar-powered irrigation is a huge opportunity for India,” said author Kashish Shah, IEEFA Research Analyst. “But despite the clear multiple commercial benefits, the rollout of solar pumps has been much slower than anticipated.”
The report calls for a renewed push on the installation of solar-powered pumps under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s INR34,422 crore (US$4.7 billion) PM-KUSUM scheme, which has a 2022 target of 30.8 GW of solar capacity (revised from 25.75 GW earlier), including about two million off-grid pumps.
According to the MNRE data, against the ambitious target of installing two million off-grid solar pumps, only 246,000 pumps were installed by the end of FY2019-20. The PM-KUSUM scheme should have accelerated the process of pump deployment, however, the report noted only 8,900 pumps were deployed in the 12 months after the formalization of the scheme.
By comparison, the number of fossil-fuel-powered water pumps in India totals more than 8.8 million.
Compared to utility-scale solar, distributed PV generation reduces the need to expand transmission capacity and doesn’t require large land areas.
Shah said increasing distributed solar capacity through the installation of solar pumps would support India’s near-term renewable energy target of 175GW by 2022, including 100GW of solar capacity.
Further, “replacing fleets of diesel generators in the agricultural sector would reduce emissions and air pollution and contribute to the government’s efforts to promote a self-reliant India by reducing reliance on costly, subsidized diesel imports.” 
“Solar pumps would also reduce the burden on distribution companies (discoms) of providing highly subsidized power to the agricultural sector. This could potentially even lead to reductions in tariffs for commercial and industrial consumers who cross-subsidize electricity for agriculture,” Shah added.
The report cites lack of coordination among state-level bodies, affordability, asset ownership, and technology as key challenges impeding India’s uptake of solar pumps. It notes information asymmetry across state discoms, agricultural department, minor irrigation department and other State-designated departments in the scheme implementation. 
Investing in the upfront cost of the pump and accessing formal bank credit remains a challenge for small and marginal farmers despite the central and state governments providing financial assistance for 30% of the cost.
The report stated different models of asset ownership – farmer, discom, or developer – could play a significant role in the resulting viability of the pump sets.
“When it comes to implementing the scheme by the states, it’s a case of one size does not fit all,” says Shah.
 “Different models of pump ownership could work for different states or even different districts, depending on the dynamics of the agricultural and power sectors in that area.
 “Each state needs to zero in on which mode of solarising its agricultural power demand – off-grid or on-grid – works best for them.”
The report looks at the progress of solar pump deployment in three states; Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, and notes the ambitious approach taken by Andhra Pradesh to solarise the state’s entire agricultural demand through distributed solar, as well as using the enormous cost advantages of centralised utility-scale solar as an alternative.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/11/surge-in-solar-panel-and-polysilicon-prices-may-impact-projects-in-india/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COVID-19,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SOLAR GLASS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"JUNE 11, 2021",Surge in solar panel and polysilicon prices may impact projects in India,"Cost reduction, a major selling point that made solar power the world’s fastest-growing power source, has hit a rough patch. Solar module prices have risen 18% since the beginning of the year 2021 after falling 90% over the past decade. 
This spike in solar module prices comes in the backdrop of India’s decision to levy 40% basic customs duty (BCD) on solar modules and 25% on solar cells from April 1, 2022.
“We are seeing an upward movement in solar panel prices from China in the last two quarters. The global supply chain disruption that started with the pandemic has exacerbated with container shortages, winter weather, factory fires, plastic price increase, and logistics woes,” said the chairman and managing director of a leading clean energy solutions provider.
­­Refer the price variation in the past decade in the graph shown in Figure 1.
This reversal can affect the solar projects in two ways: delay them beyond timelines and even slower adoption of solar power, just as several major economies have started to acknowledge the contribution of solar power in slowing the rate of climate change. 
Let us understand the reasons for this price rise and its most likely impact on the Indian solar industry.
Shortage of raw material supply. This increase in prices is attributed to the shortage of raw materials supply to manufacture PV modules (such as polysilicon, glass, and silver) and lack of manufacturing capacity to meet the current strong demand. 
Glass and polysilicon manufacturers are trying to increase their capacity, but it takes time to set up production lines with additional factories. Rapid global demand is unlikely to prevent price increases for at least the next six months or more until sufficient capacity is added. Moreover, most of the solar modules demand is being met by China. This geographical concentration further fuels the rise.
Increase in raw material prices. Glass prices increased by about 80% per square meter between June 2020 and February 2021, according to PV Insights. Polysilicon and silver prices also increased by 64% and 55%, respectively. 
Polysilicon manufacturers have been unable to keep up with the expected increase in module demand as the solar industry responds. Polysilicon prices have hit their highest levels in nearly a decade. 
According to analysts at Los Capital Partners, polysilicon prices are expected to remain high through the end of 2022. 
Also, the problem is not limited to polysilicon. The photovoltaic industry is facing an expanding upstream supply chain cost challenge. 
Refer Figure 2 showing the price rise of polysilicon in the last decade.
Negative supply shock in China. Due to supply disruptions caused by floods in Southeast China, module prices began to rise in mid-2020, which led to the temporary closure of Tongwei Solar, a major polysilicon-producing company. An explosion at GCL Poly, another large polysilicon-producing company, also affected the supplies adversely.  
Increase in bifacial demand. Prices stabilized after a while but began to rise in the fourth quarter of 2020 as demand for bifacial modules increased around the world. Bifacial modules can generate solar energy from both sides of the panel. These are more efficient but require more glass than a multi or mono perc module. 
Rise in logistics cost. Indian solar developers were facing a new challenge while importing modules. The majority of the solar panels and modules (85-90%) arrive from China via sea route. Due to the shortage of shipping containers, freight rates, too, have shot up 5-8 times, pushing up module prices even higher in Q4 of 2020.
Investment returns might take a hit. With 85-90% of the solar modules used in India imported from China, this steep increase in prices has worried developers who have won projects that are yet to be commissioned. 
Modules represent 45 to 55% of the project capex. In a very competitive market like India, independent power producers (IPPs) have lower margins, and even a modest increase in module prices will put more pressure on them. The higher price affects the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for projects that already have a power purchase agreement (PPA) in place. 
Commissioning delay may pose additional penalties on developers. Developers typically purchase PV modules four to six months ahead of commissioning a project, but the recent price hikes have delayed the scheduled purchases. With India having strict project commissioning deadlines, a failure to meet them will result in penalties for developers.
Large-scale projects that have not signed price agreements (PPAs) with utilities might also get delayed unless the customer is willing to pay a higher tariff for the electricity.
It is evident that polysilicon shortage is here to stay at least till the first half of 2022. Furthermore, this will spread over to the whole ecosystem as other raw material prices like silver and glass are also on an upward trajectory.
Gurugram-based Amplus Solar has a PV portfolio of 800+ MWp, catering to a 200+ C&I customer base.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/11/acme-retracts-decision-to-abandon-600-mw-solar-in-rajasthan/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 11, 2021",Acme retracts decision to abandon 600 MW solar in Rajasthan,"Acme Solar is withdrawing its petitions to terminate the power purchase agreement (PPA) and transmission arrangements for the 600 MW solar project in Rajasthan. The clean energy developer had secured the project in 2018 at an INR 2.44/kWh (US$ 0.033/kWh) tariff in a reverse auction conducted by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
Last year, in a petition with regulator Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), Acme had submitted its decision to terminate the PPA contract with the SECI as it feared Covid-19-affected commissioning of the project would stretch beyond the six-month extension from the scheduled date enshrined in the agreement. It also cited delays in securing land for a necessary substation and the commissioning of associated transmission network infrastructure.
The fresh move to withdraw from project cancellation follows the announcement of Norway’s Scatec acquiring a 50% stake in Acme’s 900 MW solar assets in Rajasthan. However, it’s not clear how much of the capacity won at INR 2.44 falls under this arrangement.
Furthermore, a series of auctions in India have recently seen the discovery of much lower tariffs. Last year, in Rajasthan itself, a 1.07 GW auction attracted a tariff of INR 2/kWh (US$0.027). The tariffs touched an all-time low of INR 1.99/kWh (US$ 0.027/kWh) in a 500 MW Gujarat auction. More recently, Gujarat’s 500 MW solar auction saw an aggressive tariff of INR 2.20/kWh (US$ 0.030/kWh) despite the basic customs duty impact.
Acme has formed special-purpose vehicles ACME Phalodi, ACME Raisar, ACME Deoghar, and ACME Dhaulpur to develop and commission 2×300 MW solar power projects located in Tehsil Pokhran, Rajasthan.
SECI has already extended the scheduled commissioning date (SCOD) of the projects by 481 days on account of force majeure events; the revised commissioning dates for the two projects now fall in February and March 2022, respectively, as against October and November 2020 set earlier.
Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) has, however, refused to extend long-term access (LTA) commencement date in line with SECI’s SCOD extension and extended the LTA by only five months only as per power ministry’s letter dated July 27, 2020—even though the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (through its order dated February 9, 2021) allowed a further 5-month extension on case-to-case basis.
In its fresh submission to CERC, ACME said it is not liable to pay transmission charges as per the Regulation 13(3) of the 2020 Sharing Regulations in view of SCOD extension by SECI on account of force majeure events and PGCIL should be restrained from taking any coercive action against Acme including imposition of penalty.
“The contract is not frustrated, and the Petitioners (Acme) are not seeking discharge from the contract,” Acme said.
