Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, and the Austrian Institute of Technology, have developed a PV system solution for motorways.
The demonstrator consists of a PV system with a 10x17m roof area that has to be installed on a steel structure about 5.5m above the road. Construction on the pilot project is expected to begin next autumn and its operations will be then monitored for about a year. Based on the experience gained, further pilot applications may be implemented.
The project is part of the joint road construction research carried out by Germany, Austria and Switzerland. “With the research project, we want to develop the potential of the highways for the generation of renewable energies,” explained Steffen Bilger, German state secretary at the Federal Ministry of Transport. He emphasized that the roofing of a motorway is a particular technical challenge because of the fast-moving traffic underneath. “But the vision of using an area that has already been sealed off, for the generation of the energy that is needed underneath by electric vehicles, has to be pursued,” said Bilger.
The German Federal Ministry of Transport pointed out that building PV systems over roads is significantly more expensive than rooftop PV or ground-mounted solar plants. In the event of an accident on the road underneath, the supporting structure must be protected against a possible vehicle impact so that it does not collapse. To make matters worse, from a length of 80 meters, such supporting structures would have to be classified as similar to tunnels and the structure would then have to meet even higher safety requirements.
Although the modular construction of the demonstrator has some cost advantages, widespread use of solar roofs over motorways is not to be expected in the medium term, according to the ministry. In comparison, there is still a large potential for areas on which renewable energy can be generated less expensively. But for special, locally limited areas of application, the experts see possible uses for a solar roof over motorways.

The company would set up the solar-powered EV charging stations under ATUMCharge brand to support the shift to electric vehicles globally.
ATUMCharge stations will be powered by Visaka’s flagship product ATUM, the world’s first integrated solar roof.
Visaka claims ATUM solar roof is the right product for these charging stations as it can generate 40% more clean power from the same given space than any other solar solution. Besides, ATUM roof will allow the entire electric vehicle charging proposition to move to 100% solar—a clean and green power. In comparison, currently, most EV charging stations use electricity produced by thermal power generation plants, completely defeating the purpose of moving to environment-friendly power.
ATUM is a solar power-generating roof with solar panels (made with poly or mono-crystalline solar cells) integrated on cement boards—a highly durable roofing material, making it the world’s first solar panel which can be directly used as a roof.
Unlike other solar panels that need to be separately mounted upon a racking system and placed on the truss, Atum is both the roof and the solar panel. It provides a sleek and simpler integrated solar rooﬁng system while increasing energy generation by up to 40% compared to convention solar rooftops.
ATUMCharge is also looking at partnering with other electric charging station providers who are either in the market or are planning to enter the business in the near future.

With the safeguarding duties slapped on foreign products due to be wound down in late July, domestic manufacturers are navigating turbulent waters.
Last year’s nationwide lockdown has this year been replaced on a state-by-state basis, enabling manufacturers in regions less affected by the pandemic to continue operating under partial lockdown.
Speaking to pv magazine, Bharat Bhut, co-founder and director of Gujarati photovoltaics manufacturer Goldi Solar, said: “Different states have different impositions of the lockdown. We are situated in the western part of the country, in Gujarat, which had a partial lockdown. Industries were allowed to operate at a normal scale, with most … of the logistics and services running normally. We faced very few issues in the supply chain and delivery within Gujarat. Only states or regions that had a stricter lockdown faced a slowdown.”
However, manufacturers have been faced with low demand as nationwide PV installation has slowed due to labor and logistics issues. 
“While there is no direct order stating that development [and] installation cannot continue in lockdown, we are facing logistical and labor issues,” said Bhut. “The demand has dropped as the installation is not at the pace that it should have been. We do not have enough offtake; we are seeing [less] demand than production.”
Haryana-based panel and lithium battery business Loom Solar also reported an impact on sales. 
“Almost all states had closed retail shops during this time so there was not enough demand in the market,” said co-founder and director Amol Anand. “Besides, warehouses were also closed as domestic demand reduced to 70%.”
Small-scale manufacturers have been most seriously affected, according to Anand. “Large manufacturers, with a plant capacity of more than 500 MW, at least have old orders from EPC [engineering, procurement and construction] companies so they are occupied in fulfilling them,” he said. “In comparison, small … manufacturers face many challenges, the biggest being financial liquidity.”
A sudden rise in raw material prices has applied further pressure on profit margins at a time when the duties applied to imported solar panels are about to finish.
The safeguarding duty on solar cell and module imports from China, Thailand, and Vietnam is due to expire on July 30 and the customs levy which will replace it is not set to kick in until April 1. Indian manufacturers fear that window will see Chinese manufacturers swamp the market with low-cost modules.
The situation is likely to mean long-term solar supply deals will not be viable for the immediate future, according to Goldi Solar director Bhut.
“It would be difficult to commit, on both timelines and prices, for a longer duration, owing to price fluctuations and [the] unpredictability of all variables: module prices, freight cost, unavailability of laborers etc,” he added.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/31/rising-hardware-costs-slow-covid-recovery-for-off-grid-solar-sales/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,ETHIOPIA,INDIA,KENYA,NIGERIA,SOMALIA,UGANDA,ZAMBIA",MAX HALL,"MAY 31, 2021",Rising hardware costs slow Covid recovery for off-grid solar sales,"From pv magazine International
The rising cost of solar system components – which drove prices up more than half in some cases in the second half of last year – helped dampen the recovery of the global off-grid solar appliance market in July-to-December period of a Covid-hit 2020.
That was one of the trends to emerge from the latest six-month report issued by Amsterdam-based off-grid organization GOGLA and the World Bank’s Lighting Global program.
The latest edition of the biannual Global Off-grid Solar Market Report estimated 33.66 MW of solar generation capacity was deployed worldwide from July last year, in the form of off-grid systems such as lanterns, fans, TVs and fridges, as well as multiple-appliance solar home systems.
GOGLA, formerly known as the Global Off-grid Lighting Association, noted a rise in sales of 50-100 Wp solar home systems as wealthier households moved to shore up grid power supply during the pandemic and speculated tighter family finances during lockdowns explained a shift from cash-up-front purchases to pay-as-you-go finance. The report also pointed to the effect of conflict between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, given the importance of the off-grid market in Tigray, which is attempting to break away from Addis Ababa.
The statistics showed a recovery of sorts after the initial ravages of the pandemic in the first half of last year, with 3.6 million solar lighting product sales up 19% from the January-to-June period but down 18% on the second half of the previous year. The nascent market for non-lighting appliances held steady at around 470,000 sales with the report adding it had been expected to expand last year, before the pandemic hit.
The uneven nature of the recovery was illustrated in sub-Saharan Africa, with solar lighting sales that were down 4% from the second half of 2019 overall featuring a fall of 10% in East Africa, the biggest regional market, but rising 19% in West Africa and a notable 40% in central Africa. By contrast, non-lighting appliance sales slumped 32% in the central region during the second half of last year, with the retreat only 11% in West Africa and 5% in the eastern region. The report also noted rising sales of ‘extra large’ solar powered TVs across East and West Africa, reflecting advances in energy efficiency for such products over smaller screens.
Policy support for off-grid solar in Somalia and Nigeria – the latter badly hit by Covid cases and the oil price plunge – was balanced by reverses in Uganda, caused by extreme weather events; Zambia, where companies were forced to make retroactive import payments for historic shipments; and Ethiopia, where the coffers of the World Bank-funded Development Bank of Ethiopia had been almost exhausted in 2019.
The study also highlighted the detrimental effect on off-grid appliance sales in Kenya after Covid expenses forced the government to rescind an exemption from VAT for such products. A similar, regional move saw the six-nation East African Community remove an exception from import duties for solar goods.
In South Asia, solar lighting sales tumbled 43%, from the second half of 2019, mainly because of the effects of the pandemic in India. A lack of micro finance in India worsened the picture, after the government failed to extend a three-month Covid-related repayment holiday for bank borrowers to micro finance customers. With sales tumbling, a third of South Asian retailers who provided information for the update reported figures down more than 50% during the six-month window.
The study also includes the East Asian and Pacific off-grid appliance market and the report’s authors said global investment in the sector held firm during 2020, at $316 million, but that figure included a 46% fall in equity investments into provider companies.
Calling for immediate provision of more grant and concessional finance for off-grid solar, GOGLA and its partners said the advent of Covid-19 across markets last year had deprived 10-15 million people, and 300,000-450,000 enterprises, of improved energy access.
The market report was produced by GOGLA, the World Bank, clean energy appliance NGO Efficiency for Access, U.K. government body UK Aid and Dutch consultancy Berenschot.
