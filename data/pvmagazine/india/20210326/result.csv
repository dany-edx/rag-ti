This loan will be provided through the private sector investment finance scheme of JICA and is co-financed with the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. 
The Government of India ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016, in which India committed to cut the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35% by 2030. To achieve the target, the Indian Government is promoting mitigation measures such as the installation of renewable energy (solar power, wind power, etc.), energy-efficient equipment, and electric vehicles.
JICA’s loan will support TCCL to mitigate the impact of climate change by offering green finance, which will contribute to decrease the emission of GHG in India. It will also contribute to SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) Goals 7 and 13. JICA will continue its support for climate change initiatives globally and continue to mobilize private finance for this sector.
Manish Chourasia, Managing Director, Tata Cleantech Capital Limited, said: “The partnership with JICA is a significant milestone for TCCL that will enable us to accelerate the pace of transition to clean energy in India. Our focus will continue to be to fund and support projects across Renewable energy, e-mobility, and energy efficiency sectors. Our aim is to channelize and mainstream climate finance in India to help mitigate the impact of climate change.”
 TCCL, a joint venture between Tata Capital Limited (Tata Group) and IFC (World Bank), is a private-sector green investment bank with a focus on climate finance and advisory services. It has contributed to the development of 9.8 GW renewable energy, which has averted annual carbon emissions of 15.1 MT.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/26/edelweiss-infrastructure-acquires-74-stake-in-engies-india-solar-assets/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,FRANCE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 26, 2021",Edelweiss Infrastructure acquires 74% stake in Engie’s India solar assets,"Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus (EIYP), an alternative investment fund (AIF) managed by Edelweiss Group, has concluded the acquisition of a controlling stake (74%) in French energy major Engie’s 813 MWp of operating solar capacity in India. 
Engie plans to develop 2 GW of solar assets in India over the next couple of years, which, once commissioned, will also be acquired by EIYP as per the agreed terms.
The transaction for 813 MWp will enable the French fossil fuel company to reduce net debt by more than €400 million, Engie announced last year, without revealing the transaction’s exact price.
Engie’s ‘develop, build, share, and operate’ strategy involves selling part of its stake in renewables assets while carrying out operations and maintenance.
“This partnership between EIYP and Engie is aimed at creating a high-quality solar platform of substantial scale with a plan to add 2 GW solar assets over the next couple of years. These assets developed by Engie will be acquired by EIYP post-commissioning as per agreement between the two companies,” read an EIYP statement. 
The investment was carried out by EIYP’s energy-focused platform Sekura Energy that focuses on investing, acquiring and operating assets in the Indian energy sector.
EIYP is the largest yield-focused infrastructure AIF in India and the only platform owning and operating assets in all three large infrastructure sectors—transmission, solar energy and highways. 
The latest investment is in line with its strategy to generate regular yield and create value for its investors by taking a controlling stake in quality operating infrastructure assets with strong cash flows. 
 “Acquiring operating infrastructure assets helps developers to unlock capital and de-lever, enabling them to take on newer and larger opportunities. As India transitions to clean energy, this model will be the core to the country’s ambitious renewable capacity expansion program”, said Hemant Daga, chief executive officer, Edelweiss Asset Management.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/26/indias-rooftop-solar-installation-still-dismal-at-3-9-gw/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 26, 2021",India’s rooftop solar installation still dismal at 3.9 GW ,"India has installed a cumulative grid-connected rooftop solar capacity of 3.9 GW as of February 28, against the 40 GW by 2022 target, according to the latest data shared by the power ministry. The capacity is only around 10% of the nation’s cumulative grid-connected solar installation (39.1 GW).
With 942 MW capacity, the state of Gujarat leads in rooftop solar installation, followed by Maharashtra (694 MW) and Rajasthan (419 MW).
No rooftop solar installation has taken place in Lakshadweep and Ladakh as per the ministry’s figures. 
Considering the average cost of rooftop solar plant installation as INR 5 crore/MW, the total investment made for 3.9 GW rooftop solar installation would be around INR 19,500 crore.
Initiatives
The need to approach multiple agencies was identified as one of the major reasons deterring customers from rooftop solar plant installation under the first phase of the Rooftop Solar Programme. To make the process simpler, the government has made power distribution companies (Discoms) and their local offices as the nodal points for implementing the Rooftop Solar Program’s second phase.
Phase II targets an aggregate 4 GW of grid-connected rooftop solar plants in the residential sector by providing central financial assistance (CFA). Discoms are provided incentives based on their achievement in installing additional grid-connected rooftop capacity over and above the base level. However, these incentives are limited to the first additional 18 GW rooftop capacity installed across the country.
The power ministry shared, “CFA of 40% of the benchmark cost is provided for rooftop solar projects up to 3 kW capacity and 20% for system capacity beyond 3 kW and up to 10 kW for individual households. For group housing societies/residential welfare associations, CFA is limited to 20% for rooftop solar plants of capacity up to 500 kW for the supply of power to common facilities.
“Discoms get incentives for achieving rooftop solar capacity addition in a financial year above the baseline capacity as on March 31 of the previous year. There is no incentive for capacity addition up to 10% of the baseline capacity, incentive of 5% of the benchmark cost for capacity addition beyond 10% and up to 15%, and incentive of 10% of the benchmark cost for capacity addition beyond 15%.”
Consumers willing to install rooftop solar plants under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s Scheme have to pay the plant’s cost after deducting the applicable CFA. The CFA amount is paid to the vendor by the Discom.
Industrial and commercial sector consumers, where the Ministry does not provide CFA/incentive, can avail concessional loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) through the State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank.
Besides, Prime minister Narendra Modi has called for a major city in every Indian state to become a solar city where all houses have rooftop solar energy plants and all the electricity needs of the city are met from solar energy or other renewable energy sources.
