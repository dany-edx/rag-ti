An international research team has fabricated a four-junction (4T) tandem solar cell based on perovskite and copper/indium/selenium (CIS) thin-film with a power conversion efficiency of up to 29.9%.
The scientists said they used halide salt methyldiammonium diiodide (MDADI) for surface defect passivation, which they said reduced the open-circuit voltage loss in the device’s top cell based on perovskite while improving the overall tandem cell efficiency and near-infrared (NIR) transmittance.
The scientists grew the top cell through a multi-stage co-evaporation process. The device was based on a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), a hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx), a perovskite absorber, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer (ETL), a tin oxide (SnOx) layer, an ITO layer, and an ultrathin lithium fluoride (LiF) interlayer.
“We then vary the optical pathways within the semi-transparent front cell to realize the control of the interference spectrum,” the team explained. “By matching the optical interference with the AM 1.5 G irradiance spectrum, the perovskite front cell achieves high average NIR transmittance (ANT) of 81.5% and an efficiency of 21.8%.”
The academics also explained that the MDADI-treated film can reach a much higher quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) compared with the one without the treatment. “The pseudo current-voltage (J-V) plot shows that the MDADI-treated film reaches an implied open-circuit voltage of 1.29 V, whereas the untreated film reaches only 1.24 V, and this marks a difference of around 50 mV.”
This top cell was then combined in a tandem device with a bottom cell made with a glass substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo), a CIS absorber, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, and a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO). This device has an efficiency of 17.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.60 V, a short-circuit current density of 39.7 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 72.9%.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the perovskite-CIS tandem cell achieved an efficiency of 29.9%, which the group said is the highest efficiency ever recorded for a perovskite-CIS tandem solar cell at the research level to date.
The scientists described the device in the study “29.9%-efficient, commercially viable perovskite/CuInSe2 thin-film tandem solar cells,” which was recently published in Joule. “These findings indicate the vast opportunities for all thin-film-based perovskite/CIS tandem cells in diverse applications and pave the way for their commercialization,” they said. “The combination of superior performance and cost-effectiveness makes them an attractive prospect for the solar industry.”
The research group included academics from the National University of Singapore, Switzerland’s Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA), and Germany’s Forschungszentrum Jülich.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/21/falling-module-prices-to-drive-record-16-gw-solar-addition-this-fiscal/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",Falling module prices to drive record ‘16 GW’ solar addition this fiscal,"A steady decline in solar module prices since October 2022 will boost the internal rate of return (IRR) for 45 GW of utility-scale solar project pipeline awarded since fiscal 2021. This, in turn, will propel solar capacity implementation to its fastest annual pace of 16 GW this fiscal, according to Crisil analysts.
Solar installation slowed down in fiscals 2022 and 2023 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic-induced disruptions and challenges stemming from the efforts to protect the Great Indian Bustard bird, for which extensions were given by the relevant authorities. That, along with an upsurge in module prices, had delayed project execution.
With module prices falling again, the end of pandemic-induced disruptions, and clarity regarding the protection process for the Great Indian Bustard (bird diverters to be installed on extant and new low-voltage transmission lines), Crisil analysts expect solar project execution to fast-track by fiscal 2026.
The trend of falling module prices reversed in the last quarter of fiscal 2021 as higher prices of key raw materials such as polysilicon and aluminium drove up the cost. This impacted the returns for 20 GW of projects auctioned in fiscals 2021 and 2022 — included in the 45 GW of solar project pipeline cited above — as developers had factored in the falling module prices when bidding for capacities; module prices are typically tied up closer to the installation period of 6-9 months.
Ankit Hakhu, director, CRISIL Ratings, said, “If implemented as per schedule, the average IRR of 20 GW projects auctioned during fiscals 2021 and 2022 could have fallen to as low as 5%, with some even becoming unviable on a standalone basis. However, the pandemic-linked extension in the scheduled commissioning dates provided relief to these projects, giving developers a chance to defer module purchases.”
Now that module prices have fallen 30% as of September 2023 compared with the average last fiscal, project IRRs may improve by 300-500 basis points (bps) to 9% on an average. [Here, the analysts assumed project financing in a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25, P50 plant load factors (PLFs) of 26-27% AC, a rate of interest of 9.5% on under-construction and 8.5% on operational phase debt, and interest income of 4% on reserves and cash balances.]
Varun Marwaha, associate director, CRISIL Ratings, said, “Softer module prices will also benefit 25 GW of capacities bid during and since fiscal 2023. These 25 GW of projects had higher bid tariffs (INR 2.5-2.7 per kWh) than the projects awarded in prior fiscals (at below INR 2.5 per kWh), as they factored in higher module costs, and should see their IRR improve 200-300 bps now that module prices have eased.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/21/cool-roofs-increase-power-yield-in-bifacial-rooftop-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RENEWABLES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",‘Cool roofs’ increase power yield in bifacial rooftop PV systems,"From pv magazine Global
An Algerian-Spanish research team has looked at how cool roofs (CR) could help increase power yield in bifacial rooftop PV systems and has found that the proposed combination offers higher energy yields than bifacial counterparts deployed on conventional roofs.
The scientists explained that cool roofs are roofs made of highly reflective coatings with a high emissivity in the thermal infrared. “They are normally used on building roofs because they lower their temperature compared to corresponding roofs without the coating,” they said. “They have been shown to significantly reduce the energy required for cooling buildings and the heat island effect in urban environments and can offer economic benefits.”
These roofs are based on coating materials with high reflectance properties, which the researchers said increases the radiation received at the panels’ backside.
The group tested its new approach on the test bench located on a building in Barcelona. The installation comprises four PV systems, each consisting of three bifacial PV modules connected in series. The systems are a reference monofacial array, a bifacial array above a conventional floor, a bifacial array above a cool-roof-coated floor, and a bifacial array above the normal floor with other types of PV modules.
For all systems, the academics used 320 W modules from Chinese manufacturer JA Solar and 1.5 kW inverters from China-based Solax. The testing period ran from April 2020 to November 2021. During the winter months, the surrounding buildings cast shadows on the arrays.
The analysis showed that the bifacial array above a cool-roof-coated floor achieved the highest energy yield.
“When a cool roof coating is used beneath the bifacial modules, PV production can be substantially boosted (+8.6%) compared to the monofacial solution, meaning an economic benefit about 18.3 €/kWp/year,” the group said. “Moreover, the [cool roof] coating can help reduce floor temperatures in unshaded areas during summer (−3.8 °C), potentially leading to significant energy savings in cooling the building.”
The scientists said that cool roofs could be either added to the floor of existing bifacial rooftop PV systems or used for new installations. “It is an already available market product with reasonable costs that offers dual advantages: increased energy yield and reduced building cooling consumption, both yielding economic benefits,” they concluded.
The researchers presented their findings “Experimental energy performance assessment of a bifacial photovoltaic system and effect of cool roof coating,” which was recently published in the Journal of Building Engineering. The research group is formed by academics from Spain’s research center Tecnalia, Algeria’s Center for the Development of Renewable Energies (CDER), the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, and the University of the Basque Country.

Enphase Energy, a leading provider of solar microinverters, announced it is expanding to the commercial scale market with its new IQ8 Commercial Microinverters. The inverters, called IQ8P-3P, are designed for small-scale commercial installations. 
Each microinverter supports up to 480 W of peak output power, supporting three-phase commercial installations and newer, high-powered solar panels. The new microinverters are compatible with a wide range of solar panels including 54, 60, 66, 72, and 144-cell panels with full or split cells, supporting panels ranging 320 W to 640 W. Full specifications sheet and accessories can be found here.
Enphase said its distributed architecture makes designing commercial rooftop applications more seamless, enabling flexibility in design for maximizing yield on crowded or shaded small commercial rooftops. 
“We have been installing Enphase products for more than 13 years,” said Jason Szumlansky, owner of Florida Solar Design Group. “Enphase commercial microinverters are a game changer — simplifying installation, improving energy harvest, and satisfying client requirements. Our first project was successful and we found that commissioning a new Enphase commercial system is as simple as commissioning a residential installation.” 
The microinverters are backed by an industry leading 25-year warranty for projects in the U.S. and Canada and 12-year warranties for projects in Mexico. 
“If low-voltage power and module level rapid shutdown, production optimization, and monitoring are a priority for a project, then the new commercial IQ8 Microinverters are an excellent solution,” said Jason Jackson, co-founder and chief executive officer, Hakai Energy Solutions.
The commercial Enphase system includes the IQ Gateway Commercial 2, an internet-connected portal that enables over-the-air updates and the ability to connect to the Enphase App production monitoring platform. Enphase Kiosk Software is provided to display system performance in real-time, offering marketing, brand value, and sustainability-tracking by showcasing on-site clean energy generation. The new microinverters also feature Enphase Burst Mode technology, allowing panels to start earlier and turn off later in the day where other systems would stop generating power.
Enphase said the commercial microinverters are available for distributor orders today, with shipments expected to begin by the end of 2023. Shipments are expected to begin from Enphase’s U.S. contract manufacturing facilities in the first quarter of 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/21/china-module-prices-hit-record-lows-operating-rates-estimated-around-60/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023","China module prices hit record lows, operating rates estimated around 60%","The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), which is the OPIS benchmark for mono PERC modules from China, and TOPCon module prices hit another historical low this week falling $0.008 per Watt peak (wp) and $0.002/wp to $0.130 and $0.140/wp respectively, according to OPIS data. Weak market sentiment and lackluster export demand continue to weigh on the module segment.
Module prices have fallen for a fourth consecutive week with CMM seeing its largest percentage drop of 5.8% in over two months. Most buyers and sellers priced mono PERC modules in the $0.120-130/wp range and TOPCon modules in the $0.130-140/wp range. Successively lower prices continue to emerge, a module seller said. “Now, we all don’t know how to predict module prices,” he said.

Module manufacturers have lowered their manufacturing output due to the oversupplied market, with one stakeholder estimating the segment’s overall operating rates are 50-60% lower than the previous 70-80%. A module seller said that his firm’s operating rate is now around 60%. “In the present stage, maintaining current operating rates is enough,” he said. Small factories “with inefficient production capacity” that can’t maintain rates will gradually exit the market, he said.
China’s export markets continue to look weak. Installation rates will slow as Europe celebrates the Christmas holidays in December, said one stakeholder. Low-priced cargoes continue to be offered in Europe, according to multiple people. People are frantically attempting to “clear their inventories,” said one module seller. Persisting with these low prices means “victory,” an employee at a tier-1 solar major said. “If you can’t carry on, you’ll go bankrupt,” he said.
Weakness was evident in other export markets too. Module imports in Brazil, the largest solar market in Latin America, could decrease at least 11.2% year-to-year, assuming total imports of up to 15.8 GW in 2023, according to Brazilian consultancy Greener. “Everyone is not doing well,” said a module manufacturer with clients in Brazil. According to multiple sources, prices in Southeast Asia below $0.130/wp for PERC are low but realistic.
Prices are expected to keep falling. One module maker is offering PERC modules at 0.99 yuan/wp this week, which is a signal that the market is on the threshold of the psychologically significant barrier of 1 yuan/wp.
The entire solar value chain will “go through a phase of inventory-clearing before the end of the year,” a module manufacturer said. Bottom prices across the value chain will come between December and China’s Spring Festival next year. After the 1 yuan/wp era arrives, “one may wonder when we will see [prices] below $0.10/wp,” a solar market veteran said.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
