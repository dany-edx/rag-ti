Ltd. has opened bidding for the development of a 105 MW grid-connected floating solar project at the Erai River dam, in the Chandrapur district of Maharashtra.
A single PV developer will be chosen to set up the solar park in two phases of 65 MW and 40 MW, on a “build-own-operate” basis. The project will be built under the Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Park (UMREPP), “Mode 8” of the modified Solar Park Scheme. Under this mode, state-owned organizations can serve as solar park developers.
MSPGCL will enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidder. The power will be sold to Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. The project must be commissioned within 15 months from the signing of the PPA.

To be set up on a ‘build-own-operate’ basis, the projects must be augmented with energy storage systems to ensure power supply during peak hours.
GUVNL may enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the selected developers. The applicable tariff under the PPA shall comprise peak and off-peak tariffs and shall be fixed for the entire PPA term. The energy supplied during the off-peak hours shall be eligible for a flat tariff payment of INR 2.29 ($0.029)/kWh. The price for the energy supplied during peak hours shall be discovered through an e-reverse auction.
The developer shall deploy a solar, wind, or wind-solar power project with an energy storage systems of a minimum ‘X/2’ MWh of energy rating, where ‘X’ is the contracted project capacity as per the PPA. For example, in case the contracted project capacity is 100 MW, the minimum energy rating of the energy storage system installed shall be 50 MWh.
Projects under construction and not having any PPA with existing buyers shall also be eligible under this RFS.
A single developer must bid for a minimum of 50 MW in case of solar and hybrid wind-solar projects with the co-located energy storage system. The minimum bid capacity for wind power developers is 25 MW.
“The developers can opt for connectivity at state transmission utility (STU) or central transmission utility (CTU) sub-station. RE projects will also be allowed to be set up in the existing wind farm which is already connected to the grid subject to availability of spare capacity for RE integration at corresponding GETCO/CTU substation,” states the tender document.
The commissioning timeline for the wind-solar hybrid project with an energy storage system is 24 months from the signing of the PPA. Wind or solar projects with energy storage system must be commissioned within 18 months from the PPA signing.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/17/battery-metals-how-quickly-can-supply-ramp-up/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JUNE 17, 2022",Battery metals: How quickly can supply ramp up?,"From pv magazine Global
At the end of May, US investment bank Goldman Sachs rattled battery metal stocks, forecasting that the price of three key battery materials – cobalt, lithium, and nickel – are heading for a drop over the next two years, as investors have piled in too quickly.
The electrification of the transportation sector caused severe shortages in the lithium-ion battery market last year, leading to soaring raw material prices. But in its report, Goldman declared the battery metals bull market “over for now.”
It went on to explain that the surge in investor capital into supply investment, tied to the long-term EV demand story, has resulted in trading a spot-driven commodity as a forward-looking equity. “That fundamental mispricing has in turn generated an outsized supply response well ahead of the demand trend in focus,” the bank said.
Goldman expects current lithium prices of just under $54,000/ton to plunge to $16,372/ton in 2023. Meanwhile, cobalt prices will go down from around $78,500/ton now to an average of $59,500/ton next year. As for nickel, prices should remain relatively flat, going from $31,000/ton now to $30,250/ton next year. Over the rest of this year, however, Goldman expects a rally in nickel prices to $36,500/ton, after which it will head south.
Between 2022 and 2025, the analysts expect lithium supply to grow on average by 33% year on year, reflecting the ramp-up of new projects in Australia, China and Chile. Cobalt will rise by 14% year on year and nickel by 8% year on year, against annual demand growth rates of 27%, 11% and 7%, respectively.
Pushing back
But some industry observers, including London-based consultants Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, are loudly pushing back. They argue that Goldman’s forecast that a flood of new production will fill the supply deficit is far from likely. Instead, Benchmark believes that lithium market will remain in structural shortage until 2025.
“As the market wrestles between long-term supply security to fuel the lithium-ion economy, and increasingly market-led pricing mechanisms to incentivise supply growth, the era of lithium market volatility is likely just beginning,” Benchmark said in response to Goldman’s research note.
The consultancy goes on to outline five reasons why it feels Goldman’s call is wrong:
High waste
But regardless of the speed of expansion in the battery supply chain, there is a consensus that global cumulative capacity is set to grow at an unprecedented pace throughout the decade. According to US analyst Wood Mackenzie, global cumulative lithium-ion battery capacity could rise more than fivefold to 5,500 GWh between 2021 and 2030.
However, according to WoodMac’s base case scenario, supply will not keep pace with demand until some point in 2023. One way to relieve pressure from the supply deficit of battery raw materials is recycling both scrap and end-of-life batteries.
According to WoodMac, current demand for key battery raw materials stands at 97 kilotonnes (kt) for lithium, 186 kt cobalt and 3,014 kt nickel. By 2030, these are expected to grow to 318 kt, 264 kt and 4,273 kt, respectively. However, supply from recycled materials are expected to reach 130 kt for lithium, 112 kt cobalt and 377 kt nickel by the end of the decade, the analyst finds.
Not easy
However, the challenges of recycling battery raw materials seem inhibiting at present. Firstly, recycling the cathode, which is rich in critical metals, is no easy business as it is overpackaged with pack materials such as casings, interconnects, cooling channels and others. Coupled with an industry push to use lower value materials, the move towards larger-sized EV packs is also a deterrence against recycling due to lower throughput, according to WoodMac.
Secondly, EV packs have long warranties and lifetimes. In addition, the emergence of second-use applications, like residential or industrial energy storage, will also keep end-of-life EVs from entering the recycling system.
As such, WoodMac believes recycling production scrap will be the main source of recycled material this decade. Globally, the analysts expects battery manufacturing capacity to grow 3.5 times to more than 4,621 GWh by 2030, with China leading the way. This presents an increasing market for production scrap.
“At the end of the day, the amount of production scrap or EVs coming to end of life will never be able to meet demand while demand continues to increase. There needs to be a push in expanding virgin sourcing while maximizing the recycling sector to ease the deficit,” says WoodMac research analyst Max Reid.

Rinnai Corp., a Japanese manufacturer of home heating appliances, has developed a new water heater powered exclusively by hydrogen.
“We have succeeded in the development of a water heater powered by hydrogen, which is sought after as a clean fuel source with zero CO2 emissions, in a way that addresses the issues of explosion risk and combustion stability,” it said, adding that the heater can be used for residential applications.
Rinnai is currently using the hydrogen water heater in demonstration projects in Australia, prior to commercialization.
“We will develop our products in countries where hydrogen will be quickly available,” the company said. “This latest breakthrough will be an absolute game-changer, both for our business and for the wider gas industry. It will mark the beginning of bringing proven household appliances that can run on 100% renewable gas to market.”
In the past, Rinnai has developed a gas water heater that can operate with 20% hydrogen or methane blending. It also recently tested tankless water heaters that can work with 30% hydrogen or methane blending, without the need for product upgrades or modifications.
