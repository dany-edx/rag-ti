The mini-grid was recently set up at the institute’s Center for Excellence in Farm Machinery (CoEFM) residential colony in the Ludhiana district of Punjab to provide 24×7 power.
The all-renewables-powered system generates enough power to meet the residential colony’s lighting requirements and run 10hp and 5hp agricultural pumps.
The mini-grid uses solar trees of different capacities (three trees of 11.375 kWp capacity each, one 8.125 kWp, and two 3.05 kWp). A fully automatic biodiesel plant of 1 tonne/day capacity (8 hours) is being used to produce the necessary fuel to run the generators. The biodiesel plant, recently developed by the Centre, can produce biodiesel from any feedstock (waste vegetable oil, used cooking oil, animal tallow, etc). 
On the system’s launch, Harish Hirani, director, CSIR-CMERI, said, “Currently, a major share of India’s installed power capacity is from fossil fuel sources like coal and diesel, which have severe implications for the nation’s energy security and environment. These high-power centralized generation systems also warrant investment in expensive transmission and distribution infrastructure, leading to higher transmission losses.
“In this scenario, localized region-specific distributed generation systems like mini-grids with small-scale renewable energy sources can be potential generators of electricity near load centers and can help in addressing energy needs of local communities. These systems can be a unique solution for uninterrupted power in remote areas, villages, hilly areas, etc.”
The hybrid mini-grid system developed at CSIR-CMERI also finds applications in Smart City projects because of its inherent smart features for integrating different sources. 
“Unlike in rural areas, cities have a higher domestic energy consumption along with huge fluctuations due to varied usage patterns, making the power balancing a challenging issue. Experiments were conducted in the CoEFM residential colony during different times of day, month and different seasons to understand the developed system’s performance under different conditions of loading, solar radiation, etc,” said Hirani. 
The future plan is to increase the mini-grid capacity by adding more solar trees and battery banks. Other sources of energy like wind energy and biogas can also be integrated into this system.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/03/longi-launches-420-w-panel-for-rooftop-applications/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021",Longi launches 420 W panel for rooftop applications,"From pv magazine International
Chinese monocrystalline solar module manufacturer Longi has unveiled its new half-cell Hi-MO4 monofacial PV module for applications in residential, commercial, and industrial PV projects.
The new module has a power output of 410/420 W and a conversion efficiency between 20.5% and 21.0%. It has a size of 1924 x 1038 mm, a weight of 22 kg and a total surface of around 2 m2. “The width of the module is standardized, while three different length options allow the Hi-MO 4m series to maximize the photovoltaic system’s installation capacity in residential rooftops,” the manufacturer specified.
“In terms of electrical matching, the current at maximum power of the Hi-MO 4m module is lower than 11A, which is a perfect match for the various brands of string inverters, power optimizers and micro inverters available worldwide,” Longi further explained, adding that the product also has strong resistance to wind and snow loads.
The new product will be part of the Hi-MO 4 series that Longi launched in early 2019 and includes two more panels: a 60-cell panel with a power output of 370-385 W, a conversion efficiency ranging from 20.3% to 21.1%, with a size of 1755 x 1038 mm and a weight of 19.5 kg; and a 72-cell panel with a power output of 450-460 W, a conversion efficiency ranging from 20.7% to 21.2%, with a size of 2094 x 1038 mm and a weight of 23 kg.
All the modules of the series can be used with operating temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C, while the operating temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree (Celsius). They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The junction box has an IP 68 rating. The panel’s front side is covered with 3.2 mm of coated tempered glass.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/03/ntpc-tenders-for-735-mw-solar-project-in-rajasthan/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021",NTPC tenders for 735 MW solar project in Rajasthan,"State-owned power producer NTPC has invited domestic bids to set up an aggregate 735 MW grid-connected solar capacity in Nokh Solar Park of Rajasthan. The capacity, comprising three blocks of 245 MW each, will be awarded to multiple bidders in single/multiple blocks.
The project is to be set up in complete EPC mode with domestically manufactured cells and modules.
The scope of work includes design, engineering, manufacturing, supply, packing and forwarding, transportation, unloading, storage, installation and commissioning, and comprehensive operation and maintenance of the plant and transmission system for three years from the date of successful completion of the trial run. 
To be eligible, the bidder should have a similar experience, as a developer or EPC contractor, for a minimum 40 MWp of cumulative installed grid-connected solar capacity. Out of this, at least one plant should be a minimum of 10 MWp capacity. The reference plant must have been in successful operation for at least six months before the date of techno-commercial bid opening. 
Or, the bidder should have executed in the last ten years an industrial project either as a developer or as an EPC contractor in the area of power, steel, oil and gas, petro-chemical, fertilizer, cement, coal mining including coal handling plant and/or any other process industry, worth minimum INR 200 crore if applying for a single block of 245 MW and INR 400 crore when applying for two blocks of 245 MW each. Further, it should have executed at least one electrical sub-station of 33 kV or above voltage level, either as a developer or EPC contractor, which should be in successful operation for at least one year.
