The projects would entail an estimated investment of INR 27,000 crore (around $3.27 billion) and provide employment to around 13,500 people during construction. 
Torrent intends to execute these projects over a period of five years. The projects would be executed at three sites identified by Torrent, namely, Karjat (3 GW) in the Raigarh district, Maval (1.2 GW), and Junnar (1.5 GW) in the Pune district. All the sites are off-stream, and the projects are planned to provide a minimum of six hours of energy storage daily. 
The increasing share of renewable power in the grid necessitates energy storage for load management and meeting peak demand. Pumped storage hydro is an established, proven, and cost-effective technology for firm, flexible, and dispatchable power. It involves a configuration of two water reservoirs at different elevations. Water is pumped to the upper reservoir during excess power when it is the cheapest. At the time of demand when power is expensive, water flow from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir generates power with a hydraulic turbine. 
PSH is a much superior solution than batteries for energy storage as it is cheaper, has a longer life of 40 years, and provides longer duration storage of 6 to 10 hours with the feasibility of multiple cycle operations during the day.
Torrent Power, with a turnover of around $3 billion, is one of the largest companies in the Indian power sector, with a presence across the entire power value chain of generation, transmission, and distribution.
Torrent Power currently has an aggregate installed generation capacity of 4.1 GW, mainly consisting of gas (2.7 GW) and renewables (1.07 GW). It also has a renewable capacity of 0.7 GW under development. To complement its growing portfolio of renewables and distribution, Torrent is strategically entering the storage space.

US-based startup Salgenx has integrated ultracapacitors with its saltwater redox flow batteries (SRFBs), resulting in enhanced power response, increased efficiency, and improved energy density.
The company unveiled its scalable SRFB earlier this year. The system features two separate tanks of electrolytes, one of which is regular saltwater. It does not use any lithium or vanadium and is membrane-free, unlike other flow batteries, thus promising big gains at the levelized cost of storage level.
The company claims that material costs of $5/kWh, $257kWh for system infrastructure, and a total system cost of $500,000, or $166/kW for the 3,000 kWh battery. The technology purportedly has a life expectancy of more than 25 years and a round trip efficiency of 91% at 10 mA/cm². With 125.7 Wh/L, its energy density outstrips that of most other flow battery solutions available today.
The Salgenx system circulates saltwater and a proprietary electrolyte through electrodes, which regulate the input and output of electricity from the battery. The battery is said to be suitable for an array of applications including grid scale power storage (both standalone or with solar or wind power), demand support, grid arbitrage, microgrid deployment, voltage and frequency regulation, co-generation, electric vehicle charging stations, and desalination, as well as thermal storage.
Now, with the integration of ultracapacitors, SRFBs are expected to deliver even greater benefits. The integrated system is said to ensure rapid power output within milliseconds, compensating for the slower response time of SRFBs and significantly boosting the overall power output of systems.
With the addition of ultracapacitors, the SRFB system is now able to efficiently handle short-duration high-power demands, according to Salgenx. This increased efficiency extends the lifespan of the SRFB and enhances the overall performance of the system.
SRFBs are known for their high energy density, while ultracapacitors excel in power density. Therefore, SRFB provides long-duration energy storage, while the ultracapacitors supplement it with high-power bursts when needed, resulting in a more comprehensive energy storage solution, according to the manufacturer.
“The successful integration of ultracapacitors with SRFBs will be a significant milestone for Salgenx and the renewable energy industry as a whole,” said Greg Giese, CEO of Salgenx.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has published a new market update on the outlook for renewable energy in 2023 and 2024.
It said global renewable capacity additions are set to soar by 107 GW to more than 440 GW in 2023 – the largest absolute increase ever. Solar will remain the main source of global renewable capacity expansion in 2023, accounting for 65% of growth or 286 GW, with distributed generation applications accounting for almost half of the expansion.
“Lower module prices, greater distributed PV system uptake and a policy push for large-scale deployment trigger higher annual additions in all major markets including China, the European Union, the United States, and India,” said the IEA.
However, the agency said that capacity additions will decrease in Brazil from 2023 to 2024, due to Law 14.300 entering into force in early 2022, changing remuneration rates for the distributed generation market. It revised its forecast for renewable capacity additions for 2023 and 2024 upwards by 38% compared to its predictions in December 2021.
“In the European Union, residential and commercial solar PV systems account for 74% of the increase to our forecast, with the majority (82%) of the rise coming from six key markets: Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Sweden,” it added.
The two main trends driving the revised forecast are the increasingly attractive business case for self-consumption since January 2021 and the market conditions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the IEA.
The agency said that it also increased its forecast for utility-scale growth, but to a much lesser extent due to permitting challenges, unsubscribed auctions, and long development timelines. Competitive auctions are expected to remain the leading procurement method in Europe, accounting for at least 65% renewable capacity growth between 2022 and 2024.
“Almost half of this growth will be from auctions for two-way fixed contracts for difference, led by Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain,” said the IEA.
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) and merchant plants are expected to account for 22% of Europe’s capacity expansion until 2024. Corporate PPAs will account for most unused projects, led by Spain, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Some unsubsidized projects are also likely to emerge in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Poland, according to the IEA.
“While installations being developed on a fully merchant model are likely to constitute a minority, PPA projects are expected to stack revenues by combining a merchant tail,” it added.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/06/effect-of-wind-on-solar-panel-cooling-in-desert-areas/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JUNE 6, 2023",Effect of wind on solar panel cooling in desert areas,"From pv magazine Global
While desert locations are attractive sites for PV installations due to high solar radiation, exposure to harsh climate conditions can significantly reduce the efficiency of the panels. One of the common problems is the overheating of solar cells, and the challenge is to find a low-cost, yet efficient cooling technique.
Now researchers from the Mohamed First University and the Green Energy Park in Morocco have investigated and quantified the effect of wind as a natural cooling agent under a hot arid climate. They exposed a 300 W polycrystalline PV module for six months (during the hot period of the year) in Benguerir, mid-south of Morocco, and measured the module’s electrical parameters together with the meteorological data using high-quality sensors.
Their results showed that, even in a hot desert climate, the wind has a positive effect on reducing the PV module temperature, improving electrical production as well as conversion efficiency.
Their data showed that the reduction in module temperature (i.e., the cooling performance) varies from 1.12 °C to 14.48 °C for wind speed going from 1 m/s to 5.8 m/s. This leads to a gain in the power output ranging from 0.12% to 7.18%, and an enhancement in the module’s efficiency from 0.04% to 6.45%.
Specifically, a wind speed increase of 5.8 m/s results in a PV temperature drop of 12 °C, leading to an increase in power production and conversion efficiency by 7.2% and 6.5%, respectively.
Additionally, the study evaluated the impact of wind direction and demonstrated that windward blowing (southerly winds) facing the front surface of the PV panel exhibit a more efficient cooling effect than leeward blowing (northerly winds), resulting in a temperature drop of 13 °C.
They presented their findings in the paper “Experimental Investigation on the Effect of Wind as a Natural Cooling Agent for Photovoltaic Power Plants in Desert Location,” published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
“These results may be important under the pretext that they may provide a good idea for the engineers to better select the hosting site of the PV power plants including wind speed and direction as a criterion, and also to better design the PV power plants in hot arid climates to take advantage from the winds and enhance the profitability and the lifetime of this last,” they concluded.
