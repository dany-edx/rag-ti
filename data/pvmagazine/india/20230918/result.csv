This is the first time that the lowest level was sustained for over a quarter of the year, according to a new report by Ember.
Fossil fuels produced 34 TWh of electricity from January to July 2023, showing no growth (-1.6%) in comparison to the same period in 2022. Meanwhile, solar and wind power generation grew 28% year-on-year to 27 TWh. Solar and wind combined with other RE sources including nuclear, hydro, and bioenergy make clean power generation in Rajasthan now on par with fossil generation.

From January to July 2023, electricity generation in Rajasthan increased by 4.4 TWh YoY fuelled by a growth in solar and wind. As a result, the carbon emissions intensity of power produced in Rajasthan in July 2023 was 422 gCO2e/kWh, 10% lower than in July 2022.
The state of Rajasthan has pushed for the deployment of solar and wind power fleets by administering its Solar Energy Policy and Wind Hybrid Energy Policy in 2019. In addition, the rise in demand for clean power in other states such as Delhi is attracting investments in Rajasthan, a state with the highest solar potential across the country, the report stated.
From January to July 2023, Rajasthan added 1.7 GW of solar and 500 MW of wind capacity. As of July 2023, Rajasthan’s solar and wind capacity stood at 23 GW, accounting for 20% of India’s solar and wind capacity. Meanwhile, fossil fuel (coal and gas) based generation capacity has remained unchanged since 2022.
As a nation, India generated over 70% of its electricity from fossil fuels throughout 2023 (up to July), and 77% of its electricity across the whole of 2022.

Their study – “Feasibility analysis of green hydrogen production from oceanic energy,” recently published in Heliyon – underscores the significance of marine farms with capacity factors equal to or exceeding 50% and wind speeds surpassing 7 meters per second for offshore wind farms. Proximity to the coast enhances economic viability and flexibility while minimizing energy losses. The researchers said that the most suitable equipment for marine conditions are PEME electrolyzers, due to their faster response times to intermittent energy from marine energy sources. They also discussed cost-effective approaches to transport and store wind energy, electric cables for short distances, and hydrogen shipping for distances exceeding 1,000 km. For large hydrogen quantities, they recommend storage in salt caves.
Turkey has started talks with the United Arab Emirates to produce hydrogen and construct an offshore wind facility in Mediterranean waters. “We have a great potential in renewable energy, especially solar and wind,” Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar reportedly said. On social media, he outlined Turkey’s energy goals: 42,000 MW of solar, 18,000 MW of wind, and 5,000 MW of offshore wind power by 2035. He also emphasized Turkey’s focus on technology transfer in negotiations with Russia for a second nuclear power plant.
Lhyfe and Exogen have agreed to jointly provide decarbonization solutions for industrial steam, district heating, and mobility applications using green hydrogen. Lhyfe said there is a growing demand from multinational companies and industrial clusters seeking operational efficiencies through the integration of thermal and mobility solutions fueled by green hydrogen. These mobility applications include hydrogen refilling stations for forklifts, vans, delivery trucks, and cars. The two companies will primarily target industries with substantial process steam requirements, including pulp and paper, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and the oil and gas sector. Exogen provides hydrogen-powered steam plants, pre-assembled in container-sized units.
TotalEnergies and Air Liquide have signed an agreement for the long-term supply of green and low-carbon hydrogen to a TotalEnergies refining and petrochemical platform in Normandy, France. Air Liquide will build and operate the Normand’hy electrolyzer, with a total electrical capacity of 200 MW. TotalEnergies will supply around 700 GWh/year of “renewable and low carbon power” to the Air Liquide electrolyzer for half of its capacity.
TotalEnergies has also launched a call for tenders to supply 500,000 tons per year of green hydrogen by 2030. The French energy company will use it in its six European refineries in Antwerp (Belgium), Leuna (Germany), Zeeland (Netherlands), Normandy, Donges, and Feyzin (France), and its two biorefineries in La Mède and Grandpuits (France).
Everfuel has decided to prioritize green hydrogen production capacity development and reduce refueling network investments by high-grading its existing portfolio of refueling stations and projects. It said the decision follows a realignment of strategy, with a new focus on scaling green hydrogen production “to capture significant value creation opportunities led by recent market developments in Germany and Denmark.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/18/share-of-green-power-for-cement-companies-expected-to-increase-to-42-by-fy2025-icra/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023",Share of green power for cement companies expected to increase to 42% by FY2025: ICRA,"ICRA estimates the green power to account for 40-42% of the total power mix by March 2025 compared to around 35% as of March 2023, for the cement companies in ICRA’s sample set. 
The major cement players in the country aim to reduce their emissions by 15-17% over the next 8-10 years by increasing the share of blended cement, which uses less clinker and consequently less fuel, increasing the share of green power consumption through a mix of solar, wind and waste heat recovery system (WHRS) capacities.  The effort is also to shift to alternate fuels.
Giving more insights, Anupama Reddy, vice president and co-group head, ICRA, said: “The capital outlay towards green power investments by the major cement companies for the planned addition of 537 MW green power (solar + WHRS) is expected at around INR 5,500 crore in the next two years, considering per MW installation cost of INR 12-13 crore for WHRS and INR 4-4.5 crore for solar plants. Such investments are likely to result in annual savings of INR 2,000 crore in power cost for these companies once their planned green power capacities become fully operational.”
The cement industry is highly energy intensive and is one of the largest consumers of coal (as primary fuel), only behind iron, steel, and thermal power. The electricity requirements of the cement industry have traditionally been met from the state grid along with coal-based captive thermal power plants. Additionally, cement plants use significant quantities of coal during the clinkerisation process emitting greenhouse gases, which adversely impact the environment.
The extent of emission depends on multiple parameters such as the clinker factor, power consumption per tonne of cement, the thermal substitution rate and the green power mix present in the company.
ICRA expects the share of blended cement in the portfolio of major cement companies to increase to 80-82% over the medium term from 77-79% in FY2023. In addition, the cement companies are looking to increase the proportion of Portland Slag Cement (PSC) in the blended cement varieties as its manufacturing involves the low clinker factor because of higher usage of slag, thus leading to lower emissions.
The increasing focus on green power is likely to lower the cement industry’s dependence on high-cost thermal power and grid for power requirements, thereby reducing the operating costs and the carbon footprint.
Commenting on the benefits of green power, Ms Reddy added: “Assuming a thermal power cost at INR 6.5/kWh, WHRS power cost at INR 0.75/kWh and solar power cost at INR 4.5/kWh, a 25% replacement of thermal power consumption by green power could lead to cost savings of around 15-18% and an improvement in operating margins by 140-160 bps for cement companies, while also reducing the carbon footprint.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/18/getting-to-the-bottom-of-topcon-degradation/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023",Getting to the bottom of TOPCon degradation,"From pv magazine 09/23
Technological innovation continues apace, in a solar industry that could add 400 GW of generation capacity in 2023. This year could be as pivotal as 2016, when passivated emitter rear ccontact (PERC) solar cells supplanted back surface field technology. TOPCon solar cells are the front runner to become the new mainstream solar approach and are gaining on PERC market share. However, heterojunction (HJT) and back-contact cells are also rising in popularity.
In 2016, after PERC had already made significant inroads, researchers and test labs became aware of degradation issues. They saw that the technology was particularly susceptible to: light-induced degradation (LID) and light and elevated-temperature induced degradation (LeTID).
Once the root cause was identified, cell and module manufacturers quickly adopted mitigation methods in their production processes, ensuring PERC cells should not suffer excessive LID and LeTID rates.
In mid-2023, researchers and testing and certification laboratory specialists began warning TOPCon modules might be more sensitive to certain degradation mechanisms. The question is whether the issues flagged are indicative of inherent problems of TOPCon technology or are a result of the materials or process production parameters of these early modules not having been fully adapted to the specific needs of the technology.
The alarm was first raised by Paul M. Sommeling and his collaborators from Nederlandse Organisatie voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek (TNO). The team from the Dutch research body conducted damp heat tests to study the moisture-induced degradation impact of different encapsulation materials on performance in bifacial PV modules. It found that the front-side metallization of negatively doped, “n-type” TOPCon cells appeared to be more prone to acid- or moisture-induced degradation than positively doped, “p-type” equivalents.
The latest annual “PV Module Index report,” published in May by the Renewable Energy Test Center, a third-party testing lab, indicated that n-type TOPCon cells may have higher susceptibility to ultraviolet-induced degradation (UVID).
In June, Asier Ukar, director of testing body PI Berlin Spain, voiced concerns that manufacturers were not fully aware of different degradation mechanisms when switching from PERC to TOPCon cell production.
pv magazine has approached scientists and certification specialists at top institutes to ask them about TOPCon degradation issues. Manufacturers have also outlined the mitigation steps they’re taking.
In this first part of a two-part series, we aim to consider any valid concerns for TOPCon manufacturers.
Addressing these aspects will require the industry to implement appropriate measures in order to mitigate the detrimental effects that higher degradation sensitivity may entail. It is obvious that TOPCon modules should not exhibit higher degradation levels than today’s market leading PERC modules show over a 30-year lifespan under actual operating conditions – sometimes in rather demanding environmental conditions.
Any inherent higher-sensitivity associated with the transition from PERC to TOPCon technology should be clearly distinguished from any “teething pains” in newly released TOPCon modules that have been installed over the past 18 months. The term “teething pains” would characterize quality issues that arise when new technologies are introduced to the market in “version 1.0” or perhaps even in a “version 0.9.” Such problems do not necessarily reflect a TOPCon-specific issue but rather highlight the fact that certain processes or materials, for instance the encapsulants, have yet to be fully optimized and fine-tuned to the specific needs of TOPCon cell technology.
Technology issues with new products are not unique to the solar industry. Some manufacturers may simply be a little overly ambitious to bring a product to market, most likely at a time when the full qualification and optimization steps of all relevant process parameters in production have not been fully completed. Such an approach effectively makes customers “beta testers” of the newly released products. While this might be a viable development option for software, we consider it detrimental for photovoltaic products. After all, a “bug fix” for solar modules typically cannot be implemented by downloading a newer version, as is customary for software products. If there is a real issue then, more often than not, the modules already installed in the field will have to be exchanged, which is very costly and time intensive.
As always, a good reputation is easily tarnished. It is time-consuming and cumbersome to have to try to restore lost trust. It is hard to explain to customers that the “teething troubles” currently being observed with some TOPCon suppliers are not problems inherent in the technology but due to a lack of preparedness on the part of some manufacturers.
Just as a cook cannot prepare a three-star meal at their first or second attempt solely because they’ve chosen the best ingredients, it appears logical that it is impossible to launch a new cell type onto market that meets all quality requirements without passing through a certain learning curve. Noting here, of course, that the required lifespan is 30 years and more.
The necessary optimization routine equates to tweaking some process parameters and identifying viable process windows. Such fine-tuning can really only be achieved within a framework of trial and error even if the manufacturer has years of experience in PERC production and was fortunate enough to have selected the correct bill of materials (BoM) from the outset – which is an art in itself.
The PV industry continues to be under tremendous price and cost pressure so manufacturers always have to weigh how they put together the BoM for their modules; simply opting to always take the best components available is not economically viable. In fact, very careful consideration must be given to any decision-making process in which high-quality “ingredients” are deemed absolutely indispensable to create modules that will fulfil performance expectations over 30, 40, or even 50 years. It is necessary to identify the points at which low cost solutions may be sufficient without jeopardizing this goal.
In terms of the research conducted by TNO in the Netherlands into sensitivity to certain types of degradation in TOPCon cells, the researchers’ warnings center on three areas:
1. Are TOPCon modules more sensitive to water vapor than PERC panels?
We know that some manufacturers have indeed taken extra precautions with respect to this degradation mechanism, stating that they attribute this higher sensitivity to the corrosion of the finely-porous glass that is the “glass-frit” in modules. The corrosion reportedly occurs due to chemical reactions between moisture/acetic acid and the silver-aluminum paste and glass frit.
Christos Monokroussos, from the testing lab TÜV Rheinland Shanghai, disagrees. “The sensitivity of PV modules to water vapor ingress is predominately controlled by their encapsulation, and to a much lesser degree by the cell technology,” he says. “We do not expect TOPCon modules to behave drastically different from conventional PV modules when it comes to water vapor ingress.”
As a takeaway, one can conclude that the chemical reaction that ultimately leads to corrosion, and thus degradation, is already well known. So one would therefore assume that manufacturers have taken this aspect into account from the onset and have dealt with it through the proper choice of encapsulant.
2. Are TOPCon modules more prone to UV degradation?
To this question, Monokroussos says, “Yes, TOPCon technologies exhibit an increased sensitivity to UV radiation. The degradation is attributed to [issues with] surface passivation, which deteriorates after being exposed to UV light. TÜV Rheinland is, therefore, designing an internal standard to address UV-induced degradation of TOPCon PV modules. During this test, both faces of a PV module are exposed to an increased UV dose (10 times more than received in IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 [standard testing conditions]), which are considered sufficient to assess the susceptibility to UV-induced degradation.”
Monokroussos concludes that manufacturers must therefore pay special attention to the correct choice of encapsulant. “Both the front glass and the encapsulant serve as a UV filter for the solar cells,” he says. “But since TOPCon cells are inherently more sensitive to UV degradation, and the UV filtering capabilities of the encapsulant decreases over time as the module is permanently being exposed to UV radiation, a more UV resistant encapsulant has to be chosen and, typically, a thicker layer of encapsulant is being considered.”
3. PI Berlin’s Ukar says that TOPCon modules are more sensitive to potential-induced degradation polarization (PID-p). Is this view shared by other experts?
“Yes, n-type technologies, in general, are more prone to PID-polarization,” confirms Monokroussos. “The degradation mode is generally seen as reversible in the field as long as the module’s back side is exposed to UV light. Generally speaking, in most application environments, PV modules would receive some UV light from the back in the field yet there may be other application scenarios eg. roof-mounted installations, where the rear side does not receive sufficient UV irradiation, thus making these modules more susceptible to severe power losses arising from PID-p. Currently, the IEC [International Electrotechnical Commission] working group 2, which is the standardization group focusing on PV, is working on a procedure which would allow to identify the sensitivity of PV modules to PID-p.”
To summarize the three areas of concern, in all cases there are technological reasons why manufacturers should pay extra attention to these degradation paths. At the same time, there are also solutions available today that don’t entail the significant extra cost to contain these issues.
If there are batches of TOPCon modules installed in the field that now exhibit problems, it is much more indicative of a manufacturer releasing their product prematurely than a sign of an overall problem associated with TOPCon technology.
It might be tempting to take a gloomy outlook and wonder how long it will take until all TOPCon manufacturers have eventually adjusted their BoMs and production processes to accommodate these existing degradation threats. However, we received one piece of feedback from the research community that we believe much better summarizes the outlook for the PV industry as it stands on the brink of transitioning from p-type wafers to n-type wafers.
Radovan Kopecek, from International Solar Energy Research Center Konstanz, points out that while higher-efficiency cells can be susceptible to all forms of degradation, n-type has inherent advantages.
“N-type material is less sensitive to impurities and therefore degrades less in the field – if you understand what you are doing in the process,” says Kopecek. “If you have the process under control and choose a good BoM (for instance, double glass and POE [polyolefin elastomer encapsulant]), new n-type module technologies will be more stable.
“Unfortunately, when technology changes occur too quickly, products can be introduced to the market too quickly,” Kopecek adds. “The price pressure in the industry is enormous and currently the overcapacities created by the rapid expansions [of production fabs] is not very helpful. The industry must learn to play a global PV symphony and focus less on solo virtuosity.”
In the second installment of this series, we will compare and highlight the different approaches being taken by the leading TOPCon manufacturers to address these challenges.
