Su-Kam plans to produce e-mobility and solar energy products on the approximately 50-acre site at this Sustainable Energy Storage Park. As per the MoU, the company will be allotted the necessary land, along with external developments and other required infrastructure facilities. Additionally, it will receive connectivity to the highway and other incentives as per the government norms.
Sanchit Sekhwal Goyal, Director, Su-Kam Power Systems, said, “We plan to invest around INR 300 crore in the coming years and expand in green energy such as renewable, e-mobility, and other sustainable energy product segments. We will be producing EV batteries and chargers for both two and four-wheelers, solar panels, and expanding our solar range.”
Su-Kam expects the project to provide employment to more than 1,000 people. It has a vast network of over 10,000 dealers in India and a presence in more than 70 countries worldwide. Products range includes solar power generation system comprising inverters, batteries, etc.
“The Energy Storage Systems Division of Su-Kam is committed to developing futuristic products, moving towards the next generation of energy storage systems. We are very soon going to launch Lithium-ion batteries also,” said Goyal.

The capacity is tendered under the second phase of the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme.
The successful bidder’s scope of work include design, engineering, supply (except PV modules), construction, erection, testing and commissioning of the solar project. It will also provide five-year operation and maintenance support for the plant.
“Supply of modules is under the owner’s scope,” reads the tender document.
The procurement of solar inverters for the project must be done from Class I local suppliers only, wherein a Class-I local supplier means a supplier or service provider whose goods, services or works offered for procurement has local content equal to or more than 50%.
Bidding closes on May 26.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/14/amplus-led-opex-mode-rooftop-solar-installations-in-2022/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 14, 2023",Amplus led ‘Opex’ mode rooftop solar installations in 2022,"A new JMK Research report shows India installed 1,891 MW rooftop/on-site solar in 2022, including 378 MW in Opex mode (operating expenditure) mode, wherein a third-party company (developer/RESCO) owns, installs, and operates the system at consumer premises. Capex mode on-site installations (wherein consumers own the system) stood at 1,513 MW.
Amplus accounted for around one-third (26%) of Opex mode on-site installations in 2022 by deploying 100 MW.
JMK report projects rooftop solar installations in 2023 to touch 2.8 GW. 
“OPEX model is ideal for companies with expansion plans in tune with their green initiatives…. The customers avail saving benefits on their electricity bills, get closer to their net-zero targets and all this with zero upfront investment and no procedural hassles,” said Anil Bhat, business CEO, Distributed Solar, Amplus Solar. 
Rooftop solar systems installed under the OPEX or RESCO model require consumers to enter a long-term (up to 25 years), legally binding power purchase agreement (PPA) with the developer, thus making the latter the system’s owner for its entire lifetime. The developer provides operation and maintenance services while bearing all capital expenses and risks.
Amplus has developed a state-of-the-art in-house data monitoring system, Hawk AI, which helps track solar plants’ performance in real-time, thus ensuring zero downtime and increased productivity.
Amplus owns and manages a portfolio of over 1.4 GW of distributed solar assets. It provides clean energy solutions to commercial and industrial customers by setting up on-site solar projects (rooftop and ground-mounted) and off-site solar farms. It has also diversified into new avenues such as battery storage, residential solar, and electric vehicle-based logistics solutions.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/14/top-pv-module-manufacturers-by-shipment-volume-in-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 14, 2023",Top PV module manufacturers by shipment volume in 2022,"From pv magazine Global
TrendForce says in a new report that the top six module manufacturers in 2022 shipped around 205 GW to 211 GW of PV panels, accounting for 76% to 78% of 270 GW of module demand last year.
All of the main manufacturers are based in China. Longi Solar took the first spot with 45 GW to 47 GW, followed by Trina Solar with around 43 GW and JinkoSolar with 42 GW to 43 GW. JA Solar came in fourth with 39.75 GW, followed by Canadian Solar with 21.1 GW, and Risen Energy with 16 GW.
High-power, large-format modules dominated the market last year, according to TrendForce. With advancements in n-type technology, 210 mm products have already become mainstream and will continue to rule the market, said the research firm.
As of the first quarter of 2023, cumulative shipments of 210 mm modules have exceeded 120 GW, and the power of 210 mm n-type modules has surpassed 700 W. TrendForce estimates that large-format wafers, cells, and modules will account for more than 90% of the total production capacity, with 210 mm modules accounting for nearly 60% of the total production capacity.
The market share of lar-format wafers might increase from 83.45% in 2022 to 95.74% in 2023, according to TrendForce.
“In 2023, the production capacity for large-format wafers will hit 792.4 GW, showing a stronger tendency toward larger formats, while 210 mm wafer production capacity will hit 320.8 GW, increasing by 74.6%, with a market share of 38.76%,” it said in a statement.
As for cells, large-format units will reportedly reach 822.3 GW in 2023, or 94.99% of the total capacity. The market share of 210 mm cells may reach 67.9%, with a capacity of 587.75 GW, an 83.7% increase from 2022.
On the module front, large-format PV panels may reach 767 GW with a market share of around 90%, TrendForce said.
“Among them, 210 mm module capacity will reach 508 GW, a 68.14% increase from 2022, with a market share of 59.62%, indicating continued strong growth,” it concluded.
