Tata Power secured the capacity in an auction by KSEBL in September 2020. KSEBL will procure the solar electricity generated from the project under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA).
The project must be commissioned within 18 months from the date of execution of the PPA.
When operational, the plant is expected to generate about 274 million units of electricity per year, offsetting approximately 274 million Kg of CO2 annually. 
With this, Tata Power’s renewable capacity will increase to 4,032 MW, out of which 2,667 MW is operational and 1365 MW under implementation including 110 MW won under this Letter of Award.

The array, planned for the reservoir formed by the Omkareshwar dam across the Narmada river, will be the world’s largest, according to the state’s new and renewable energy minister, Hardeep Singh Dang.
That title is reportedly held at present by a 150 MW plant in Anhui, China which has been in operation since November 2017.
The 2,000ha Madhya Pradesh facility will require an estimated INR3,000 crore investment, according to Dang.
The minister said the plant is expected to begin power generation by 2022-23.
Madhya Pradesh Power Management Co, the holding company for the state’s power distribution companies, will buy the power generated by 400 MW of the site’s capacity.
Dang said the International Finance Corporation, its World Bank parent and federal power transmission body Power Grid Corporation of India will support the project’s development. The project’s preliminary feasibility study has been completed with the help of the World Bank.
Dang said Power Grid Corporation would start surveying the transmission line route from the project area to the Khandwa substation this month. A tender to study the project’s environmental and social impacts will also be issued.

Chinese solar manufacturer JinkoSolar has achieved 24.9% conversion efficiency for a large-area, n-type, TOPCon, monocrystalline-silicon cell.
The result, which was confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH), in Germany, improves on the company’s previous record of 24.79%, achieved in July. “The record-breaking monocrystalline silicon solar cell was fabricated on a high quality, low defect CZ mono-Si substrate,” the company said in a statement. “Advanced diffusion with highly activated dopant, high-quality surface passivation, JinkoSolar highly conductive passivating contact technologies, and a series of innovative technologies and material upgrade[s] were integrated into the cell process,” the module maker said in a statement.
In January 2020, when the cell had, still, an efficiency of 24.2%, Jinko said its cell was based on its HOT design and featured tunnel-oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) technology. The cell features a 267.72cm2 monocrystalline silicon substrate grown using the Czochralski method.
More details on the cell technology were not disclosed and the company did not say when it could be applied to commercial production.

The proposed capacity—to be developed in turnkey mode—shall come up in Cuddalore and Tiruvannamalai districts of Tamil Nadu.
The total capacity of 50 MW will be awarded to a single successful bidder selected through a reverse auction on the cumulative capacity.
The work scope includes complete transfer of ownership/lease of encumbrance-free land in favor of SECI, design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing and commissioning of the plant. The contractor shall also be responsible for the comprehensive operation and maintenance of the plant for ten years.
To be eligible, the bidder should be a body incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 2013.  
Foreign firms can also participate on a standalone basis or by way of a joint venture or consortium. In the case of a foreign company participating on a standalone basis and its selection as the successful bidder, it has to form an Indian company registered under the Companies Act, 2013 as its subsidiary company with at least 76% shareholding. The said company is to be formed within 30 days from the notification of the award.
