Kuldeep Gupta, vice president of strategic partnerships at C4V, told pv magazine that the contract is signed for supply over the next five years. Under the contract, C4V will supply its cells further assembled into battery packs. Initially, part of the capacity will be delivered from the USA and later the supply will be served from C4V’s proposed India plant. The batteries delivered would be rated 10.8kWh.
C4V recently signed an INR 4015-crore MoU with the Karnataka government as it plans to manufacture its lithium-ion battery cells in India.  
The company is looking forward to participating in the Production-linked Incentives Scheme (PLI) launched by the Government of India with a strong vision to set up the cell manufacturing gigafactory in India, Gupta told pv magazine. 
C4V prides itself as a technology provider at the forefront of the lithium-ion battery innovation ecosystem deploying its technology via global, strategic manufacturing joint ventures. The company’s core technology eliminates the need for cobalt and nickel, enabling a high-performing, cost-effective, safe, and environment-friendly energy storage solution. C4V is currently part of iM3NY and iM3TSV, two Gigafactories being set up by Imperium 3 consortium in New York USA and Townsville Australia, respectively. 
Part of the Omega Seiki contract is also expected to be fulfilled by iM3NY.
Omega Seiki Mobility is developing its own line of commercial EVs primarily deployed for last-mile delivery. Headquartered in New Delhi, it serves as a separate business auto vertical of the Anglian Omega Group. The company’s first vehicle – Rage+, was indigenously designed and developed at its manufacturing facility in Faridabad, Haryana. Launched in February 2020 at the Auto Expo 2020, Rage+ is claimed to be India’s first smart electric cargo three-wheeler. Recently, the company also unveiled a refrigerated vehicle, Rage+ Frost, to assist in the delivery of food and pharmaceuticals, particularly the COVID-19 vaccine.
Speaking about the agreement with C4V, Uday Narang, founder, Omega Seiki Mobility, said, “With this association, we will not only be able to deliver the latest battery technology but also help us in reducing the cost of the battery thus our vehicles. Besides, C4V’s upcoming facility in India will also help us increase our levels of indigenization even further. I am sure Omega Seiki Mobility is all set to revolutionize the India electric vehicle market with these new C4V batteries.”
Deb Mukherji, managing director, Omega Seiki Mobility, said, “With sustainability at the heart of our strategy and an increasingly important requirement for our customers and consumers, we are delighted to be working with our partners to deliver the best technology via our products to the market. The Cutting-edge lithium batteries of C4V will not only provide a solution to range anxiety but will also be value for money to our customers due to their long life and reliability. We hope to have a long and mutually beneficial business relationship with C4V.”

Chinese solar panel makers JinkoSolar, Longi and JA Solar have released a joint statement to announce they have reached a consensus on the standardization of PV modules produced with 182mm (M10) wafers.
The three manufacturers agreed that 54-cell panels will have to measure 1,722×1,134mm and have a mounting hole spacing of 1,400mm and that 72-cell products must have a size of 2,278×1,134mm and the same mounting hole spacing as 54-cell modules. Furthermore, they agreed that 78-cell panels will have to measure 2,465×1,134mm and have a mounting hole spacing ranging from 400mm to 1,500mm.
“Since the joint launch of the M10-type wafer standard by JA Solar, Jinko Solar and Longi Solar, in June 2020, the wafer size has been gaining widespread recognition and acceptance in the PV industry,” the statement reads. “However, due to the differences in the technical roadmap, design concept and installation mode followed by different manufacturers, the standards of the same type of modules vary in their lengths, widths and mounting hole spacings despite being based on the same M10 wafer technology.”
The new parameters are aimed at standardizing component specifications to reduce manufacturing costs and simplify design and installation in the downstream business, the three companies stated.
In mid-June, they jointly published a white paper intended to show what they believe are the advantages for developers of large scale PV projects of using photovoltaic modules manufactured with M10, 182mm wafers. In November 2020, the three manufacturers stated their combined production capacity of PV panels based on 182mm wafers would reach 54 GW in 2021.
The three manufacturers emphasized the increasing reliability risks associated with larger and more powerful products and reiterated the well-known saying “bigger is not always better,” heard in recent months from all those companies that decided not to bet on 210mm wafers and modules with a power output exceeding 600 W.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/14/jinkosolars-n-type-topcon-cell-achieves-24-58-efficiency-via-hydrogenation-treatment/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2021",JinkoSolar’s n-type TOPCon cell achieves 24.58% efficiency via hydrogenation treatment,"From pv magazine International
A group of researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), in Australia, and Chinese solar module manufacturer JinkoSolar, claims to have been able to improve the average efficiency of a batch of 50 commercial n-type TOPCon solar cells developed by JinkoSolar itself, by implementing a post-cell hydrogenation process.
Described in the paper 24.58% efficient commercial n-type silicon solar cells with hydrogenation, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, the novel technique consists of incorporating the hydrogenation step in the chemical passivation for the tunnelling oxide, polysilicon contact, during the high-temperature firing for metal contact formation. When applied to this process, hydrogen diffuses from the dielectric layer to the silicon dioxide/crystalline silicon and passivates interfacial defects. “The hydrogenation process was developed at UNSW and is incorporated into the production of n-type TOPCon ‘HOT’ solar cells in a fully industrial environment at JinkoSolar,” the researchers emphasized.
The cells were fabricated with monocrystalline 251.99 cm2 n-type silicon wafers that were diamond wire cut and pyramid textured using an alkaline texturing solution. Tunneling oxide was thermally grown on the cell rear side through a thermal oxidation furnace. Both sides were then passivated with a stack of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD), and hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx) layers, deposited through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). “Front silver/aluminium and rear silver contacts are screen printed with nine front busbars,” the scientists explained. “Cells are fired in a belt furnace to form the contacts, which also simultaneously allows hydrogen to diffuse throughout the bulk of the silicon.” The cells were then exposed to the hydrogenation treatment and heated to up to 600 degrees Celsius in a chamber for around one minute, which allows hydrogen to bond to dangling bonds and defects.
By measuring the performance of the solar cells, the researchers found that the cell’s average open-circuit voltage increased by 7 mV, from 696 to 703 mV, and the average fill factor from 82.03% to 83.07%. “These improvements indicate enhanced bulk passivation and slight surface improvement from the dedicated hydrogenation process, above and beyond the hydrogenation that occurs during the firing process,” the Chinese-Australian team stated, noting that the average cell efficiency grew by 0.64%, from 23.51% to 24.15%.
The research team also developed a champion cell with an efficiency of 24.58% which was confirmed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This device also showed an open-circuit voltage of 10.45 A and a fill factor of 82.5%. “This result highlights the potential for incorporating an additional hydrogenation process following firing for the manufacture of commercial n-type TOPCon solar cells,” it concluded.
