The Group will spend the amount across RE generation, component manufacturing, transmission, and distribution. It will make over 75% of its planned capex until 2025 in green technologies as it plans to triple RE power generation capacity over the next four years from 21% of the total power portfolio to a high of 63%.
Adani Group, through its arm Adani Green Energy, has a renewable energy portfolio of 25 GW—a target which it has achieved four years ahead of the 2025 scheduled timeline. The company sees itself well on track to be the world’s largest RE power generating company by 2030. It is already the world’s largest solar power player when accounting for its generating, under-construction, and contracted projects.
Addressing the J.P. Morgan 6th Annual India Investor Summit, 2021, Gautam said, there are economic opportunities arising out of the global effort to combat the climate challenge. This includes next-generation, high-efficiency solar panels, fit-for-purpose battery technologies, smarter and distributed grids, green hydrogen technologies, electric vehicles, and much more. Advances in digital technology and machine learning will further stimulate innovation across every single one of these technologies, and create their own markets.
“The marginal price of green power will drop steeply in the future as technologies mature and economics of scale kick in. This will enable the next manufacturing boom, which, in turn, will create new jobs.”
“Our integrated value chain, scale, and experience put us on the path to be the producer of least expensive green electron [electricity] anywhere in the world.”
The Group also plans to foray into green hydrogen with an aim to become one of the largest green hydrogen producers in the world, power all of its data centers with renewable energy by 2030, and make its ports net carbon zero by 2025. 
Adani Group is in the business of data centers in a joint venture with EdgeConneX.

The solar plant, at MRPL’s refinery site in Karnataka, was commissioned by Tata Power Solar and is spread across 34 rooftops within the refinery premises.
There are some sites inside the plant where the presence of chemical gases puts inverters at risk of rusting due to chemical reactions that can take place in a gaseous environment. GoodWe inverters still perform well in this kind of difficult environment. Featuring 150% DC oversizing and 115% AC overloading ratio, this 6MW solar project with GoodWe MT G2 series is running smoothly and efficiently, GoodWe stated. 
GoodWe’s MT Series inverters are equipped with IP66 enclosures, which means the inverters are protected from total dust ingress and high-pressure water jets from any direction. The C5 corrosion class also protects the inverters from high humidity and adverse atmospheric conditions.
The solar plant is generating more than 24,000 units (kWh) of electricity per day, which will amount to more than 8.8 million units per annum.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/23/rajasthan-now-has-the-most-installed-solar-capacity-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",Rajasthan now has the most installed solar capacity in India ,"Rajasthan has become the leading Indian solar state with an installed PV capacity of 7,737.95 MW, surpassing Karnataka, as per a recent report released by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India. 
Despite the challenging circumstances of Covid, the State installed 2,348.47 MW PV capacity in the last eight months. During this period, it attracted a record investment of INR 10,000 crore (US$ 1357 million)  in the solar sector. The State made unprecedented progress in ground-mount, rooftop, and off-grid PV installations in the year 2021. 
As per the MNRE report, Gujarat ranks third with 5,708 MW of installed PV capacity, Tamil Nadu fourth with 4,675 MW, and Andhra Pradesh fifth with 4,380 MW.
“The state’s Solar Energy Policy-2019 has played a very important for investors in the direction of making Rajasthan a leader in the field of green energy-clean energy. Also, the Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme, 2019 brought a revolutionary change in the field of solar energy in the state. Under this policy, in April 2021, customized investment proposals worth INR 34,200 crore (US$ 4641 million) were approved in the hybrid energy sector in the state. Most of these are related to solar energy,” read the state government release.
Notably, high solar radiation and an abundance of barren land make Rajasthan suitable for solar power generation. The State’s solar power generation potential has been estimated at 142 GW owing to its favorable conditions. The State government has set an ambitious target of 30 GW of solar power generation by 2024-25.
