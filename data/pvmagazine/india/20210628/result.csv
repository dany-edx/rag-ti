The BESS may be deployed at a single location or split across multiple NTPC power plants.
The applicants identified through the EoI shall be asked to submit proposals for undertaking projects.
NTPC Limited produces around 300 billion units of electricity annually through its more than 65 GW capacity comprising gas, coal, hydro and renewable energy based power stations across the country. Further, it plans to reach an installed power generation capacity of 130 GW by 2032, with 60 GW from renewables.
NTPC will increasingly be required to operate its conventional fleet flexibly to support the grid as the penetration of variable renewable energy invariably increases in India’s power system. Taking the first move, NTPC is looking to pursue grid-scale BESS in due consultation with POSOCO (an arm of Powergrid Corporation of India Ltd) and the Ministry of Power. The aim is to provide the Indian grid with a flexible storage system, test NTPC’s ability to integrate BESS into its future operational regime, and simultaneously extend the facility for ancillary operations by POSOCO to enhance grid reliability.
The BESS may be deployed along with thermal/RE generators for one or more of the following applications at a time: Store surplus energy during low demand periods and supply stored energy during peak demand hours; supplement thermal generation in meeting the statutory ramp up and ramp down requirements; ancillary services as per grid requirement; and minimize unscheduled interchange (UI) and optimize UI returns.

The project at Bada Talab in Bhopal uses cantilever (a beam anchored at only one end to vertical support) frame to support the panels on the retaining wall of the lake. 
The project uses 1540 solar panels, running for 1.2 km by the side of the lake.
“The project illustrates that rooftop solar program really means decentralized solar program and is not limited to rooftops,” said Manu Srivastava, principal secretary, New and Renewable Energy Department, the government of Madhya Pradesh, announcing the PV installation as the winner of an award by India’s Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.
The entire operations were completed in just 100 days. “Some operations were done at night since the lake is by the side of VIP Road, one of the busiest roads of Bhopal. The staff climbed onto a suspended scaffolding platform. During the installation, the water level was at its highest and solar panels were installed by staff standing on boats,” said Manu Srivastava.

The PV installation produces around 750,000 units annually, which is supplied to the Karbala pumping station. The pumping station pumps 40,000 cubic meters of water to a water treatment center at Shyamla Hills. The solar project leads to annual savings of almost INR 5 million. 
The project would help offset 15,375 tonnes of CO2 emission over its lifespan, which is equivalent to planting 24,600 teak trees.
The project has been implemented by State Discom MP Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd with financing from the government of India, the government of Madhya Pradesh, and Bhopal Municipal Corporation. The World Bank provide technical assistance. The project was executed by Madhav Infra Projects Limited, led by Amit Khurana.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/28/new-perovskite-material-for-23-5-efficient-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 28, 2021",New perovskite material for 23.5%-efficient solar cell,"From pv magazine International
A group of scientists at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) in Japan has created a high-quality version of one of the most promising halide perovskites – the α-formamidinium lead iodide known as α-FAPbI3 — for applications in absorber layers of solar cells.
The researchers explained that this perovskite material is fabricated by combining lead(II) iodide (PbI2) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) and that the reaction between them produces FAPbI3. “But this method is far from perfect,” they also specified. “There are often leftovers of one or both of the original materials, which can impede the efficiency of the solar cell.”
The Japanese group applied what it describes as a more precise powder engineering method consisting of adding formamidinium acetate (FAAc) and hydroiodic acid (HI) to PbI2, heating the mixture to 90 degrees Celsius, and then dissolving and filtering out impurities or unreacted materials. “When the perovskite’s absorber layer was formed from the original reaction, it was stable at high temperatures,” it further explained. “However, at room temperature, it turned from brown to yellow, which wasn’t ideal for absorbing light. The synthesized version was brown even at room temperature.”
This perovskite powder was used to build a small-area solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of over 23.5%  and a lifespan of more than 2,000 hours. With this cell, the academics were also able to build a 5 x 5 cm2 small-sized module with an efficiency of around 14%. “Our next step is to make a solar module that is 15 x 15 cm2 and has an efficiency of more than 15%,” said research co-author Guoqing Tong. “One day I hope we can power a building at OIST with our solar modules.”
The technique to fabricate the special perovskite powder is presented in the study “Removal of residual compositions by powder engineering for high efficiency formamidinium-based perovskite solar cells with operation lifetime over 2000 h,” published in Nano Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/28/ntpc-doubles-its-2032-renewable-energy-target-to-60-gw/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 28, 2021",NTPC doubles its 2032 renewable energy target to 60 GW,"NTPC, India’s largest power producer under the power ministry, has announced its target to install 60 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2032. The company is also aiming at a 10% reduction in its net energy intensity by 2032.
NTPC declared that it would form at least two international alliances to facilitate clean energy research and promote sustainability in the energy value chain by 2025.
The targets were unveiled in the recently held ‘Ministerial Thematic Forums for the HDLE’ event. 
NTPC had earlier planned to have a minimum of 32 GW capacity through RE sources, constituting nearly 25% of its overall power generation capacity by 2032. 
NTPC has marked its presence in coal, gas, hydro, solar, and wind and ventured into biomass, waste-to-energy, and mobility. It is undertaking extensive study and experimentations in the areas of carbon capture and hydrogen, and has also announced a few pilot projects on green hydrogen.
Currently, NTPC Ltd has an overall installed capacity of 65,825 MW. In FY 2020-21, it recorded the highest ever gross generation of 314.07 billion units against 290.19 billion units during the previous year. The total income was INR 103,552.71 crore as against INR 100,478.41 crore in FY2019-20, registering an increase of 3.06%. Profit after tax increased 36.16% to the highest ever figure of INR 13,769.52 crore.
