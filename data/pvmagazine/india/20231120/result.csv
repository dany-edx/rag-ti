https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/20/unlocking-the-solar-potential-for-tough-terrains/,"HIGHLIGHTS,SOLAR TRACKERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 20, 2023",The solar potential of tough terrain,"Solar tracker adoption has picked up significantly in Indian PV installations. What are the key growth drivers?
Solar trackers help in optimizing and increasing energy production while reducing costs. Single-axis solar trackers generate up to 20% more energy than projects which use fixed-tilt systems that do not track the sun’s movement depending on site conditions. 
The use of modern technology in photovoltaic modules has made solar trackers indispensable, ensuring optimal energy output regardless of geographic location. Bifacial adoption is encouraging. Due to improved tracker design efficiencies, there is an upward trend for adopting solar trackers combined with bifacial module technology in India.
As per a recent report by Bridge To India, improvements in bifacial technology, falling cost premium over monofacial modules, and growing industry experience are finally leading to large-scale adoption of bifacial modules in India. The LCOE [levelized cost of electricity] gain for bifacial modules over monofacial modules with fixed-tilt structures and single-axis trackers is estimated at 1% and 6%, respectively. 
Currently, the domestically manufactured module capacity is not enough to meet the demand from solar projects. Solar trackers play a significant role in enhancing the yield by up to 20% and help developers and EPCs narrow the gap.  
How much capacity has Nextracker installed in India? 
Nextracker will have over five gigawatts of smart solar tracker systems deployed in India by the end of 2024, with 80% of the components locally sourced. The combination of Nextracker’s hardware and software solutions benefits customers by accelerating construction and generating more energy in rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. These technologies deliver improved solar project profitability and expand the geographic areas where solar is cost-effective. 
We are rapidly ramping up supply capacity to support the country’s ambitious solar goals of 280 GW by 2030 with ‘Made in India’ trackers. 
Land and changing weather conditions are thought to be major constraints for tapping the solar potential in India. Given these challenges, what’s your focus when innovating pv trackers for the Indian market?
In India, the choice of solar trackers for PV projects is deeply influenced by the nation’s diverse terrain and unique environmental challenges. Nextracker has tailored specialized solutions for the Indian landscape, addressing critical concerns.
Nextracker’s latest innovation for undulating terrain doubles the capability of the popular NX Horizon XTR terrain-following tracker, which has been proven on dozens of utility-scale projects and in-use since 2019. 
NX Horizon XTR-1.5 significantly reduces and even eliminates earthwork on extreme terrain sites without requiring complex joints or additional components. It can save many tons of steel with shorter piles and thousands of cubic yards of cut and fill, with the benefits of accelerating construction schedules, minimizing environmental impact, and reducing project risk. 
Minimizing disturbance also prevents long-term soil erosion and preserves habitats, an essential factor when it comes to ease of permitting for new projects.
Another innovation Nextracker is bringing to the market expands on the company’s yield optimization and control software TrueCapture with Zonal Diffuse, a new tracking capability that enhances energy generation during rapidly changing irradiance conditions on utility-scale sites. This new technology includes spatial resolution sensing and control algorithms, adjusting trackers to variations in cloud cover across the entire power plant.
Plants equipped with Zonal Diffuse can “chase clouds” for additional gains without compromising tracking performance during clear sky conditions. Zonal Diffuse complements TrueCapture’s terrain-adaptive row-to-row tracking mode and Split Boost, a tracking optimization algorithm for half-cell modules.
What are the key design considerations for installing solar trackers?
Effective solar tracker systems require careful consideration of module types, soil qualities, wind dynamics, and corrosion resistance. Trackers are optimized when they are tailored to the unique module parameters determined by the EPC/developer. Soil stability study informs foundation design while understanding local wind patterns ensures structural integrity. The use of corrosion-resistant materials protects the system from environmental wear, maintaining its durability.
Is tracker compatibility really an issue for pv installations using newer technology modules? 
Module design is the fundamental driver of tracker design. Nextracker systems are compatible and integrated with every Tier 1 module. We work closely with our partners to optimize the attachment and positioning of their modules into our smart solar tracking systems and collaborate on next-generation technologies in our R&D facilities. 
One of the most exciting recent innovations in PV module technology is the introduction of large-format modules. The big modules offer increased power density and a lower bill of materials at scale. Due to their oversized dimensions and additional weight, these powerful products present mechanical, electrical, and weather-related challenges, requiring specialized mounting configurations and optimization approaches. Every Tier 1 module company has certified Nextracker’s compatibility with their products.
Due to large-size projects, a shift towards robotic cleaning is being seen. Nextracker offers robotic cleaning compatibility. Our independent row architecture enables robots to move to adjacent sections to leverage 2 km or more of cleaning per robot charge.
How do you foresee the growth of the solar tracker market in India?
India’s solar tracker market appears to be extremely promising. The demand for solar energy is quickly increasing, fuelled by India’s ambitious target of generating 280 GW of solar power by 2030. Solar tracker systems are critical in this growth trajectory because they optimize the angle of solar panels, ensuring optimum sunlight exposure and significantly improving energy generation efficiency. This optimization is critical for long-term competitive Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), making solar electricity an economically feasible option.
As India’s energy demand rises, solar energy, aided by enhanced tracker technology, is ideally positioned to supply this demand sustainably. Solar trackers not only increase energy production but also improve grid stability, making them essential in India’s changing energy scenario. 
Furthermore, the worldwide focus on renewable energy corresponds with India’s aim to lower carbon emissions, propelling the solar tracker industry forward. In essence, the combination of ambitious goals, the need for cost-effective solutions, and environmental sensitivity paints a bright future for solar trackers in India, emphasizing their importance in the country’s renewable energy path.

Under its hydrogen policy, NPCIL is pursuing clean hydrogen generation both as captive production for its nuclear power plant sites and commercial production as a diversification business model along with the generation of clean and green electricity.
In captive mode, small clean hydrogen-producing units will be established to meet the captive requirement of hydrogen at the nuclear power plant sites. The unit will use electricity sourced from the nuclear power plant itself to replace the sourcing of grey hydrogen from the market. The company said such a setup can be used as a prototype for subsequent implementation of large-size clean hydrogen-producing projects.
NPCIL is also looking at cogeneration mode, which allows NPCIL to generate profit from the sale of hydrogen apart from the sale of power generated.
In cogeneration mode, clean hydrogen is co-generated using the electricity generated by nuclear power plants, which may be rendered excess due to demand and price trends in the electricity market. “This strategy may be needed to deal with technologies like solar/wind and their falling tariffs, as difficulties are being faced in concluding power purchase agreements (PPA) with distribution companies (DISCOM) for electricity generated by new nuclear power plants,” said NPCIL. “There are also pressures on Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) to operate in flexible mode in line with the availability of cheap solar power in the grid. Nuclear power plants in general are not amenable to flexible operation, as frequent variations in power are undesirable for reliable fuel performance and stability of the neutronic equilibrium of the reactor core.”
NPCIL is also looking at setting up dedicated nuclear power plants to generate electricity for the sole purpose of producing clean hydrogen. This model may be thought of for the small-capacity, older nuclear power plants, said NPCIL.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/20/agrivoltaic-system-achieves-9-9-efficiency-lcoe-of-0-033-kwh/,"AGRIVOLTAICS,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 20, 2023","Agrivoltaic system achieves 9.9% efficiency, LCOE of $0.033/kWh","Scientists led by the University of Science and Technology of China have developed a spectral-splitting concentrator agrivoltaic (SCAPV) system that can reportedly increase the crop productivity of multiple plant species.
The SCAPV system is based on the spectral separation of sunlight based on the difference in the spectral response of photovoltaics and photosynthesis. According to this principle, red and blue wavelengths are used for photosynthesis as they match the absorption peaks of plant chlorophyll, while all other wavelengths are used for concentrated power generation.
The research group described their findings in “Spectral-splitting concentrator agrivoltaics for higher hybrid solar energy conversion efficiency” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management. They highlighted the system’s key components: multilayer polymer films (MPFs) enabling spectral separation, parabolic trough concentrators (PTCs), and crystalline silicon solar cells.
They used commercially available MPFs with high transmittance manufactured by US-based industrial conglomerate 3M. The PTCs are used as a substrate for the flexible MPFs and as reflectors to direct the reflected bands toward focal-point interdigitated back contact (IBC) PV cells, which were provided by US-based manufacturer Sunpower.
“Although multijunction III-V cells hold potential for higher efficiency, silicon cells are cost competitive for a scalable solution, and can maintain performance under high incident radiation within a concentration ratio of 3–100,” they further explained, noting that each PV module includes a front cover made of low-iron glass, a backsheet made of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and a back aluminum substrate.
The researchers said the PV cells and MPFs had a cost of $0.10/W and $0.02/W, respectively, while the hardware including the concentrators and the trackers cost $0.57/W.
The group tested the performance of the system through a prototype deployed in Fuyang, in China’s Anhui province. This system occupies a surface of 422.4 square meters and relies on a dual-axis solar tracking system.
The system was found to have a PV efficiency of 9.9% and a hybrid light use efficiency of 9.05%, which the academics said is higher than the maximal theoretical photosynthetic efficiency of around 6%.
“The economic analysis shows that the LCOE of SCAPV is 0.033 $/kWh, indicating its economic feasibility,” they said, adding that the plants grown under partial sunlight showed the potential for increased biomass. “Although these tunable PVs are usually not cost competitive for now, agrivoltaics provide a niche market where they can provide advantages over conventional silicon photovoltaics and hence have the opportunity to be commercialized and improved.”
The research group unveiled its basic SCAPV system design in October. That system was tested in outdoor conditions in Anhui, and was found able to produce 107 MWh of electricity per hectare. Its overall system efficiency reached 11.6%, which the scientists said is the highest efficiency ever recorded for the spectral separation technology.

Terabase Energy, developer of Terafab, an automated utility-scale solar installation platform, announced it has successfully completed its first commercial installation. The company’s “field factory” installed 17 MW of a 225 MW solar project in Arizona in development by Leeward Renewable Energy and engineering and construction contractor RES.
The Terafab system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7.
In the Arizona project, Terabase said its labor productivity improved 25% when compared with manual installation.
“[The project] demonstrates that Terabase’s technology can drive substantial progress in solar construction safety, quality, cost, and schedule,” said Will Schultek, vice president of construction, RES.
The installation system cuts the amount of labor needed on-site and improves working conditions for laborers. Workers are housed in shaded and cooled conditions, allowing for system operation and installation in harsh desert environments.

Reducing labor requirements to install utility-scale solar projects may prove useful for accelerating the energy transition. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects a demand of 800,000 new solar workers by 2030 to build the projects the United States needs to be on pace with its decarbonization plan. However, 44% of solar industry employers report it is “very difficult” to find qualified applicants, said the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC).
Terabase’s field factory also enabled a 100% return on solar panel packaging for reuse by the manufacturer.
Leeward Renewable Energy executive vice president of project execution Sam Mangrum said the benefits demonstrated in the project underscore the “transformative potential of automation” in solar.
“This milestone marks a pivotal moment in our mission to accelerate solar plant deployment to meet the terawatt scale demands of the future,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer at Terabase Energy. “Furthermore, the Terafab system was deployed alongside our Construct digital twin software for managing and monitoring solar power plant construction.”
