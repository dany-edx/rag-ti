The new addition will include about 14 GW of utility-scale solar projects and 2.8 GW of rooftop/onsite solar projects, according to a new report by JMK Research.
The analysts said India installed 11.4 GW of utility-scale solar capacity and 1.9 GW of rooftop PV aggregating to 13.3 GW in 2022. As of Dec. 31, 2022, India’s cumulative installed capacity of utility-scale solar stood at about 53.6 GW, while another 44.6 GW was under pipeline.
Leading players in 2022
In CY2022, Jinko was the largest module supplier with a 13.2% share of the cumulative 15,013 MW DC modules shipped annually. It was followed by Trina (12.1%) and Longi (10.8%). Domestic players also registered a significant increase in sales from April 2022 onwards after the imposition of a 40% basic customs duty (BCD). Waaree, Adani, and Vikram Solar were the leading domestic suppliers in CY2022.
String inverter shipments during Jan.-Dec. 2022 period stood at 10,302 MW AC. Sungrow led the supplies with a 20.9% share, followed by Huawei (20.4%) and Solis (11.8%).
Central inverter shipments stood at 5,716 MW AC. The top suppliers were Sineng (39.5% market share), Sungrow (30.9%), and Fimer (22.7%).
NTPC, Adani, and Avaada were the top three project developers that commissioned the maximum utility-scale solar projects in CY2022. Tata Power and L&T were the leading third-party EPC contractors for utility-scale PV.
Avaada, ReNew Power, and Cleantech Solar commissioned the maximum open-access PV capacity.
Tata Power Solar, Amplus, and Fourth Partner Energy topped in rooftop (onsite) PV installations.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/03/high-latitude-tests-show-vertical-rooftop-pv-yields-30-more-energy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 3, 2023",High-latitude tests show vertical rooftop PV yields 30% more energy,"From pv magazine Global
Norwegian startup Over Easy has reported the initial results of its vertical bifacial rooftop PV system, which uses specially designed solar modules. The Norwegian Institute for Energy Technology (IFE) supported the company in measuring the performance of the array, which is located in Vestby, near Oslo.
“Overall yearly specific yield is up to 30% higher than for conventional flat roof solutions,” CEO Trygve Mongstad told pv magazine.
In 2022, the vertical PV system generated 1,070 kWh per kilowatt installed. Mongstad says this compares to around 800 kWh per kilowatt installed for a conventional rooftop array installed in the same location.
“Two other 5 kW installations with HJT cells have also been in operation since February and May 2022 in Oslo, Norway, and have showed over 30% higher energy yield in the periods compared to conventional 10-degree tilted flat roof solar installations,” Mongstad added. “Snow is normally not a problem for the energy production, the panels are sticking up on the rooftops even with 1 m snow on the ground.”
The company currently uses PERC cells with a bifaciality of 77% to 81% or HJT cells with bifaciality of 90% in its demonstrators.
“The ground cover ratio of the installations is about 50%,” Mongstad explained. “The solar panels are about 20 cm tall and the pitch between the rows is 40 cm. The installations were placed on generic dark or lighter gray bitumen roofing membranes.”
The units include a mounting system and solar panels in a single pre-assembled package, which the manufacturer said makes them easily mountable. Every unit measures 1,600 mm x 1,510 mm x 350 mm and weighs 24.5 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure rating and 3.2 mm double-tempered glass.
Over Easy said it plans to work with production partners in China and Spain and aims to begin producing the solar modules in the fall. Currently, it uses solar cells provided by undisclosed Asian manufacturers.
“We are doing assembly at locations in Norway and Spain, and the units for our pilot installations so far are 100% manufactured in Europe, including the solar panels,” Mongstad told pv magazine in May.
*The headline of the article was updated on March 29 to reflect that the 30% higher energy yield is achieved on a yearly basis and not in winter.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/03/chinese-module-prices-to-fall-by-15-from-q4-2022-to-q4-2023-says-cea/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",LÍVIA NEVES,"APRIL 3, 2023","Chinese module prices to fall by 15% from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023, says CEA","From pv magazine Global
The latest PV price forecast from CEA predicts that module prices in China will fall by about 15% from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, as polysilicon prices continue to slide.
The engineering consultancy said that from 2023 to 2024, TOPCon prices will remain higher than PERC.
“As many new cell lines are ramping up that will need to calibrate, limiting the growth in TOPCon availability,” said CEA.
However, it added that it expects the price difference between the two technologies to narrow down from 2024, “as TOPCon becomes the default utility-scale module.” Nevertheless, the firm noted that it expects some price gap to remain between TOPCon and PERC, “as growing TOPCon adoption will cause PERC to be offered at an increasingly discounted rate until it is retired.”
The corresponding graph from the report shows that by the first quarter of 2025, monofacial, backsheet TOPCon modules will cost the same as bifacial double-glass PERC modules with 210 mm cells. Between the first quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, module prices in China will drop by an average of 6%, according to the report.
Global PV manufacturing capacity across the supply chain will experience rapid growth from 2022 to 2027, according to CEA, with capacities doubling in the ingot/wafer stages and potentially quadrupling for polysilicon. This capacity will remain heavily concentrated in China, said CEA.
Equipment oversupply, as measured by nominal industry production capacity compared to new facilities, is expected to increase from 25% in 2022 to 100% in 2027. That is, the industry as a whole will be able to produce twice as much as demand, according to projections.
By 2023, global module production capacity are set to exceed 800 GW per year, while global installations will likely stay above 300 GW. By 2027, module production capacity could exceed 1,000 GW per year, while installations should be near 500 GW.
The most immediate impact of the capacity increase on the market is a tripling of polysilicon capacity from 2022 to 2024, based on new capacity under construction or already in the start-up and ramp-up phases.
CEA’s projections are the result of a specially developed modeling system to provide independent market intelligence on changes in global supply chains and accurate forecasts for supply price scenarios based on technologies, materials, manufacturing regions, and target markets, as well as supply and demand forecasts.
