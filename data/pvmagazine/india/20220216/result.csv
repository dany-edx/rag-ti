The two sides signed a letter of intent in this regard during the 4th India – Australia Energy Dialogue, co-chaired by India’s Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy, R.K. Singh, and Australia’s Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor.
The focus of this LoI will be scaling up the manufacture and deployment of ultra-low-cost solar and clean hydrogen.
“Clean hydrogen,” a term frequently used by the Morrison government, refers to hydrogen made from fossil fuels where emissions are claimed to be captured by carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. It is otherwise known as blue hydrogen, and not to be confused with green or renewable hydrogen.*
Energy transition was a major area of discussion in the dialogue and both the energy ministers spoke in detail about the ongoing energy transition activities in their respective countries with a focus on renewables, energy efficiency, storage, electric vehicles, critical minerals, mining, etc. The Indian side also highlighted the need for climate finance for meeting the energy transition goals of developing countries.
The two sides agreed on a forward action plan for areas like energy efficiency technologies; grid management; R&D collaboration on flue gas desulphurization, biomass or hydrogen co-firing, water cycle optimization, renewables integration, batteries, and electric mobility.
This article was amended on February 23 to clarify the difference between “clean” hydrogen and “green” hydrogen

The successful projects will be jointly funded by India and Denmark. For the Danish counterpart, funding will be disbursed by the IFD. Similarly, the Indian counterpart will be funded by the DST. 
“The Danish side (IFD) will allocate a total of 20 million DKK and the Indian side (DST) will allocate a total of INR 200 million to support three to five joint research and innovation projects. The duration of the projects is expected to be up to three years for both sides,” as per the call for proposals.
Projects may contribute to renewables-based green hydrogen production, storage, and utilization; electrolyzers and fuel cells; innovations on improving efficiency, boosting production capacity, and finding robust, cheaper alternatives to the rare materials used in current electrolyzers/fuel cells; support for the establishment of gigawatt-scale electrolyzer test center; manufacturing of electrolyzer/fuel cell components; standardizing and automating production processes; distribution network for H2 transport using polymers/converting current gas distribution; underground H2 storage facility; decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries like refineries, steel, and ammonia; and photoelectrochemical systems for hydrogen production.
The proposal can be submitted to the IFD and the DST until June 2, 2022.

The plant shall be located at Getalsud Dam in the Ranchi district.
The successful bidder’s workscope includes design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing and commissioning, and ten years of operations and maintenance of the solar plant.
SECI has applied for financing from the World Bank toward the cost of the Project of Innovation in Solar Power and Hybrid Technologies and intends to apply part of the proceeds toward payments under the floating solar project contract.
The contractor shall commence work on the facilities within 20 days from the signing of the agreement. The completion period for the whole of the plant facilities is 18 months till commissioning from the effective date.
Bidders are required to take note of the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy’s notification on the imposition of a 40% basic customs duty (BCD) on solar PV modules and 25% on cells with effect from April 1, 2022, and bid accordingly, as the imposition of BCD as per this mentioned trajectory will not be considered under Change in Law.

Shanghai-based battery manufacturer Soluna has developed a portable power generator for outdoor and indoor applications.
Its Volans generator has a storage capacity of 1.28kWh. If combined in a two-unit series, it can reach 2.5kWh.
“Volans has multiple charging options and can be connected to a solar panel as a power generator,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine, noting that the device can also be charged by car chargers, AC inputs, or fast charging if there is a power delivery charger.
The system features built-in 120V(AC) output, continuous AC output power of 1,200W, and peak output of up to 2,400W. It measures 380 mm x 215 mm x 210 mm and weighs in at 30 kg. According to Soluna, it can be fully recharged in an hour.
The LifePO4 battery is claimed to be able to provide 6,000 cycles and 10 years of life. It relies on textured sheet metal parts that purportedly ensure fast heat dissipation. Its usable storage capacity is 1.02kWh and the battery capacity is 50Ah.
The system can be used with LED lighting with a maximum power of 3kW and with an operating temperature range of -10 C to 40 C. It features forced airflow as a cooling method. The new product comes with a one-year warranty.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/16/solar-power-prices-rising-with-demand/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 16, 2022",Solar power prices rising with demand,"From pv magazine Global
BloombergNEF has reported that global procurement of renewable energy contracts by corporations has set a new record of 31GW of capacity. Most of that capacity was procured in the Americas, with 17GW coming from the United States and 3.3GW from other nations in North and South America.

Europe, in the grip of a massive run-up in electricity pricing due to natural gas issues with Russia, signed 12GW of capacity. Asia actually saw a significant drop from 2020, with just 2GW in 2021.
BloombergNEF reports that most of the capacity was solar power. Amazon and Microsoft led the procurements with 38% of the total, and 8.2GW of that capacity was solar power.
All of these record purchases occurred despite steadily increasing pricing in the solar industry. LevelTen Energy’s recent “Q4 2021 PPA Price Index” shows prices increasing 5.7% to $34.25/MWh.

However, the price increases varied by region. For instance, California’s CAISO stayed flat, while PJM & SPP increased 15% and 15.1%, respectively. Year-over-year pricing increases were immense, averaging 12.1% for all US regions. Texas’ ERCOT region saw the lowest increase of 6.9%, while SPP prices were up more than 20%.
A LevelTen developer survey suggests that the price increases began in early 2020 due to increased demand, macroeconomic fluctuations, supply chain issues, and a confluence of other factors.

One might suspect that the increases in global electricity pricing are driving the ever-increasing demand for solar, but BloombergNEF suggests otherwise – and its data follows. It reports that 67 companies joined the RE100 last year – making for a total of 355 companies now committed to 100% renewable energy, totally offsetting their electricity use.
Of course, when we review the chart at the top of the article, it becomes apparent that corporate procurement volume had already been increasing at a consistent rate. Large increases began long before the solar hardware price increases in 2020 or the electricity pricing increases in 2021. For US solar developers, it might speak positively on the opportunity to continue selling solar power projects at pricing that pays respectable development fees.
One final factor worth considering: renewable procurements in the United States may be motivated in part by our increasing exports of US Liquid Natural Gas. According to the US Energy Information Administration, these exports have led to today’s higher natural gas prices, as a result of the country’s exposure to global pricing of the fuel.
