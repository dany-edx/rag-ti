Mono M10 and Mono G12 cells both dipped more than 3% to $0.0865/W and $0.0856/W respectively, while TOPCon M10 cells notched 0.41% downwards to $0.0965/W.
The weak module market is largely to blame for cell price decreases, according to one source. Module plants without their own cell capacity have applied “many strategies to reduce production,” the source said. Mono PERC and TOPCon module prices are also at record lows, according to OPIS data.

Given that cell prices have fallen significantly, discussions are raging about whether cell makers will cut production. Some small makers are planning to halt operations over China’s Golden Week holiday at the start of October, reflecting a dim outlook for the cell market and marking a decline in cell output, an insider explained.
Others disagreed. If cell production is to fall, there should only be a slight decrease, a different source argued. “The overproduction of cells is not as bad relative to the entire supply chain,” the source said, referring to overproduction in the polysilicon, wafer and module segments.
For another source, lowering prices is the strategy by which cell makers maintain 100% operating rates. Whether the cell segment will cut output is strongly influenced by the rate at which wafer supply is growing and the manufacturing strategy of module manufacturers, he said.
“The decrease in module production may unavoidably compel a decrease in cell production by the end of October and the beginning of November,” the source also said, adding that end-users will reduce module purchasing orders because they have already arranged enough supply to support year-end solar installations.

The company, which makes Powerwall range of battery systems, is looking to tap residential as well as industrial customers for its battery storage systems. 
Reuters reported that Tesla recently proposed supporting India’s battery storage capabilities with its ‘Powerwall,’ a system that can store power from solar panels or the grid for use at night or during outages. The company is keen to tap residential and industrial customers for its battery storage systems.
Tesla has sought a number of incentives to set up the battery storage factory in India. The Indian officials have declined these incentives but offered to create a fair business model for the company by offering subsidies to customers for Tesla products, according to Reuters.
Recently, Tesla showcased its new hybrid battery, the Powerwall 3, at RE+. The battery offers 11.5 kW of continuous power to homeowners and requires an installation time of between 30-40 minutes. It comes with an integrated inverter, which simplifies the installation, bringing both power conversion and energy storage together in one unit. As a hybrid system, it is suitable for new solar installations, but not for households with existing rooftop solar systems.
