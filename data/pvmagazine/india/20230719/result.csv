Pegasus Solar has unveiled InstaFlash, a new roof mount for solar installations on composite shingles. The mount is pre-installed with a watertight sealant designed to address roof irregularities and seal any missed pilot holes, cracked shingles and shingle seams. 
It said the mount is designed to make it easy-to-install in a variety of composite roof configurations and weather conditions. The sealant instantly deploys when the mount is fastened to the roof, instantly creating a watertight seal. It seals any potential water ingress points under the entire footprint of the base. 
Kai Stephan, chief executive officer of Pegasus Solar said that InstaFlash is “new guy proof,” as it “virtually eliminates the potential for user-error.” 
The non-hardening sealant is housed in a cage that contains where the sealant spreads when deployed, preventing any messes and directing the material to the point where it is needed. InstaFlash can be installed in freezing temperatures or extreme heat (0 F to 170 F) and can be installed in rain without leaks.
For sloped roofs it can be installed on composition shingle or rolled asphalt, and for flat roofs it can be mounted on modified bitumen or built-up roofs. 
“When a fastener lands in the so-called ‘slot-canyon’ between shingles, water can pass under a rigid tape, mastic or rubber-type barrier,” said Kai Stephan, chief executive officer of Pegasus Solar. “We realized we needed a semi-liquid sealant to fully penetrate and seal this gap to eliminate any potential for leaks.”
The mount comes with a 25-year warranty, is IBC and CBC code compliant, and UL certified. Full specification sheet can be found here. 
“We approached this design from a clean slate,” said Stephan. “The guiding principle was, ‘What are the toughest challenges for a comp roof mount, and how can we solve those challenges with a product that’s easy enough for the newest installer to master?’”
Pegasus Solar also provides rail systems, tile scissor mounts, tilt leg kits, tile replacements, conduit and accessory mounts, MLPE brackets, and wire management systems.

This was supported by increased demand for modules from the USA amid the restrictions imposed on module sourcing from China. 
The exports to the USA accounted for 97% of the total solar PV module exports from India in FY2023.
 Also, the significant ramp-up in domestic module manufacturing capacities over the past 18 months has supported the growth in exports. The OEMs benefited from the higher realizations in the export markets than in the domestic market. 

The exports largely constitute solar PV modules, and the share of PV cell exports was only 0.1% in FY2023.
 The export buoyancy continued in the current fiscal, with the first two months of FY2024 witnessing solar PV module and cell exports of INR 2,457 crore against INR 130 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. 
Going forward, the export demand would be a function of the restriction by the USA on imports from China and the development of domestic module manufacturing units in the USA given the incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The new gigafactory, with a production capacity of 40 GWh, will be one of the largest in Europe. 
Tata Group will invest over £4 billion ($5 billion) in this factory, which will produce batteries for another Tata Sons investment, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), as well as other EV manufacturers in the UK and Europe. The gigafactory will supply JLR’s future battery electric models including the Range Rover, Defender, Discovery, and Jaguar brands.
Production at the new gigafactory is due to start in 2026.
Tata Group announced in its investors’ presentation earlier this year that it will produce long-range, high-performance, and fast-charging batteries at the UK fab. Its immediate focus will be end-to-end cell design to validation, and, industrialization.
Back home, Tata Group is setting up a 20 GW+ battery cell facility in Gujarat to supply batteries designed with a focus on long lifecycle and safety for Tata Motors EV customers.
Tata Group plans to cater to a wider range of customer segments in the future, including energy storage solutions, two-wheelers and three-wheelers, and commercial vehicles in addition to passenger cars. 
The company said in its investors’ presentation that its battery cell arm has developed a unified ‘Prismatic’ cell format for Tata Motors and JLR EVs, which can be easily extended to other segments. Stacking of prismatic cells allows superior cell-to-pack efficiency, fast charging, flexibility in chemistry, enhanced safety with terminals at either end, and high efficiency. Initially, the Group will focus on both LFP and NMC batteries for Tata Motors and JLR passenger vehicles.

The project will come up in the 600 MW solar park (Stage-1) of Gujarat State Electricity Corp. Ltd (GSECL). 
NHPC will award the project through domestic competitive bidding followed by reverse auction. Bidding closes on August 29.
The successful bidder will be responsible for the design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing, and commissioning of the solar project along with the power evacuation system. It will also provide comprehensive operation and maintenance of the solar PV plant for five years as well as an annual maintenance contract (AMC) of critical equipment for ten years.
The EPC completion period (including commissioning) is 15 months from the award of the contract.
For solar modules and inverters to be used in the project, NHPC intends to get an exemption from the local content requirement mandate under the Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) order. Bidders are advised to quote accordingly. The project will, however, be awarded only after the grant of the aforesaid exemption, stated NHPC.

Comision Nacional de Energia Electrica (CNEE), Guatemala’s energy regulator, said this week that it has received 48 project proposals for more than 1 GW in an energy auction it launched in August 2022.
The authorities of the Central American country hope to allocate 235 MW of power generation capacity and assign 15-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) through the procurement exercise.
The selected projects will have to be commissioned between 2026 and 2028.
The CNEE will announce the auction’s final results on Aug. 2.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Guatemala had 105 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022. It has deployed just 4 MW of solar power in the last four years.

The Green Energy Auction Bids Evaluation and Awards Committee (GEA-BEAC), under the Philippines Department of Energy (DOE), has published a list of winning bidders for the Second Green Energy Auction Round (GEA-2).
The GEA-BEAC allocated 1,870.8 MW of ground-mounted PV capacity and 90 MW of floating solar power. It also assigned around 10 MW of rooftop PV capacity and 960.28 MW of onshore wind power.
It originally planned to allocate around 11.6 GW of renewable energy capacity, which means the auction was largely undersubscribed.
“The winning bidders were ranked based on their offers from the lowest to the highest bid price and stacked corresponding to the respective [renewable energy] technology per grid,” the authority said in a statement.
The selected developers will secure 20-year power purchase agreements.
In the first procurement exercise in the Philippines, which concluded in June 2022, the authorities allocated 2 GW of renewable energy capacity, with 1.49 GW coming from solar power.
