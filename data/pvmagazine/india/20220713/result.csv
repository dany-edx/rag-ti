The nation will need to add over 38 GW of renewable capacity annually during the nine years from 2022 to 2030 to achieve its target, says a new report by GlobalData.
India aims to increase non-fossil power capacity to 500 GW and meet 50% of the country’s electricity needs through renewables by 2030. It also targets net-zero emissions by 2070. India mainly plans to achieve these long-term climate goals through capacity additions in solar and exploring offshore wind potential.
However, after including large hydro under the definition of renewables, the report stated that the country is likely to achieve its 2022 target but may miss out on the solar-specific target and fall short of the 2030 target.

Attaurrahman Ojindaram Saibasan, a power analyst at GlobalData, said, “India is already focusing on rooftop solar installations along with large ground-mounted solar PV projects. As part of the plan, India approved 45 solar parks with a total capacity of 37 GW under its solar park scheme in September 2021.
“India is situated in a solar belt and gets a significant amount of solar diffused horizontal irradiance and global horizontal irradiance. The top solar power-rich states are Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. Regulatory bodies in India have drafted attractive policies and schemes to boost the renewable energy sector. For instance, the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) provides custom and excise duty benefits to the solar rooftop sector to propel growth.”
Additionally, a new hydropower policy for 2018-28 has been drafted for the growth of hydro projects in the country. To increase hydropower generation, the government has granted renewable energy status for large hydro.
The government has also been promoting wind power projects by providing various fiscal and promotional incentives. Some of the most important support schemes include accelerated depreciation, excise duty exemptions to manufacturers, concessional import duties on certain components of wind electricity generators, and a tax holiday on income generated from wind power projects. These are expected to encourage the private sector participation in renewable power projects.
Saibasan emphasized easing approval processes, pre-identifying land spaces for the development of renewable power, enhancing the grid to connect renewable power plants seamlessly, and investing in battery storage and micro-grids in remote areas to drive capacity additions in the future. He also recommended renewable auctions without delays, strongly enforcing the RPS mechanism, and educating the end-consumers on adopting small-scale systems such as rooftop solar PV.

It said it also plans to localize production in the medium to long term, in order to better serve Indian customers.
The technology center will support Fluence’s global product development by expanding its engineering skills, while strengthening its local market presence. The staff will work with their North American and Europe counterparts to launch new products and regionalize product support. For the Indian market, the company will offer control applications specific to local grid requirements and market services where projects are deployed.
“This team will be key to the expansion of our sixth-generation product line, which is delivering a range of critical grid services to customers around the world, as well as the creation of next-generation products,” said Fluence SVP and Chief Product Officer Rebecca Boll.
India has an ambitious renewables target of 500 GW by 2030, which is why Fluence sees the tech center and its joint venture with ReNew as just the beginning of its operations in the country. Its systems currently use LFP or NMC lithium-ion battery chemistries, but its product platform is designed to work with new chemistries as they become cost-competitive. The company has a diversified, global supply chain to feed its product manufacturing.
Fluence energy storage systems are equipped with integrated safety features and cooling systems and are designed for the climates in which they are deployed. The company has many projects in hot climates, including a project in Delhi and installations in Chile, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, Australia, and the southwestern United States.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/13/renew-refinances-dollar-denominated-bonds-worth-525-million/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 13, 2022",ReNew refinances dollar-denominated bonds worth $525 million,"NASDAQ-listed Indian developer ReNew Energy Global has refinanced its 2024 maturity dollar-denominated bonds with amortizing project debt from an Indian nonbank financial company, becoming the first Indian renewable energy company to do so.
ReNew issued bonds worth US$ 525 million in 2019, which were set to mature in 2024. “By refinancing the dollar-denominated bonds ahead of time, ReNew has shown strong and continued access to domestic debt capital, as well as an ability to proactively manage the refinancing risk,” read a ReNew statement.
This refinancing has cut the bonds’ INR interest cost by 200 basis points, with the interest rate fixed for three years while pushing the maturity to the end of the fiscal year 2027. “The rate reduction, rate fixing, and tenor extension have taken place against the backdrop of a rising interest rate environment in the broader markets. This pre-emptive refinancing mitigates near-term refinancing risk for bonds and provides liquidity to bond investors,” stated ReNew.
ReNew develops, builds, owns, and operates utility-scale wind, solar, and hydropower projects. As of June 14, 2022, it had a gross renewables project portfolio of 12.8 GW across India.
ReNew CFO Kedar Upadhye said, “In today’s business climate, being pro-active and flexible in one’s financing strategy is key, and our team has taken the lead in this by making us the first Indian renewable energy to raise money onshore to retire US dollar bond obligations.
