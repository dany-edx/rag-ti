Ltd (GSECL). The project’s total order value is approximately INR 843 crore ($107 million).
Prozeal Infra will build the project around Gujarat Energy Transmission Corp. Ltd’s substations in the Surendranagar and Morbi districts of Gujarat. It will handle design, engineering, supply, procurement, construction, testing, and commissioning, along with five years of operation and maintenance services.
The project completion must be completed within the next 12 months. The company has already commissioned more than 650 MW of solar capacity across 18 states in India. It has an order book of more than 400 MW to be completed by fiscal 2023.

The project is located in the state of Kerala. It was commissioned by Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) and is owned by state-owned energy company NTPC.
Skyfri will deploy a 24×7 real-time monitoring system to identify faults using machine learning, ensuring optimized production time and better operations and maintenance.
“This contract is a milestone for Skyfri as a company. For the first time, we are expanding into the floating solar segment, one of the fastest-growing opportunities in renewable energy globally,” said Skyfri CEO Pratik Ghoshal. “This is a steppingstone for Skyfri into several more projects in the region.”
Skyfri delivers complete end-to-end solar asset solutions through its technology platform, which takes care of solar assets throughout their life cycles. It operates two business units. Skyfri Energy provides O&M and asset management services, while Skyfri Intelligence is  a technology platform that monitors solar plants. Together, the platforms oversee almost 2 GW of solar assets.
“Our technology accumulates data from more than 200 sites globally, and this latest add-on with floating solar will enable us to adjust our solutions onto a whole new segment,” said Skyfri Chief Technology Officer Aslan Shamsutdin. “This is also our first project where we will deploy drone-based inspection and management.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/30/sanvaru-plans-new-lithium-battery-plant-as-orders-exceed-capacity/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV BATTERIES,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,HARYANA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 30, 2022",Sanvaru plans new lithium battery plant as orders exceed capacity,"Haryana-based Sanvaru Technology has revealed that it will more than triple its lithium battery manufacturing capacity to 400 MWh per year, as demand has surpassed supply.
The company currently has a 125 MWh/year facility in Sonipat, Haryana, where it makes lithium batteries for the solar storage and electric vehicle segments. Its expansion plans are now underway, and its next factory will be built in Haridwar.
“We expect our revenues to cross INR 175 crore ($22 million) this year, as we have received letters of intent for orders worth INR 300 crore, but have production capacity limited to serve INR 175 crore value,” Sunil Bhatnagar, international business director for new and emerging technologies at Sanvaru Technology, told pv magazine.
Bhatnagar said the electric vehicle market is expanding, with two-wheelers and three-wheelers leading sales. For four-wheelers, the electric bus market is quickly emerging as a mode of mass rapid transportation. Another potential segment is e-tractors, which are good for exports, but the domestic market is also coming up now, said Bhatnagar.

In line with current market trends, Sanvaru’s focus area is lithium batteries for EVs. On the solar side, it mainly makes high-voltage energy storage systems. It also makes some batteries for applications such as medical equipment and e-cycles.
Recently, Sanvaru crossed the milestone of 1,000 LiFePO4 battery supplies for L3 and L5 electric automobiles. It has already developed batteries for e-tractors and e-trucks (250 kWh battery packs) and is now looking to partner with some original equipment manufacturers in this segment.
“E-bus battery is also in the pipeline as it’s quite similar to e-truck batteries. Another vertical which is coming up is megawatt-level containerized solutions, where Sanvaru is working on many fronts,” said Bhatnagar.
Sanvaru has a supply base that spans all of India. Apart from that, it exports batteries to neighboring countries and markets in Africa.
