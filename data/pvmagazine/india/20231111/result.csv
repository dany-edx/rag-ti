The Franco-German partnership, spanning over 2,000 square meters in Berlin, utilizes automation and robotics for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer module production. The joint venture said that it aims to play a pivotal role in fostering a sustainable hydrogen economy.
Air Products has partnered with Chinese state-owned Chengzhi, aiming to accelerate transport decarbonization in China’s Yangtze River Delta. The joint venture has launched a commercial-scale hydrogen fueling station in Changshu, Jiangsu province, fueling public transport and logistics trucks. The president of Chengzhi, Wei Junmin, expressed excitement about deepening collaboration to expedite hydrogen vehicle development and the hydrogen value chain.
Japan and South Korea are set to collaborate on a supply chain for hydrogen and ammonia, with plans to announce the initiative during the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in the United States. Additionally, the two nations will create new frameworks in quantum technology and semiconductors.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/11/researchers-shed-light-on-mysterious-higher-energy-yields-in-vertical-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 11, 2023","Researchers shed light on mysterious, higher energy yields in vertical PV systems","A group of researchers at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has conducted a series of tests and simulations to understand why vertical PV systems tend to provide unexpected yield gains compared to horizontal arrays and have found that vertical installations have much lower operating temperatures.
“Although better than expected performance for vertical installation of bifacial PV has been reported at conferences and workshops, we haven’t seen any publications that show that this is accompanied with a much lower operating temperature than you would expect for free-standing fixed tilt PV with the same total irradiance,” the research’s corresponding author, Bas B. Van Aken, told pv magazine. “These lower operating temperatures have a positive effect on the operating voltage. And thereby on the total energy generation, particularly under high irradiance conditions.”
In the study “Thermal model in digital twin of vertical PV system helps to explain unexpected yield gains,” published in EPJ Photovoltaics, Van Aken and his colleagues explained that the voltage is influenced both by the amount of light and by the temperature of the solar cells. With increasing irradiance conditions, the voltage increases logarithmically, while with increasing temperature, the voltage decreases, typically by 0.3-0.4% per C.
“For a standard system, we observed that under high irradiance conditions, the increase due to the light is offset by the decrease due to the higher operating temperature,” Van Aken stressed. “However, for the vertical system, we observed that the operating temperature is not increasing so much and the voltage increase and decrease are more or less balancing.”
For its modeling, the group used digital twins, which are virtual representations that connect and visualize real-world assets, to create twins consisting of a real PV system and a copy in digital format. Digital twins are commonly used for operation and maintenance (O&M) of solar power plants. “The digital version mimics the output of the PV panels based on the time series of weather and other environmental data. The simulated values are compared to observed data,” the scientists explained.
They took their measurements in a vertical PV system located near the TNO facilities in Petten, the Netherlands. The east-west system features nine rows each equipped with eight 315 W bifacial modules, with the spacing between module rows being 2 m, 4 m, or 6 m, respectively. Of the 72 modules deployed in the system, 60 rely on n-type M2 TOPCon solar cells. All of the panels are equipped with power optimizers provided by Israel-based Solaredge.
For its analysis, the group utilized an in-house developed extraction method and found that the heat transfer coefficients of the vertical panels are nearly double the values of the horizontal panels. Heat transfer coefficients define how heat energy passes from one material to another and are commonly used, for example, to make insulation in homes.
They also ascertained that the vertical array operates at a temperature difference with respect to ambient that is “nearly halved,” which they said results in a 2.5% higher annual energy yield.
“These results show the importance of checking the actual operating conditions of emerging applications of solar panels,” Van Aken concluded. “We expect that this effect has a 2-3% increase in annual electricity yield in the Netherlands, the lower operating temperature has a slowing effect on degradation mechanisms and the effect could be more significant in locations with higher irradiance conditions.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/11/solar-wafer-prices-could-bottom-out-soon-with-new-record-lows/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 11, 2023",Solar wafer prices could bottom out soon with new record lows,"Mono M10 and G12 wafer prices could find soon find a bottom as they extended losses this week to new historic lows according to OPIS data, decreasing 2.33% and 1.44% to $0.293/pc and $0.410/pc, respectively.
While the wafer market remains sluggish, this week’s price drop was less dramatic than it was in the prior two weeks. This is because wafer prices are projected to bottom out soon, a source upstream said.
Even if polysilicon in China is priced at CNY50 ($6.86)/kg, the cost of M10 wafers made by major manufacturers would still be a little over CNY2/pc, according to a polysilicon seller. A CNY2/pc selling price won’t be reached until the price of high-purity quartz crucibles also plummets, he added, concluding therefore that the bottom selling price for M10 wafers could be around CNY2.1/pc and CNY2.2/pc.
The price difference between wafers offered by major producers and the rest is narrowing. Large and small producers alike have reduced M10 wafer prices to between CNY2.3/pc and CNY2.4/pc, after a Tier-2 wafer manufacturer took the initiative to cut prices, according to a veteran market observer.
Wafer companies are no longer profitable given the present pricing of polysilicon, a developer said. OPIS assessed that China polysilicon prices fell almost 5% to CNY65.875/kg this week. To minimize losses, wafer businesses would rather cut production output further than sell wafers at a significant loss, suggesting that wafer manufacturers are no longer able to afford additional price reductions, the source added.
The only encouraging news in the wafer market is that China polysilicon prices are currently falling more than wafer prices, which could help wafer makers make up for some of their losses, according to a downstream source. An end to the downtrend in wafer prices is within reach as polysilicon prices approach their cash cost, the source added.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
