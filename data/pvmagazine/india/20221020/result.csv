Phase 1 of the project consists of a state-of-the-art automated 500 MW solar panel manufacturing line, which will start producing M10 half-cut cells, from day one. The line, which will be operational in the second quarter of 2023, is designed to produce more than 2,000 modules each day.
“Given that PV cell and module technologies are changing so rapidly, this line will be fully upgradable to the latest generation modules and cell sizes between M3 and M12 and up to 15BB; and it has the option of producing glass-glass and/or glass-backsheet modules,” Mondragon Assembly told pv magazine.
The client, which is primarily focused on building clean energy projects around the world – including solar photovoltaic projects, solar pumps and LED lighting projects – has taken the step to become the owner of the largest manufacturing plant in solar modules in North India.
The panels will go to projects in India and other countries, according to Pankaj Dhingra, Director of BVG India Ltd. and CEO of BVG Clean Energy Ltd. JS Bhatia, COO of BVG Clean Energy Ltd., added that “there are High demand for high-quality, high-voltage modules in India and in countries such as the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. With this new line we want to take advantage of this market situation, making EPC projects feasible to develop with quality and competitive prices”.

The MoU is the first step in advancing Ambri and Reliance’s strategic partnership to develop and manufacture Ambri’s batteries in India.
Reliance has set an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon by 2035 and has committed to invest more than $10 billion in its new energy business spanning hydrogen, wind, solar, fuel cells, and batteries. Ambri batteries’ unique chemistry utilizing commonly available, recyclable materials is an attractive solution for Reliance’s stated objective.
“As an investor, we have helped support Ambri’s work to produce and scale a superior and reliable energy storage solution because we believe in the company and its technology. One of our goals in investing in Ambri was that someday we would have the opportunity to harness Ambri’s technology to help us achieve our goals to deliver cost competitive round-the-clock power,” said Sanjay Mashruwala, Director, Reliance New Energy Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd. “This memorandum of understanding paves the way for us to engage in discussions for testing and installation of Ambri’s demo installation at Jamnagar, India and further progress our joint development work to set up large-scale manufacturing of Ambri systems in India.”
The Ambri system will ship by mid-2023 and is set for commissioning immediately thereafter.

Greenko will assist JSP in the design of the comprehensive energy solution including the design and development of the associated renewable energy capacity, identification of potential strategic investors for the RE capacity, and making available energy storage capacity.
The proposed 1 GW of carbon-free energy is targeted to meet the existing and incremental power demand of JSP’s Angul facility. “This is amongst the largest commitment by any Indian industrial group, particularly steel producers in India, to use clean energy in core industrial processes,” JSP stated in a media release. “Once completed, it will ensure the reduction of approximately 7 million tonnes of CO2 annually.”
As part of the proposed transaction, Greenko Group shall offer energy storage capacity from its off-stream closed-loop pumped storage project under development in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

SJVN will set up the project on a build-own-operate basis. The tentative cost for the project development will be INR 730 crore ($87.9 million). The project is scheduled for commissioning within 15 months from the date of signing of the power purchase agreement.
Nand Lal Sharma, chairman and managing director of SJVN, said, “After commissioning, the project will generate 230 million units of electricity in the first year and 5,420 million units over a period of 25 years. The commissioning of this project is expected to reduce 2,65,602 tonnes of carbon emission.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/20/global-installed-pv-capacity-could-hit-260-gw-in-2022/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Global installed PV capacity could hit 260 GW in 2022,"From pv magazine Global
The IEA PVPS recently published its latest report on “Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2022.” It estimates, “with a reasonable firm level of certainty,” that the world installed a minimum of 173.5 GW of new solar capacity in 2021, representing a 22% year-on-year growth. That makes 2021 another record-breaking year, despite the pandemic-related perturbations.
“The markets reached incredible numbers last year, but they will probably be even higher this year,” Gaëtan Masson, co-author of the report and co-chair at the European Solar Manufacturing Council, told pv magazine. “Without trade disruptions as we’ve seen in the last two years, my bet is that the market will reach 260 GW.”
He said this prediction is “roughly on line” with the predictions of an undisclosed company.
“Looking at production numbers , we had 153 GW of wafers produced in the first six months of the year, so it is not totally impossible to see a market of around 250 GW to 260 GW,” he added.
European manufacturing
Last year, the European Union came second in terms of new installed solar capacity with 28.7 GW, after China with 55 GW.
“Most probably we will see production capacities in all segments of the value chain in Europe in the coming years. I think that the atmosphere has changed significantly, policy makers started to understand that there is no growth without local manufacturing,” said Masson.
However, most European manufacturing projects happening at national level are too small to be competitive.
“There is a political will, there is an industry need, but the conditions are too favorable in the US or in India for the time being, so we will lose a certain number of projects which only a few months ago were supposed to be developed in Europe,” Masson noted.
This problem of competitiveness will not be solved at the policy level through the European Commission, he said. He argues that European PV manufacturing isn’t lacking policy instruments at the European level, but rather massive investment and continuous technology development at the national level.
“If you want to remain competitive, you need to be flexible, you need to develop new production lines mostly on a yearly basis, with lower cost, to benefit not only from economies of scale, but also from technology improvements, and lower cost of manufacturing,” he said.
Continuous investment in the order of €1 billion ($977 million) a year will be needed to replace Europe’s current “static projects,” added Masson.
“That’s probably the key challenge that will not be solved by public support. It must be understood by the investors that it will be a multibillion investment for each company, with a continuous need for fresh money, and increase of production capacities,” he concluded. “The market will follow up – there’s no problem.”
