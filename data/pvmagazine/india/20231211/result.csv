The international research group led by Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales in Australia has published Version 63 of the “solar cell efficiency tables” in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The scientists said they have added six new results to the new tables since June.
One of the six results added to the tables is the 25.2% efficiency that researchers at Northwestern University in the United States achieved for a 1-cm2 lead halide perovskite cell.
Furthermore, the tables now include the 22.4% efficiency that US-based First Solar achieved for a 0.45 cm2 cadmium-telluride (CdTe) cell, the 26.1% efficiency that China’s University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) obtained for 0.05 cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell, and the 26.1% efficiency the Northwestern University and the University of Toronto in Canada achieved for a 0.05-cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell.
The fifth result added to the tables is the 36.1% efficiency that Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) and Dutch research institute AMOLF achieved in September for a multijunction solar cell based on silicon and III-V semiconductors such as gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs).
The sixth result is the 33.9% efficiency the Chinese module maker Longi announced for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell in early November.
In Version 62 of the tables, released in June the researchers added 21 new results, a record number for the Tables. The group has seen major improvements in all cell categories since 1993, when the tables were first published.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems and the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH), Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the US Department of Energy, and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/11/solar-lcoe-now-29-lower-than-any-fossil-fuel-option-says-ey/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 11, 2023","Solar LCOE now 29% lower than any fossil fuel option, says EY","EY said in its latest energy and resources report that 86%, or 187 GW, of newly commissioned renewable energy resources generated electricity at a cost lower than the average cost of fossil fuel generation in 2022.
Solar is the cheapest new-build electricity in many markets, even amid inflation and price rises, said EY, noting that the global weighted average LCOE for solar is now 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative. Large-scale energy storage is also quickly becoming more cost-competitive and sophisticated, it said.
Solar has rapidly fallen in average LCOE globally, from more than $400/MWh in the early 2010s to about $49/MWh in 2022, down 88%. Wind power LCOE has fallen roughly 60% over the same period.

EY forecasts that solar and wind will become the global baseload electricity source. By 2030 the two traditional renewables are expected to represent 38% of the energy mix, and by 2050 solar and wind may supply 62% of the energy mix. China, Europe and the United States will drive a 53% increase in solar and wind generation, producing over 57% of global solar and wind output by 2050, said EY.
“A global solar boom will power more than half of this, but adoption will vary across markets. Solar-generated power will become the biggest source of energy in countries such as the US, and those in Oceania and South Asia, driven by technologies around solar PV modules advancing at rapid pace,” said EY.
However, these landmarks will not be reached without clearing major barriers to progress, EY said. Particularly in the United States, a backlog of grid interconnection applications is causing delays, cancellations, and large incurred costs. EY said that the United States has at least 1,350 GW of wind and solar capacity and 680 GW of storage is waiting to be connected, which is enough to double the country’s electricity supply.
In a survey of more than 70,000 global consumers, EY found that sentiment towards residential solar adoption is strong. About 62% of survey respondents said they have bought or are thinking about buying solar panels, while 50% are considering buying or have already purchased battery storage.

Bangladesh‘s government approved tariffs for 200 MW of PV in November and 310 MW in October.
In November, the national authorities approved two 100 MW solar projects to be developed in Feni district in southeastern Bangladesh and Mymensingh district, in the north-central part of the country.
China’s Xizi Clean Energy Equipment Manufacturing and Bangladeshi clothing makers Cassiopea Fashion and Cassiopea Apparels will build the project in Mymensingh, under a 20-year tariff of $0.10/kWh.
The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will set up the other solar plant in Sonagazi with an unspecified Chinese investor as a partner. It will also operate under a 20-year tariff of $0.10/kWh.
China’s Hangzhou Boiler Company, in collaboration with Max Infrastructure in Bangladesh, secured approval in October for a 180 MW solar project in Jamalpur district. The Bangladesh Power Development Board is set to purchase electricity from the plant at $0.0999/kWh.
The second project to be approved in October is a 130 MW array in Munshiganj district. A joint venture between Energon Renewables (BD) Ltd and PWR Energy Trading LLC will construct the project.
The Bangladeshi authorities have approved several large-scale PV projects in recent months to expand the share of renewables in the country’s electricity mix and reach its energy and climate targets. This increase in projects is likely due to new measures that were recently introduced to help domestic independent power producers build and operate new renewable energy plants.
Over the last seven months, the government has approved proposals for more than 1.5 GW of solar installations. Nasrul Hamid, the state minister for the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, said that there are currently more than 1.2 GW of projects under construction in Bangladesh.
