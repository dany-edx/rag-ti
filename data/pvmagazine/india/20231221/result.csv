The facility, located in the town of Brookshire, will have the initial capacity to manufacture 3 GW of solar modules annually by the end of 2024.
Waaree plans to invest up to $ 1 billion over the next four years to scale the US facility’s annual module manufacturing capacity up to 5 GW by 2027, making it one of the largest solar module manufacturing facilities in the US.
Waaree will also add an integrated solar cell facility that is expected to become operational by 2025.
In total, Waaree’s new facility is expected to create over 1,500 total jobs in the US when at full capacity.
Waaree already has a major presence in the US solar market. To date, it has supplied over 4 GW of modules from its current Indian facility to US customers.
Waaree’s ambitious U.S. expansion benefits from the long-term supply agreement with SB Energy, a leading climate infrastructure and technology platform with over 2 GW of solar in operations, 1 GW in construction, and another 15 GW+ of solar and storage in development across the U.S.
Waaree will supply multi-GWs of solar modules to SB Energy over the next five years following the commissioning of the facility, which is expected to be set up in 2024.
Most major components used in the manufacturing of these solar modules will be sourced domestically, stated Waaree.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/21/india-has-awarded-more-than-8-gw-of-utility-scale-energy-storage-in-tenders-as-of-november/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 21, 2023",India has awarded more than 8 GW of utility-scale energy storage in tenders as of November,"India has awarded a cumulative grid-scale energy storage system (ESS) capacity of more than 8 GW in tenders as of November 2023, allocating 60% of the capacity in 2023 alone, according to a new joint report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research & Analytics.
The report finds India’s ESS sector poised to boom in the coming years, in line with the exponential growth of the renewable energy sector.
“Globally, power systems across different regions are undergoing a pivotal phase of development,” says the report’s contributing author, Vibhuti Garg, Director, South Asia, IEEFA. 
“The exponential surge in renewable energy installations within the past decade has exposed the grid infrastructure to increased risks arising from renewables’ intermittent and variable nature, especially solar and wind. ESS is crucial in overcoming this intermittency and enabling a continuous energy supply when needed. Thus, for sustainable renewable energy addition, a concurrent growth of ESS capacity is also imperative,” she adds.
A snapshot of the Indian ESS market

Battery-based ESS (BESS) and pumped hydro storage (PHS) are the most widespread and commercially viable means for implementing energy storage solutions in India, with green hydrogen expected to gain a greater share of the renewable energy mix in coming years.
The Central Electricity Authority estimates India will need about 42 GW of BESS and 19 GW of pumped hydro storage (PHS) capacity by 2030.
Large, grid-scale ESS projects will be crucial in meeting these future energy needs. To this end, the latest demand-driven Firm and Dispatchable Renewable Energy (FDRE) tenders offer the ideal model for India.
“FDRE tenders, first issued in 2023, are demand profile-driven tenders to ensure firmness and dispatchability of renewable energy, and create a win-win scenario for power developers and offtakers,” says the report’s co-author, Jyoti Gulia, Founder, JMK Research.
 “With similar power quality and declining costs of renewable energy and ESS, FDRE can potentially replace thermal, a situation electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) are already exploring,” she adds.
FDRE is the latest, most advanced iteration of tender models, such as round-the-clock (RTC), Solar + BESS and standalone ESS, offering tariffs already comparable to, if not lower than, traditional fossil fuel-based power generation.
Their tariffs will likely become even more attractive with longer tenures of up to 25 years as grid-scale FDRE storage projects mature.
 “The discovered tariff in RTC tenders is lower than any peak power supply tenders, even though RTC tenders ensure higher availability and supply of renewable energy. This trend is due to the higher utilisation rate of ESS,” says the report’s co-author, Prabhakar Sharma, Consultant, JMK Research.
“Falling ESS costs, especially for BESS, and sustained cash flow over a longer duration enable ESS developers to quote lower tariffs,” he adds.
 Policy measures like the energy storage obligation (ESO) targets are also helping create a conducive environment for ESS projects.
“ESS trading on power markets is also likely to increase in the coming years, driven by entities aiming to meet their energy storage obligation (ESO) targets and storage developers looking for avenues to sell the excess power from soon-to-be commissioned grid-scale ESS projects,” says Sharma.
 “Other policy measures supporting the growth of ESS include the viability gap funding (VGF) scheme for BESS projects, the National Energy Storage Policy and the National Pumped Hydro Policy,” he adds.
 However, obstacles to the expansion of ESS remain, such as high initial capital expenditure, longer gestation periods (especially for PHS projects), suboptimal infrastructure and a dearth of domestic manufacturing, highlighting potential supply chain risks.
 “India aims to augment its VRE installed capacity (solar and wind) from 117GW to more than 392GW by 2030. This surge in VRE penetration needs to be supported by a simultaneous growth in ESS capacity,” says Gulia.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/21/worlds-largest-8-hour-lithium-battery-approved-in-australia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 21, 2023",World’s largest 8-hour lithium battery approved in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
The Richmond Valley Battery Energy Storage System lithium-iron phosphate battery system is being developed at the proposed Richmond Valley Solar Farm site at Myrtle Creek by Ark Energy, which, along with the Sun Metals Zinc Refinery in Queensland, is a subsidiary of Korea Zinc.
The battery project, which will use lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) technology, will have a power capacity of 275 MW and an energy storage capacity of up to 2,200-MWh over eight hours. With existing and planned projects globally, this constitutes the largest eight-hour lithium-ion battery project in the world to date.
Behind the large-scale project, Korea Zinc is already working on other energy storage mechanisms closer to its Townsville base, from where it supplies much of Asia with non-ferrous metals. The Richmond Valley project is being developed by Ark Energy which has a mandate to provide Korea Zinc with enough renewable energy for the production of green zinc.
The Richmond Valley battery project is one of five energy infrastructure projects representing 750 MW of renewable energy generation and 524 MW/4,192 MWh of long-duration storage that have been successful to the New South Wales (NSW) government’s latest tender round as it prepares for the exit of coal-fired power generation from the state’s electricity grid.
“NSW is now almost halfway there on our 2030 renewable generation target, and over a quarter of the way there on our long-duration storage target,” NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said.

The five successful projects represent $4.2 billion (USD 2.84 billion) in private sector investment in NSW’s renewable energy infrastructure. The energy storage projects are expected to be operational by 2028 and are expected to contribute an estimated 1,000 jobs, $2 billion in local supply chain benefits and $40 million towards First Nations initiatives.
With an energy storage capacity of up to 2.2 GWh over eight hours, the Richmond Valley durational battery storage project exceeds other big batteries planned for Australia and globally including Akaysha’s Waratah Super Battery which has a capacity of 850 MW/1,680 MWh and the Orana battery in NSW that clocks in 415 MW / 1,660 MWh. It is also larger than Synergy’s 500 MW / 2,000 MWh Collie battery in WA and has six hours more capacity than Equis’ 1,200 MW / 2.4 GWh (two hours) Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub battery project.
The Richmond Valley battery project will be built alongside the proposed Richmond Valley Solar Farm being developed near Casino in northern NSW. The project includes the construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of the solar farm with a capacity of 500 MW. The project includes the installation of approximately one million PV panels on a mounted tracking system and will connect to the grid via the Coffs Harbour to Lismore 330 kV powerline that transects the site.
Australia’s leadership in renewable durational battery storage lies in its ideal circumstances for large-scale solar. The combination of available land, high solar coverage, a comparatively high level of technological infrastructure and functional governance are all elements that make Australia an ideal breeding ground for renewable energy projects such as the Richmond Valley battery.
Australian conditions make it ideal for industrial giants such as Korea Zinc, the world’s largest producer of zinc, lead and silver, and its subsidiaries.
Korea Zinc is currently trying to organise its supply chains so it can avoid exclusion from battery production in the US with the new FEOC regulations (‘foreign entities of concern’) – basically trying to reduce the total dependence on China for all things battery-related.
The company is also ramping up its renewable energy production – with Ark Energy, among others – as well as ramping up its recycling activities to keep critical raw materials in production loops. According to US stipulations, if battery materials were originally produced in China but recycled outside of FEOC, these materials regain eligibility for US subsidies.
The clean production of energy and short transport distances mark two important issues in compliance with standards for government investments in important industries. Refining zinc takes a lot of energy. If battery materials are not produced and transported with the lowest possible carbon footprint, they face exclusion from many governmental support schemes globally as countries try to decarbonise their industries.
Ark Energy is tasked with decarbonising the Korea Zinc subsidiary Sun Metal’s Townsville zinc refinery. The plant is currently Queensland’s second biggest electricity user and chews up between $50 – $80 million in energy costs each year.
Korea Zinc has recognised Australia’s combination of assets, making it one of the world’s ideal locations for industrial activity, with production on-site reducing excessive transportation costs of renewable energy – particularly from neighbouring regions with high energy needs.
In terms of durational storage, lithium battery projects are said to be limited to eight hours of storage potential. The use of lithium for durational storage pits it in competition with transportation needs as the world’s transport industries transition off fossil fuels. Vehicle batteries have higher demands of battery performance and are, therefore, not as flexible as the frameworks applying to stationary storage in terms of alternative methods.
Lithium battery storage systems typically last four to eight hours. As renewable energy generation becomes a higher share of the grid, it will require longer durations and technologies with different characteristics to simulate a “base load” generation mix.
Besides lithium battery storage systems, “mid- to long-term” storage technologies such as iron air or zinc-based battery storage systems (which still have other drawbacks) boast the use of significantly more abundant materials. Renewable energy stored in green hydrogen can make electricity available months later. Gravitational storage provides a duration of 4-24 hours and has a lifespan of up to 35 years.
Korea Zinc is covering all options. Last month, Ark Energy broke ground on its SunHQ green hydrogen hub. The industrial group is also getting primed to export energy to those places less well-endowed with the combination of sun and space – such as most of densely populated Asia – by means of a renewable energy hub in Queensland.
In terms of durational energy storage potential, publications in China point to gravity energy being one of the most tenable energy storage mechanisms for durational storage, also mentioning Vault Energy as an industry leader in this regard. Compared to other methods, gravity-based storage does not need to rely on research years or decades in the future, has a low environmental footprint, no supply chain issues, and is flexible and scalable, making it versatile for both small- and large-scale energy storage.
In 2022, Korea Zinc signed a partnership with Vault Energy. The Swiss company’s gravitational EVx storage system works like pumped hydro. It uses power when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-tonne blocks made of soil and waste materials, rather than water, up to a height. When energy is needed – irrespective of whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing – the blocks are lowered, which releases their potential energy to generate electricity.
Pumped storage has been around for a long time, but utilising moving mass is relatively new, and Energy Vault is considered a leader in this area. Energy Vault says the technology is not dependent on specific terrain, lasts 4-24 hours, and has a lifespan of up to 35 years.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/21/master-slave-technique-for-deploying-parallel-inverters-in-pv-systems/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 21, 2023",Master-slave technique for deploying parallel inverters in PV systems,"A group of scientists from the University of Hradec Kralove in Czechia has developed a master-slave control system for controlling parallel inverters connected to a PV system.
The research group explained that using parallel inverters in PV systems is a strategy to optimize power generation while maintaining system efficiency and reliability, noting that master-slave architectures, which is a well-known concept for controlling and regulating shared resources, are commonly used in off-grid PV systems linked to storage.
In master-slave systems, a master entity receives one or more inputs and then creates slave entities to execute them. The master also controls the number of slaves and what each slave does.
“Auto-master-slave control is implemented to achieve rapid dynamic response and precise distribution of load power,” the academics said, noting that the main challenge of this configuration, however, is minimizing the circulating current between parallel units.
They also explained that previous approaches on parallel inverters had prioritized stabilization issues. “This master-slave structure allows photovoltaics to supply maximum energy to the microgrid,” they added. “Storage provides system voltage and frequency support by acting as master voltage sources.”
The team said that the proposed control technique relies on four pillars: effective circulating current reduction; accurate MPPT combining the perturb and observe (P&O) method with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm; rapid response to load and radiation changes in under 50 milliseconds; and a payback period of 3.6 years.
The scientists utilized, in particular, a d-q-0 axes PID controller, a master unit based on a voltage loop PID control, and slave units using dual-loop PID current control. “The slave units’ outer loop is responsible for tracking the PV units’ maximum power, while the inner loop is responsible for sharing the desired amount of power with a current that is in phase with the load current,” they explained.
Through a series of simulations, the scientists found that the master inverter connected to the batteries was able to maintain constant system voltage and compensate for deficits in PV generation. The proposed approach was also found to effectively restrict circulating currents between inverters.
Furthermore, they observed that the MPPT operates all solar panels at their exact MPPs with 100% efficiency and negligible fluctuations, regardless of the load and radiation conditions. The control system responds to any changes in load or radiation in less than 50 milliseconds, ensuring fast and efficient operation of the system, they concluded.
The novel control strategy was presented in the paper “Maximizing photovoltaic system power output with a master-slave strategy for parallel inverters,” published in Energy Reports.

Chinese solar module manufacturer Longi has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 27.09% for an HBC solar cell. Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) has confirmed the result.
Longi said the result was enabled through a new laser graphical process that costs less than conventional high-cost photolithography processes.
“This substitution has effectively reduced the cost of the BC cell,” the company said in a statement, noting that the HBC architecture also minimizes the reliance on traditional indium-based transparent conductive oxide (ITO). “This breakthrough has propelled the commercialization of HBC solar cells, featuring independent intellectual property and cost-effectiveness.”
In early November, Longi announced a power conversion efficiency of 33.9% for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.
It claimed the world’s highest efficiency for silicon cells in November 2022, with a 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified heterojunction solar cell.
