Under this strategy, it would invest in new green technologies, including lithium-ion batteries, while focusing on value maximization in its core business of lead-acid batteries.
Setting up a strategic business unit for ‘new energy’ is part of the transition strategy. This business unit would encompass lithium cells and battery packs, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, energy storage systems, advanced home energy solutions, and related products and services. 
The New Energy business will build on technological innovations such as lithium and other new-age chemistries that are enabling accelerated transformation in renewable energy, electric mobility, microgrids, etc. 
“The advanced chemistry cell (ACC)  production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme announced recently by Government of India…provides a significant impetus for building a domestic supply chain for lithium and other advanced cell chemistries to serve the fast-growing EV and renewable energy sectors. Amara Raja Batteries Limited plans to invest in a bouquet of products and services to accelerate its transformation to an Energy and Mobility solutions provider,” read a statement by the company.
Amara Raja Batteries Limited reported a profit-before-tax of INR 873.33 crore (US$ 119 million) for the financial year 2020-21, with revenues for the year at INR 7,149.68 crore (US$ 976 million) compared to INR 6,839.46 crore (US$ 934 million) during FY 20. It has been recording strong volume growth in both automotive and industrial applications across all customer segments.
The company believes that the lead-acid batteries business will continue to grow in India owing to the buoyant demand from automotive, industrial, telecom, and new emerging segments like data centers. 
Keeping up with the demand, the company would continue to invest and expand the lead-acid batteries business. It would tap opportunities in the home inverter, motive power, and unorganized segments, further consolidating its existing strengths and market share. 
Amara Raja Batteries Limited will further invest in advanced process technologies to maintain its technological edge and recycling to enhance critical raw material security and expand its commitment to environmental responsibility.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/14/ntpc-invites-global-eoi-for-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electrolyzer-systems/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS,MICROGRID,INDIA,WORLD",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 14, 2021",NTPC seeks expressions of interest for hydrogen fuel cell-electrolyzers,"State-owned NTPC Limited, India’s largest power generator, is seeking expressions of interest (EoI) to set up hydrogen-based fuel cell systems to provide back-up power and be used in microgrid applications. The EoI documents explain a separate project is envisioned for each application with the hydrogen to be produced by an electrolyzer.
Under the project, NTPC would install the hydrogen-based fuel cell-electrolyzers as pilots with a view to rolling out such systems as a green alternative to diesel generation.
In one pilot project, NTPC aims to replace around 500-1,000 kW of diesel generator capacity which provides back-up power for its offices in Noida, with an electrolyzer. The project includes an on-site electrolyzer to produce the hydrogen needed.
In the other scheme, the power company would set up a 50 kW electrolyzer-fuel-cell-based microgrid at one of its guest houses at NTPC Simhadri, in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The electrolyzer would generate the sustainable fuel during the day and provide electricity at night, via the fuel cell.
“There are multiple possible fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies to create back-up power and [a] microgrid solution,” stated the EoI document. “The responses shall be evaluated regarding various factors, with the key[s] being, expertise of the applicant, technology, capital cost, efficiency, reliability, maintenance challenges, and [the proposed] contribution to capital investment. The interested applicants will specify the technical specification [and] the total estimated project cost, and shall propose the financial contribution to be shared by themselves and by NTPC.”
The document continued: “NTPC would implement the project either on [a] nomination basis or through [a] request for proposal (RFP) process amongst the shortlisted parties identified through this EoI process. The intellectual property generated from the pilot projects (a first-of-its-kind in India) will be co-owned by NTPC and the applicant. The same, may be monetized separately during the commercialization of the technologies.”
