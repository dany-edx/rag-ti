However, they have lower energy density compared to ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries, and their uptake is held back by high upfront cost.
Now, researchers led by the University of Padua in Italy developed a techno-economic model, using experimental and market data, which can better inform investment decisions for this type of technology.
Their model considers the present and future competitivity of industrial flow batteries in operating specific services, which have not yet been developed to an accurate grade, and yields economic performance indicators such as capital costs, operative costs, levelized cost of storage (LCOS), and net present value.
To perform their calculations, the researchers used technical parameters taken from large-area multi-cell stacks, rather than from small single-cell experiments, to better characterize the behavior of real industrial-scale systems. They also used data from real financial markets and economic patterns of some major manufacturers.
The assessment was performed considering a lifespan of 20 years with a charge/discharge cycle per day. Each component affecting the capital and operative costs was analyzed, and the impact of side phenomena on capacity losses was considered.
As a result, their model showed where the economic indicators are heading and which parameters have a greater affect on investment profitability, thus tracking a possible roadmap for system optimization.
Their estimations indicate that technological and market evolutions are heading to much more competitive systems, with capital costs down to €260 ($284.2)/kWh at an energy/power duration of 10 hours. Namely, this is the breakeven point where the present values of total costs equate the present values of total revenues and no economic result is obtained.
“This is to be compared with a break-even point in the net present value of 400€ kWh, which suggests that flow batteries may play a major role in some expanding markets, notably the long duration energy storage,” the researchers stated.
Their results are published in the study “Techno-economic assessment of future vanadium-flow batteries based on real device/market parameters,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.

In its strategic plan for the 2024-27 period, Spanish inverter manufacturer Power Electronics said it plans to invest €300 million ($328 million) to expand its inverter production capacity in Spain and the United States.
A company spokesperson told pv magazine that its current production capacity is 30 GW, and it will increase manufacturing capacity in the United States by more than 20 GW by 2026.
The new factory will cover an area of 174,015 square meters and “will be designed with the latest manufacturing and assembly technologies to serve as an optimal center for the manufacturing and distribution of its products throughout the country,” said the company.
The plan also foresees the completion of a new plant in Llíria, Spain, for the Electric Mobility division.
Power Electronics products are present in almost 2,000 plants in 35 countries around the world. The company closed the year 2023 with an installed AC power capacity of 91 GW. According to Wood Mackenzie’s report on inverter shipments in 2022 published in August, Power Electronics is ranked seventh globally.

7,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/19/how-to-convert-pv-plants-with-dual-axis-trackers-into-agrivoltaic-facilities/,"AGRIVOLTAICS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RACKING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-19,How to convert PV plants with dual-axis trackers into agrivoltaic facilities,"From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers at the University of Cordoba in Spain has developed a new method to calculate how much land could be used for agricultural purposes under photovoltaic plants based on dual-axis solar trackers.
The scientists analyzed, in particular, the behavior of solar irradiance in a south-oriented facility hosting a tree crop in hedges planted in the same direction and found there is geometric space between the panel rows where the crop would not shade the modules.
The proposed methodology is specifically intended to identify these non-shading zones between the two-axis solar trackers. “Based on this analysis, an innovative method is proposed to estimate the maximum available space that could be occupied by crops within photovoltaic plants with rectangular collectors on dual-axis trackers with backtracking,” they explained.
In the study “Methodology for the estimation of cultivable space in photovoltaic installations with dual-axis trackers for their reconversion to agrivoltaic plants,” published in Applied Energy, the academics said the novel methodology initially defines the West, South, and Azimut vectors that characterize the PV system.
It also considers the latitude of the place and the solar declination, as well as the hour angle given by the angular rotation speed of the Earth, the time with respect to solar noon, and the unit vector directed towards the solar disk at all times.
“Once the azimuth and the elevation of the solar collectors are known, it is possible to determine the unit normal vector to the surface of the collectors at each instant,” the academics explained, noting that the proposed approach analyzes the behavior of the vectors as a consequence of the movement of the collectors that depends on the position of the sun at each instant.
The novel methodology was applied via a simulation to the Molino photovoltaic plant, which is located in Cordoba and is equipped with dual-axis solar trackers, in an effort to identify pentagonal arable space between the collectors.
This analysis allowed the researchers to identify, along the North-South direction, several trapezoidal profile streets available for cultivation. These have a width of 10.5 m, a minimum height of 1.31 m in the lateral areas,  and a maximum height of 2.81 m in the middle area.
The scientists said the curve of the percentage of the maximum cultivable area is a function of the crop height. “The actual cultivated land will be lower as this maximum cultivable area may be adapted to the typical and appropriate alignment and geometry for the specific crop selected, as well as to the constraints imposed by the farming operation of the crop,” they specified.
They found that the Molino plant offers up to 74% of arable land in the space between collectors, and said that this space decreases as the height of the crop increases. “Therefore, the agricultural production of the agricultural plant and its yield will depend on the crop finally selected,” they emphasized.
