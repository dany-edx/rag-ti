The latest line is capable of manufacturing ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyolefin elastomer (POE) sheets.
The company is looking to significantly expand its encapsulant output to 11 GW by adding another 8 GW in a phase-wise manner.
Towards that goal, it has already started working on the addition of yet another GW of encapsulant production capacity, which will ramp up its total capacity to 4 GW.
Avinash Hiranandani, global chief executive officer and managing director, RenewSys, said, “It is an exciting time to be in the solar manufacturing industry in India. More organizations and homeowners are looking to switch to solar now, than ever before.
“The support of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and the impetus to the ‘Make in India’ movement has been fuelling the set-up of PV module manufacturing facilities pan India. We welcome all these new businesses and look forward to partnering in their growth journey, by supplying them with world-class PV encapsulants and backsheets, made right here- in India.”
RenewSys recently launched an EVA encapsulant called CONSERV Ultra plus (U+). This thermo-efficient encapsulant reduces the curing time per PV module cycle by 2-3 minutes, increasing the efficiency of the module manufacturing line by 10-20%.
Headquartered in Mumbai, RenewSys is an integrated manufacturer of solar PV modules (1.75 GW/annum capacity), and their key components including encapsulants (3 GW), backsheets (4 GW), and PV cells (130 MW). Since its inception in 2011, it has supplied over 15 GW of PV encapsulant and backsheet material globally. It has to its credit several firsts including India’s UL certified POE, transparent backsheet, and the only backsheet patent.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/24/priority-sector-lending-can-help-unlock-ev-financing-market-of-inr-40000-crore-by-2025/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 24, 2022",Priority-sector lending can help unlock US$5-billion EV financing market by 2025,"India’s electric vehicle (EV) finance market could reach an estimated INR 40,000 crore ($US5 billion) by 2025 and INR 3.7 lakh crore ($US50 billion) by 2030. Priority sector lending can be a crucial pathway to helping realize this potential. If designed well, it can incentivize banks to finance EVs, while institutionalizing the importance of the EV sector within the financial industry, says a new report by NITI Aayog, Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), and RMI India.
The report, titled ‘Banking on Electric Vehicles in India’, says retail finance for EVs in India has been slow to pick up. Given the nascency of EV technology and adoption, financial institutions such as banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are not lending to EVs due to associated asset and business model risks.
Priority sector lending mandates certain banks to direct a specified percentage of bank credit to priority sectors. The report states the inclusion for retail lending to EVs has the potential to increase investor confidence by providing a market signal of ongoing government commitment to the sector. It can also ensure a swift and equitable transition by providing a mandate for financial institutions to direct credit to segments and use cases where credit deficiency persists despite compelling economics.
Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, said, “Reserve Bank of India’s PSL [priority-sector lending] mandate has a proven track record of improving the supply of formal credit towards areas of national priority. It can provide a strong regulatory incentive for banks and NBFCs to scale their financing to EVs.”
The report highlights that the RBI may consider various EV segments and use cases based on the parameters of socio-economic potential, livelihood generation potential, scalability, techno-economic viability, and stakeholder acceptability.
“Buyers are unable to access low-interest rates and long loan tenures for EVs as banks are concerned about resale value and product quality. Priority-sector lending can encourage banks to fast-track India’s transition to EVs and help achieve our 2070 climate goals,” said Clay Stranger, Managing Director, RMI.
The report indicates that electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and commercial four-wheelers are early segments to prioritize under PSL considering the socioeconomic potential, livelihood generation potential scalability, techno-economic viability, and stakeholder acceptability. Moving forward, the engagement of other ministries and industry stakeholders will be important to ensuring the guidelines designed can effectively enhance EV investment in India.
To maximize the impact of the inclusion of EVs, the report also recommends a clear sub-target and penalty mechanism for priority sector lending to renewable energy and EVs. Furthermore, it suggests recognition of EVs as an infrastructure sub-sector by the Ministry of Finance and the incorporation of EVs as a separate reporting category under the RBI. Multiprong solutions such as these are needed not only for EV penetration and businesses but also for the financial sector and India’s 2070 net-zero target.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/24/sodium-ion-battery-tech-gets-commercial-testing-in-uk/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 24, 2022",Sodium-ion battery tech gets commercial testing in UK,"From pv magazine International
UK-based battery manufacturer AMTE Power, battery intelligence tech provider Brill Power and energy management system specialist Starke Energy will demonstrate their latest energy storage technologies at a commercial-scale testbed at Harwell Campus, in Oxfordshire, England. The three technologies will be integrated into a battery storage system which will be coupled with the Science and Engineering Facilities Council’s on-site solar array at the campus, with no further details on these systems specified.
The testbed will demonstrate AMTE’s sodium-ion battery module using Brill Power’s battery intelligence technology to ensure optimal battery usage, lifetime, performance, and safety and Starke Energy’s energy management system, which links stored energy into the electricity grid and markets. This is the first time that these technologies are being deployed in a commercially relevant project.
The energy storage system at Harwell is expected to be in operation from March this year and will run for a minimum of 12 months. In the project’s first phase AMTE Power will deploy lithium-ion cells before switching to use the company’s Ultra Safe sodium-ion cell technology in the second demonstration phase of the project.
“The ability to test our new products in a commercial operating environment is invaluable. Having access to the Hardwell site will accelerate the time to market for our new energy products incorporating our Ultra Safe cells” said John Fox, director of business development at AMTE Power.
Ultra Safe
Last year, AMTE Power entered into a licensing deal with Sheffield-based Na-ion battery specialist Faradion, which was recently acquired by India-headquartered multinational Reliance Industries. Under the collaboration deal between the two U.K.-based companies, AMTE Power was given a license for defined fields of use and geographies to manufacture and sell sodium-ion cell for stationary energy storage systems.
The idea behind the partnership was to use Faradion’s patented technology and leverage AMTE Power’s existing lithium-ion manufacturing facilities in Thurso, Scotland. AMTE Power has branded its sodium-ion product Ultra Safe due to improved safety and enhanced thermal stability, whereas Faradion’s patented zero-volt tech has enabled the Ultra Safe product to offer safer transportation and maintenance options for customers and users.
Faradion’s technology is said to provide similar performance to ubiquitous li-ion chemistry, while being more sustainable and affordable. Its technology is highly scalable and applicable in various fields, such as transportation, storage, backup power, and energy in remote locations. Set up in 2010, the company has developed an extensive IP portfolio to cover numerous aspects of Na-ion technology, focusing on three key areas: cell materials, cell infrastructure and safety and transportation.
Faradion says its Na-ion cells can be made on existing commercial Li-ion manufacturing lines. The operating temperature range is -30 to +60 degrees. “Our cell chemistry provides world-leading cell-specific energy of 150-160 Wh/kg for sodium-ion,” Faradion CEO James Quinn told pv magazine last year.
The project will also feature Oxford University spin-out Brill Power’s battery intelligence technology, which is supported by its proprietary battery monitoring and analytics software platform and said to be capable of improving all aspects of advanced battery systems, including performance, cost of ownership, reliability and safety. “This testbed will enable us to integrate our technology with other cutting-edge battery innovations and collect real-world data on a commercially relevant site,” said Brill Power CEO and co-founder Christoph Birkl.
Starke Energy’s energy management system will integrate the battery system with the local energy network at Harwell. The system, using artificial intelligence, learns how much energy is being produced by renewable sources, and how much is being used to optimize the storage and release of energy across a network of connected intelligent batteries.
The Harwell project is part of the Interreg North-West Europe STEPS program, which is providing financial backing and supporting small and medium-sized businesses to accelerate their market readiness. Under the program, AMTE, Brill and Starke have benefited from expert support provided by UK STEPS partners Cambridge Cleantech and the Faraday Institution. This has included tailored testing, introductions to potential end-users and market knowledge to strengthen the competitiveness of their products.
The Harwell testbed is one of 20 testbeds being developed throughout North-West Europe by a variety of SMEs, including a second in the UK at Allia’s Future Business Centre in Cambridge. It will use a battery system from English manufacturer Aceleron, which claims to offer world’s most sustainable lithium-ion batteries.
