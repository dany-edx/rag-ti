https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/15/implementing-robust-om-practices-in-the-solar-industry/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"DECEMBER 15, 2023",Implementing robust O&M practices in the solar industry,"While solar panels stand out as a commendable source of clean energy, it’s important to recognise that their performance can vary under different conditions, particularly in the presence of dirt and contaminants. Despite their lack of moving parts, these panels inevitably accumulate additional debris over time, including dust, pollutants, and bird droppings, leading to a potential decrease in energy output by up to 15%. This underscores the necessity for consistent monitoring and periodic maintenance to optimise panel efficiency and ensure their long-term effectiveness.
Ensuring the reliable performance of solar PV systems demands a meticulous approach  to the maintenance of essential solar operations and maintenance (O&M) practices. This encompasses not only the solar PV panels but also batteries, charge controllers, inverters, and all associated wiring and connections. The smooth functioning of these components ensures the longevity and consistent performance of the solar system, maximizing its energy generation potential and overall reliability.
Efficient performance of solar panels, particularly in countries with diverse climates like India, hinges on consistent maintenance practices. The performance of a panel might be seriously hampered by dust buildup. Following the manufacturer’s guidelines, cleaning with water and gentle brushes or microfiber cloths is essential to ensure maximum energy output. The cleaning frequency should be based on the soiling loss, prioritizing low-performing inverters over conventional approach of target cleaning cycles.
Additionally, periodic testing is beneficial in assessing the module performance within the warranty provided by the OEM. This proactive approach not only enhances energy generation but also extends the lifespan of the panels, offering long-term cost-effectiveness.
Moreover, routine inspections stand as a cornerstone of effective solar PV system management. By conducting regular assessments, potential issues can be identified and addressed in their early stages. Employing monitoring systems that offer real-time performance data is instrumental in detecting underperforming panels or faulty equipment swiftly. This proactive maintenance strategy not only prevents major breakdowns but also fine-tunes the system to operate at its peak efficiency, ensuring consistent energy production over time.
Taking proactive measures to develop an emergency response plan or breakdown impact analysis in the event of failure of any equipment/spare in the plant, ensures the timely restoration of the equipment and consequently, enhancing plant availability. The digitalization of tools for tracking end-to-end O&M activities, spanning from procurement, operations, reporting, preventive/predictive/breakdown maintenance plan and HSE, plays a vital role in centralized management of O&M activities.
Many other components play a pivotal role in the operation of solar plants, underscoring the importance of maintenance, with a particular focus on inverter maintenance. Often regarded as the heart of the system, inverters require regular checks, software updates, and timely replacements. This ensures the efficient conversion of DC to AC power, enabling the system to function optimally.
Moreover, battery maintenance is vital for energy storage and overall reliability. Proper operation involves monitoring battery health, ensuring the correct charge and discharge cycles, and avoiding overcharging or deep discharging. Regular inspections of electrolyte levels, corrosion, and connection integrity are crucial to prevent performance degradation and ensure the longevity of the battery.
Similarly, the charge controller, which regulates the flow of energy from the solar panels to the battery, also requires regular maintenance. This involves verifying its correct functioning and preventing both overcharging and undercharging of the battery. Monitoring its settings and performance ensures efficient energy conversion and protection against voltage fluctuations. Moreover, regular examination of wiring and connections is necessary to identify any loose or damaged components. Diligent wiring maintenance minimizes energy losses and prevents potential safety hazards due to short circuits or fires.
The success of these solar O&M efforts depends on the skills of manpower employed for the job. Investing in skilled manpower and providing comprehensive training is essential. Trained technicians equipped with the necessary knowledge can swiftly diagnose problems, perform repairs, and conduct preventive measures, thus minimizing system downtime. Collaborating with reputable O&M service providers offers the advantage of professional upkeep, combining expertise with the latest industry practices.
Most importantly, maintaining stringent adherence to safety protocols is non-negotiable in solar O&M practices. Regular technical and safety trainings, utilization of protective gear, and strict compliance with local regulations guarantee the well-being of personnel and the environment.
Enforcing operational and maintenance (O&M) practises for solar systems offers advantages beyond extending equipment lifespan. These advantages include increased effectiveness, cost savings, and a future powered by more sustainably produced energy. Operations and maintenance activities across all components are essential to ensure the efficient, safe, and reliable functioning of a solar PV system. To unlock the full potential of India’s solar installations and align with the country’s aspirations for sustainable energy, it is imperative to adhere to optimal O&M and preventive maintenance practices.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/15/batteries-in-hybrid-hydro-pv-systems-could-increase-profitability-by-2/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"DECEMBER 15, 2023",Batteries in hybrid hydro-PV systems could increase profitability by 2%,"Scientists from Norway’s Institute for Energy Technology have assessed the profitability of battery storage in hybrid hydropower and floating PV plants. They have found that the profitability of such facilities could be increased by up to 2%.
The scientists ran cost-optimal assessments for systems with and without batteries, and then compared their profitability in light of capacity markets, ancillary services, and energy arbitrage.
“This paper investigates the profitability potential for a viable business case for battery storage integration with utility-scale hybrid hydropower-solar photovoltaic plants,” they said. “It is based on a hypothetical, two-reservoir cascaded hydropower plant in Sub-Saharan Africa.”
The research team maintained constant characteristics for hydropower plants in the simulation, with a 36 MW turbine and a 90 MW turbine. The hybrid power plant operated under a power purchase agreement (PPA), with fixed capacities for both hydropower and the power grid restricted to 126 MW.
“In this study, a two-level configuration is assumed to represent a scenario in which electricity is more valuable during daytime,” the researchers said. “The same two-level shape persists throughout the entire year.”
The optimization model adjusted the capacity of the floating PV and the battery. The south-oriented floating PV system, with a fixed 13-degree tilt, used crystalline silicon PV modules with 19.9% efficiency and total system losses of 13%. The Li-ion LFP battery incorporated irradiation levels from the PVGIS SARAH2 dataset, a web application providing solar radiation and PV system energy production data.
The scientists said that for the base case result, the cost-optimal PPA power levels were 12.7 MW at $60/MWh and 118.6 MW at $100/MWh.
“The co-optimized case, in which both battery and [floating PV] are optimized for cost-efficiency, increases profitability by 0.6% compared to the base case,” they said.
With ancillary service revenue, the base case annual profitability could reach 2%, factoring in battery degradation constraints. The model assumed a 15-year battery lifetime, preventing it from reaching a state of health below 80% after this period, considering additional cycles from ancillary services.
The academics said that energy arbitrage “provided economic benefits for the hydro-floating PV power plant, but batteries were not necessary, and variable spot prices make predictability and value stacking difficult.”
The academics presented their findings in “Profitability of battery storage in hybrid hydropower–solar photovoltaic plants,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage.
