That could improve the receivables period for leading RE producers by 40-50 days from the current 180 days and improve the equity returns of some projects by up to one percentage point, the analysts added.
Manish Gupta, senior director, CRISIL Ratings, said, “The INR 9,000 crore of liquidated dues can support equity investments in 24 GW of under-implementation projects over the next two fiscals. Our calculation presumes that financially stronger discoms — such as in Gujarat and Maharashtra — would show better payment periods for RE projects than others that are expected to pay with an average delay of three to five months.”
Payment stretch has been one of the key risks for the RE sector. In March 2022, leading RE generators had receivables of about six months (similar to March 2019 level) despite their operational portfolio having an increasing share of central counterparties that clear payments within 30 days of the due date.
The receivables’ stretch has been caused by payment delays by select state counterparties such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu. These have a high proportion in the offtake mix of RE gencos, with receivables of 8-14 months over the past three fiscals.
The problem is compounded by the unpredictable payment profiles of discoms, with large variations. For instance, the receivables cycle of the Telangana discom rose to 400 days as of March 31, 2022, from 250 days as of March 31, 2019. For the Maharashtra discom, it surged to 300 days from 70 days, according to Crisil analysis.
Such stretch can cause cash-flow mismatches for RE gencos, which rely on liquidity buffers and working capital to service their own debt. It forces them to go for additional working capital, the cost of which depresses equity returns.
Under the proposed scheme, dues, including late payment surcharge as on the cut-off date of June 3, 2022, will be converted into monthly installments that discoms will pay over the following 12-48 months. That would translate to immediate liquidity gains for RE gencos and can lead to better payment profiles.
Crisil expects this dues liquidation scheme to drive nearly half of the 40-50 days of improvement envisaged in the receivables cycle of RE projects.
Further, RE gencos analyzed by CRISIL have benefited in the past from a rising share of central counterparties in their operational portfolio. Central counterparties’ share in their operating portfolio was up to 40% last fiscal, compared to less than 25% in fiscal 2019.
Ankit Hakhu, director, CRISIL Ratings, expects the share of central utilities to increase further to 55% over the next two fiscals as a majority of the capacity to be commissioned has power purchase agreements tied up with central counterparties. “This is expected to contribute the balance projected decrease in receivable days of 40-50 days by March 2024,” he said.

The airport will be able to offset two lakh tons of CO2 emissions per year with the switch to renewable energy to power its operations. This is a significant step toward achieving its goal of net-zero carbon emission by 2030.
Onsite solar plants meet around 6% of the airport’s electricity requirements. These include a 7.84 MW ground-mount solar power plant on the active airside and another 5.3 MW rooftop solar at the cargo terminals.

The 7.84 MW PV plant uses 27,800 modules and two types of seasonal tilts to ensure better system efficiency. An independent weather-monitoring system validates plant performance by monitoring and recording all parameters.
The airport meets the remaining 94% of its electricity requirements from hydropower. A Himachal Pradesh-based hydropower producer has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement to supply hydroelectricity for the airport until 2036.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/23/vertical-rooftop-pv-pilot-goes-online-in-norway/,"HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 23, 2022",Vertical rooftop PV pilot goes online in Norway,"From pv magazine Global
Norwegian startup Over Easy Solar AS has finalized the first pilot project to use its vertical solar module technology for rooftop applications.
“The 5 kW system was deployed in a school building in Oslo,” CEO  Trygve Mongstad told pv magazine. “We applied our modularized solution at a height of 31.4 cm above the rooftop with no need for ballast or fastening, and we are now validating it for application in each building and local wind conditions.”
The PV system is owned by Oslo municipality, which provided support through its Smart Oslo innovation fund. The system will be used mainly for self-consumption and will also sell excess power at spot prices to the grid under Norway’s net metering scheme.
“The orientation we chose here gives a peak at around 11 am in the morning, and a second peak at around 7 pm in the afternoon,” Mongstad explained, referring to the advantages of deploying vertical solar arrays at high latitudes. “There is most activity here early in the day and in the evening when the school is used for other extracurricular activities.”
Andreas Nilsen, energy and environmental adviser for municipal enterprise Oslobygg, said the energy production matches the school’s demand profile “perfectly.”
Over Easy Solar used 150 of its special solar panels, which are based on heterojunction solar cell technology. They have an efficiency of 22% and a bifaciality of up to 92%. Their temperature coefficient is -0.26 C. The panels were installed in 50 vertical PV units.
The units consist of a mounting system and solar panels in a single pre-assembled piece, so they can be mounted more quickly. The geometry with low-building vertical panels has no or very low need for fastening or ballast, which further simplifies the mounting job. Each unit measures 1,600 mm x 1,510 mm x 350 mm and weighs 24.5 kg. It also features an IP68 enclosure rating and 3.2 mm double-tempered glass.
“We are working to take down costs to a competitive level with respect to conventional solar installations,” Mongstad said. “The modularization of the vertical system is the key to taking down cost. By integrating the mounting system into the product we can take down cost and installation is much faster and easier than with conventional solar products.”
He claimed that deployment is extremely easy and fast because of modularization.
“The complete installation was in place in less than one hour, with two workers placing out the vertical units,” he said. “On a company level, our challenge is now to reach commercialization of the product. For this, we need risk capital, early mover customers, and other support to get over the ‘valley of death’.”
