OSOWOG is a globally interconnected power grid project aimed at seamless sharing of renewable energy resources among countries for mutual benefits and global sustainability. 
MNRE is the programme support agency for the OSOWOG Initiative, ISA the nodal implementing agency, and the World Bank the strategic advisory and funding agency. They have a critical role in synergizing over 140 countries across the Far-East and the Far West regions, building consensus, launching energy policy imperatives, and setting up the framework for large-scale global cooperation. 
The workshop, attended by more than 160 experts, saw implementation partners present their roadmap for OSOWOG. 
In his keynote address, Indu Shekhar Chaturvedi, Secretary, MNRE, said, “Political leadership from other countries have also expressed faith in our vision of a solar grid interconnected with RE across countries… Some multilateral announcements are likely to be made later in the year.”
Ajay Mathur, Director General- International Solar Alliance, said, “The advantage of interconnecting regional grids to each other provides a huge opportunity in terms of availability of the solar electricity, especially at times in a place where solar electricity is not available from other regional grid where solar electricity is available.” 
Simon Stolp, Practice Manager, Energy-South Asia, The World Bank, said, “Through OSOWOG, India has demonstrated its leadership in global energy transitions. India’s commitment to a clean energy future is clear and serves as a lighthouse to the South Asia region and the world. OSOWOG is based on the three critical pivots of sustainability, global interdependencies, and India’s commitment to play its global role. I would like to reaffirm The World Bank Group’s commitment to supporting India and the global community in achieving this vision.”
Other implementing partners include a consortium led by Electricité de France to conduct the pre-feasibility study for OSOWOG, State Bank of India as the contracting agency, and EY as the knowledge partner for this initiative. 
Topics discussed at the workshop included technical and economic valuation, regulations in different countries, 2050 roadmap for CO2 emission reduction, intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040, importance of technology improvements in HVAC/HVDC, undersea or overhead lines, transmission losses, smart operation management, hydrogen in transportation, system stability and supply security.
OSOWOG will be implemented in three phases. In the first phase, pre-feasibility analysis will carried out, covering individual countries’ assessment, demand-supply scenario projections, RE resource potential assessment and scenario assessment for net zero by 2050. The second phase will focus on pilot projects and timeline in terms of commissioning the interlinks. Lastly, the third phase will be geared towards setting up the institutional framework including draft policy and regulatory papers.

The project shall be located in the Ganjam District.
The project order is placed for a total amount of INR 188.19 crore (US$25.89 million).
Under the EPC contract, Tata Power Solar shall install a solar power plant on the government land acquired by NHPC Limited for the project. It shall also be responsible for the work of the associated 220 kV transmission line for connectivity at 220 kV Odisha Power Transmission Corporation Limited (OPTCL) transmission system and comprehensive operation and maintenance for ten years. 
State discom Grid Corporation of Odisha (GRIDCO) shall procure the power generated from the project for the entire project life of 25 years. 
The project has been sanctioned by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy under Solar Park Scheme and is scheduled to be commissioned within a period of 12 months.

Slovenian solar module maker Bisol has unveiled two new colored PV panels based on the company’s Spectrum product type.
Available in alabaster white and terracotta orange, the two products are claimed to add aesthetic features to the architectural traits of buildings and roofs of various types and styles. “Orange glass matches the shades of Dutch buildings and brick roofs all around the world and maintains the color recognition of the environment,” the manufacturer explained. “White glass is a great solution for seamlessly blending with large surface buildings and maintaining their historic character.”

“The coloring is done on the inner side of the glass, so the color is much more durable and resistant to all weather conditions,” a company’s spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Spectrum module with the colored glass is a 60-cell monocrystalline product relying on 3.2 mm glass with anti-reflective coating and high transparency. It is sold in three versions with power outputs of 190, 200 and 290 W, and an efficiency of up to 11.4% for the white panel. For comparison, the Spectrum modules without the colored glass would have an efficiency ranging from 18.9% to 20.5%.
The panel measures 1,665 × 1,002 x 35 mm and weighs 18.8 kg. The open-circuit voltage is between 40.3 V and 43.5 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 6.00 to 8.75 A. The maximum system voltage for the new product is 1,000 V.

The panel can be used with operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.37% per degree Celsius. It features an IP68 enclosure rating and an MC4-compatible connector.
The two modules come with a 25-year output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The manufacturer claims the panels will operate at 85% of their original performance after 25 years.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/26/india-opens-applications-for-inr4500-crore-solar-manufacturing-incentives/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 26, 2021",Applications open for solar manufacturing incentives  ,"The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency has invited applications for incentives from solar manufacturers prepared to set up high-efficiency module factories under the INR4500 crore ($619 million) production-linked incentive scheme.
Manufacturers setting up any solar technology-based production facilities will be eligible for assistance, provided they commit to develop facilities which manufacture at least solar cells and modules; meet a minimum level of production capacity; and adhere to minimum standards for solar module performance. The latter requirement sets standards for module efficiency and level of temperature coefficient of Pmax – which concerns the amount of power generation lost for every degree Celsius a panel is above 25 degrees Celsius.
Applicants bidding for incentives must indicate the annual scale of compensation they expect, based on the number of rupees they will accept per Watt of product manufactured and how many megawatts of products they expect to sell each year. They will also have to list any local value addition and any tapering factor to the incentives they are applying for.
Beneficiaries of the separate manufacturing-linked solar plant tender conducted by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy or the Special Incentive Package Scheme run by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, cannot also apply for support from the production-linked incentive program.
Applicants must also meet minimum requirements related to the size of their business or the volume of equity investment they can commit to each gigawatt of planned production capacity, with the value varying depending on how many layers of the solar production chain their facilities will perform. Those requirements are as follows:

India aims to install 175 GW of renewable energy generation capacity by next year, and 450 GW this decade. Based on techno-economic analysis, the Central Electricity Authority has projected an optimal clean power generation mix will require the nation to add 280 GW of solar capacity by 2029-30. That would mean around 25 GW of solar would need to be added annually. 
The government wants to ramp up Indian PV module manufacturing to support such growth. With the country currently hosting only 9-10 GW of solar module annual production capacity, and around 2.5 GW of cell fabrication facilities, India’s solar industry is heavily reliant on imported cells and modules.
