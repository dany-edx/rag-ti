The amount repaid includes the most recent amortization of $180 million this month.
“In today’s fast-paced global business environment, firms must be very strategic in financing for the growth initiatives,” said Kedar Upadhye, CFO of ReNew. “As ReNew and India lead the global energy transition, we have continued to mitigate refinancing risk without diminishing the company’s growth capital.”
Over the past fiscal year, ReNew refinanced $525 million in the domestic markets ahead of the March 2024 maturity, in addition to repayment of $300 million from its internal cash flow accruals. Post this refinancing, asset-backed bonds worth $325 million would be due for repayment in FY2025, while the rest of the dollar bonds worth $1.7 billion would be due for maturity in FY2027 and beyond.
ReNew previously announced the closing of $1 billion in financing for its round-the-clock (RTC) project.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/28/indosol-reliance-win-production-linked-incentives-for-poly-to-module-manufacturing/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 28, 2023","Indosol, Reliance win production-linked incentives for poly-to-module manufacturing","The Indian government has allocated a cumulative 39.6 GW of domestic solar module manufacturing capacity, with a total outlay of INR 14,007 crore ($1,705 million), under the second round of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. In all, eleven companies emerged winners for the incentives. 
Indosol and Reliance won incentives for their poly-to-module manufacturing capacity of 6 GW each. First Solar also won incentives for its fully vertically integrated facility of 3.4 GW. The cumulative 15.4 GW of fully integrated manufacturing capacity is likely to become operational by April 2026.
Waaree (6 GW), ReNew (4.8 GW), Avaada (3 GW), Grew (2 GW), and JSW (1 GW) won incentives for their module manufacturing capacities integrated up to the wafer stage. The cumulative wafer-to-module capacity of 16.8 GW will likely start production by April 2025.
Tata Power Solar (4 GW), Vikram Solar (2.4 GW), and AMPIN (1 GW) will set up integrated cell and module capacities totaling 7.4 GW. Production from these facilities is expected to start by October 2024.
“The Tranche-II of the PLI Scheme is expected to bring in an investment of INR 93,041 crore. It will also generate a total of 1,01,487 jobs with 35,010 getting direct employment and 66,477 being indirectly employed,” read the power ministry release.
A total integrated capacity of 8,737 MW was allocated under the first round of the PLI Scheme. Considering the two tranches together, the total domestic solar PV module manufacturing capacity allocated under the PLI Scheme is 48,337 MW, with cumulative support of more than INR 18,500 crore by the government.
“The PLI scheme will give a much-needed impetus to India’s solar module manufacturing sector. With the allocation of 3 GW by MNRE, Avaada Group will play a pivotal role in India’s green energy transition. This initiative will foster energy security, economic growth, and a cleaner environment. The participation of leading solar module manufacturers showcases the enormous potential of the PLI scheme in revolutionizing India’s renewable energy landscape,” said Vineet Mittal, chairman of Avaada Group.

Its earlier highest annual loan disbursement was INR 16,071 crore during FY 2021-22. IREDA also surpassed its highest annual loan sanction of INR 23,921 crore in FY 2021-22 and sanctioned loans aggregating to INR 32,578 crore as on March 27, 2023.
IREDA provides financial assistance to renewable energy projects across the country at competitive rates.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) recently approved IREDA listing on the stock exchanges through an Initial Public Offer (IPO) by the part sale of the government’s stake in it and to raise funds through issue of fresh equity shares by IREDA.
“The IPO will help in unlocking the value of government’s investment on one hand and on the other hand will provide an opportunity to the public to acquire a stake in the national asset and draw benefits therefrom. Besides, it will help IREDA in raising a part of its capital requirement for meeting growth plans. It will further improve the governance through greater market discipline and transparency arising from listing requirements and disclosures,” the company stated in a previous release.

As per the MoU, Tata Motors will deliver 1,000 units of Ace EV in the first year, for deployment in cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, and Kolkata. 
Gentari has further expanded its Vehicle-as-a-Service (VaaS) offering through an MoU with electric mobility provider MoEVing Urban Technology (MoEVing) to provide 1,000 three-wheeler and 500 four-wheeler electric cargo vehicles on subscription. 
“High-quality electric four-wheelers coming into the market opens a whole new segment to electrify in the urban delivery ecosystem. We are excited to work with Gentari to deploy three- and four-wheeler commercial electric vehicles across India to reduce the carbon footprint of deliveries. With our operations, charging, and maintenance footprint spanning across India, we hope to bring change on-ground and electrify deliveries for e-commerce, e-grocery, the logistics segment and now also large FMCG and traditional companies,” Vikash Mishra, MoEVing’s CEO said.
Separately, Gentari also exchanged MoU documents with logistics company Gati KWE (Gati) to provide 500 electric cargo vehicles through its VaaS offering. 
Introduced in Sept. 2022, Gentari aims to deliver a suite of renewable energy, hydrogen, and green mobility solutions that are safe, responsible, cost-optimized, and emissions-abated by applying an integrated approach across the clean energy value chain for customers globally.
Gentari, with its VaaS, has a current fleet of approximately 1,000 three-wheeler EVs serving third-party logistics and e-commerce operators as well as private users. In 2023, Gentari aims to further grow its EV fleet to more than 4,000 vehicles across ten cities with a mix of three- and four-wheeler vehicles. Meanwhile, from a current network of seven charging hubs operating in four cities at the end of 2022, Gentari targets to grow the number of hubs to 10 cities in 2023, expanding the current 162 charging points deployed in 2022. 
Gentari’s plans in India complement the company’s 2030 global aspirations of building a renewable energy capacity of 30-40 GW; supplying up to 1.2 mtpa of clean hydrogen; and becoming Asia Pacific’s preferred green mobility solutions provider by capturing a 10% market share (around 25,000 charging points) across key markets in the region.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/28/german-manufacturer-achieves-80-overall-efficiency-with-new-pvt-solar-module/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 28, 2023",German manufacturer achieves 80% overall efficiency with new PVT solar module,"From pv magazine Global
Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) said this week that its new PVT solar module PX-1 from German manufacturer Sunmaxx PVT has an overall efficiency of 80%.
The module measures 1,750 mm x 1,140 mm x 38 mm and features 108 PERC half-cells in the M10 format. The electrical output is 400 W, which corresponds to an electrical efficiency of about 20%.
The new product has also a thermal output of 1,200 W, which corresponds to a thermal collector efficiency EtaO of 60%. Fraunhofer ISE measured this value under maximum power point (MPP) conditions in full sunlight, at a module temperature of 25 C, and at a wind speed of 0 meters per second.
Fraunhofer ISE has conducted additional tests on real operating scenarios on outdoor and indoor test stands. The measurements showed that the module heats up to a maximum temperature of 30 C in full sunlight. Conventional PV modules reach temperatures of up to 80 C, which reduces their efficiency.
