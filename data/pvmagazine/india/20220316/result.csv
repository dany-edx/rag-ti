The AP High Court, in its order dated September 2019, had ordered the AP state distribution utilities (discoms) to pay the RE developers at a reduced interim tariff of INR 2.44/kWh for solar power and INR 2.43/kWh for wind power instead of the PPA tariff. 
The HC, in its latest order, has thus reinforced the sanctity of PPAs signed between the wind and solar power producers and state discoms. It has directed the state discoms to honor the terms of the signed PPAs and clear pending payments as per the agreed PPA tariff within six weeks from the date of the order. 
Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president and co-group head – Corporate ratings, ICRA, says the AP High Court order upholding the sanctity of the signed PPAs is a significant positive development for the renewable energy sector as it will provide a major liquidity relief for the affected independent power producers (IPPs) in the state. Pending resolution of PPA tariff renegotiation matter has been a key concern for the RE sector and, in turn, affected the credit profile of wind and solar IPPs in AP, especially the entities belonging to relatively weaker sponsor group.
He, however, flagged timely implementation of the HC order by the discoms as a critical monitorable, given the weak financial profile of the discoms in AP marked by continued losses and large debt dependence.
The HC order will directly impact the power purchase cost to be borne by the AP discoms. The tariff order issued by Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) for FY2022 has an approved annual revenue requirement (ARR) for AP discoms based on an average RE purchase cost of INR 2.55/unit, considering the interim PPA rate. Based on the direction by AP High Court, the incremental impact on power purchase cost for AP discoms is estimated at about INR 10,500 crore, due to the build-up of dues arising out of the difference between the PPA rate and interim rate over the last three-year period. 
Commenting on the demand from the industrial segment, Vikram V, vice president and sector head – Corporate Ratings, said, “Assuming this additional power purchase cost is approved as a regulatory asset to be amortized over five years, the incremental impact on the cost of power supply for AP discoms is estimated at 54 paise/unit, thus reflecting an upward pressure of 8.5% on average retail supply tariff for AP discoms. As a result, timely and adequate tariff determination by the APERC for AP discoms also remains a critical monitorable. Notwithstanding the pressure on the cost of power supply, the average retail tariffs have remained unchanged for AP discoms as per the tariff orders issued since FY2019.”

The first of these swap stations is already operational at Azadpur, one of the busiest marketplaces in the capital.
Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited’s large power capacity and extensive infrastructure will allow Battery Smart to establish more high-capacity swap stations at key locations to cater to the growing electric two- and three-wheeler market.
Battery Smart, co-founded by IIT Kanpur graduates Pulkit Khurana and Siddharth Sikka, targets a $17 billion swapping market by 2025 by aiming to have a swap station at every one square km area in the Delhi-NCR region to begin. It is working with various players in the industry, including battery manufacturers, OEMs, the driver community, and startups, to build a robust ecosystem that can help drivers easily shift to a more economical EV model.
Commenting on the partnership, Dwijadas Basak, Chief- Commercial, Consumer Experience& Social Impact Group, Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited, said, “Our partnership with Battery Smart strengthens our resolve to enable India’s EV revolution. This partnership reiterates our commitment towards a cleaner and pollution-free Delhi by making swapping stations accessible to customers at the same scale and convenience as refueling.”
Battery Smart co-founder, Siddharth Sikka, said, “This is a significant milestone for us as we have been growing at 10X since last July, and this association will provide us access to existing infrastructure and power requirements to scale our business further.”

SolarArise India Projects, an investee company of ThomasLloyd, owns seven solar power projects with a cumulative capacity of 434MW in India.
ThomasLloyd expects the acquisition to complete in the second quarter of 2022. “Consideration of $34.6 million for the acquisition will be settled via the issuance of ordinary shares in the company,” stated the company.
SolarArise was founded in 2014 by James Abraham, Anil Nayar and Tanya Singhal. Other shareholders besides ThomasLloyd are the Global Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF), advised by the European Investment Bank Group, the Core Infrastructure India Fund (CIIF), managed by Kotak Mahindra Bank, and the founding team.
ThomasLloyd has entered into a conditional Heads of Terms Agreement to increase its investment in SolarArise by purchasing further shares from the other existing shareholders.
“The company remains on target to deliver an annual dividend of 2-3% per share on the basis of the initial offer price of $1 per share for the year ending 31 December 2022. The Board and Investment Manager continues to carefully assess a strong pipeline of diverse opportunities for further deployment of the initial proceeds,” it said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/16/panasonic-launches-solar-heat-pump-solution-for-water-heating/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 16, 2022",Panasonic launches solar heat pump solution for water heating,"From pv magazine Global 
From April 20, Japan’s Panasonic will start offering a new air-source heat pump that can be combined with residential rooftop solar for water heating.
The Eco Cute solution includes a heat pump and hot water storage unit that purportedly saves energy by maintaining bathwater temperatures at a constant level. It also helps homeowners to save energy at night by using heat from their bathwater. In addition, the device reduces energy and water use.
The product features a solar charging function that uses surplus electricity generated and stored from PV sources. It can use electricity to boil water during the night or day, said Panasonic.
The new product also has an “emergency boiling” function that is activated when disaster warnings or bad weather warnings are issued. This means the water continues to boil automatically, so the tank is always filled with hot water.
“Therefore, hot water can be secured in case of a power outage or water outage,” said Panasonic.
The new product was developed with Tepco Energy Partner, an electricity retailer owned by Japanese utility Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). Panasonic said the heat pump is compatible with a new Tepco electricity rate plan for solar self-consumption.
“A normal heat pump water heater boils hot water at night, but the EcoCute product heats water with electricity generated in the daytime,” said Panasonic.

The renewable energy trade body of Ukraine has said 37% of the nation’s ground-mounted solar project capacity is in regions where active hostilities are taking place, with a further 34% in adjacent areas.
A strongly worded statement issued by the Ukrainian Association of Renewable Energy (UARE) on Thursday added, 35% of the country’s roof and facade-mounted solar capacity was also installed in region’s with hostilities taking place, with another 19% of such systems nearby.
The UARE reported “registered cases of destruction” of solar panels and claimed Russian forces “steal all the equipment from the stations, everything that can be stolen and taken away.”
With the trade body stating troops had also destroyed electricity transmission lines since Russia invaded 20 days ago, the association said 6.37GW of the country’s 9.5GW of clean power generation capacity – including wind farms and biomass, biogas, and small hydro facilities – is either in or next to regions affected by the fighting.
That translates into $9.2 billion worth of the $12 billion the UARE estimated has been invested into Ukrainian clean power facilities in the last decade.
The trade body added: “Given the cost of capital investment; the cost of restoring generation capacity, transmission lines [and] equipment; compensation for health and [the] lives of renewable energy workers in Ukraine, [the] Ukrainian renewable energy sector will demand compensation from Russian invaders in international courts.”
