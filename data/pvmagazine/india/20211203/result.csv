The plants are to be installed on design, build, own and operate mode for a period of 25 years, and will be awarded on tariff-based bidding. The bidders must quote for a minimum of 100 MW involving at least three reservoir sites
KSEB will provide the required possible area assessed by the developers for the installation of floating solar power plants.
The main scope of the bidder is to assess the potential of the grid-connected floating solar plant at each reservoir without affecting the hydel tourism activities if any. It also includes design, engineering, manufacture, supply, erection, testing, and commissioning of the plants with operation and maintenance and the evacuation of the power and its transmission up to the nearest substation.
KSEBL will provide the required possible area assessed by the developers for the installation of floating solar power plants. It will sign the power purchase agreement (PPA) with the solar power developer for 25 years subject to a tariff approved by KSERC.

As part of its push for Indian customers, the company will build an inverter factory in Noida, Uttar Pradesh by May which will be able to manufacture 5 MW of products annually.
Invergy director Deepak Pandey told pv magazine: “Our product line is not in competition with other inverter brands present in India. Ours are next-generation inverters with features that have not been introduced in India ’till today. These are IP65-compatible units compatible with both lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries. Currently, the inverters available in the Indian market are mostly compatible with only [a] lead-acid or lithium battery.”

“Our inverters are scalable. So, you can get 50 kW output by placing 5 kW inverters in ten rows in parallel. You can connect up to 16 … rows. The maximum capacity, in that case, will be somewhere around 75 kW, with 5 kW units. The best part is, our single-phase inverters can be connected in three-phase mode and give a three-phase output.”
Invergy lays claim to 10 MW of manufacturing capacity catering to the residential solar market in Europe, West Africa, Dubai, and India.
“We want to manufacture in India as the response from the Indian market is good,” added Pandey. “Also, the Make in India concept is there. The increased [customs] duties on the import of completely-built units is among other reasons [for our expansion in India].”

The EVA film factory, with a capacity of 800 MW/annum, is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, where it also has its module production capacity.
Pixon, which currently has a 400 MW module factory, intends module capacity expansion and further backward integration.
At Intersolar, Sumit Mehta, Pixon founder and director, told pv magazine they plan to start the production of aluminium frames and backsheets at their existing facility. The company is also scaling up module production capacity to 1 GW with the addition of a 600 MW mono PERC line.
The new module line will be equipped to produce panels with peak power output up to 600-700Wp and will be operational by May 2022.
