The PV project is expected to produce 110,029 units of electricity per year, helping to offset carbon emissions of up to 9 lakh tons. The project is spread over 191 acres and features 127,268 solar modules. It was completed within nine months.
“The team established a two-level pooling substation on the undulating terrain, and the hard rock land was earthed to ensure the structural stability of the entire EHV (extra high-voltage) system,” said Tata Power. “Materials were directly unloaded at the workplace to avoid delays caused due to multiple shifting and to enable immediate regularization. Along with this, insurance of modules was done before commissioning.’
The completion of the project brings Tata Power’s total utility-scale solar portfolio to 9.7 GWp.

The developer’s total income increased 27% year on year to INR 69,195 million ($912 million) in fiscal 2021-22. Its net loss widened to INR 16,127 million, from INR 8,033 million in fiscal 2020-21. It attributed the wider net loss to charges related to its listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange, the issuance of share warrants, listing-related share-based payments, and other factors.
Its operational renewables portfolio grew to 7.6 GW at the end of March 2022, with 130 MW added in the fourth quarter alone. Its overall renewables portfolio stood at 10.7 GW, including 3.1 GW of projects in the pipeline.
The company has signed definitive agreements in the current fiscal period to purchase 528 MW of renewable energy assets. It has also signed an additional 1.6 GW of power purchase agreements, bringing its total portfolio to 12.8 GW.

In May, NTPC switched on the first 20 MW section of the project. The company is developing the 56 MW Kawas solar project under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s (MNRE) Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme Phase II. It won the project through viability gap funding (VGF) competitive bidding, in an auction conducted by Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) in 2019.
Vikram Solar is handling engineering, procurement, and construction duties. The project is a mix of 33 MW ground-mounted arrays and 23 MW floating solar installations that are being developed within the existing NTPC Kawas gas-based power station. According to the conditions of the CPSU Scheme, the project uses domestically made PV modules and cells. It also receives VGF support from the MNRE.

Japanese design company Arth Co., Ltd. has developed a new concept to build autonomous solar-powered residential units at any location without electricity, gas and water infrastructure.
The Weazer habitation module is purportedly 100% self-sufficient for energy and water supplies. Electricity is provided by a rooftop PV array and water comes from filtered and sterilized rainwater.
“The special purification technology used does not generate sewage drainage, so it does not damage the environment at the installation site,” the company said.

The size of the small building can be adjusted according to the needs of clients by combining different units. It can be installed in just a few days, according to Arth. It can also host electric vehicle recharging.
“Since it is self-sufficient for energy generation, it can be also used as an emergency evacuation site,” the company said, without revealing more details.
Arth plans to install the first prototype in Nishiizu, Shizuoka prefecture, in the fall. It wants to provide the system to hotels, resorts, and emergency evacuation areas.
“We will deploy the Weazer residential unit in areas with vulnerable infrastructure,” it said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/15/photovoltaic-water-heater-from-italy/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 15, 2022",Photovoltaic water heater from Italy,"From pv magazine Global
Italian solar module manufacturer Sunerg Solar Srl has developed a 1,500 W water heater solution that can be powered simultaneously by a solar panel and grid electricity.
The company offers the Frog Photovoltaic Water Heater with its own solar module, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller, and an 80 L water boiler with two resistances, of which one is activated by the photovoltaic panel.
“All the electricity generated by the module is injected into the water heater through the FROG V10 controller,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “It can work with a photovoltaic module with a power output of up to 450 W, a maximum short-circuit current of 50 V and a short-circuit current of 9.0 A.”
The controller is based on a Perturb and Observe algorithm, which consists of an artificial neural network that reduces the oscillations at the MPP. “It maintains the point of maximum energy transfer from the panel to the water heater following the variations in the lighting conditions of the panel,” the spokesperson further explained. “Moreover, a complete scan of the panel is periodically carried out to avoid the so-called ‘false maximum points’ due to uneven illumination of the module itself.”
The FROG 10 controller is encased in a die-cast aluminum container equipped with perforated flanges for deployment onto a wall and cables with connectors for the solar panel. It also includes a plug connector with fixing screws for connecting the resistance and temperature sensor from the boiler to the control unit. “Once the connector has been inserted into the control unit, it practically turns it on,” the spokesperson added.
The boiler measures 45 cm x 75 cm and weighs 22 kg. It is sold by the manufacturer in combination with its own solar modules, preferably with its X Max XL panel with a power output of 320 W to 340 W and efficiency ranging from 19.18% to 20.38%. The panel weighs 18.3 kg and features busbar cell technology. It also has an IP67 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V. Its temperature coefficient is -0.36% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
According to the manufacturer, the solar panel can generate approximately 2,800 Wh per day and the heater is able to raise water temperature from 20 C to 50 C. The daily thermal energy supplied to the resistance is approximately 2.410 kCal.
“We offer the whole package for €1,200 ($1,29o) excluding VAT and installation costs,” the spokesperson explained. “It comes with a three-year warranty for the water heater and a two-year warranty for the FROG 10 controller.” For the panel, Sunerg offers a 25-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty.
