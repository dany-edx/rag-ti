The report authors project the sales shortfall after accounting for the current electric mobility policies (FAME II and state policies) and even increased EV adoption in a few years as battery prices drop and local manufacturing ramps up.
NITI Aayog had projected EVs to supply 30% of new private car sales in India, 70% of commercial cars, 40% of buses, and 80% of two and three-wheelers by 2030, driven by FAME II and other measures. In absolute numbers, this amounts to having 80 million electric vehicles on road by 2030.

The JMK report projects electric two-wheelers (E2Ws) will grow at 57.86% annually between FY 2022 and FY 2030 and account for 79% of the total EV sales in the analysis period.
Compared to E2Ws, the report adds that the higher costs of E3Ws are a concern for their owners with low disposable incomes. This could lead to E3Ws’ low adoption rate in the coming years.
The report projects a modest growth in E4W sales till FY 2025 owing to charging infrastructure still being built up and most of the current product introductions primarily in the premium segment. After FY 2026, the market is expected to grow annually at 52% given the anticipated launch of mass segment e-cars, adoption of an increased number of E4Ws for fleet, and private charge point operators and e-car OEMs taking the lead in setting up semi-public charging stations.
E-buses will witness high growth due to an increase in the number of tenders issued by the government and the private sector also entering the E-bus domain.
The analysis further estimates India will need at least 2.05 million and 3.9 million charging stations to support 50 million and 80 million EVs on road by 2030, respectively. This is much higher than the charging stations planned in this period.
The study “Accelerating transport electrification in India by 2030” was released at the EV Market Conclave organized by JMK Research in New Delhi. It also analyses all approved state EV policies and makes a strong case for better and more ambitious state targets to complement India’s sales projections.
While some states have defined targets as absolute numbers, others have defined a percentage of total vehicles, and some have no target defined at all. Very few policies define targets for charging infrastructure or to convert government-owned vehicle fleets to EVs. Moreover, the majority of the policies do not have timelines till 2030. They currently only provide support till 2022 to 2026.
“Progress on clean energy goals, for example, renewable energy, happened as much due to state policies as it did due to regulation. In electric mobility as well, the country needs much more coordination. India has started on the right foot on e-mobility, with an enabling policy landscape and sales growing rapidly in some vehicle segments,” said Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends. “However, we need more coordinated efforts between states and centre, in defining targets and incentives that align with national ambition and policies, not to miss much greater focus on charging infrastructure and financial solutions for funding EVs.”
“To bridge the 40% gap in realizing projected sales by 2030, India can put simple yet effective practices in place. All states must define clear targets for ramping up charging infrastructure, incentives alone are not enough. This is a prerequisite that will define adoption trends in the country. Following global examples, India should consider introducing mandates for 100% electrification of government fleets, and mandating at least some percentage of vehicle aggregator fleets to be electric,” said Jyoti Gulia, founder and CEO, JMK Research & Analysis.

NTPC is the project management consultant to UNE for implementation of these projects. It has been working with UNE on the identification and technical evaluation of PV project sites, preparation of feasibility report, preparation of this tender document and other documents like power purchase agreement (PPA).
As per the tender document, the cumulative capacity of 150 MW/150 MWh BESS will be divided equally in three different provinces for 50 MW/50 MWh each.
The 1,150 MW PV capacity will come up at 175 locations across 15 provinces. It will be divided into three buckets (blocks) of 300-400 MW each, consisting of provinces that are nearby (western bucket, central bucket and eastern bucket). Each of these buckets will have 50 MW/50 MWh BESS located in one of the provinces near a substation. The provinces having BESS shall also be evaluated separately. There will be thus a maximum of six buckets to be evaluated separately.
UNE has already acquired the land for both the solar and BESS projects.
The prospective developer’s work includes design, financing, construction, installation, commissioning, operation and transfer/dismantling of the project. The developer will set up a totally foreign capital company “Empresa de Capital Totalmente Extranjero” (ECTE) to execute the project.
UNE will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the ECTE.
A single developer may participate in any one, two or all three blocks with a minimum capacity of 50 MW. It also needs to factor in the additional cost of setting up the BESS system at time of bidding.
The bidder who offers minimum tariff for a project with a minimum capacity of 50 MW in a block shall be selected as L1. The other bidders shall be rated as L2, L3 according to their offered tariff. Bucket filling within each of these blocks is envisaged if the capacity is available.

A report from TrendForce for Q2 2022 shows the path of solar modules and cells continues to move toward larger formats and higher production capacities. As the cost of polysilicon rises, the need for increased efficiency and reduced costs in PV products intensifies.
Large and high-power components now account for 80% of capacity and shipments of wafers, cells, and modules, and have become mainstream in the market. Large modules, considered 182 mm and 210 mm, made up nearly 80% of shipments in Q2.
Major module makers are expected to ship a total of 203 to 230 GW throughout 2022, and shipments of 210 mm modules will rise rapidly, said the report.
The high-power 600 W or greater modules are generally used for utility-scale ground mounted applications. Analysis of nearly 90 GW of module tenders indicated that 77% of buyers want power of 530 W and above. About 19% of module tenders reported no size requirement.
The quantity of residential, commercial, and industrial products is expected to see a rapid increase under the thriving intensity of the distributed market, said the report. These products are currently sitting at a power range of 400 W to 450 W, with approximately 68.75% of products at 410 W to 430 W.
The report said that 56 cell manufacturers, about 80% of all cell makers, can now produce 180 mm and 210 mm cells, a year-over-year growth of 51% of manufacturers with that capability. The report said large cells of this size are expected to reach 593.25 GW in 2023, and 210 mm cells alone are expected to reach a market share of 58%.
Large wafers of this format size are expected to reach 90% of the market share by 2023. Progress made in wafer thinning has exceeded initial expectations, said the report, leading to a significant reduction in wafer consumption.
Businesses faced with persistently high prices of raw materials are steadily reducing their use of wafers by rapidly switching from 165 μm to 160 μm to 155 μm. TrendForce expects this will continue the move toward 150 μm. Wafer consumption is thus expected to drop from 2.7 g/W to 2.8 g/W in 2021 to about 2.6g/W.
As PERC technology is nearing the theoretical limit of efficiency improvement weighed against cost of materials, transportation, and land costs, N-type modules are becoming essential for PV businesses seeking competitive advantage. Manufacturers are targeting this technology for its improvement in conversion efficiency and reduction in system costs.
Last month, Trina Solar announced it is developing a 210 mm N-type module that is expected to have a capacity of above 700 W. The report said 210 mm and N-type continue to optimize levelized cost of electricity, which may further increase the share of PV in renewable energy buildout.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/28/new-tech-to-produce-hydrogen-from-tap-water/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 28, 2022",New tech to produce hydrogen from tap water,"From pv magazine Global
Spanish scientist José Antonio G. I.  has developed a system that is able to generate and store hydrogen on-site from tap water without electrolysis.
“Until now, the most common way to produce hydrogen is by electrolysis. However, this process implies a significant electrical consumption that makes it not interesting from an economic point of view,” he told pv magazine.
The prototype consists of a water tank that is initially filled with water and two more chemical elements that the researcher doesn’t want to reveal. Hydrogen production begins when a 20 W compressor discharges pressurized air in the lower part of the tank.
“It is the air that causes the reaction between the different chemical components and generates hydrogen,” the scientist explained. “Then, the generated hydrogen leaves through the upper area of the tank to be introduced into an equally pressurized tank. The water in this second tank collects the possible impurities and hydrogen comes out through the upper part of the tank.”
After the hydrogen is purified, it flows via an upper conduit to another tank equipped with closed contacts, a safety valve and an outlet pipe assisted by a solenoid valve.

“Currently, we are developing a model with a 220-liter tank that can work with a pressure of 1 kg/cm2 and a flow rate of 30 liters per minute,” González Ibáñez went on to say. “This can generate heating, hot water and electricity for a household or a small business.”
The group is also designing a larger model that can work with a pressure of 750 Kg/cm2 and can reportedly supply a thermal power plant or a container ship.
“Hydrogen is produced at the place of consumption, so transportation disappears, it only needs a water tap,” the scientist emphasized. “The system is capable of generating the energy equivalent to a liter of gasoline –30 Mjoules or 8.333333 kW– for €0.0151515 ($0.0153749).”
