The International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) has published a new report offering guidelines for module manufacturers to consider recyclability of their products from the beginning, noting that with projected growth in PV over the coming decades, material shortages could become an issue, and preventing end-of-life modules from ending up in landfill should be an industry priority.
Alongside general guidelines such as avoiding hazardous or hard to recycle materials, such as one-way adhesives, and developing a standardized labelling system allowing recyclers to identify materials, the report makes several points specific to PV module design. The authors advise module designers to give particular consideration to backsheet compositions, choice of metals, minimizing use of encapsulants or using reversible encapsulant materials, choosing a frame sealant that would allow for disassembly, and including some durable way for recyclers to identify the materials and construction of the module.
“If adopted today, application of these DfR guidelines could help to mitigate tomorrow’s resource scarcity, lower the barriers and cost for PV recycling, and enable a circular economy during the energy transition,” the author’s state.
The report goes on to address the balance between designing products that last for a long time, and also considering ease of disassembly at end-of-life. “…all products reach end of life at some point, even durable ones, and it is better environmentally to recover and reuse those materials than lock them away in landfills,” they explain.
This will remain a challenge for the industry for years to come, and IEA PVPS notes that policy encouraging manufacturers to consider both sides of the equation, as well as availability of assessment frameworks and other resources to help guide choice of materials will be essential here.
It also notes that design for recycling can also include the possibility for recyclers to separate entire components from the module for reuse or remanufacturing, eliminating the need to go all the way back to a raw material – and the picture is bigger than recycling alone. “Economics, product performance, and environmental impacts must be considered; recycling at EOL may not always be the best solution for the existing manufacturing and recycling ecosystem,” the report states.
“Ultimately, it is desirable to achieve system-wide goals, such as ensuring material supply,
maximizing material value, or minimizing life cycle impacts.”
Since technologies for module recycling are still in the early stages, the report notes that manufacturers will need assurances that materials can be handled recyclers twenty or more years down the line. And one way for manufacturers to reduce this risk, say IEA PVPS, is for them to become involved directly in planning and development of future recycling capabilities.

The cumulative installed capacity includes 2,507 MW of commercial, 3,902 MW of industrial, and 1,292 MW of residential PV, according to Bridge To India‘s Solar Rooftop Map 2021 June. 
The capital expenditure (capex) model, wherein consumers own the system, accounts for 5,505 MW (71%) of this capacity. The balance of installations (2,196 MW) is in Opex (operating expenditure) mode, wherein a third-party company (developer/RESCO) owns, installs, and operates the system at consumer premises. 
In the July 2020-June 2021 period, the residential segment added 488 MW of rooftop solar capacity—a 360% increase year-on-year. Bridge To India cited the MNRE subsidy scheme and large tenders by many states as the driving factors for this surge.
The share of opex-mode installations in the annual installations dropped from 39% in the previous year to 20% (345 MW of 1,748 MW)—mainly because developers focused on the open access market for faster growth and consumers restricted site access because of Covid concerns.
Among players, Mumbai’s Tata Power led in EPC installations with 10.8% of the 1,748 MW market. Hyderabad-based Fourth Partner Energy ranked second with a 4.95% market share. Mumbai’s Mahindra Susten (2.5%) installed the third most capacity.
Fourth Partner Energy was the lead developer. It claimed close to 18% of the 345 MW Opex (developer-mode) market. Gurgaon’s Amplus Solar (13.8%) and Singapore-based Cleantech Solar (7.4%) followed next.
All top five inverter suppliers were from China. Solis supplied 19.12% of the 1,748 MW market, followed by Sungrow (14.79%), Delta (13.11%), Growatt (10.77%), and Goodwe (8.1%).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/14/green-lending-criteria-could-improve-the-performance-of-power-discoms-in-india/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,PROCUREMENT,RENEWABLE ENERGY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",Green lending criteria could improve the performance of power discoms in India ,"To encourage carbon-neutrality in the power sector, India’s power authorities could introduce a green rating when assessing financial support and bail-outs for power distribution companies (discoms), says a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
Report author and IEEFA contributor Saloni Sachdeva Michael highlights an urgent need to examine the financial risks of high-carbon portfolios, with a view to integrating green criteria into lending decisions and credit risk analyses applying to distribution companies. 
“Establishing hybrid rating (green + credit) information systems is a fundamental task at the heart of green finance and a necessary step to increase disclosure, transparency, and accountability of the Indian distribution sector,” Sachdeva Michael added.
In the current annual credit rating system for discoms employed by the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), the sole green parameter, the renewable purchase obligation (RPO), carries the least weight – and this is not conducive to the development of green finance and a sustainable, low-carbon economy.
“Considering the time and effort required to re-engineer a separate green rating, the more logical next step is to strengthen the existing integrated rating methodology, drawing learning from the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework used for corporate ratings. New parameters can be added in a phased manner,” Sachdeva Michael said. 
Recommendations
To achieve a hybrid (green+credit) rating, the report recommends strengthening the existing green parameter (RPO) by increasing its weight in the current rating mechanism, adding new green parameters, linking distribution sector bail-out to green performance, and aligning Indian banks with global green finance best practices.
According to IEEFA, India will need to deploy US$500 billion in investments to reach its renewable energy capacity target of 450 GW by 2030. Of this, US$300 billion would be directed to wind and solar infrastructure, US$50 billion to grid firming investments, and US$150 billion to expanding and modernizing transmission. 
For state utilities, financial stability is a significant challenge to attracting the necessary investment. 
Sachdeva Michael says discoms continue to be a resource drain on the national economy despite central and state government schemes and initiatives aimed at improving their operations and financial health. 
“Most distribution companies are making major losses as a result of expensive legacy thermal power purchase agreements, poor infrastructure and inefficient operations, among other factors,” she says.
The discoms have accumulated massive overdue payments to generators – INR 119,185 crore (US$16 billion) as of June 2021 – creating a liquidity crunch across India’s entire power sector.
Currently, tracking and monitoring of discoms’ decarbonization plans and green performance is limited. The arrival of alternate financial instruments such as green bonds, combined with massive decarbonization goals, shows the need to update the rating methodology to include parameters that help quantify green initiatives undertaken by the discoms.
“A hybrid rating that incorporates both green and credit performance of discoms will provide a true picture of the sector’s green disclosure and readiness for the energy transition,” says Sachdeva Michael.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/14/meyer-burger-unveils-new-solar-tiles/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",CORNELIA LICHNER,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",Meyer Burger unveils new solar tiles,"From pv magazine International
Switzerland-based solar module maker Meyer Burger has unveiled new solar tiles for a building-integrated PV (BIPV) project at the Intersolar event, which is being held this week in Munich, Germany. The new product was designed by German engineering company paXos Consulting & Engineering GmbH & Co. KG, which sold the related patents to Meyer Burger.
The tiles measure 44 cm x 33 cm x 3 cm and weigh in at 2.5 kg. This makes them lighter than normal roof tiles, says paXos Managing Director Peter Hakenberg. He claims this is an important advantage, particularly in relation to snow loads.
The black PV tiles heat up considerably in summer, which is why there is a continuous ventilation duct from the lower to the upper bricks, producing a chimney effect. At the top of the ridge, the hot air can be discharged or used for heating. In the winter, when the temperature differences are not so great, a fan can specifically suck in the heated air and direct it to a heat exchanger or heat pump.
Hakenberg says the paXos prototype has been assessed in wind tunnels and other practical tests. He said the company hopes for a noticeable reduction in costs, compared to conventional rooftop systems.
Frank Hoetzsch, head of service at Meyer Burger, announced that production of the tiles will begin in the second half of 2022. He noted that the company is conducting tests with the Cologne University of Applied Sciences to determine the exact thermal performance of the new product.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/14/jinkosolar-sets-new-record-for-n-type-solar-cell-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",JinkoSolar sets new record for n-type solar cell efficiency,"From pv magazine International
JinkoSolar today announced a new world record for n-type solar cell efficiency, at 25.4%. The achievement has been confirmed by the Japan Electrical Safety and Environment Technology Laboratories (JET), making it the fourth time this year that Jinko has raised the bar for n-type cell efficiency using its tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology. The record surpasses Jinko’s previous achievement of 25.25%, announced in May.
According to Jinko, a hydrogenation process developed in collaboration with Australia’s University of New South Wales was key to the achievement here, alongside ultrafine metallization, an advanced diffusion process, and various material upgrades.
“This is a big milestone in our R&D capabilities to make clean energy affordable and sustainable for everyone,” commented Jinkosolar chief technology officer Hao Jin. “We will continue to lead with innovative products and solutions for our global customers who depend on us for our breakthrough technology and reliable supply chain.”
It is not clear whether the hydrogenation process used to produce this record-setting solar cell has been implemented in commercial production. Last month, the company worked with UNSW to demonstrate its potential, producing a batch of cells in an ‘industrial environment’ and achieving average efficiency of 24.08%. The hydrogenation treatment was shown to add 0.64% on average to each cell’s efficiency.
JinkoSolar also received further recognition this week, being awarded the Green World Award by non-profit The Green Organization, for its commitment to environmental best practice. “The Green World Awards are a great honor for JinkoSolar and its employees. Investing in sustainability pays off – for us, for our customers, and for the environment,” said Dany Qian, VP of JinkoSolar, “we have firmly anchored our sustainability strategy along our entire value chain. And we will foster sustainability on the part of our suppliers and business partners, in their own operations and on the customer side.”
The achievement comes as Jinko and other leading solar cell and module makers ponder a switch to n-type in their mainstream manufacturing operations. TOPCon affords manufacturers the chance to upgrade existing production lines for PERC technology, rather than building entirely new lines as heterojunction and other n-type cell architectures would require.
Analysts expect n-type technologies to begin growing rapidly after 2022, with TOPCon the initial leader. According to PV InfoLink, by 2025 we will see more than 100 GW of n-type production capacity, with TOPCon accounting for around 60%.
