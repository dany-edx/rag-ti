https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/06/bluetti-launches-sodium-ion-solar-generator/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 6, 2022",Bluetti launches sodium-ion solar generator,"From pv magazine International
Bluetti, a Las Vegas-based manufacturer of solar energy facilities, PV generators, solar panels, and other solar peripherals, has launched a sodium-ion solar generator, the NA300, and a compatible battery module, the B480.
Bluetti said its first-generation sodium-ion battery excels in thermal stability, fast-charging capacity, low-temperature performance, and integration efficiency, despite slightly lower energy density than its lithium-ion counterparts. The solar generator and battery’s chemical components also feature more abundant materials than traditional lithium-ion batteries, lowering prices and alleviating concerns about resource scarcity.
The sodium-ion power station comes with four 20-amp traditional wall plugs, as well as a 30-amp L14-30 output port, driven by the system’s built-in 3000W pure sine wave inverter.
Thermal stability has become a hallmark issue of lithium-ion batteries, ever since the Arizona Public Service battery failure and corresponding explosion that left eight firefighters and one police officer hospitalized in Surprise, Arizona, in April 2019.
According to Bluetti, the system can charge to 80% state-of-charge in less than 30 minutes at room temperature. In a low-temperature environment of -20 C, it has an 85% capacity retention rate and 80% system integration efficiency.
BloombergNEF recently updated its technology outlook to include sodium-ion batteries. It said could play a “meaningful role” in the greater storage landscape by 2030.
Bluetti plans to officially debut the NA300 & B480 Sodium-ion Battery Power station at CES 2022 on Jan. 5 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/06/bringing-dead-lithium-back-to-life-to-boost-battery-lifespans/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RECYCLING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 6, 2022",Bringing dead lithium back to life to boost battery lifespans,"From pv magazine International
One of the main reasons for substantial capacity losses and even fires in lithium batteries are little islands of inactive lithium that are created during the nonuniform dissolution of lithium dendrites. This isolated lithium loses connection with the current collector, so it is considered electrochemically inactive or “dead,” but a team of US researchers has discovered that this lithium can be brought back to life, boosting the capacity and lifespan of batteries.
Researchers at the US Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have shown that isolated lithium is alive and highly responsive to battery operations, due to its dynamic polarization to the electric field in the electrolyte. They have designed an optical cell with a lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide (NMC) cathode and a lithium anode. They also used an isolated lithium island in between as a test device that allowed them to track what happens inside a battery when in use, in real time.
They discovered that when charging the cell, the island slowly moved toward the cathode. When discharging, it crept in the opposite direction.
“It’s like a very slow worm that inches its head forward and pulls its tail in to move nanometer by nanometer,” said Yi Cui, a professor at Stanford University and SLAC, and an investigator at the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Research. “In this case, it transports by dissolving away on one end and depositing material to the other end. If we can keep the lithium worm moving, it will eventually touch the anode and reestablish the electrical connection.”
Lithium metal accumulates at the negative end of the island and dissolves at the positive end. This continual growth and dissolution causes the back-and-forth movement that the researchers observed. Their next step was to modify the charging protocol in order to move these floating islands far enough to reconnect with the anode.
They discovered that by adding a brief, high-current discharging step right after charging, the battery nudges the island to grow in the direction of the anode. As a result, the researchers demonstrated that they can mobilize and recover the isolated lithium, extending the battery’s lifespan by nearly 30%.
The researchers expect these findings to have broad implications for the design and development of more robust lithium-metal batteries. Their study, “Dynamic spatial progression of isolated lithium during battery operations,” was recently published in Nature.
