There’s no doubting that Australian rooftop solar installations are on a tear and showing few signs of letting up. Green Energy Markets’ data show that rooftop installations grew 14% to 3.14 GW in 2023 – only 65 MW less than 2021, the record-setting year for rooftop PV installs.
While that is good news for the distributed generation segment, and for householders making savings on their electricity bills, it is leaving little room in the market for utility-scale solar. And, energy economist Bruce Mountain observes, it is increasingly putting the squeeze on wind.
“Rooftop solar has pulled prices down during all of the time that large scale solar has a market to the level that without storage, large scale solar is going to battle for grid supply,” Mountain told pv magazine Australia. “For grid supply, certainly in South Australia and Victoria, it [large scale solar] is struggling.
Mountain says that current prospects in Queensland is better for solar farm development, but that investors will have seen how quickly daylight wholesale prices have declined in South Australia and Victoria and would be reluctant to invest.
“Even though you’re not yet seeing the same wholesale price effects in Queensland, I think investors are likely to anticipate it.”
Installation data confirms the observation. Solar consultancy SunWiz found that while the rooftop PV segment remains strong, the large-scale is lagging. In 2023, SunWiz found 10 new solar farms were completed, for a capacity of 1.1 GW – down 60% on the 2.9 GW completed in 2022.
Rooftop solar percentages of total daytime demand tell much of the tale. During summer, rooftop PV is already supplying more than 100% of grid-demand during much of the day in South Australia, and 135% at midday. In Victoria, those numbers come in at 35% and 42%, respectively – figures that are still hugely impactful for large-scale solar project development.
On electricity markets, Mountain said, one impact has been to squeeze wind generation from the market during peak solar production periods. When generation is annualized, the solar generation (dotted yellow) profile in Victoria (left) and South Australia (right) in 2023 resulted in wind generators being squeeze out of the market at the times of peak production (dotted green).

While difficult for wind projects and developments, this market development leaves little room for solar farms.
“The economics will be solar-plus-storage versus wind. Wind will spill during the middle of the day as we’re seeing now, but it has decent production through the sea breeze, pretty consistently year-round – so it gets the evening peak pretty consistently without the need for storage.”
There do, however, remain opportunities for large-scale solar in the short term, said Mountain.
“It probably still has a standalone market for mines and off grid supply and new supplies cause its economics fundamentally are very attractive – it’s very cheap and forecastable and all of those things.”

Researchers from the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials have proposed to combine adiabatic compressed air storage (A-CAES) and large scale solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) for the production of green hydrogen via excess power from wind and solar PV facilities.
A-CAES can store compression heat or compressed air in thermal energy storage (TES) and air storage reservoirs, respectively, and then release the heat and compressed air for power production. It differs from conventional CAES for implementing the process “adiabatically,” which means without loss or gain of heat. SOECs use a solid oxide – or ceramic – electrolyte to produce hydrogen and syngas fuel (CO+H2) from a mixture of water and carbon dioxide or oxygen from carbon dioxide, respectively.
“The A-CAES system can be used as a combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) system, providing heat and power to SOEC in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the system,” the scientists explained. “Unlike the diabatic CAES system with an external heat source, in the case of the A-CAES system, heat is recovered from compression, stored in a TES unit, and later used to heat the compressed air for the expansion process.”
The system consists of a motor, a compressor, and TES units, which are connected to both a turbine for power generation and the SOEC unit. It cools hot compressed air in the TES unit and then stores it in large underground caverns. In the discharging process, the compressed air is released from the cavern and heated by the TES. The hot compressed air is then conveyed to the expander for power generation or to the SOEC unit.
“The TES unit is divided into high-temperature (HT) and medium-temperature (MT) units for efficient use,” the group said. “During the discharging process, compressed air heated by the TES unit supplies external heat to the SOEC system via a high-temperature heat exchanger (HT-HE).”
The academics analyzed the performance of the system considering constant-pressure air storage, negligible potential and kinematic energy effects, as well as a minimum temperature difference of 10 C for heat transfer between the TES and the air. They also assumed the compression pressure of air to be constantly at 70 bar, while the compression power was assumed to be 100 MWh, with the charging and discharging periods being identical.
The analysis showed that the system has a round-trip efficiency of approximately 70% and that the remaining 30% of the input energy was dispersed as heat due to the “irreversibility” of the A-CAES processes.
“When the A-CAES system is integrated with a SOEC, the thermal energy from the A-CAES can be used to vaporize water in the SOEC electrolyzer,” the researchers stressed, noting that the SOEC unit can operate for 24 h regardless of the discharging or charging modes. “With an increase in the use of the thermal energy of A-CAES for SOEC, although the round-trip efficiency of electricity decreases, the CHP round-trip efficiency increases to more than unity.”
The total round-trip efficiency of the CCHP-A-CAES system was found to be 121.2% and its over-unity efficiencies were in the range of 100% to 120%. “Thermo-economic modeling and optimization of the proposed systems, considering both energy efficiency and economic factors, would provide valuable insight on the best ways to implement them in real-world applications,” they concluded.
The proposed system was introduced in the paper “Adiabatic compressed air energy storage system combined with solid-oxide electrolysis cells,” published in Energy Reports.

SEG Solar (SEG) has unveiled a new solar module based on n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPcon) technology.
The Alpine N modules feature 210 mm n-type TOPCon cells and are designed for ultra-large power stations.
“Using SMBB technology, the modules reduce internal electrical losses and enhance optical utilization. The non-destructive cutting process minimizes damage to solar cells, lowering the risk of hidden cracks and improving manufacturing yield,” the company said in a statement. “The design includes a small gap between cells, reducing the distance from 2mm to 0.6mm, resulting in a 0.2-0.3% increase in module efficiency.”
SEG Solar is offering four versions of the panels, with power outputs ranging from 685 W to 700 W. The efficiency ratings range from 22.05% to 22.53%. The open-circuit voltage is between 47.30 V and 47.90 and the short-circuit current is between 18.34 A and 18.49 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panels measure 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm x 33 mm and weigh 338.5 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and 2 mm semi-tempered glass. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0%. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
SEG Solar currently produces its panels at factories in Vietnam and Indonesia. It is also planning a 2 GW TOPCon module manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas.

Qcells, a solar module manufacturer, has entered a new partnership with Solarcycle, a recycling company. Under the terms of the agreement, Qcells solar panels will be recycled after decommissioning.
The agreement is a landmark deal for solar recycling in the United States. Qcells operates one of the largest solar manufacturing operations in the country, with plans to expand production to 8.4 GW per year by the end of 2024, adding 4,000 jobs. The company announced a $2.5 billion investment to support this expansion plan in January 2023.
Solarcycle said its patented recovery process retains 95% of the value of materials in the panels, compared to conventional methods, which extract about 50% of the material value. The company recycles aluminum, silver, copper, silicon, and low-iron glass. It will send these materials back to the domestic manufacturing value chain, thereby supporting a circular economy.
With the rapid growth of solar energy in the United States, there is also rising concern about what will happen to solar panels at the end of their useful life. Without an increase in solar recycling, the United States will contribute 10 million metric tons of trash in landfills and other waste facilities by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). To put into context, the United States dumps almost 140 million tons of waste each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
“We want our solar panels to not only help our customers cut costs and carbon, but also to be a part of building a more sustainable clean energy industry,” said Qcells. “Our partnership with Solarcycle will give our panels a life after powering homes, businesses and communities, reducing waste and reusing pieces for all types of technology including solar.”
Solarcycle runs recycling centers in Texas and Arizona. The company said it expects to employ more than 700 people in the next few years.
“Together, we can close the supply chain loop to ensure solar energy is manufactured and recycled in the US using American labor and cutting-edge sustainability practices,” said Suvi Sharma, chief executive officer and co-founder of Solarcycle.
Earlier this month, Solarcycle said it would move its headquarters to Mesa, Arizona, and open a research facility at the location. The Mesa facility will initially recycle 250,000 solar panels per year, and ramp up to 1 million panels per year to keep pace with growing market demand in the solar industry for its recycling and circular supply chain services.
The solar recycler has grown its infrastructure footprint nationally through high-volume contracts with industry leaders including AES, EDF Renewables North America, EDP Renewables North America, Greenbacker, Ørsted, Silicon Ranch, and Sunrun.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory projects that by 2040, recycled panels and materials could help meet 25% to 30% of US domestic solar manufacturing needs.
