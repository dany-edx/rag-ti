The consortium behind the transaction includes local entities Comfit Composite Knit, Viyellatex Spinning, and Midland East Power.
The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has allocated 900 acres of land for the solar facility in Bagerhat district, near a 1,320 MW coal power plant, which is expected to be operational by 2026. The consortium plans to invest approximately $430 million to set up the power plant.
The BPDB, having obtained approval from the Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase, will sign a power purchase agreement with the consortium. The agreement will establish a 20-year commitment to procure electricity at a rate of $0.1020/kWh, governed by the principle of “no electricity, no payment.” The confirmation of the cabinet’s support for the solar power plant proposal was conveyed by Sayeed Mahbub Khan, the additional secretary of the cabinet division, during a recent press briefing.
ACWA Power had previously inked a memorandum of understanding with the BPDB in November of the prior year, outlining their intention to develop 1,000MW of solar power capacity across Bangladesh. The company, headquartered in Jeddah, is presently evaluating potential locations, including Payra in Patuakhali and Mirsarai in Chattogram, for the establishment of an additional 700MW solar power plant.
ACWA Power is mainly owned by the Saudi government, with a 75% stake, while private entities hold the remaining 25%. Just last month, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina officially inaugurated the country’s largest 200 MW Teesta Solar Power Plant in Gaibandha. The national grid also recently started receiving power from another utility-scale solar plant – a 100 MW array in Rampal that is owned by Orion Group.

Ltd (NREDCAP).
With a green hydrogen production target of 500 ktpa, the state requires 10-15 GW of RE capacity dedicated to green hydrogen production and 4-5 GW of electrolyzer capacity. 
The report states that out of the estimated investment of $10-15 billion required to enable a 500 ktpa green hydrogen target, around 70% will be necessary for creating the RE infrastructure with a balance for electrolyzer capacity additions.
Andhra Pradesh, one of India’s leading industrial states, emitted 169 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) in 2018, a 6.5% share of India’s emissions. With a current hydrogen demand of 400 ktpa, the state can reduce 4-4.5 mtpa of CO2 with a 100% shift to green hydrogen, states the whitepaper.
Andhra Pradesh is well poised to leverage this opportunity. Under Andhra Pradesh Green Hydrogen and Green Ammonia Policy 2023, the state targets a green hydrogen production capacity of at least 500 ktpa or green ammonia production capacity of up to 2 mtpa in the next five years by harnessing its RE potential.
A swift shift to green hydrogen requires massive capital investments for developing renewable energy infrastructure such as solar and wind power generation plants, green hydrogen production plants, and equipment manufacturing for electrolyzers, solar panels, wind turbines, and other ancillaries.
Andhra Pradesh has an installed RE capacity of around 9 GW. It has an immense RE potential of 82.5 GW (38 GW solar and 44 GW wind) with 5 lakh acres of potential land parcels for RE generation. Further, 34 GW of pumped hydro potential can be leveraged for a round-the-clock supply of RE to operate electrolyzers efficiently and produce uninterrupted green hydrogen. As electricity accounts for 75-80% of the green hydrogen cost, the availability of low-cost RE is a distinguishing factor in the state.
The report states Andhra Pradesh is well placed for the export of green hydrogen, owing to its long coastlines and ports.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/04/bila-solar-to-make-lightweight-solar-modules-in-us/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 4, 2023",Bila Solar to make lightweight solar modules in US,"From pv magazine USA
The newly launched Bila Solar has announced plans to open a solar module factory in Indianapolis, Indiana. It said it will produce 1 GW of glassless, frameless solar modules per year.
Bila Solar plans to renovate a facility spanning an area of 150,000 square feet (13,935 square meters) and expects to employ 240 people once the plant is fully operational. It said it will begin production in the summer of 2024.
“We’re bringing to the US market ultralight modules that go where traditional solar panels can’t go,” said Mick McDaniel, vice president and US general manager of Bila Solar. “In Indianapolis, we found a central urban location, a diverse workforce and an entrepreneurial spirit – ideal for our out-of-the-box approach to making clean energy attainable for all.”
The technology behind the modules was developed in collaboration with the advanced materials industry. McDaniel told pv magazine USA that replacing glass with specially formulated composites was inspired by the windows in airplanes, which are not made from glass, and are lightweight, transparent, strong, flexible, durable, and UV resistant.
“These same characteristics are excellent for solar panels, so why haven’t we used them yet?  The aerospace industry has figured out how and so our task was how to apply that to the PV industry in a cost effective way that met the needs of solar customers.” said McDaniel.
Bila Solar plans to produce 520 W 144 half-cell monocrystalline modules, with an efficiency of 19.3%. The modules measure 88.4 inches by 47.1 inches by 0.08 inches. Made of an aerospace polymer composite, the modules reportedly weighs 17 lbs (7.7 kg), which the company says is nearly 70% lighter than conventional glass-framed modules.
The light weight and thinness of the modules enable them to be deployed in various applications, including low load-bearing commercial and industrial roofs, waterproof membrane roofs, integration into vehicles for solar power, off-grid use and even on curved surfaces, the company said.
McDaniel said the Bila Solar modules pass the same durability tests as conventional glass panels, including IEC 61215:2016, IEC61730:2016, UL61730 (USA), PID, and salt mist “level 8” tests. He added that the modules have also undergone wind tunnel testing, damp heat, adhesion pull tests, flexibility stress tests and more. The modules come with a 12-year  product warranty and a 25-year linear power warranty.
Bila is far from alone in setting up solar manufacturing facilities in the United States. Earlier this month, the Solar Energy Industries Association reported that an additional 85 GW of module manufacturing was coming to the US, following passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes onshoring manufacturing across the solar supply chain. Site Selection Group assisted Bila Solar with procuring state and local incentives for this exciting project.
“Indiana’s entrepreneurial ecosystem is strong, and we’re excited to welcome Bila Solar to our growing network of innovators advancing products that power the world,” said Governor Eric J. Holcomb. “With Bila’s new Indianapolis manufacturing operation, Indiana’s skilled workforce will be making solar energy more accessible and powering our growing clean energy sector to new heights.”
With its factory planned for Indianapolis, Bila has also designated the city as the location for its US headquarters.
