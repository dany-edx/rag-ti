With the purchase, EAM is poised to make India the first country in Asia outside of China to manufacture LFP cathode materials.
EAM is scheduled to break ground on its facility in India in 2024 to build a large-scale customer qualification plant in 2025, which will scale up to 100,000 tons by 2030.
“This acquisition reaffirms our commitment to delivering cutting-edge solutions to the evolving EV battery market,” said Vikram Handa, managing director of EAM. “The advanced technology center in Moosburg strategically positions us to lead the industry in cathode material manufacturing.”
EAM’s acquisition of the cathode active material technology center from Johnson Matthey will reduce the battery market’s reliance on China. Approximately 70% of cathode materials, and 100% of LFP cathode, for lithium-ion batteries are currently produced in China.
Epsilon Advanced Materials previously announced INR 9,000 crore ($1,085.5 million) investment for the establishment of an anode battery materials manufacturing facility in Bellari, Karnataka, India. EAM also plans to build a $650 million graphite anode material manufacturing facility in Brunswick County, North Carolina, USA, and is investing Euro 600 million to develop a graphite processing facility in Vaasa, Finland.
“We are proud to announce that EAM is now ready to go to market with a proven high-performance cathode active material, marking a significant leap forward in our capabilities,” said CEO Sunit Kapur. “Integrating the cathode expertise from the Moosburg technology center with our anode business uniquely positions us to deliver comprehensive solutions to customers, delivering anode and cathode to empower them to optimize the performance of their batteries.”
Battery manufacturers are increasingly transitioning to LFP cathode, which has a longer life span, offers improved discharge and charge efficiency, provides better performance in higher temperatures, and is less expensive than other cathode materials, such as nickel and cobalt. It is also maintenance-free, extremely safe, and lightweight.
The Moosburg facility greatly reduces EAM’s technology development and scale-up timeframe. The center is equipped to produce LFP and lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode in small laboratory-scale batches to up pilot-scale material. It features a versatile pilot customer qualification plant designed to validate new materials and utilizes a Hydrothermal process that provides a cleaner metal processing solution, which results in a more environmentally friendly battery-metals supply chain.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/02/mitigating-the-challenges-in-solar-project-development/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,2024-02-02,Mitigating the challenges in solar project development,"In recent years, India has made significant progress in developing its solar market, driven by a combination of government support, technological advancements, and increasing awareness of the need for sustainable energy solutions. The nation’s commitment to renewable energy has been highlighted by various policy measures and initiatives aimed at boosting solar capacity installation. However, the year 2023 witnessed a notable slowdown in the growth of installed solar capacity, prompting a closer examination of the factors influencing this deceleration.
With an understanding of the solar potential in India, vis-a-vis the globe, the government has set ambitious green targets for the country. While we have created a robust framework towards achieving this goal, pursuing an approach that focuses on increasing the efficiency of this framework can help stabilize the sector for the long term.
Supply chain disruptions
The solar industry faced disruptions in the global supply chain, impacting the availability and cost of solar equipment. Delays in equipment delivery and increased prices affected project timelines and financial viability. While these were uncontrollable external factors, getting rid of specific tariff and non-tariff barriers which were created domestically could have helped. For reference, considering the initiatives taken by the government, the future of solar modules manufacturing is bright in India; however, till we have an adequate manufacturing base, for high-efficiency modules, within the country, these barriers create uncertainty amongst stakeholders.
While we all appreciate the need and impacts of building a robust manufacturing base within the country, I suggest removing such barriers until an adequate solar manufacturing capacity encompassing the complete value chain is established. This gives enough time to both the manufacturers and developers to proceed in their respective directions, which eventually culminates in creating a resilient solar sector for India.
Policy homogeneity
Changes in government policies and regulatory uncertainty, including the interpretation and implementation issues between Centre & State Government(s), deter investors. There is an urgent need to ensure the standardization of policies and procedures across the Centre and State. A case in place, The GNA Regulations, 2022 and IEGC Regulations, 2023, which are operationalized for inter-State transactions, should ideally dictate the Open Access and Scheduling procedures at the State levels, where the ultimate consumer rests.
However, State-level procedures are currently anchored in the existing Open Access Regulations and corresponding State Grid Code Regulations. This divergence complicates and delays open access procedures, especially for interstate transactions involving state-embedded C&I consumers. SERCS must integrate the GNA concept by formulating and implementing updated GNA Regulations at the State level to realise GNA rules.
Similarly, there are instances of net-metering regulations, captive definitions, etc., with major gaps. Such uncertainties and differences need to be addressed so that we can extend a homogeneous policy framework within the State(s) and Centre for boosting the investor’s confidence.
Grid infrastructure and land acquisition issues
As the solar capacity increased, challenges in grid integration emerged. Issues related to grid stability, intermittency, and the lack of sufficient energy storage solutions hindered the seamless assimilation of solar power into the national grid.
Similarly, securing suitable land parcel closure to the grid substations is a pressing challenge.
While there is an immense appetite within the investor community to set up huge giga-scale solar projects, the development efforts sometimes get obstructed by lagging grid infrastructure preparedness and issues with land acquisition. A program facilitating the development of huge solar parks nationwide with ready grid infrastructure (both ISTS and intra-state connectivity) will be beneficial for solar developers.
Developing the solar market in India has been a multifaceted journey marked by commendable achievements and occasional challenges. While the government’s support has been instrumental in fostering growth, addressing the identified challenges, ensuring policy stability, and promoting technological innovation will be critical to reignite momentum and achieve India’s renewable energy targets in the coming years. The solar sector remains integral to India’s sustainable development goals, and concerted efforts are needed to overcome the hurdles and create a robust, resilient solar market.

“The primary objective of anti-reflective coatings is to minimize the reflection loss, so enhancing the absorption properties by the semiconductor material, often silicon, and facilitating its conversion into electrical energy,” the academic explained. “This is essential for increasing solar cell efficiency.”
In addition, they have also tested the effect of a mixed SiO2-ZrO2 coating, with a ratio of 1:1, on the cell performances.
For their research, the group purchased polycrystalline Si solar cells measuring 5.0 cm × 4.0 cm with an efficiency of 14.4%. Then, they coated them with either SiO2, ZrO2, or SiO2-ZrO2 using the radiofrequency (RF) sputter coating technique. “To ensure a nearly uniform distribution, the mixture underwent mechanical grinding with a mortar and pestle for approximately 120 minutes,” they highlighted.
The RF sputter coating technique utilizes radiofrequency energy to generate plasma and sputter material from a target onto a substrate. In the process described in this study, argon gas was ionized to form a plasma during the sputtering process. The coating process lasted 45 m at room temperature.
Following the coating of the three cells, the academics assessed light absorption and transmittance and compared their performance with that of uncoated reference cells.
Based on the results of an I–V measurement, the uncoated cell’s power conversion efficiency was 14.4%, while that of the SiO2-ZrO2 sample was 17.6%. The SiO2-only sample had an efficiency of 15.6%, and the ZrO2 had 16.7%.
“The Root Mean Square (RMS) values of roughness for SiO2, ZrO2, and SiO2–ZrO2 blend coated solar cells were measured at 35.42 nm, 47.47 nm, and 62.36 nm respectively,” the researchers added. “The increased surface roughness may also serve to reduce the reflection loss potentially and enhance optical transmittance.”
The anti-reflective coating was presented in the paper “Surface engineering of Sio2-Zro2 films for augmenting power conversion efficiency performance of silicon solar cells,” published in the Journal of Materials Research and Technology.
The research was conducted by scientists from Saudi Arabia’s Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, and Qassim University, as well as from India’s Kongu Engineering College and Velalar College of Engineering and Technology. Furthermore, the group comprised researchers from Thailand’s King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok and Egypt’s National Research Centre.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/02/how-to-combine-residential-heat-pumps-with-pv-battery-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-02,"How to combine residential heat pumps with PV, battery storage","Fraunhofer ISE researchers have studied how residential rooftop PV systems could be combined with heat pumps and battery storage.
They assessed the performance of a PV-heat pump-battery system based on a smart-grid (SG) ready control in a single-family house built in 1960 in Freiburg, Germany.
“It was found that the smart control increased the heat pump operation by boosting the set temperatures,” researcher Shubham Baraskar told pv magazine. “The SG-Ready control increased the supply temperature by 4.1 Kelvin for hot water preparation, which then decreased the seasonal performance factor (SPF) by 5.7% from 3.5 to 3.3. Furthermore, for space heating mode the smart control decreased the SPF by 4% from 5.0 to 4.8.”
The SPF is a value similar to the coefficient of performance (COP), with the difference it is calculated over a longer period with varying boundary conditions.
Baraskar and his colleagues explained their findings in “Analysis of the performance and operation of a photovoltaic-battery heat pump system based on field measurement data,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Advances. They said the main advantage of PV-heat pump systems consists of their reduced grid consumption and lower electricity costs.
The heat pump system is a 13.9 kW ground-source heat pump designed with a buffer storage for space heating. It also relies on a storage tank and a freshwater station for producing domestic hot water (DHW). Both storage units are equipped with electric auxiliary heaters.
The PV system is south-oriented and has a tilt angle of 30 degrees. It has a power ouput of 12.3 kW and a module area of 60 square meters. The battery is DC-coupled and has a capacity of 11.7 kWh. The selected house has a heated living space of 256 m2 and an annual heating demand of 84.3 kWh/m²a.
“The DC power from PV and battery units is converted to AC via an inverter which has a maximum AC power of 12 kW and a European efficiency of 95 %,” the researchers explained, noting that the SG-ready control is able to interact with the electricity grid and adjust the system’s operation correspondingly. “During the periods of high grid load, the grid operator can turn off the heat pump operation to reduce the grid strain or can also undergo a forced turn on in the opposite case.”
Under the proposed system configuration, PV power must be initially used for the house loads, with surplus being supplied to the battery. Excess power could only be exported to the grid, if no electricity is required by the household and the battery is completely charged. If both the PV system and the battery are not able to cover the house’s energy demand, the electricity grid can be used.
“The SG-Ready mode is activated when the battery is fully charged or is charging at its maximum power and there is still PV surplus available,” the academics said. “Conversely, the trigger-off condition is met when the instantaneous PV power remains lower than the total building demand for at least 10 minutes.”
Their analysis considered self-consumption levels, solar fraction, heat pump efficiency, and the impact of the PV system and the battery on the heat pump performance efficiency. They used high-resolution 1-minute data from January to December 2022 and found that the SG-Ready control increased the heat pump supply temperatures by 4.1 K for DHW. They also ascertained that system achieved an overall self-consumption of 42.9% during the year, which translates into financial benefits for the homeowners.
“The electricity demand for the [heat pump] was covered by 36% with the PV/battery system, through 51% in domestic hot water mode and 28% in space heating mode,” the research team explained, adding that higher sink temperatures reduced heat pump efficiency by 5.7% in DHW mode and by 4.0% in space heating mode.
“For space heating, a negative effect of the smart control was also found,” Baraskar said. “Due to the SG-Ready control the heat pump operated in space heating above the heating set point temperatures. This was because the control probably increased the storage set temperature and operated the heat pump even though the heat was not needed for space heating. It should also be considered that excessive high storage temperatures can lead to higher storage heat losses.”
The scientists said they will investigate additional PV/heat pump combinations with different system and control concepts in the future.
“It must be noted that these findings are specific for the individual evaluated systems and can vary greatly depending on the building and energy system specifications,” they concluded.
