Worldwide as well, solar power is witnessing increased acceptance and application. For the same, technological advancements for maintaining solar PV plants are also witnessing a positive growth.
Maintaining solar PV plants has become increasingly easier owing to technological advancements in robotics. From drones combined with thermal imaging to the robotic cleaning crew for large-scale solar PV plants, automation and robotics are constantly evolving for the cleaning and maintenance of solar PV plants. 
Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced robotics are steadily becoming a major part of maintaining and cleaning solar power plants. This, in turn, could lead to the widespread adoption of solar energy with hassle-free, unmanned solutions in place for regular maintenance. 
Advanced robots powered by artificial intelligence (AI) help cruise the large solar power plant area and ensure safety. Where CCTV cameras might fail, these surveillance robots monitor the entire area detecting movements and capturing videos. By transmitting images to a single source, these robots can prevent any mishaps and thefts at all times. The human identification system in the robots helps them differentiate strangers from authorized personnel. 
Birds can often lead to inefficiencies in solar power panels, thus hampering power generation. Robots designed for bird control can help combat this problem. Automatically cruising the site and equipped with a bird scaring system, advanced robotic systems in place ensure that the panels are not damaged. 
Dust can reduce the efficiency of solar panels significantly. Therefore, regular panel cleaning is a must. Manual solar panel cleaning involves the use of water to clean the panels. This may lead to water wastage regularly and on a much large scale. Robots that use less water and use microfibre cloth help tackle this problem. 
Constant innovations are also being done to find more solutions to the water wastage problem and to ensure that solar power plants remain sustainable and easy to maintain. 
Drones combined with thermal imaging have the potential to reduce maintenance costs for large-scale solar plants. These are a highly efficient alternative compared to handheld thermal inspections and augment the ease of maintenance of large-scale solar PV plants. 
With drones at the task, solar technicians need not manually walk the vast rows of solar farms. This increases the accuracy of the data as well.
Detecting hotspots, cleaning water issues, loss of generation due to shadows, and deterioration of solar panels is all possible with drones. This helps in taking timely steps to prevent further loss of energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/28/kelwon-introduces-wall-mounted-lithium-battery-inverters-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,LI-ION,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 28, 2022",Kelwon introduces wall-mountable lithium battery inverters in India,"Kelwon has unveiled compact and wall-mounted Lithium-ion inverters in India. The systems come in power ratings from 1 kVA to 10 kVA, with operating voltages of 12.8 V to 120 V, respectively.
The inverter system has an inbuilt lithium battery, which can be charged with solar as well as grid electricity. Being wall-mountable, the inverter poses no safety hazard as it has no hanging wires or terminals.
“Traditional [lead-acid battery] inverters produce indoor air pollution, which is a health hazard, especially for kids and elders living in the house. These produce a foul smell, fumes, and bad odor, which pollutes the air within the house. Also, traditional battery inverters are placed on the floor, which makes it a safety hazard for kids and pets. The hanging wires and terminals can be dangerous for the playing kids and pets in the house,” said H.S. Bhatia, managing director of Kelwon. “[In comparison], our hybrid lithium-ion battery inverter is wall-mountable, portable, and highly safe.”
The Kelwon inverter auto-selects the AC power source first for battery charging and support load during the daytime, which reduces the power consumption for battery charging and saves electricity costs.
“It is a smart inverter with two modes for inverter and UPS, pure sinewave output, auto-restart feature while AC is recovering, and overload/over temperature/short-circuit protection,” stated the company. The portable model can be used for the outdoor purpose as a power bank.
Kelwon Lithium-ion inverters come with a comprehensive warranty of 60 months both on the inverter and the battery.
This product has a long life of 15 years with negligible maintenance, which makes it far more cost effective than traditional inverters.
The price starts from INR 49,990 for a 1 kVA inverter and onwards for bigger sizes.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/28/new-industrial-plant-concept-for-end-of-life-pv-panel-recycling/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RECYCLING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 28, 2022",New industrial plant concept for end-of-life PV panel recycling,"From pv magazine Global
Italian startup Tialpi Srl has developed a new concept for photovoltaic panel recycling plants that may reportedly help recycle at least 85% of a photovoltaic panel’s weight.
“We have developed a new technology to recover the most significant components of photovoltaic panels such as aluminium profiles, copper cables, and glass,” Vera Ramon, who is responsible for energy at Tialpi Srl, told pv magazine. “Our next step, which is the second phase of our project, will be completing the development of the processes for dividing the backsheets from the wafer of silicon, which will make it possible to recover 100% of a module’s weight. For the first phase, the company has already secured a patent while for the second the patent is still pending.”
The second phase of the project is currently under development at the company’s facility in Mottalciata, in the Italian northern province of Biella. The industrial plant will recycle solar panels across several steps.
The process initially moves the panels into the line from two vertical stock containing about 25 panels each via a gripping system with pneumatic pistons that presses on the four aluminum perimeter profiles, which are then transferred through wheeled containers to the stock with a forklift. “The connector cables are cut manually with a simple scissor and the cables will be bagged manually directly into big bags on a pallet to be then transferred to the stock with forklift,” said Ramon. “Then the edges of the aluminum frame are cut by means of four miter saws operated automatically and the dust generated will be sucked up with a vacuum cleaner and bagged directly into 25 kg bags.”

In subsequent steps, the process detaches the aluminum frame by means of four pistons, then removing the electrical connectors fixed to the backsheets by cutting the silicone or other sealants using a thin semi-hardened steel blade. Machinery moves the treated panel to one of two glass detachment lines, where the glass is heated by infrared lamps and then detached via a vibrating steel blade. “The action of the vibrating knife and the detachment from the sandwich crush the glass that falls on a lifter and moves on to the next section,” explained Tialpi’s Ramon. “The sandwich is conveyed to a pallet, with gradual lifting, which contains up to 500 sandwiches, for a height of about one meter and a weight of about 1,500 kg.”
After this process is completed, a rubberized cup belt transports the glass to the screening department. The purpose of the screening is to eliminate fine (<2 mm) and coarse (> 10 mm) glass elements and any sandwich residues to obtain glass sized between 2 mm and 10 mm. These two products are then bagged directly into big bags on a pallet to be then transferred to the stock with a forklift.
In order to obtain a high-quality glass, the two products must then be properly stored and optically sorted to identify and reject non-transparent particles. “After the optical sorting, the final high-quality glass with a 2-10 mm size is directly stored in a 50-ton capacity silo. From here, it is possible to load directly the trucks for final delivery to the customers,” said Ramon.
The final step consists of an offline machine that is manually fed cabling at up to 150kg/hour to treat and extract copper with 99% purity, and plastics that can be used for extrusion. The whole process, according to the company, is environmentally compatible, as it is carried out without emissions into the atmosphere and without the use of water. The recovered aluminum can be used in remelting processes for various industries such as automotive and construction, while the high-quality extra-clear glass can be utilized in the container glass and flat extra-clear glass industry.
According to its developers, the entire process has a low energy consumption of about 1kW per panel. “It is carried out with only two workers and the payback time is about two years,” the spokesperson explained.
 The company developed the special design in the frame of the “Frelp By Sun” project, which was initially funded by the European Union. The project began in 2012 with the aim of testing and developing innovative technologies for 100% recycling of end-of-life photovoltaic panels in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. The project leader was Tialpi’s parent company, Sasil, a unit of Italian mining company Minerali Industriali, in partnership with glass maker Stazione Sperimentale del Vetro di Murano (SSV) and the consortium PV Cycle.

Los Angeles-based technology start-up Nanotech Energy says its proprietary, graphene-based, nanotechnology overcomes the safety challenges of traditional lithium-ion batteries, and its latest announcement signals it might be making progress in bringing its products to the mass market.
Nanotech’s battery uses lithium-ion chemistry supported by graphene and a proprietary nonflammable electrolyte technology that improves the electrochemical properties and safety of its electrodes.
According to the company, graphene provides ideal electronic and mechanical support to increase the reversible capacity, power and cycling stability of standard cathodes. Nanotech produces its own graphene, which allows it to be vertically integrated.
On Thursday, the company announced it would supply more than 1 GWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS) to Athens-headquartered Smile Energy, acting as the distributor for Greece and the surrounding region with Nanotech Energy BESS products through to 2028. Greece has recently doubled its 2030 energy storage target to 3 GW.
Smile Energy will potentially use Nanotech’s products to develop BESS for private homes, commercial real estate, and the marine sector and building on its pipeline of 700 MWh of energy storage across Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania.
Battery tech
The startup uses a solution processing method that allows graphene to be coated on “any substrate” along with a laser process step that forms a graphene foam. The company had originally applied its graphene technology to making better supercapacitors, but now focuses on its “super battery.”
“Nanotech Energy is the first and only producer to break the 50% content barrier by reaching 98% monolayer graphene, the wonder material that powers our products. We’ve already developed groundbreaking energy storage using technology that has the high capacity of a battery and the power performance of supercapacitors in a single solution,” said Nanotech Energy CEO Jack Kavanaugh.
According to the technical data sheet for Nanotech Energy Nonflammable GOC18650A batteries, it has a cycle life of 1200 cycles before it degrades to 88%. Its gravimetric density is 215 Wh/kg, while volumetric density stands at 557 Wh/l. The operating temperature range is from -20 to 60 degrees Celsius.
In August 2021, Nanotech Energy raised $64 million in a Series D at a $550 million valuation, with total funding thus far standing at $94.9 million. The privately held company has been backed by Multiverse Investment Fund, Fubon Financial Group, and Volkswagen, among others.
Meanwhile, Nanotech has announced it is expanding its operations with a new manufacturing facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, Nevada. The first of two buildings planned will produce 2.5 GWh of batteries annually, with the plan to continue expansion to 15 GWh over the next several years, the company said.
The first building is slated to open in Q4 2022, and Nanotech is currently taking battery pre-orders. Limited production will kick off in 2023 with full production starting in 2024.
