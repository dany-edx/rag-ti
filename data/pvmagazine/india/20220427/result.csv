Positive energy storage adoption is fundamental to changing course in the energy storage market­­, governed by the ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and practical aspects like safety, scalability, and component manufacturing.
Energy storage has a key role in the transition toward clean energy. The energy storage market must focus on reliability and resilience in the wake of the ever-growing list of countries aiming at net-zero emissions. Despite falling battery prices, grids struggle to meet energy supply amidst the increasing demand. Modern technologies have paved the way for smart meters, changing how electricity is used. Efficient energy storage harbingers the revolutionization of power generation and delivery.  
According to BloombergNEF (BNEF), energy storage installations globally will reach a cumulative 358 GW capacity by 2030. With net-zero commitments being executed worldwide, renewable energy will account for 80-90% of global electricity production by 2050. Robust energy storage technologies can help facilitate a smooth transition towards renewable energy, providing commercially scalable and sustainable solutions. 
Energy shifting is another important factor. For utilities and grid-scale operators, viable energy storage closes the gap in the variable output of solar/wind plants, preventing surplus power production and helping maintain the reliability of the electrical system.
BloombergNEF forecasts 55% of energy storage deployment by 2030 will be to provide energy shifting (for instance, storing solar or wind to release later). The stakeholders’ ability to store and discharge electricity of their own accord maximizes the management of power flows, thereby boosting revenues. Transforming the energy storage market through advanced battery storage energy systems will allow affordable energy leveraging businesses to reduce operating costs. 
A strong commitment to energy storage market transformation will necessitate a transition to renewables, efficient electrification, grid flexibility, functional electrical vehicle charging, and evolving battery storage technologies, leading to large-scale socioeconomic development.
Battery storage has dominated the market in both stationary and mobile applications for energy storage. These offer grid stability by addressing variability in renewable energy resources. The current battery landscape has Lithium-ion technology as the undefeated king. Li-ion battery technology spans 60% of global energy storage. Energy storage is estimated to grow into a $50-100 billion market by 2025.
However, Li-ion battery adoption faces an unstable supply chain and safety concerns. Usage of Lithium-ion is implausible in certain markets, such as dense urban areas, where factors like overheating and fire regulations limit its applicability. Further, puncture and leakage accentuate its safety concerns. 
Li-ion battery uptake is also limited by the extraction of raw materials such as nickel, graphite, and cobalt, raising the cost of the supply chain. Geopolitical issues govern such extraction. Automotive OEMs depend on mining and metal companies to extract battery raw materials, constraining the supply chain.
The unfolding energy storage transformation across sectors has also brought the flow battery technology to the fore. Its long-duration energy output, coupled with low-level degradation of components in utility-scale deployments, makes it ideal for the current energy storage market. But low market penetration of the flow battery technology curtails its commercialization.
The need of the hour is new storage technologies and battery materials, overcoming the limitations of the current battery technologies. Consequently, many new battery technologies have been developed to provide cheaper energy storage, though these are far from successful commercialization.
Rapid scaling up of energy storage systems will be critical to addressing the hour‐to‐hour variability of wind and solar PV, especially as their share in electricity generation increases rapidly. Meeting the needs for flexibility while decarbonizing electricity generation is a central challenge for the power sector, so all sources of flexibility, including power plants, grids, demand‐side response and storage, need to be tapped.
Recent evidence shows that spillover effects are already strong. EV battery manufacturers aim to continually develop batteries with greater energy density to reduce upfront costs and increase EV range, but this has little impact on stationary applications, for which size and weight are secondary considerations. Therefore, as supply chains advance to the next higher-performing blend or chemistry, technology that may become less attractive for EVs can be deployed at a lower cost for stationary applications on the grid.
For example, lithium iron phosphate batteries are being increasingly favored for grid-scale installations, particularly in China. These batteries offer greater safety, lower cost, and higher durability than nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistries, which dominate the EV market. Their lack of reliance on cobalt and nickel also makes them favorable from the perspective of critical mineral supply.
Ensuring pragmatic energy storage transformation is proportional to tweaking the current battery storage chemistry. Zinc battery technology is gaining traction, changing the prevailing energy storage dynamics. To develop a unique technology that ensures safety, high-availability, non-toxic raw materials are paramount. 
The zinc battery market is rapidly growing and is predicted to register a CAGR of 25.65% over the five-year period 2022-27. Ergo, there are two critical points that the energy storage market has realized: 
A disruptive chemistry in zinc battery technology must ensure five important vectors for efficient energy storage: sustainability, availability, safety, price, and performance. Applicating the zinc technology prioritizing the user base is imperative. For example, batteries required for renewable energy storage versus batteries in EVs have different requirements. Some applications need higher charging speed from a battery performance standpoint, while others need better life or better thermal stability. This is where deep science-backed zinc technology can come handy. Modularity obtained by prioritizing charging speed versus temperature stability versus energy density is a pressing need. 
There is a close link between sustainability and cost-effectiveness. A battery’s performance varies due to fluctuating weather conditions. This increases maintenance, adding up to the overall operational cost of the battery, and subsequently decreasing the capital returns on investment. Designing a battery that uses globally available materials, is easy to manufacture, and leverages the existing modular infrastructure for Lithium-ion will ensure commercial viability and success. 
Backed by pathbreaking technologies, the energy storage market will rapidly expand from hereon. The rightful investment must pool in new resources and novel technologies, emphasizing zinc battery technology as an alternative to conventional energy storage. Undoubtedly, as the world moves towards renewable energy storage, the need for high-performance batteries that are non-toxic and contain easily sourced raw materials will become indispensable.

The digital data platform pilot was launched today by the Danish ambassador to India, Freddy Svane. 
The digital solution was developed by Columbus, a Denmark-headquartered IT services and consulting company, in partnership with BYPL.
A major issue with solar power is storage and efficient management. As the energy generation is not continuous, there is a challenge to store, predict both generation and usage, and efficiently manage the distribution. 
The digital data solution by Columbus will efficiently predict the solar energy generation and demand and help the utility plan for storing the excess energy by considering the distribution congestion and commercial aspects.
The digital data platform is funded by Nordic Innovation, an organization floated by Nordic countries to promote innovation-based projects. The funding support was channelized through the Danish Embassy to optimize the storage and distribution of alternative energy sources.
The digital solution combines artificial intelligence (AI) and data science techniques to predict the energy demand at consumption points like electric vehicle charging stations and energy generation capacity at solar rooftops. It constantly assesses the optimal energy storage requirements and makes informed decisions on when to discharge and consume energy from the power grid. Real-time dashboard and automations allow efficient management and monitoring of the energy distribution.

Statkraft is a leading developer and generator of renewable energy with a substantial experience and presence in India. Aker Clean Hydrogen is a global integrated hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol producer. 
The two partners will combine their expertise to explore fully-integrated renewable power generation and green hydrogen production in India, and green ammonia for domestic use and export.
“With considerable renewable energy production and market activities in India, Statkraft is well-positioned to capture green hydrogen opportunities in this huge and important energy market. Developing such opportunities helps us grow our business and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in India,” said Jürgen Tzschoppe, Statkraft’s executive vice president for international power. 
Emissions from the steel and ammonia industries contribute to close to 9% of the global greenhouse gas emissions and are classified as hard-to-abate sectors. 
The steelmaking and shaping process is highly temperature- and energy-intensive, usually powered by fossil fuels. Similarly, ammonia production for agricultural fertilizers uses natural gas (methane) or other fossil fuels to provide the hydrogen feedstock and the energy to power the synthesis process. Switching to green hydrogen offers an emission-free alternative for decarbonizing both these sectors.
India currently consumes approximately 7 million tonnes of grey hydrogen per year, making it the world’s second-largest hydrogen consumer. The country’s hydrogen demand is expected to reach around 12 million tonnes by 2030 and about 28 million tonnes by 2050. Its commitment to reach net-zero by 2070, announced during the 26th UN Climate Change Conference, will further increase green hydrogen demand. 
“We are excited to join forces with Statkraft to accelerate the transition from grey to green solutions in India,” said Knut Nyborg, Chief Executive Officer of Aker Clean Hydrogen. “The potential environmental benefits from decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries like the steel and ammonia industry in India are substantial. India is a large hydrogen consumer, has supportive governmental policies, and benefits from world-class renewable energy resources, which offers significant opportunities for green hydrogen and ammonia production.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/27/mobile-agrivoltaic-system-from-the-netherlands/,"AGRIVOLTAICS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 27, 2022",Mobile agrivoltaic system from the Netherlands,"From pv magazine Global
A Dutch consortium has developed a mobile agrivoltaic system that is claimed to improve soil quality and biodiversity of agricultural fields.
Called H2arvester, the first prototype has been deployed on sugar beet land in Oude-Tonge, South Holland, and was inaugurated last week by Netherlands’ Agriculture Minister, Henk Staghouwer.
“The solar car concept was developed four years ago by my company and two other partners,” Marcel Vroom, responsible for design and business development at design services provider Npk design, told pv magazine. The other two companies are L’orèl Consultancy and LTO Noord. “At the moment, there are two pilots being tested, the one in Oude-Tonge and one in Lelystad, at the research farm of the Wageningen University. Both systems will be operating for one year to test the effect on the yield and the land, to show that there will be no loss of agricultural production.”
The local farmer Jacob Jan Dogterom invested €166,000 in the system located in Oude-Tonge, which consists of four solar cars hosting a total of 168 solar panels and an irrigation system that can also provide water to the surrounding area. “It is a pilot project, the investment is far from being complete. We will continue to build it and if we can develop this on a mass scale, it will only become cheaper,” the consortium said.
InnovationQuarter, the regional economic development agency for the Province of Zuid-Holland, subsidized around half of the project’s costs.
Each car measures 12×6 m and is able to move slowly, at a pace of 10 meters per hour, and, during harvesting, it can be moved to the side. According to its developer, the system should cover up to 10% of an agricultural field, which would thus not lose its agricultural purpose. “They are movable arrays of solar panels, assembled on lightweight structures and supported on wheels, moving in pre-defined directions,” Vroom further explained.
The system could also be combined with an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen, which could then be used as a green fuel for agricultural applications. Residual heat coming from hydrogen generation may also be used to dry crops, such as oats, grass and alfalfa.”The solution to convert the generated kWh directly into hydrogen not only provides an autonomous production plant, but is also a solution to the need to balance the production and use of generated energy without worrying about reinforcements of the electricity network,” said Robert Jacobs, energy specialist at L’orèl Consultancy.
The project is part of the H2GO Program, which is an innovation program supporting the combination of electricity and green hydrogen. Partners of the projects are Kitepower, Npk design, L’orèl Consultancy, Rho, Accenda and TU Delft, among others. According to its creators, H2arvester is a circular energy model for a local and regional economy.
