Transition VC will make seed investments in startups across sectors such as e-mobility, green hydrogen, energy storage, net zero journey in buildings and climate-tech. With ticket size ranging from $500K to $1 million, it is looking to support up to 40 early-stage startups over the next three years.
Transition VC recently received its SEBI approval, and is eyeing to mark the first close of the fund by the end of this calendar year. The fund was founded last year by a team of entrepreneurs and business professionals.
Prior to launching Transition VC, its team invested in e-mobility startups like Charge+Zone and Exponent Energy. While Exponent Energy is enabling rapid charging for commercial vehicles, Charge+Zone is one of the country’s largest charge point operators.
In addition to investments in Indian startups, the Transition VC fund will also allocate 25% of the fund value for global startups. “For its global investments, Transition VC has a concentrated strategy to invest in developed market products that could also be introduced to an emerging market like India,” stated the company.

NREL has unveiled a new version of its Best Research-Cell Efficiency Chart. The tool highlights the highest confirmed conversion efficiencies of research cells for a range of PV technologies.
With the new interactive version, users can pull up decades of research data and compare custom charts that focus on specific technologies or time periods, NREL said in a statement. They can now find data on a cell’s current, voltage output, and fill factor, in addition to efficiency. The availability of those details will depend on the information in NREL’s records.
The highest research cell efficiency recorded in the chart is 47.1%, for a four-junction cell. Its interactive nature allows users to visualize the recent jump in conversion efficiencies for emerging technologies like perovskite solar cells. That contrasts with the steady improvement of silicon solar cell efficiency since the 1980s.

“It’s possible that the NREL efficiency chart is the most presented graph that you can find at the annual PV Specialists Conference and similar conferences,” said Sarah Kurtz, senior research fellow at NREL. “But it has gotten so full that it’s difficult to see the data. With the new interactive chart, researchers will be able to still use the data, but present it in a way that communicates better for their talk.”
The cell efficiencies are measured by independent testing centers, including NREL, before earning a spot on the chart. All of the figures are also available as a downloadable file.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/23/longi-claims-worlds-highest-efficiency-for-silicon-solar-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 23, 2022",Longi claims world’s highest efficiency for silicon solar cells,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese PV module maker Longi has revealed that it has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.81% for an unspecified heterojunction (HJT) solar cell, based on a full-size silicon wafer, in mass production. The result has been confirmed by Germany’s ISFH.
“We cannot disclose if the cell is n-type or p-type at this stage,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
Martin Green, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia and the creator of the “solar cell efficiency tables,” said the result is the highest efficiency record for silicon solar cells to date.
“This outstanding achievement will be included in the next version of efficiency tables published in the progress in photovoltaics,” he said, noting that the previous record of 26.7% was achieved by an unspecified Japanese manufacturer in 2017. Longi likely refers to the result achieved by Japanese chemical company Kaneka. Its 180cm² crystalline silicon device, which featured heterojunction and back-contact technology, achieved 26.63% efficiency.
“Longi broke a new world record for silicon solar cell conversion efficiency with 26.74%, 26.78% and 26.81% respectively, which further affirmed Longi’s determination to continuously focus on R&D investment and promote industrial progress,” said the Chinese manufacturer.
In September, the company said it had achieved an efficiency of 26.12% for a gallium-doped, p-type heterojunction (HJT) solar cell based on an M6 wafer. The company also achieved an efficiency of 25.47% for the same solar cell in March.
In addition, the Chinese manufacturer recorded an efficiency of 26.5% for a n-type heterojunction solar cell in June and a 25.19% rating for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it achieved a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon PV cell.
*The article was updated on November 21 to specify that the undisclosed manufacturer cited by Longi is likely Japanese company Kaneka.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/23/enfinity-global-adds-205-mw-of-solar-energy-capacity-in-india/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 23, 2022",Enfinity Global adds 205 MW of solar energy capacity in India,"In a release issued this week, US-based Enfinity Global announced it has added 205 MW of solar capacity in India through the interconnection of 135 MW of projects in the state of Maharashtra and the acquisition of six operational projects from Rays Power Infra in the states of Telangana and Karnataka.
This capacity addition marks an important milestone for Enfinity Global, which entered the Indian market last year.
“We will continue to strengthen our market presence by developing a hybrid renewable portfolio of about 3 GW as part of our current pipeline and continue to acquire operational assets across segments,” said Sandip Agarwal, Enfinity Global CEO for India. “We are also expanding into other sustainability areas such as water management, sustainable mobility, hydrogen generation and circular economy.”
Enfinity Global built and interconnected 135 MW across ten different solar power plants in Maharashtra during the first half of 2022. It built these projects under Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojana, which seeks to provide day-time power to the local farmers while contributing to a more sustainable agricultural activity. The power produced will be sold to Maharashtra State Power Generation Co. (Mahagenco) under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA).
“The 250,000 solar panels installed will generate 225 million units of electricity per year, equivalent to lighting 189,000 Indian homes and reducing some 200,000 tons of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the amount absorbed by 9.5 million mature trees,” stated the company.
The 70 MW of solar power portfolio acquired from Rays Power Infra includes six operational plants in the states of Telangana and Karnataka.
The portfolio acquired in Karnataka includes 47 MW spread over three sites, while the plants acquired in Telangana comprises three other sites totaling 23 MW. All the projects have PPAs signed with state-owned power distribution companies.
The six sites have a total of 226,000 solar panels installed, generating 108 million units of electricity sufficient to power 98,352 households and save 103,000 tons of CO2 emissions, equivalent to planting 4.9 million mature trees.
Enfinity Global Inc., established in 2019, focuses on developing, financing, building, operating, and owning renewable energy assets. It is present in India since early 2021, thanks to the integration of Tepsol, a Hyderabad-based solar energy joint venture previously owned by EverStream Energy Capital Management LLC and Think Energy. The company operates renewable energy projects across the states of Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Its current portfolio includes a pipeline of over 2 GW of commercial and industrial (C&I) and public utility projects under different stages of development.
