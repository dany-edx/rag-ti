The company plans to expand its presence across the entire solar value chain eventually.
RSOLEC will initially set up a solar crystal growth and wafering facility with a production capacity of 5 GW per annum and plans expansion to exceed 20 GW in the long term. Commissioning of the facility is planned in late 2025 and production is set to start in 2026. 
RSOLEC is currently evaluating several short-listed production sites offering attractive opportunities.
The company announced its solar manufacturing plans for India following its official launch and establishment, accompanied by a planned investment of about $300 million recently. 
“With global reach and expertise in differentiated solar and electronic materials manufacturing, RSOLEC is set to revolutionize the industry with a strategic focus on solar crystal growth and wafering,” announced the company. 
RSOLEC stated its primary focus for the next five years will be on crystal growth and wafering in India, contributing significantly to the country’s strategic solar manufacturing capacity. Over the long term, the company will expand its manufacturing over the entire solar value chain.
RSOLEC aims to pioneer solar manufacturing with the lowest capital intensity, ensuring cost-competitive production on a global scale. The company’s roadmap anticipates achieving a capital intensity below $35 million per GW.
RSOLEC stated its facility will utilize the state-of-the-art Recharge Czochralski (RCZ) process, which can be retrofitted to the emerging Continuous Czochralski (CCZ) process for crystal growth. Wafer production will be based on the cutting-edge DCW platform, capable of producing thin wafers measuring below 100 micrometers in thickness. 
The primary product will be high-quality silicon wafers with low oxygen content, long lifetime, and controlled resistivity. These will be compatible with all solar cell technologies, including TOPCon, PERC, HJT, and Tandem structures.
RSOLEC aims to achieve crystals with uniform resistivity, potentially increasing average cell efficiency by 0.15%, a milestone not yet attained in the solar manufacturing industry. For select customers requiring very low oxygen content, the magnetic Czochralski (MCZ) platform will be employed. The facility will have the capability to produce wafers in various sizes, including M10, G12, and G16.


The company claims to achieve an 80% improvement in productivity and a 40% reduction in production costs over a short timeframe by leveraging its continuous technological advancement on existing platforms.
RSOLEC is founded and supported by technocrats from five different countries across three continents. The company is based in Delaware, USA, and operates through its Indian subsidiary located within the IIT Madras Research Park.
Milind Kulkarni, chairman and CEO of RSOLEC, articulated, “RSOLEC is poised to contribute to the solar energy revolution and initiate the cultural transformation required for success in the dynamic solar manufacturing sector. Our differentiation lies in our technology-driven, low-risk innovations, positioning RSOLEC at the forefront of the solar industry.”
“It is strategically imperative for India to develop the entire solar ecosystem, encompassing solar manufacturing. RSOLEC brings the requisite expertise for technology-driven solar manufacturing, and we are pleased to support this critically significant endeavor at the IIT Madras Research Park,” added Ashok Jhunjhunwala, President of IITM Research Park.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/10/reducing-solar-module-temperature-via-dew-point-evaporative-cooling/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 10, 2023",Reducing solar module temperature via dew-point evaporative cooling,"A group of scientists led by Japan’s Kyushu University has developed a new technique based on dew-point evaporative cooling (DPEC) to reduce the operating temperatures of photovoltaic panels.
DPEC is a heat and mass transfer technique that has been broadly used for energy conservation in several industrial sectors to date. This technique is one of the most effective and energy-efficient ways to cool down hot air. It has a higher cooling efficiency than traditional evaporative cooling and can reach dew point temperature, which is the temperature point at which the air can hold no more water vapor and is always lower or the same as the air temperature.
DPEC systems are usually designed to supply air into a wet channel as the working air. This enhances the heat and mass transfer process in the wet channel, due to the lower temperature of the incoming working air. “The exhaust air in the DPEC system can reach saturation, while the supply air in the dry channel can reach its dew-point temperature,” the researchers explained. “The proposed system consists of a separate dew-point evaporative cooler that supplies the near-saturation air to the wet air channels which are attached to the back of the PV panels.”
The proposed system consists of two wet channels, one located in the DPEC system itself and another one placed on the back of the PV panel. The DPEC system provides near-saturation cooled air to the wet channel attached at the back of the PV panel where further evaporative cooling occurs to ensure the maximum cooling effect.
The academics claim that the DPEC system is able to considerably reduce the solar panel operating temperature, particularly at the air inlet of the panel. “A large temperature difference between layers at the panel inlet is observed, due to the cool air supplied from the DPEC unit,” they said. “As the air flows along the channel, the temperature difference between each layer is reduced via heat transfer.”
They also explained that the water evaporation process triggered by the continuous heat transfer from the dry channel to the wet channel embedded in the DPEC system and to the wet channel placed in the panel resulted in an increase in air humidity.
The system was tested for 10 h a day, and the group found the DPEC system consumes 0.0736 kg of water, while the second wet channel at the back of the PV panel consumes 0.7157 kg, with total water consumption being about 0.7893 kg.
The team also found that the channel height has a significant impact on system performance. “Increasing the channel height allows a larger amount of unsaturated air to enter the PV panel, which promotes the heat and mass transfer process to control the panel at a lower operating temperature and thus improves the solar cell efficiency,” it stressed.
The researchers compared the performance of a solar module cooled by the novel technique with that of an uncooled panel and of panels cooled by direct evaporative cooling, and DPEC-based sensible cooling systems. They found that, in all cases, the proposed system achieved better cooling performance and maintained higher module efficiency.
“Shorter channel length and larger channel height improve the cooling performance and yield higher efficiency for the PV panel,” they emphasized. “On the other hand, higher inlet air velocity and working air ratio are favorable.”
They presented the system in the study “Dew-point evaporative cooling of PV panels for improved performance,” published in Applied Thermal Engineering.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/10/stanwell-partners-with-queensland-manufacturer-on-worlds-largest-iron-flow-battery/,"HIGHLIGHTS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 10, 2023",Stanwell partners with Queensland manufacturer on ‘world’s largest’ iron flow battery,"From pv magazine Australia
The Queensland government has announced publicly owned energy company Stanwell Corporation will work with Energy Storage Industries – Asia Pacific (ESI) to develop what would be the largest iron flow battery energy storage system in the world and the largest deployment yet of Australian-made storage.
Stanwell is already working with ESI to establish a 1 MW/10 MWh iron flow battery pilot project near Rockhampton on Queensland’s central coast and now the state government has penned an agreement that could deliver a 150 MW battery with up to 14 hours of storage capacity.
The agreement, announced by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk during her recent State of the State address, also provides Stanwell with rights to purchase up to 200 MW of iron flow battery energy storage a year from 2026.
“Stanwell has now entered into a partnership with Energy Storage Industries Asia Pacific to secure the first large-scale deployment of locally made flow batteries in Australia,” Palaszczuk said.
“Stanwell and Energy Storage Industries are now working on an initial 150 MW battery project with the ongoing rights to purchase up to 200 MW per annum.”
The announcement comes with work having already started on the pilot project that will deliver a 10 MWh iron flow battery storage system. The battery, the first technology to be tested at Stanwell’s Future Energy and Innovation Training Hub being built at the coal-fired Stanwell Power Station site near Rockhampton, is expected to be operational by September 2024.
ESI Managing Director Stuart Parry said the pilot project will confirm the viability of iron flow batteries for medium- and long-duration energy storage and the viability of deploying the technology at scale.
Parry said the company’s iron flow batteries can provide up to 14 hours of energy storage capacity, making them ideal for supporting and firming the electricity network during high demand and low renewable energy generation.
“The battery at Stanwell Clean Energy Hub is the first of many that will be deployed across the state to help stabilise energy supply from renewables and provide energy at night or when the sun doesn’t shine,” he said.
“We look forward to working with Stanwell to deliver this and future projects, which are critical to supplying Queensland’s long-term energy needs.”
EIS batteries are to be manufactured in a new facility being built at Maryborough with the centre expected to be operational in 2024. The company said its batteries have a lifecycle of 25 years, are entirely recyclable and made with environmentally friendly electrolytes produced in Townsville.
Parry said the company plans to expand its operations so that, by the end of 2026, it will be capable of delivering up to 400 MW of battery energy storage systems annually.
Stanwell Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Rourke said the agreement with ESI forms part of the corporation’s energy transition with the state government identifying large-scale energy storage as fundamental to achieving its renewable energy targets.
“To deliver the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan, Stanwell is building a renewable energy portfolio of at least 9 to 10 GW by 2035, and at least 3 to 3.5 GW of energy storage,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/10/a-reaction-to-rystads-recent-estimates-on-european-solar-module-stockpile/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 10, 2023",A reaction to Rystad’s recent estimates on European solar module stockpile,"From pv magazine Germany
A week ago, Rystad Energy corrected its previous statements about the inventory of Chinese module imports downwards by 60% and assumed 40 GW inventories in the EU at the end of 2023.
Quote: “The market has reacted and companies have significantly reduced their orders,” said a Rystad analyst in an article published by pv magazine on September 29. Relying on export data for modules from China to Europe, he said that inventory levels are stagnating at around 40 GW. Manufacturers would not flood the European market without wholesalers and project developers placing corresponding orders, he also said.
This week, however, Rystad told pv magazine that there are suddenly 80 GW in the EU warehouses, and Rystad assumes that there could be 100 GW by the end of 2023.
Rystad said that the new numbers are based on new figures that have only been available this week, with the assumed decline having not occurred after all.
Bang! From 40 GW to 80 GW within six weeks because of supposedly new numbers.
And what happens next is no longer understandable to me.
From January 2023 to the end of August 2023, around 78 GW were exported from China to the EU. That’s right – the official export figures from China are confirming this and it is no secret. The 78 GW probably also includes at least 5 GW to 6 GW of OEM modules that are sold under labels from “EU manufacturers” but come entirely from China.
Anyone can easily check this here for the last few years (csv file, scroll to EU):
https://ember-climate.org/data-catalogue/china-solar-pv-exports/
As I have already described several times, at the end of 2022, with an EU market of 46 GW, we had a “normal” inventory of two to three months, essentially around 8 GW, plus around 33 GW.
How to calculate “module surplus” with a simple Excel table
This is how the year 2023 began, and from here on, it is a simple Excel table with which you can calculate the “module surplus.”
In this table, you will note the official export from China to the EU with a delay of around two months, the EU market development up to the point in time under consideration, and the “normal storage cycle” of two to three months until the modules then appear in the installation statistics.
Based on my long solar experience, these are normal numbers on the way from the port to the customer and the completed installation or its official registration.
With an EU market of 60 GW to 114 GW expected for 2023, 10 GW to 19 GW would be the expected new normal for module inventories.
It’s just a different dimension than before, and you have to get used to 10 GW to 19 GW as a “normal” warehouse flow – until recently, the entire EU market was that big per year. But now, it is 20 times larger than it was in the darkest days of the anti-dumping duties.
I’m surprised at how the analysts at Rystad Energy are proceeding. It has been easy all year long to take the Chinese export data, add “normal” warehouse flow, and then follow the EU installations closely. There was “no new data overnight,” only the export data from August of 8 GW, after 7.2 GW in July, and 11.6 GW in May. This doesn’t look like a surprise to me.
In Germany, PV capacity is growing considerably, as reported every month by the Federal Network Agency. And in Germany alone, the market is growing by an incredible 85% compared to 2022, and I hear similar things from many other countries. Therefore, EU growth from 46 GW in 2022 to well over 80 GW in 2023 is entirely possible.
I don’t know exactly where we stand with EU installations at the end of September. But it’s very easy with Excel to enter 60 GW, 80 GW, and 114 GW as an EU market for the entire year 2023, scale it to the period up to the end of October using the rule of three, and calculate the export data plus warehousing against it.
The results for the EU warehouses can be estimated based on the end of October. By then, all of the exporters from August will have arrived here, meaning 78 GW since January. These are the results:
With a 60 GW market in the EU in 2023:
“Normal” inventory: 10 GW
Module consumption in 2023, up to and including October: 50 GW
“Excess” inventory, including excess from 2022: 59 GW
With an 80 GW market in the EU in 2023:
“Normal” inventory: 13 GW
Module consumption in 2023, up to and including October: 67 GW
“Excess” inventory, including excess from 2022: 39 GW
With a 114 gigawatt peak market in the EU in 2023:
“Normal” inventory: 19 GW
Module consumption in 2023, up to and including October: 95 GW
“Excess” inventory, including excess from 2022: 5 GW
I expect at least something quite simple like this from a large analyst firm like Rystad.
One could also say: “It’s the real size of the EU installation market.”
Because that’s what it’s all about in the end: Have manufacturers, retailers, and others overestimated the EU market? Are there a lot of goods there? Or do they not have that, and in some cases, there is very little product?
In any case, it has nothing to do with “dumping” and you have to have strong special interests in order to derive accusations of dumping from the stocks. These would then apply in the same way to OEM modules imported from China, as well as to solar cells from China.
In the end, all the magnificent growth of the EU solar market is “brutally” good news for climate protection in the EU and the entire world.
