Developers selected by SECI shall set up wind-solar hybrid power projects on a build-own-operate basis at their chosen locations. 
SECI has been designated as a trader for the purchase and sale of power from such projects. It shall enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders and a power sale agreement with the interested buying entities.
“Projects under construction, projects which are not yet commissioned and projects already commissioned but do not have any long-term PPA with any agency and selling power on short-term or merchant plant basis will also be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other Central or State Schemes and do not have any obligations towards existing buyers,” as per the tender document.
Under this RfS, a hybrid power project shall comprise solar and wind power components. The rated installed project capacity of either of the two components shall be at least 33% of the contracted capacity.
The hybrid power projects are to be designed for interconnection with the transmission network of the central transmission utility at a minimum voltage level of 220 kV. Developers are required to set up the transmission network up to the delivery point at their own cost.
The solar project component may be sub-divided into a number of ‘blocks’, set up at multiple locations if required. However, such blocks for a single solar project component shall be located within the same State. The minimum voltage level for a single block shall be 33 kV. These individual blocks shall be pooled at a minimum voltage level of 33 kV at a ‘pooling station.’
Single developers can compete for a minimum of 50 MW, up to all of the 1200 MW capacity. The minimum project size shall be 50 MW.

To begin with, Tata Power would set up 10,000 microgrids through Common Service Centres (CSCs).
Speaking about the partnership, Sanjay Kumar Rakesh, CEO of CSC e-Governance Services India, said, “Energy production and consumption is changing at a fast pace. One emerging trend is shift from concentrated grid-scale systems to distributed, consumer-side production. In the future, every city and village is going to have power production plant for their consumption.
“While CSC brings to the partnership village-level entrepreneurs to provide such production centers with quick service support at low cost, Tata Power brings technology and financial strength to set up the systems and provide round-the-clock power supply to households and businesses in rural areas.”
As solar power can be generated only during the day-time, Tata Power will supplement these solar plants with battery storage to ensure continuous power supply. To ensure supply even on days when sun doesn’t shine, there will be a provision for coupling with diesel generator which will run on power from biogas plants.
Tata Power has started a pilot project in five villages of Lakhimpur district.
“This partnership will increase energy access and provide an economic opportunity to the company by providing off-grid or microgrid power. This will help rural customers move away from burning relatively expensive fuels such as kerosene and can provide basic energy services and meet economic needs,” Dinesh Tyagi, managing director, CSC e-Governance Services India, said in a statement.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/16/canadian-solar-begins-production-of-640-665-w-panel-series/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 16, 2021",Canadian Solar begins production of 640-665 W panel series,"From pv magazine International
Chinese-Canadian solar module manufacturer Canadian Solar has begun mass production of its 640-665 W panel series that was launched in October and includes the two monofacial, CS7L-MS and CS7N-MS series, and the two bifacial, CS7L-MB-AG and CS7N-MB-AG series.
“The nameplate production capacity of the HiKu7 and BiHiKu7 modules will reach 10 GW by the end of 2021, of which a significant portion has already been booked,” the panel maker stated. “The company will deliver the first batch of the new high-power, high-efficiency modules this month.”
According to the company’s CEO, Shawn Qu, these high-power modules are manufactured with damage-free cell cutting, strict hot-spot control, and low-LeTID technology.
All the panels of the HiKu7 CS7N-MS series are produced with 210mm wafers and have dimensions of 2,384×1,303×35mm, a weight of 35.7kg, and feature 132 monocrystalline half cells. The manufacturer claims they can reduce balance of system costs by up to 5.7% and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of a project by up to 8.9% compared to conventional 445 W modules.
The module technology relies on Canadian Solar’s own cell technology and module design, including hetero-type ribbon (HTR) and paving technology, which the company said improves performance with minimal cell spacing. The technology is said to combine the advantages of half-cell panels and paved modules.
