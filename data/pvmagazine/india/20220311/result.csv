Out of this, 80% (2,526MW) came from utility scale, 16% (520MW) from rooftop solar and 4% (120MW) off-grid, according to Bridge To India’s latest quarterly report, India Solar Compass Q4 2021.
The nation reached cumulative installed PV capacity of 50,481MW by December 31, 2021. This included 40,437MW of utility-scale, 8,571MW rooftop solar, and 1,473MW offgrid. Total project capacity in pipeline (projects allocated to developers and at various stages of development) stood at 63,315MW.
Bridge To India analysts expect the first quarter of 2022 to see PV capacity addition surge to 3.7GW as developers rush their installations before the module costs go up due to the onset of basic customs duty from April 1.
“Total EPC cost for utility-scale solar increased from INR 31.19/Wp to INR 33.14/Wp in Q4 2021 on account of increase in goods and services tax (GST) from 5% to 12%. Cost is expected to further shoot up in Q2 2022 due to imposition of 40% basic customs duty on modules,” according to the report.
“Prices for mono-PERC modules, currently at USD 0.27/Wp are likely to remain relatively firm over next two quarters and fall gradually by end of the year due to strong global demand and persistent supply chain constraints in China,” it added.

Halo Energie will set up the 20MW greenfield solar project in Dimapur district of the state on a land leased by the Nagaland government for 25 years.
The PV project is estimated to cost around INR 120 crore, which will be funded by a mix of debt and equity.
As per the data available from the ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Nagaland has 30.67MW of installed hydro power capacity, and just 3.04MW of installed solar capacity (1MW of rooftop solar and 2.04MW of offgrid) as of January 31, 2022.
“The State has a power requirement of 250MW and, as of the available statistics, it does not generate even 15% of power requirement in the State,” as per a discussion at Nagaland Legislative Assembly Secretariat last year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/11/sungrow-ramps-up-india-solar-inverter-factory-to-10gw-annum/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,MARKETS,CHINA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 11, 2022",Sungrow ramps up Indian solar inverter factory to 10GW/annum,"Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow recently inaugurated its expanded scale of manufacturing capacity in India. The company, which started manufacturing solar inverters in India in 2018, has scaled the India factory to 10GW/annum capacity as it looks to better the reach to its customers locally and globally with lesser lead time and better service experience.
Bhagwanth Khuba, Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy, Govt of India, virtually inaugurated the manufacturing unit. 
Sungrow, which has over 224GW installed worldwide as of December 2021, has supplied more than 11GW inverters to India since entering the Indian solar market in 2014. With its 10GW manufacturing unit, Sungrow can cater to different customer segments, including residential, commercial & industrial, utility-scale levels and the customers worldwide. 
“I appreciate this step of Sungrow, as well as its long-term development plan, which can help to realize our ambition of renewable energy mission. In the future, I hope Sungrow can keep leading this market and set the benchmark for the Indian solar industry, for the success of ‘Make in India’ Initiative,” said Bhagwanth Khuba.
At the inauguration ceremony, Sungrow launched its new products in string and central inverter categories, including models SG350HX and “1+X” modular inverter. 
SG350HX multi-MPPT string inverter for 1500 Vdc system features a maximum output power of 352 kW, supporting large-format high-efficiency and bifacial PV modules.
The “1+X” modular central inverter solution for large-scale utility solar plants boasts modularization at the inverter level, the system level and the component level. With three-level modularization, it makes power plant design more flexible and post-O&M more convenient in the future.
Sunil Badesra, Country Head of Sungrow India, said, “Sungrow is very proud to be the only company which manufactures all types of PV plus ESS equipment domestically for the Indian market, and it also creates enormous opportunities for investment attraction and employment. In the future, we will work even harder to strengthen the supply chain further and assure the stable and efficient delivery for our customers.”

Waterschap Rivierenland, the water authority of the Dutch provincies of Zuid-Holland, Gelderland, Noord-Brabant and Utrecht, is coordinating a research project aimed at developing a submersing modular raft for floating PV systems for inland water areas.
Dubbed Hide and Shine Floating Solar (HAS FPV), the system is claimed to be particularly suitable for countries where hurricanes and typhoons are frequent or which have other, frequent harsh weather conditions. The system design consists of a smart assembly of existing market components.
“A submersing solution is maybe a bit more expensive to construct but it may also result in lower costs for weather insurance, anchoring and construction while providing a longer lifespan,” the research coordinator, Johan Bakker, told pv magazine. “The modular system is currently being built by a group of Dutch companies including Easyfix Solar, EQAenergy, and Aveco de Bondt, among others.”
The HAS FPV system is designed with different buoys. The first full-scale raft is made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer and easy-fix aluminum and fibers. “With little water pumping, the raft will increase in weight and will submerge and surface by changing ballast,” Bakker explained. “During the submerging time, the solar modules are switched off.”
The modules can be submerged totally or partially, depending on the weather conditions, and in case of a severe storm the panels can be submerged up to two meters below the surface.
The consortium plans to deploy the first pilot project, relying on 50 solar modules, at a water reservoir in Weurt, near the town of Nijmegen in the Dutch province of Gelderland in a few weeks’ time. “The aim of this pilot is to research [and] develop the system for balancing, floating, and control behavior, in different weather circumstances, especially storm conditions,” Bakker emphasized.
In 2018, Waterschap Rivierenland joined forces with Dutch companies Blue21 and Hakkers NV, and with the Photovoltaic Materials and Devices (PVMD) unit of the Netherlands’ Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) to develop a new floating PV technology dubbed Innozowa. The first pilot project for this technology was also implemented at the water reservoir in Weurt.

The Institute of Home Automation and Energy Efficiency and the University of Malaga (UMA), in Spain, are developing a circular economy project to improve water supply in southern Spain via solar-powered water desalination.
Named Agua+S, the research project is aimed at combining a desalination plant, a pumping station network, and an onshore, floating photovoltaic plant in a single project design.
The desalination unit should be located near the sea at the mouth of a river, and the pumping station would be built in the riverbed and would transfer the water from the desalination plant to a swamp reservoir. The floating photovoltaic plant should be deployed on the water of a reservoir less than 20km from the sea, and should supply all the electricity needed to carry out the entire desalination process.
“Usually, desalinated water has to be mineralized, since consuming this pure water is detrimental to health. Therefore, we choose to pour it into a swamp reservoir where the mineralization process can be implemented,” explained researcher Salvador Merino.
According to the research group this is the first time that these three facilities have been combined together in a fully reproducible design that could be replicated in any river basin that has a reservoir and is close to the coast, to produce fresh water for both irrigation and human consumption.
“Agua+S would allow the production of 20 cubic hectometers (hm3) of water per year,” said Merino, noting that the project will rely almost entirely on existing water and electricity distribution networks.
According to its developers, the project could be implemented in less than a year at a cost of around €60 million. Its payback time is estimated at between three and four years. The brine generated by the desalination process will be used for the production of salt, chlorine and other chemical derivatives.
