Underwriters Laboratories, a U.S. standards development organization, and Koren car manufacturer Hyundai Motor Co. signed a memorandum of understanding to help further the safe deployment and use of second-life battery energy storage systems (SLBESS). 
The two said they will collaborate on SLBESS initiatives, including safety testing and assessment, a North America product demonstration project, and evaluation process development. They said they intend to use their worldwide presence to further SLBESS market adoption.
Second-life batteries often consist of electric vehicle batteries that no longer meet the requirements of automotive applications, but are still worthwhile additions as grid-connected energy storage devices.
As the EV market grows, attention is focusing on battery reuse. In 2018, UL participated in developing UL 1974, the Standard for Evaluation for Repurposing Batteries, a bi-national standard of the United States and Canada. In 2019, 4R Energy Corp., a joint venture of Nissan Motors and Sumitomo Corp., became the first organization certified to that standard.
Improvements in lithium extraction, battery efficiency upgrades, lithium battery recycling, and battery reuse all present market opportunities as the world shifts the way it uses energy.
The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow from $40.5 billion in 2020 to $91.9 billion by 2026, as demand for electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and electronics continue to ramp up.
Lithium battery growth is a part of national plans to evolve and decarbonize the energy and transportation sectors, as evidenced by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) making $200 million in funding available to support the full value chain of batteries, from raw materials to end-user products such as EVs and battery storage systems.
DOE and the Biden administration have identified the need to establish a secure end-to-end battery materials and technology supply chain that supports economic competitiveness, job creation, and national security.

The investment gives Reliance New Energy Solar 42.3 million shares of preferred stock in Ambri.
As part of the transaction, Reliance New Energy Solar and Ambri will partner to develop and manufacture Ambri’s batteries in India. 
The investment follows Reliance Industries’ announcement earlier this to build an energy storage giga-fab in Jamnagar. “We are exploring new and advanced electrochemical technologies that can be used for such large-scale grid batteries to store the energy that we will create. We will collaborate with global leaders in battery technology to achieve the highest reliability for round-the-clock power availability through a combination of generation, storage, and grid connectivity,” chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani had announced.
The US$ 50 million funding by Reliance New Energy Solar is part of an overall $144 million raised by Ambri in its latest round of funding. Other strategic investors leading the Ambri funding round included private investment manager Paulson & Co. Inc. and Ambri’s largest shareholder Bill Gates. New investors included Fortistar, Goehring & Rozencwajg Associates, Japan Energy Fund, and others. 
Ambri will use the funds to commercialize and grow its long-duration energy storage systems business globally. The developer uses antimony in its battery chemistry and has entered into a long-term antimony supply agreement with Perpetua Resources, an Idaho-based natural resource company backed by Paulson & Co. 
Ambri’s liquid metal battery cells utilize commonly available electrode materials, which, the battery developer claims, cost one-third of those used in nickel-manganese-cobalt oxides (NMC) lithium-ion cells. These comprise a liquid calcium alloy anode, a molten salt electrolyte, and a cathode made of solid particles of antimony.
The manufacturing of Ambri cells is also far simpler, requiring fewer steps and one-third to half the capital expense per MWh of production than lithium-ion.
The Ambri batteries are built as ready-to-install DC containerized systems and can cater to projects that require energy storage systems from 10 MWh to over 2 GWh. These are claimed to be capable of operating safely in any climatic condition without requiring supplemental air conditioning and built to last for more than 20 years with minimal degradation. 
Ambri systems are particularly suited for high-usage applications, such as shifting energy from daytime solar generation to evening and morning peak load times. The company is securing customers for large-scale projects with commercial operations in 2023 and beyond.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/10/sandia-researchers-develop-new-grid-scale-energy-storage-battery/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 10, 2021",Sandia researchers develop new grid-scale energy storage battery,"From pv magazine International
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories have designed a new class of molten sodium batteries for grid-scale energy storage.
Molten sodium batteries store energy from renewable sources. However, commercially available versions, called sodium-sulfur batteries, typically operate at 520-660 degrees Fahrenheit. Sandia’s new molten sodium-iodide battery operates at 230 degrees Fahrenheit instead.
Researchers said that “a whole cascading cost savings” comes along with lowering the battery temperature. For example, less expensive materials may be used, the batteries need less insulation, and the wiring that connects the batteries can be thinner.
But battery chemistry that works at 550 degrees doesn’t work at 230 degrees. Among the innovations that allowed this lower operating temperature was development of a catholyte, a liquid mixture of two salts; in this case, sodium iodide and gallium chloride.
A basic lead-acid battery, commonly used as a car ignition battery, has a lead plate and a lead dioxide plate with a sulfuric acid electrolyte in the middle. As energy is discharged from the battery, the lead plate reacts with sulfuric acid to form lead sulfate and electrons. These electrons start the car and return to the other side of the battery, where the lead dioxide plate uses the electrons and sulfuric acid to form lead sulfate and water.
For the new molten sodium battery, the lead plate is replaced by liquid sodium metal, and the lead dioxide plate is replaced by a liquid mixture of sodium iodide and a small amount of gallium chloride.
When energy is discharged from the new battery, the sodium metal produces sodium ions and electrons. On the other side, the electrons turn iodine into iodide ions. The sodium ions move across a separator to the other side where they react with the iodide ions to form molten sodium iodide salt.
Instead of a sulfuric acid electrolyte, the middle of the battery is a special ceramic separator that allows only sodium ions to move from side to side.
Unlike a lithium ion battery, everything is liquid on the two sides, the researchers said. That eliminates issues like the material undergoing complex phase changes or falling apart. And that means the liquid-based batteries don’t have as limited a lifetime as many other batteries.
Additionally, at 3.6V, the new sodium-iodide battery has a 40% higher operating voltage than a commercial molten sodium battery, the researchers said. This voltage leads to higher energy density, meaning that potential future batteries made with this chemistry would need fewer cells, fewer connections between cells, and an overall lower unit cost to store the same amount of electricity.
The next step for the sodium-iodide battery project is to continue to tune and refine the catholyte chemistry to replace the gallium chloride component, Small said. Gallium chloride is expensive, more than 100 times as expensive as table salt.
The team is also working on engineering tweaks to get the battery to charge and discharge faster and more fully. One previously identified modification to speed up the battery charging was to coat the molten sodium side of the ceramic separator with a thin layer of tin.
The researchers said it would likely take five to 10 years to get sodium-iodide batteries to market, with most of the remaining challenges being commercialization challenges, rather than technical challenges.
The development of the new sodium battery was supported by the Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity Energy Storage Program.
