Under the pact, they will work jointly to convert India’s existing and new ports into green facilities.
Kuldeep Gupta, President (Strategic partnerships) at C4V, told pv magazine, “C4V will provide customized solar-plus-storage solutions to the port operators as per their power demand patterns. We will do the complete EPC, from solar installation and connection to batteries to connecting the whole system to the grid.”
“Trot will act as the project developer. They have good experience in operations and maintenance of port equipment and understand the power requirements of various equipment’s at port,” said Gupta.
C4V will supply battery pack solutions imported from its factories in USA and UK.
“We aim to make Indian ports sustainable by providing solar + storage or solar + wind + storage solutions to do away with the use of grid/fossil fuel-based power for all port equipment,” said Gupta. “Three key points signed in the MoU with Trot Solutions include developing new green ports and conversion of old ports on green power, supporting port equipment like cranes, trailers, forklifts, and port trucks with batteries, and also electrification of small supply vessels, tugs, and pilot vessels with conversion from IC engines to lithium ion batteries powered.”
C4V is also working to set up a giga-scale battery cell manufacturing in India to cater to large-scale projects in battery energy storage solutions and e-mobility segments.
”C4V has successfully deployed its technology in energy storage and electric mobility segments and is now excited to help develop green and self-sustainable ports in India with Trot Solutions. Our advanced battery solutions will enable ports to reduce their carbon footprint,” said Gupta.
“India is a key market for C4V enjoying a coastline of 7,500 kilometers where many seaports still need to be developed and more power will be required, which could be delivered via green energy as well as energy storage solutions. Our target is to convert 20% of Indian ports into green by 2025 and 50% to run on green power by 2030. Electrification of vessels will be a great step forward in support of the government’s zero waste discharge policy for port operations,” Gupta added.
Rizwan Ali, managing director at Trot Solutions, said the partnership will reduce the burden of the grid, enable power in rural areas, and create job opportunities for India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/04/using-end-of-life-photovoltaic-panels-as-building-material/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 4, 2023",Using end-of-life photovoltaic panels as building material,"Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science have proposed to use end-of-life photovoltaic (EoL-PV) panels as low-cost, low-embodied energy-building material.
The research group stressed that solar module recycling is currently not viable economically, and said its approach consists of making conventional solar panels into BIPV products without any modifications.
“There is a significant reduction in the cost due to the wall, windows and roof in case of the adoption of EoL-PV modules,” the research’s lead author, Roshan R. Rao, told pv magazine. “The weight of these panels is much lower when compared to that of conventional 250 mm thick brick walls. The foundation for an EoL-PV structure would be much lighter and cheaper.”
The researchers constructed two different real buildings integrated with EoL-PV panels: a building-applied photovoltaic (BAPV) house using brick walls with plaster and RCC Roof, with the EoL-PV modules being attached to the structure; and a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) house where the walls, roof, and windows are constructed using EoL-PV panels.
Their performance was then compared with that of a reference house built with traditional materials. Each unit housing unit measures 3 m × 3 m × 3 m and is based on the typical construction practice followed in India.
“We conducted climate responsiveness of these buildings through measurements and whole building simulations,” Rao said. “We are assessing the climate responsiveness of such buildings in different climate zones and possible interventions to improve the thermal performance of such buildings.”
Despite the theoretical end of their lifecycle, the reused solar panels are still assumed to provide a nominal power of 4 kWh/m2/day and to be used for providing the housing units with part of the power they need. Furthermore, the Indian team considered their net embodied energy, which is the initial embodied energy subtracted by the energy they generated till the end-of-life stage.
“The cost analysis has been done considering the actual cost of each building material by developing ‘Bill of Quantities’ for a building constructed conventionally in India and the structure of the EoL-PV panel integrated buildings,” added Rao.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the BIPV building has lower net embodied energy than the BAPV unit, as the latter requires additional material to fix the EoL-PV to the existing building. “The net embodied energy of the building is only because of the non-PV building elements,” note the researchers.
Utilizing Energy Payback Time (EPBT) analysis, they ascertained that payback times for the BIPV and BAPV units using 15-year-old solar modules would be 3.42 years and 5.5 years, respectively, with the annual degradation rate of the modules representing the most significant factor influencing these values. “The benefit of upcycling an EoL-PV panel from the Net Embodied Energy perspective depends on the age of the EoL-PV panel,” they noted.
The group presented its findings in the paper “Examining the use of End-of-Life (EoL) PV panels in housing and sustainability,” published in Solar Energy.
“With our approach, EoL-PV would no longer be seen as a liability to either manufacturers or users,” Rao said. “PV manufacturers may consider re-design/modify the frames with an intent to allow for such application in the end-of-life stage.”

This projected growth, if confirmed by final figures, will indicate a substantial 33% increase from 2022.
The research firm predicts a 1% year-on-year expansion in the global solar market for 2024, followed by a 5% increase in 2025. However, a potential decline of 1% is anticipated in 2026. Notably, the Asia-Pacific region, including China, is poised to dominate PV deployment until 2032.
Wood Mackenzie said that the remarkable escalation in China’s manufacturing capacity is driving new solar installations to unprecedented heights.
“Massive expansion of manufacturing capacity in China is pushing solar installations to record levels,” WoodMackenzie said. “Developers are taking advantage of plummeting polysilicon prices to rapidly expand utility-scale solar plants despite increased curtailment risks.”
The report notes China’s significant influence in the PV manufacturing landscape, and suggests that the nation might transition from exporting modules to focusing on upstream cells and wafers. The research notes that policy incentives for local PV manufacturing in the United States, Europe, and India are unlikely to significantly erode China’s market share in the near future.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/04/energy-vault-completes-25-mw-100-mwh-gravity-based-storage-tower-in-china/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 4, 2023",Energy Vault completes 25 MW/100 MWh gravity-based storage tower in China,"From pv magazine Global
There are many ways to store energy, from electrochemical batteries, to pumped hydro, to iron-air batteries, to flywheels, and more. Energy Vault has taken a new approach, building towers with electric motors that lift and lower large blocks, making use of gravity’s force to dispatch electricity when it is needed.
The company said that it is entering the first phases of commissioning for its first commercial-scale gravity energy storage system (GESS). Slated to be fully grid-interconnected in the fourth quarter of 2023, the gravity tower will mark the world’s first non-pumped hydro gravity-based storage facility. The project is located near a wind power facility outside of Shanghai in Jiangsu province, China. It is a 25 MW/100 MWh storage system that makes use of the company’s new ribbon-based lifting systems.
“While this represents a significant milestone, our work in China is just beginning given recent local announcements of multi-GW hours of gravity energy storage buildouts, including projects announced in 2022 supporting China’s ‘Zero-carbon parks’ initiative with Energy Vault’s gravity energy storage technology,” said Robert Piconi, chair and chief executive officer of Energy Vault, in reference to a plan to build five storage projects with a combined storage capacity of 2 GWh in China.
EVx, the Energy Vault system, has demonstrated round-trip efficiency of about 75% in a demonstration project installed in 2020 in Switzerland. The company said it expects that to be improved to about 80%, placing it in a similar range as pumped hydro storage and even grid-scale batteries.
Energy Vault’s design includes a multi-armed crane tower that lifts composite blocks using an electric (solar-powered) motor. The lifted blocks are stacked, which creates potential energy. As the blocks are lowered, the energy is harvested and dispatched for use. It said the tower’s design is based on the physics of pumped hydroelectric energy storage. However, as a solid “mobile mass,” the composite blocks do not lose storage capacity over time. The composite blocks can be made cheaply, said the company, using excavated soil from the construction site, waste materials like mine tailings and coal ash, and even fiberglass from decommissioned wind turbines.
The tower is controlled by computer systems and machine vision software that orchestrate the charging and discharging cycles. A range of storage durations from two to 12 hours or longer is achievable, said the company. This first commercial installation in China will use a 4-hour duration.
The first commercial installation is being built in partnership with Atlas Renewable and China Tianying. A subsidiary company of China Tianying recently announced it formed an agreement with the People’s Government of Huailai County to build an additional 100 MWh gravity energy storage project. Energy Vault said it will provide more details on this expansion during the company’s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call scheduled for Aug. 8, 2023.
“This milestone could not have been achieved without the unprecedented collaboration between the collective teams in the US and China, as the world’s two largest economies have joined forces to meaningfully address climate change. Energy Vault’s breakthrough, innovative technology is on the cusp of playing a critical role in supporting China’s clean energy transition and 30-60 decarbonization policy,” said Eric Fang, chief executive officer, Atlas Renewable.
