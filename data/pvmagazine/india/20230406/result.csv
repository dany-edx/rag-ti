The report estimates the nation would require an annual investment of $1.53 billion to $1.71 billion from 2024 through to 2041 to build a 40% renewable energy capacity of the base case electricity demand of 61,866 MW in 2041. It adds this investment requirement is less than the power sector’s fiscal year (FY) 2021-22 subsidy burden.
“Bangladesh’s electricity generation model appears unsustainable without a clear transition pathway. Therefore, policymakers should raise their renewable energy targets and reflect the same in the upcoming Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan (IEPMP),” says the report’s author Shafiqul Alam, Energy Finance Analyst, IEEFA.
“The government should also translate the renewable energy policy target into a year-wise action plan backed by a monitoring mechanism to track progress,” he adds.
The report finds that high prices of fossil fuels and resultant increased power generation costs have led to a surge in the subsidy required by the country’s power sector. For FY2021-22, the subsidy reached Bangladeshi Taka (Tk) 297 billion ($2.82 billion), nearly 152% higher than FY2020-21 and a whopping 301% higher than FY2019-20.
“Rising subsidies eventually compel the government to pass the rising cost on to the consumers. This results in a spectre of price hikes for electricity and different fuels in quick succession. Despite these price hikes, the subsidy burden of the power sector in FY2022-23 could still be higher than the previous year,” says Alam.
The report finds that accelerating the transition of the electricity sector to renewable energy can free up financial resources and enhance the country’s energy security.
“Our analysis shows that the existing power system can immediately incorporate 1.7 GW to 3.4 GW of solar during the day and, subject to the feasibility of location and availability of sufficient wind speed, 2.5 GW to 4 GW of wind power at night to reduce the use of costly furnace oil-based power generation,” says Alam.
Such a move will also help reduce the average electricity generation cost. According to the report, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from the rooftop and utility-scale solar is around Tk 5.25 ($0.05)/kWh and Tk 7.6 ($0.072)/kWh, respectively.
On the other hand, the average electricity generation cost of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) was Tk 8.84 ($0.084)/kWh during FY 2021-22. It will likely cross double digits in Tk during FY2022-23.
The report calls on the government to ring in policy changes to promote the adoption of renewable energy. For example, the report suggests the government lift the current cap on rooftop solar installation capacity by up to 70% of the sanctioned load of industrial and commercial buildings.
Similarly, it recommends waiving applicable duties on fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) walkways, imported inverters, mounting structures, and direct current (DC) cable, ranging from 15.25% to 58.6%, for rooftop solar projects.
“Such moves will send the right market signals about the government’s vision for the electricity sector’s transition,” says Alam.
Finally, the report says Bangladesh needs to have a map of funding channels, including local resources and international sources. For this, Bangladesh can draw on lessons from Indonesia and Vietnam’s Just Energy Transition plans to fund its electricity sector transition. From India’s experience, the report finds that risk mitigation measures, such as risk guarantee funds, will shield the project developers. Furthermore, competitive renewable energy procurement through auctions will help reduce renewable energy tariffs and help Bangladesh contain the rising electricity generation cost.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/06/india-to-tender-50-gw-of-renewable-energy-capacity-annually-in-next-five-years/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 6, 2023",India to tender 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for next five years,"India’s power minister R.K. Singh has said that the government has decided to invite bids for 50 GW of renewable energy capacity annually from the financial year 2023-24 till 2027-28. These annual bids for setting up renewable energy capacity connected to the inter-state transmission system will also include wind projects of at least 10 GW per year.
The plan was finalized by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) at a meeting chaired by the power minister and is in accordance with India’s target of achieving 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel (renewable energy + nuclear) sources by 2030.
India has installed a cumulative renewable energy capacity of 168.96 GW as of Feb. 28, 2023. This includes 64.38 GW of solar power, 51.79 GW hydro, 42.02 GW wind, and 10.77 GW bio power. About 82 GW is under various stages of implementation and about 41 GW is under tendering stage. 
Considering that renewable energy (RE) projects take around 18-24 months for commissioning, the bid plan will add 250 GW of renewable energy and ensure 500 GW of installed capacity by 2030. The Ministry of Power is already working on upgrading and adding the transmission system capacity for evacuating 500 GW of electricity from non-fossil fuel sources.
The minister said, “The structured bidding trajectory will provide sufficient time to the RE developers to plan their finances, develop their business plans and manage the supply chain more efficiently.”
B.S. Bhalla, Secretary, MNRE, said that the bidding trajectory will also enable the power procurers, including the distribution companies, to manage their RE procurement plans effectively. “The bid trajectory will also provide a fillip to the RE manufacturing industry in the country by indicating the demand that would be created for their equipment,” Bhalla added.
The power ministry has also declared a quarterly bid plan for FY 2023-24, which comprises bids for at least 15 GW of renewable energy capacity in each of the first and second quarters of the financial year, and at least 10 GW in each of the third and fourth quarters.
This capacity addition is over and above the RE capacities that would come up under schemes like rooftop solar and PM-KUSUM.
Presently, Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd. (SECI), NTPC, and NHPC are the government-notified renewable energy implementing agencies (REIAs) to invite bids. The ministry has decided to also notify SJVN Ltd, a public sector enterprise under the Government of India, as an REIA. 
The targeted bid capacity for FY 2023-24 would be allocated among the four REIAs. The REIAs would be permitted to bring out the bids for solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid, round-the-clock renewable power, etc with or without storage as per their assessment of the RE market or as per directions from the government.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/06/us-manufacturer-releases-new-dual-solar-optimizer/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 6, 2023",US manufacturer releases new dual solar optimizer,"From pv magazine Global
California-based Enteligent has introduced a new rapid shutdown device (RSD) with module-level power optimizers and a production monitoring system.
The Enteligent NMax Rapid Shutdown with Optimization device can be attached to a single panel, or it can be paired with two panels. The paired unit can support up to 900 W of maximum power. It offers a pass-through efficiency of 99.8% in full sun, and a maximum power consumption of 1.8 W.
Power optimizers are designed to overcome inherent limitations in PV string installations. In traditional stringed solar arrays, an entire string of panels can only produce as much as the weakest link in the string. This means that shading, soiling, or faults in the panels can severely reduce electricity generation. Power optimizers avoid this issue, allowing each individual panel to achieve its highest output without being affected by others in the array configuration. 
The RSD/optimizer dynamically switches in and out of optimization mode when required, resulting in an average of 10% higher electricity from a typical rooftop solar installation, the company said.  
The NMax model also has module-level monitoring for reporting solar generation statistics. The monitoring allows installers to validate the panels are functioning properly, helps service providers to diagnose and troubleshoot module issues, and helps homeowners to monitor performance. 
The model monitors information such as voltage and current inputs and outputs, status errors, internal temperatures, and performance modes, such as pass-through and optimization. The rapid shutdown offers real-time response management. 
Enteligent claims that the new product offers a competitive alternative to the power optimizer space, which has long been dominated by market leaders.
“Currently, over 80% of North American rooftop solar installations benefit from power optimization and panel-level monitoring, but this solution is only available from the two leading solution providers who form a market duopoly,” said Sean Burke, chief executive officer of Enteligent.“It also brings alternatives to the solar installer community, who are eager to provide new offerings to differentiate from the large regional and national dealers.”
The product is available for order on the company’s website and sells for $65 or $70 per unit, before tax. The Enteligent NMax RSD with Optimization is compliant with the NEC 2017 and 2020 and UL 1741 standards. It has a NEMA Type 6P enclosure and is SunSpec RSD certified. The company says it will be available in the third quarter, and will be sold through major industry distributors, such as Power Store and ABC Supply.
