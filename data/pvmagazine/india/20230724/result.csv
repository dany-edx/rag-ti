As the United States pursues a wholesale shift from a fossil fuel-based energy system to one defined by renewables, it is an all-hands-on-deck scenario to stay on track to meet climate goals. Some of these hands may turn out to be robotic. 
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects demand for 800,000 new solar workers by 2030 to build the projects the United States needs to stay on pace with its decarbonization plan. However, 44% of solar industry employers report that it is “very difficult” to find qualified applicants, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). 
With this challenge in mind, solar developers are increasingly exploring and implementing autonomous, robotic versions of solar installers, particularly at the utility scale. Two companies making recent moves are Terabase Energy and Sarcos Robotics Corp. 
Terabase secures funding
Terabase Energy, the developer of the Terafab automated installation system, says it recently secured $25 million in funding. The capital raise was led by Prelude Ventures, SJF Ventures, and EDP Ventures to support a commercial scale-up of its technology.
The company describes Terafab as an automated “field factory” that can double installation productivity. The installation system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7.
Terabase also opened a manufacturing facility this year in Woodland, California, and described it as “a factory to make factories.” The facility is currently manufacturing the first gigawatt Terafab assembly line, with capacity to make more than 10 GW of Terafabs per year.
Terabase said its system will double labor productivity compared to traditional utility-scale installation methods. The system offers high-throughput, 24/7 operation, and modularity to enable rapid ramp-ups and higher solar field construction speeds, significantly reducing project schedules. 
“We successfully field-tested Terafab last year, building 10 MW of a 400 MW site in Texas,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer and co-founder of Terabase. “[This] launch is the next step forward to rapid commercial scale-up.”
Terafab is pegged for commercial deployment starting in the third quarter of 2023. The company said that the automated installation system reduces the levelized cost of electricity for utility-scale solar projects. It is also scalable, built on a modular design that can be replicated and deployed quickly.
Blattner and Sarcos
Blattner Company recently partnered with Sarcos Robotics to optimize employee safety and enhance the efficiency of PV module installation for utility-scale solar projects.
“We are extremely optimistic about the use of robots for solar construction to help address the workforce shortages, productivity, and safety challenges that are currently slowing down the progress of US solar initiatives,” said Matt Hadsell, senior manager-innovation and development for Blattner.
Sarcos’ proof-of-concept robotic system consists of an autonomous working vehicle, featuring the company’s Guardian XM robotic arm and an autonomous delivery vehicle. The solution uses cameras to identify where the PV panels need to be installed. The robotic arm then autonomously lifts up the panel using a vacuum system and places it approximately where it needs to be clamped to the mounting structure.
“The arm then goes into a special mode where the person clamping the panel can easily move that panel however they need, in order to align it and attach it into the panels,” Sarcos explains in a video on its website.
The partnership will build upon the Sarcos Outdoor Autonomous Manipulation of Photovoltaic Panels (O-AMPP) project, which is funded through the support of the US Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO). The O-AMPP project started in 2021 and Sarcos expects to commercialize its solution by late 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/24/china-solar-module-prices-rebound/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JULY 24, 2023",China solar module prices rebound,"The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for modules from China, rose to $0.168/W, in a week that saw the market contend with a weakening U.S. Dollar and growing prices across China’s solar value chain.
This 5% increase – CMM’s first move up in almost six months following recent record lows according to OPIS data – comes as most contacts noted prices of around $0.17/W and pointed to how the Dollar has depreciated in preceding days.

The upstream segments in China, from polysilicon down to cells, all saw gains this week, buoying module prices. China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon in the country, increased for a second week running to CNY64.42/kg, or almost $8/kg.
Module makers in China are raising production now, concurred multiple sources, although they offered different reasons for the move in the current low-price environment.
“Demand is rising now that prices are low,” with the third and fourth quarters a peak period for module sales, one source explained. Key export markets are exhibiting a normal growth rate, a solar industry veteran said. It is smaller, hardly-covered markets of below 1 GW each that, when combined, are driving demand, the veteran added.
For major tier-1 players, increasing production has “literally no correlation with demand,” according to a source at one such company. A Tier-1 manufacturer can squeeze smaller players out of the market and gain market share if it keeps on lowering its prices, according to an experienced market observer.
Moving forward, module prices are unlikely to keep rising as too many manufacturers mean intense competition in this sector, many contacts agreed. “In order to snatch orders, companies will choose to relinquish profits,” explained one source. Echoing the sentiment, another source said there isn’t much profit left to be taken, but it would be good if prices can stabilize at least.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

Energy communities have the potential to incentivize investment in clean technologies, coordinate groups of prosumers, and reduce their energy bills. However, there are challenges on both the operational and economic levels that need to be addressed to promote different energy community models.
Researchers at the University Carlos III of Madrid have modeled the operation of an energy community with renewables and storage under different technical and economic conditions and analyzed the impact of new hydrogen production and storage technologies on community operation and risk management.
They studied how community management can be directly undertaken by an arbitrageur that, making use of an adequate price-based demand response (real-time pricing) system, serves as an intermediary with the central electricity market to coordinate different types of prosumers under risk aversion.
Their results indicated that the optimal involvement in futures and spot markets is highly conditioned by the community’s risk aversion and self-sufficiency levels. They also found that the external hydrogen market has a direct effect on the community’s internal price-tariff system, and depending on the market conditions, may worsen the utility of individual prosumers.
“We show how an arbitrageur can effectively coordinate the operation of several prosumers and manage uncertainty by participating in two-stage wholesale markets and by setting an adequate demand response program,” the researchers wrote in “Risk management of energy communities with hydrogen production and storage technologies,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
The arbitrageur hedges its risk by allocating an adequate trading amount in the futures market and by charging the prosumers with a real-time pricing mechanism when the spot market trading takes place.
“Regarding the risk trading part, we can observe that the higher the self-sufficiency level of the energy community, the lower the impact of potential unfavorable scenarios,” said the researchers.
They have also observed how high-risk aversion levels may decrease forward trading in periods with low renewable generation while increase forward trading in periods with high renewable generation. Moreover, they found that the battery storage system could effectively assist in load shifting for the prosumers, reducing their operating costs and benefiting the entire community. Meanwhile, an external hydrogen market could help prosumers to bring in additional profits, while also managing cost volatility.
