In December 2020, the Ministry of Power issued the “Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020”, setting out the rights of electricity consumers in India. Under the “Consumer as Prosumer” section, the new enactment mandates net metering for loads up to 10 kilowatts (kW) and gross metering for loads above 10 kW. 
While this central government notification is not legally valid unless the state governments implement it, many states are reluctant to allow net metering for corporate consumers and are likely to shift them to gross metering. 
A few states have already started to implement the new regulation in different forms. West Bengal has issued amendments that allow net metering for consumers with sanctioned loads of up to 5kW and gross metering for contract demand above 5 kW. Karnataka has also proposed a gross metering arrangement for rooftop solar projects over 10kW capacity at an INR 2.84/kWh tariff.
Even though the gross metering arrangement has existed for many years, it has found few takers due to issues related to the distribution companies (discoms), such as inconsistency in payments, the administrative processes, and unattractive feed-in tariffs. But with net metering limited to rooftop solar systems up to 10kW, consumer categories – barring small- to medium-sized households – will be left with an economically unattractive gross metering arrangement. 
Our analysis of various net metering and gross metering tariffs payable across leading states found gross-metered consumers are compensated for the export of solar power to the grid at rates of INR 2-4/kWh. However, current rooftop power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by Tier 1 developers have tariffs in the range of INR 3.5-4/kWh.
Developers and corporates would consider any tariff lower than the current PPA tariff unviable. And not only would corporates be reluctant to set up a rooftop solar system for just INR 2-2.5/kWh benefit, under gross metering they would not benefit commercially from using the power generated from their own system for self-consumption. 
The restrictions on net metering aim to tackle the growing concerns of loss-making discoms which could lose revenues from high-paying commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers who shift to rooftop solar. 
Notably, if India were to achieve its national rooftop solar target of 40 gigawatts (GW) by 2022, this would only contribute to about 3-4% of the country’s entire energy generation. This figure represents a minuscule share of discoms’ revenue, and at just 6-7GW presently, the rooftop solar market poses little threat to the discoms, while offering a significant opportunity to enhance distributed generation and help fund national electricity system demand growth.
What are the solutions?
The interests of all stakeholders, including consumers, developers and discoms, should be given equal weight whilst also stimulating private investment in new low cost, zero emissions distributed capacity. Potential solutions such as imposition of banking charges, a net feed-in tariff and peer-to-peer energy trading should be explored, with a balanced approach meeting different stakeholders’ interests in providing the serviceability of the rooftop solar system.
Some potential solutions that offer a middle ground for the concerned stakeholders cover the following broad approaches: unrestricting net metering albeit at a pre-fixed cost to the consumer; altering the calculation basis for prosumer compensation rates other than the prevailing net metering and gross metering models; and augmenting the energy and monetary exchange channels of the market. 
More specifically, a net feed-in mechanism may prove to be a highly plausible solution. A net-feed-in mechanism is similar to net metering except when it comes to tariff calculation. Under this arrangement, for every unit of rooftop solar power used for self-consumption, the consumer would be credited at a price equivalent to the retail supply tariff charged by the discom. Meanwhile, the surplus energy exported to the grid is compensated at a net feed-in tariff determined by the relevant State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC). 
To illustrate the impact of different models on discoms and end consumers, assume a consumer with an energy demand of 100kWh generates 30kWh from their solar rooftop plant, out of which 20kWh is self-consumed and the balance of 10kWh is exported to the grid. The retail tariff for the consumer is INR 7/kWh and the feed-in-tariff is INR 3/kWh. 
The net feed-in option could offer a solution that meets the interests of all the stakeholders, without having any major negative impact on discoms’ revenue and would still be beneficial for the end consumer compared to net metering and gross metering.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/12/modeling-the-potential-of-lead-free-perovskites/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MADHYA PRADESH",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021",Modeling the potential of lead-free perovskites,"From pv magazine International
In the fast-moving development of perovskite solar cells, lead-based materials have led the way in terms of performance, reaching efficiencies beyond 25%. And the push for the commercialization of the technology has also focused on lead-containing materials, in particular methylammonium lead-triiodide.
Lead is only present in these materials in small amounts and unlikely to cause a serious environmental issue. However, the toxicity of the material has pushed many researchers to investigate alternatives. Varying the metal component in the perovskite can also allow researchers to tune the material to different bandgaps, a desirable feature for all perovskite tandem cells.
Tin-based perovskites are the closest behind lead, but the gap is still quite large with tin perovskites so far struggling to break the 10% mark. Researchers have stated that tin’s tendency to react with oxygen makes it a more difficult material to work with. New research from the Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology in Bhopal, India, however, finds that tin-based perovskites come with plenty of potential, provided the right combination of other cell materials and optimizations can be found.
Solar simulation
Scientists at the institute modeled the performance of a 1cm² solar cell comprising methylammonium tin triiodide absorber, copper oxide hole transport layer, and titanium dioxide electron transport layer. Their simulations show that, with greatly reduced defect densities in the absorber layer, such a cell could reach as high as 28.39%.
The scientists accept that producing a material with such low defect density would not be easy, at values that have been observed experimentally the device reached 18.36%, and at only a slightly higher level it could be increased to 24.54%. The simulation also concludes that 500 nanometers is the optimal thickness for such a cell.
Full details of the various simulations carried out at the institute are found in the paper Device simulation of highly efficient eco-friendly CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite solar cell, published in Scientific Reports.
The research helps to reveal potential new pathways to optimizing tin-based perovskite solar cells, particularly in terms of ideal thickness and the materials for other cell layers. “Reducing the defect density and improving the Sn2+ stability of absorber layers are the critical issues for future research, which might be resolved by refining the device’s fabrication techniques,” the scientists conclude. “The reported CH3NH3SnI3-based PSC provides a viable path to realizing environmentally benign, low-cost, and high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.”

The IFC private-sector arm of multilateral development lender the World Bank invested in 10% of the over-subscribed financial instrument as Continuum raised $561 million (INR4,080 crore) to refinance its debts.
The developer, which provides solar and wind projects for commercial customers in India, and has been controlled by U.S. finance giant Morgan Stanley since 2012, claims to have developed 2 GW of clean power generation capacity across India to date.
Last year, pv magazine took a deep dive into the topic of green finance and what it means for solar industry players, as a part of our UP initiative. Topics included the European Green Deal, regional growth opportunities, green bonds, and the role of the carbon bubble. Browse our coverage and get involved!
In a press release issued by the IFC in New Delhi today, Isabel Chatterton – regional industry director for natural resources and infrastructure in Asia Pacific for the institution – said: “We are excited to partner with Continuum for its first green bond. IFC’s investment will help Continuum maintain sustainable power generation across India and position it to deliver projects under development as the country emerges from the pandemic. It will also help support India in its ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at a time when private capital is most needed to fund infrastructure projects and support a green, resilient economic recovery.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/12/gujarat-700-mw-award-cancellation-will-impact-solar-investment/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021",Gujarat 700 MW award cancellation will impact solar investment,"With recent solar auctions in India yielding tariffs below INR 2/kwh, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd, which is responsible for bulk purchase and bulk sale of power in the State, is looking to quash its 700 MW auction and retender the capacity. And, it has the State’s electricity regulatory commission nod for the plan.
The auction for the 700 MW project, part of a 1 GW planned at Dholera Solar Park, saw ReNew Power, Tata Power, state-run SJVN Ltd, TEQ Green Power, and Vena Energy Renewables Urja being issued Letter of Award for the capacity at prices up to INR 2.81/kWh on October 9 last year. 
However, as GUVNL discovered a lower rate of INR 1.99/kWh in another auction recently, it filed a petition with the State electricity regulator to seek retendering of the 700 MW capacity, citing that the tie-up at a higher tariff of INR 2.78-2.81/kWh for 25 years under the present bid may have substantial financial implication on the consumers at large. It also mentioned that the PPAs for 700 MW capacity out of 1000 MW are yet to be approved by the [regulatory] commission, to seek order in its favour.
GUVNL said tariff ceiling of INR 2.92 in the auction was set following developers’ cold response to tenders in the Dholera Solar Park because of challenging geographical conditions of the site, which raise the cost of project development for developers. 
However, after the Letter of Award, it was found that the capital cost and other expenses for solar projects might have significantly reduced, driving considerably lower prices of INR 1.99 in non-park based tender, GUVNL said in its petition.
The Commission passed the order in GUVNL’s favour citing the Electricity Act’s objectives that competitive procurement of electricity will ultimately benefit the consumers. It said GUVNL might approach the Commission for the adoption of tariff afresh after taking appropriate action regarding bidding.
Impact
Developers’ body National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) has termed the GUVNL move unfortunate as it hurt investments into the solar sector when the nation is nearing the 2022 deadline for its 100 MW solar target. 
Notably, the Gujarat case differs from the earlier tariff dispute in Andhra Pradesh as PPAs for the 700 MW capacity are yet to be signed. In Andhra Pradesh, the state government sought to review the high-priced wind and solar power purchase agreements and to negotiate with the developers selling electricity to state DISCOMs to reduce the prices.
Speaking to pv magazine, NSEFI chief executive officer Subrahmanyam Pulipaka said the situation still poses investment risks to PV development as developers start arranging finance after winning the capacity.
“This is a serious breach of trust and contract by Gujarat. This will have a great repercussion on investor confidence in the Indian renewable energy market. We have made due representations to the government of Gujarat and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and are hopeful that a solution will be worked out soon,” Pulipaka said.
Meanwhile, Amitesh Kumar Sinha, joint secretary at the ministry, has reportedly said the ministry is looking into the matter, and the issue will be resolved.
