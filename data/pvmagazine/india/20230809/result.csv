Given this fact, the government is planning to set up and advance the Indian Carbon Market (ICM). The central objective of this undertaking is to decarbonize the economy by pricing the emissions of GHGs and issuing carbon credit certificates.
India has an energy savings-based market mechanism, also known as an emissions trading system. But to make it a reality, economic incentives need to be given to companies. It has been a year since the Indian parliament passed the energy conservation bill 2022 meant to govern the Indian carbon credit market. Still, the situation is at a nascent stage.
A carbon credit is equivalent to offsetting or removal of one ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Each industry has a cap, a certain limit up to which a company can emit greenhouse gases. This amount is usually proportional to the historical emissions of that particular industry.
If they emit less than the permitted threshold, they are awarded Carbon Credit Credentials. On the flip side, if a company emits excess to the threshold, either they’ll have to purchase Carbon credits from the organizations that have been issued such certificates or they’ll have to pay a penalty to the government. This is also called the cap-and-trade system, or the emissions trading system (ETS).
Credits and offsets are based on the same basic unit– the equivalent of one ton of carbon emissions, also known as CO2e. When one company captures a unit of carbon from the atmosphere using some green technology (this process is called carbon sequestration), it can generate a carbon offset. Other companies can then purchase that carbon offset to reduce their carbon footprint.
The first carbon credit market was set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on climate change, but because of corruption, the market fell apart. The EU-ETS and the Korean ETS were launched in the years 2005 and 2015 respectively. The global ETS market stands at around 63 billion dollars. India’s first ETS was set up in Surat and was launched with a lot of commotion in 2019. It resulted in a reduction of pollution by 24%.
The World Bank has committed to providing $1.5 billion in financing to accelerate India’s quest for a green energy transition. The Ministry of Power has notified about the domestic framework of the carbon credit market scheme to encourage mitigation. ICM is in place to achieve the NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution) goal of reducing emission intensity by the year 2030.
The Indian government has introduced schemes and initiatives like tax exemptions and subsidies to boost renewable energy projects. The process of project approvals has also been accelerated to ensure ease of doing business in the carbon credit sector. Such measures instil confidence among domestic and foreign investors.
Carbon credits is an extension of our commitment to climate change mitigation and sustainable development, that’ll unlock a slew of economic and environmental benefits. Large-scale carbon mitigation projects have high revenue generation prospects, making India a lucrative market. ICM is currently trying to meet international norms and standards to achieve the goal of reaching net zero by the year 2070.

The fab will produce solar cells and modules based on REC’s heterojunction technology (HJT). 
Reliance plans to scale the fab’s annual capacity to 20 GW by 2026.
REC is a Norway-based HJT solar panel manufacturer, acquired by Reliance. 
Reliance aims to increase the HJT module efficiency to 26% by 2026 from the current 23% and further improve it to 28% through innovations like perovskite-tandem cell technology. The company also aims to extend the life of PV modules from 25 to 50 years.
Reliance has committed to investing INR 75,000 crore ($9 billion) in its new energy business. The investment will fund the setting up of five giga factories, including the integrated solar photovoltaic module factory, an advanced energy storage battery factory, an electrolyzer factory, a fuel cell factory, and a power electronics factory, thereby creating an integrated, end-to-end renewable energy ecosystem. 
Reliance said it is ready to double the investment to further scale up the manufacturing ecosystem upon validating the feasibility of this initiative at scale.
Reliance aims to start production of battery packs and scale up to a fully integrated 5 GWh annual cell-to-pack manufacturing facility by 2024. It plans to further scale this capacity to 50 GWh annually by 2027.

A group of researchers in Turkey has developed a new model to include flood and erosion risk to PV project siting.
The scientists claim that fixed-distance buffer zones are not sufficient to protect solar farms from flood and erosion hazards, stressing that determining a certain distance from dams currently still lacks a scientific basis.
“When we initially delved into articles related to the optimal site selection of PV plants, we couldn’t help but wonder why floods were either ignored or only briefly mentioned in most of them,” Kutay Yılmaz, corresponding author, told pv magazine. “Some previous studies suggested buffer zones ranging from 100 m to 1, 000 m to mitigate reservoir-related damages, but this approach seemed somewhat imprecise to us. Given the increasing occurrence of hydrological extremes in recent years, we felt it was necessary to adopt a more rigorous approach,” said Yilmaz.
In their study “Exploring flood and erosion risk indices for optimal solar PV site selection and assessing the influence of topographic resolution,” published in Renewable Energy, they provide a method for quantitatively assessing potential flood hazards near planned solar farms and establish six levels of flood hazards based on flow depths and flood velocities with three of the highest classes being structurally unsafe for solar PV.
For their modeling, the academics utilized the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which is a decision-making technique based on hierarchical decomposition for organizing and prioritizing decision criteria. “AHP facilitates the resolution of complex issues that involve inputs that cannot be compared with one another, typically due to the use of different measurement units,” they explained. “Through the use of AHP, a solution model that employs homogeneous factors is developed from the original problem.”
As for erosion risk, the scientists utilized the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach, which considers factors such as rainfall-erosivity, soil sensitivity to erosion, and topographic features. “Erosion is a natural hazard that poses a significant risk to the structural integrity of various installations, including PV systems,” the paper notes. “To translate the erosion results into actionable insights for site selection, the severity of erosion is categorized into different classes.”
The scientists also used digital elevation models (DEMs), which are digital cartographic datasets representing a continuous topographic elevation surface to determine the distance to roads, transmission lines, and other factors. They also utilized the DEMs to analyze the influence of topographic resolution on flood and erosion hazards, and found that a lower resolution (34-meter) may provide as good results as a higher resolution (25-meter) for PV project site selection.
“It is noteworthy that the calculation process involved in determining the distance to roads, transmission lines, and other factors requires the use of DEMs,” they explained. “The study demonstrates that low-resolution topographic data can be used for site selection, provided that the data is resampled to the resolution of land use data.”
“Those results are intriguing, as even though the weights of flood and erosion in the AHP were relatively low, their impact on site selection was substantial,” said Kutay. “As we move forward, we will also consider other global-warming related criteria like sea level rise and flash precipitation, tailoring our approach to the specific characteristics and needs of each location.”

Vena Energy says it will collaborate with China’s Suntech, battery cell producer REPT Battero, and US energy platform Powin to develop an integrated production line for solar panel and energy storage system components in Indonesia.
The companies said the 2.5 GW framework agreement covers opportunities for the expansion of Indonesia’s renewable energy supply chain, with the components slated for both domestic and export markets. They will also be used in Vena’s solar-storage project being developed at Batam in the Riau Islands.
Vena Energy, which has commissioned 114 MW of solar and onshore wind projects in Indonesia, said the Batam solar power plant will have a capacity of up to 2 GW and will be coupled with battery systems with a potential storage capacity of more than 8 GWh.
Vena Energy Chief Executive Officer Nitin Apte said clean energy generated by the plant will be exported from Batam to Singapore, which is only 30 nautical miles away, with the company having inked a deal with global energy giant Shell. Apte said the company has signed a “collaboration agreement” with Shell for the “cross-border supply” of renewable energy generated by the proposed hybrid megaproject.
Although Vena Energy has yet to provide timeline details for the Batam project, the establishment of local production lines for solar panel and energy storage system components is expected to play a key role in its delivery.
Apte said the companies aim to “significantly contribute” to the development of a productive domestic supply chain in the renewable energy sector. He said the strategy will foster industrial expansion and open export opportunities, as well as support Indonesia’s energy transition plan.
For Suntech, the agreement builds upon an already established presence in Indonesia.
The Chinese manufacturer is already operating a 500 MW capacity solar module factory in Batam. Suntech said it expects the collaboration with Vena would significantly increase that factory’s capacity.

French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne has presented a new plan to the National Council for Ecological Transition (CNTE), outlining revised renewable energy and solar deployment targets for 2030. The plan includes an increase in the energy transition budget from €30 billion ($32.8 billion) to €37 billion.
The updated targets specified in the plan aim for France to reach 48.1 GW of PV capacity by 2030 and 140 GW by 2050. To meet the 2030 goal, the plan calls for the annual deployment of 3,700 MW to 5,500 MW of new PV systems. By the end of March, France had reached 17.15 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity.
However, the proportion of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption remained stagnant at 20.7% in 2022. This makes France the sole European country that has yet to reach its targeted 23% share.
Regarding the long-term vision, the French government’s strategy entails deploying a total of 140 GW of solar capacity by the middle of the century. This goal encompasses diverse sources, with 45 GW intended to be generated from installations on wasteland, another 45 GW from facilities situated in natural, agricultural, or forested areas, 35 GW from expansive roofs, and 12 GW from residential self-consumption initiatives.
