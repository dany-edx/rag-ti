The recent decade witnessed an urgency in transitioning to net zero and pivoting to renewables for attaining so. According to Our World In Data, the cost of utility-scale solar photovoltaic electricity came down by around 89% over the last decade.
As 2023 starts, there is the potential for global solar power generation capacity to surpass 1 Terawatt, and huge multinational corporations are now undertaking numerous renewable projects. These firms frequently also proclaim astronomical development goals. In this mix of things, solar energy is positioned to take the lead in power generation as nations work to meet ambitious decarbonization goals.
Here are 3 trends that will pick up pace in 2023, leading to wider solar implementation.
Greenfield community solar solutions
Without an on-site installation, community solar projects provide customers with many of the same advantages of solar power. These provide electricity for hundreds or possibly thousands of local residences and small businesses. 
A community solar farm allows households and businesses to participate by subscribing to a percentage of the project’s monthly output. In comparison to standard utility company electricity tariffs, the solar energy generated by the community solar project is often discounted. As a result, members frequently reduce their electricity costs while simultaneously benefiting the environment. Although specifics vary depending on the solar project, many are flexible if you move within the same electric company zone and don’t require an upfront expenditure.
Members must sign a contract for a specified quantity of capacity or a share of the energy produced to participate in a community solar farm. In exchange for solar energy, users agree to pay a set price per kilowatt hour, which is often 5% to 15% less than the typical utility rate from the power company. 
The solution also has another upside for users. The community solar energy credits, which represent a portion of the solar project’s electricity generation and further lower power costs, appear as a new part of the users’ bill.
Concentrated solar power
Research suggests that concentrated solar power (CSP) technology is slated to grow 87% during 2018-23—32% faster than in the previous five-year period 2012‑17—and reach 4.3 GW in 2023. 
Concentrated solar power (CSP) is a method of producing electricity wherein natural sunlight is reflected, focused, and concentrated by the mirrors into a particular area, where it is subsequently turned to heat. The steam created from the heat is then used to power a turbine, which generates electricity. 
India, which is intent on multiplying its solar capabilities, stands at a great advantage to leverage CSP technology. In contrast to intermittent energy sources like solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power, CSP offers a reasonably constant source of electricity. The electricity produced by CSP facilities is dependable and predictable because they can store solar energy as molten salts.
The integration of CSP into current steam-based power facilities is simple. The usage of CSP systems is possible even with those that utilize fossil fuels. Due to simplified operations and maintenance, CSP plants also have lower operating costs than nuclear and hydrocarbon-based plants. Because CSP technology can retain the generated heat, the process can be done continually. 
More traceable supply chains
China has played a significant role in lowering solar PV costs globally, which has numerous advantages for the transition to sustainable energy. However, the degree of geographic concentration in global supply chains also raises possible issues that need to be addressed by the government. These supply chains will be put under additional stress as the global clean energy transitions pick up speed, but this also presents a greenfield for other nations, like India, to contribute to product diversification and resilience.
Increased efforts will be needed to diversify and extend the solar supply chains to ensure a safe transition to net-zero emissions. India needs to pin its focus on traceability, which would result in supply chains becoming faster, clearer, and decision-enabling. 
A more transparent supply chain can provide useful, on-the-ground industry data regarding technology, supply chain touchpoints, and raw materials from manufacturers by making it clear where modules and raw materials are sourced.
Deep traceability audits can also assist in tracing and confirming the origin of the materials and components used in the module. This will enable lower cost-to-market activities by allowing for the identification of loopholes in a factory’s policies or documentation. Players can uncover long-lasting competitive advantages by implementing institutional-level knowledge through the coordination of various actions.
Final thoughts
Due to the shifting demand and variable supplies, the global energy market will be in turmoil in 2023. The capacities of renewable energy technologies and energy storage, however, are also improving with the development of technology. 
All said and done, the PV component of the Indian solar energy market, which is particularly strong, is poised for expansion. Companies in the solar business must be able to compete with top-notch solutions if they want to stay on top of their game.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/03/new-electrolyzer-to-split-saltwater-into-hydrogen/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 3, 2023",New electrolyzer to split saltwater into hydrogen,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from Shenzhen University and Nanjing Tech University in China have developed a seawater electrolysis system (SES) for the direct electrolysis of seawater, without side reactions or corrosion.
The new method works via self-driven water migration to sidestep the need for a separate desalination process. The energy consumption is purportedly comparable to that of industrial alkaline electrolysis with pure water.
To develop the lab-scale electrolyzer, the scientists separated the two electrode layers with a diaphragm layer and then submerged them in a concentrated hydroxide (OH−) solution – the SDE. They placed a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane between the seawater and the SDE. They claim this design allows the biased diffusion of water vapor, but fully prevents the penetration of liquid seawater and impurity ions such as magnesium, chloride and sulfate.
“During operation, the difference in water vapor pressure between the seawater and the SDE across the membrane provides a driving force for spontaneous seawater gasification (evaporation) at the seawater side and the diffusion of water vapor through the short gas path inside the membrane to the SDE side, where it is re-liquified by absorption by the SDE,” the scientist explained.
The consumption of water in the SDE during electrolysis maintains the pressure difference across the membrane, ensuring the continuous entry of freshwater, without extra energy consumption.
“When the water migration rate equals the electrolysis rate, a new thermodynamic equilibrium is established between the seawater and the SDE, and continuous and stable water migration through a ‘liquid-gas-liquid’ mechanism is realized to provide fresh water for electrolysis,” the researchers said.
The lab-scale electrolyzer steadily produced hydrogen from seawater for more than 72 hours, with average voltages of approximately 1.95 V and 2.3 V at current densities of 250 mA cm−2 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively. After 72 hours, the concentrations of chloride, sulfate, and magnesium impurities were only 0.008%, 0.052%, and 0.089% of the original.
“Calculations show that the electricity expense of [hydrogen] production is approximately 4.6 kWh Nm-3H2 and 5.3 kWh Nm-3H2 at current densities of 250 mA cm−2 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively, which is comparable to that of industrial alkaline electrolysis with pure water,” the scientists claimed.
To prove the concept, they fabricated a scaled-up SES measuring 82 cm x 62 cm x 70.5 cm. It reportedly exhibited stable performance for more than 3,200 hours and energy consumption of approximately 5.0 kWh Nm-3H2, with no detectable increase in impurity ions.
The scientists said their method can be further developed by using other electrolytes able to absorb water vapor and conduct ions, or high-performance electrocatalysts able to operate in the SDE environment. They added that the strategy could be applied to other non-volatile liquids like highly concentrated acid, alkali and salt solutions for use in industrial wastewater treatment.
In addition, it could be used to produce hydrogen while recovering useful resources such as lithium from water. Further research is also needed for the electrolyzer’s compatibility with renewable energy sources to match that of conventional electrolyzers.
The scientists shared their findings in “A membrane-based seawater electrolyser for hydrogen generation,” which was recently published in Nature.
