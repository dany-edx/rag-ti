Installations were up 210% year-on-year, according to Mercom India Research’s newly released Mercom India Rooftop Solar Market Report Q4 and Annual 2021.
Residential and commercial segments accounted for 35% and 33% of the installed rooftop solar capacity, respectively. Industrial rooftop solar installations constituted 26%, and the remaining 6% was from the government segment.
“The rooftop solar market in India had its best year, largely due to the pent-up demand from 2020, which experienced a severe decline due to Covid-19. Certainty around net metering regulation helped along with demand from consumers across all segments – residential, commercial, and Industrial. An increase in component costs will dent demand in 2022, but we still expect positive growth this year,” said Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer of Mercom Capital Group.
According to the report, India’s cumulative rooftop solar installations surpassed 7GW as of December 31, 2021. Gujarat has the most installed rooftop solar capacity, followed by Maharashtra and Rajasthan.
Rooftop solar installations in the fourth quarter (October-December period) stood at 402MW, a 10% drop compared to 448MW added in Q3 2021. However, Q4 2021 installations were up 41% year-on-year.
Mercom analysts said installations in 2021 could have been higher if not for price increases in components, commodities, and raw materials. The hike in the goods and services tax (GST) rate also dealt a big blow to installers.
On an average, installing a rooftop solar system in 2021 cost 14.75% more than in Q4 2020 as installers increased prices to match the 12% GST hike and combat high material costs.

Large solar plants can act as rainmakers, according to a new modeling study. The report claims that utility-scale PV deployment in Saudi Arabia’s arid Red Sea coastal plain could dramatically increase rainfall.
There is growing interest in the idea of artificially increasing rainfall on the Arabian Peninsula, through techniques such as cloud seeding. There is a lot of water in the air in the region because the Red Sea loses 0.7 teratons of water each year through evaporation, which is equivalent to almost 8% of the mass of all the water vapor in the Earth’s atmosphere. On the Red Sea coast, sea breezes circulate this water over land, but it hardly ever falls as rain. Instead, it is transported south toward the equator and the central Indian Ocean.
Georgiy Stenchikov, an expert in climate and atmospheric modeling at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia, is investigating how changing surface albedo – the reflectivity of the earth – in the region could affect water transport, and whether this could change rain patterns.
Stenchikov and his colleagues performed a series of numerical simulations on a regional research model and weather forecast. They focused on three scenarios: extensive forest plantation, albedo increase, and albedo decrease.
Their simulations showed that extended afforestation and increased surface albedo along the Arabian Red Sea coastal plain could reduce rainfall. The region’s sea breezes are driven by the horizontal thermal contrast between land and sea. The warmer land and the cooler sea create a pressure gradient that pushes moist sea air toward the land. Models show that afforestation and a more reflective surface cool the land, which dampens sea breezes and reduces the movement of water vapor from the sea to the land.
According to the researchers, solar panels are known to alter the energy balance of the surface by absorbing solar energy and heating up the surface. As a result, the deployment of large PV plants could change the reflectivity of the terrain enough to alter the circulation of air on the coast.
“We find that extended afforestation and increased surface albedo are not effective in triggering rainfall over the Red Sea coastal plains,” Stenchikov said. “Conversely, decreasing surface albedo to 0.2 assuming installation of solar panels over the coastal plains, increases surface air temperature by 1-2 K, strengthens horizontal surface temperature differences between sea and land, intensifies breezes, increases water vapor mixing ratio in the boundary layer above 3 km by about 0.5 gkg−1, enhances vertical mixing within the Planetary Boundary Layer, and generates 1.5 Gt of extra rainwater, equivalent to the annual consumption of 5 million people.”
The research team claimed that this form of regional geo-engineering of the earth’s surface, coupled with advanced methods of freshwater collection and underground storage, could offer a feasible solution to mitigate the existing water crisis in arid coastal regions.
The scientists presented their findings in “Sea Breeze Geoengineering to Increase Rainfall over the Arabian Red Sea Coastal Plains,” which was recently published in the Journal of Hydrometeorology by the American Meteorological Society.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/09/australian-researchers-announce-lithium-sulfur-battery-breakthrough/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 9, 2022",Australian researchers announce lithium-sulfur battery breakthrough,"From pv magazine Global
A team of researchers from Monash University’s Faculty of Engineering have redesigned the heart of a lithium-sulfur battery, creating a new interlayer that allows for exceptionally fast lithium transfer, as well as an improvement in the performance and lifetime of the batteries.
“It’s world-leading,” said Professor Matthew Hill, deputy head of the university’s Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. “A lot of our research has been about making the battery more stable and lasting longer, so this particular discovery is really exciting.”
As the world’s switch to emissions-free electrification accelerates, lithium batteries are playing an increasingly vital role as energy storage tools to facilitate that transition. Lithium-ion batteries are the dominant technology, but Hill said lithium-sulfur batteries already offer higher energy density and reduced costs. They can store two to five times more energy per kilogram than the lithium-ion alternatives but previously, the electrodes in lithium-sulfur batteries deteriorated rapidly during the recharge process.
The research team believes it has fixed that issue by developing a battery interlayer that allows for very fast charging, as well as an improvement in the life and performance of the batteries.
“The interlayer stops polysulfides, a chemical that forms inside this type of battery, from moving across the battery; polysulfides interfere with the anode and shorten the battery life,” Hill said. “The new interlayer overcomes the slower charge and discharge rates of previous generation lithium-sulfur batteries. It means the battery can be charged and discharged hundreds of times without failing.”
Hill said the key to this latest discovery was going against the accepted norms and conventions of lithium battery construction.
“It’s ground-breaking technology, because in a regular lithium battery there’s about half-a-dozen components that make up the battery,” he said. “Most people research those, but hardly anyone has looked at changing the interlayer or separator in the middle. They tend to be fairly standardized, and until now we’ve assumed it didn’t matter too much if you changed them. Now we’re saying it actually does; we’re going against the accepted convention.”
Hill said the development shapes as a game-changer for lithium-sulfur batteries which do not rely on metals like cobalt, nickel and manganese, which are critical minerals found in lithium-ion batteries.
“These batteries are not dependent on minerals that are going to lack supply as the electrification revolution proceeds, so this is another step towards cheaper, cleaner and higher performing batteries that could be made within Australia,” he said.
This latest breakthrough, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, comes just weeks after scientists in the United States announced that they have developed a lithium-sulfur battery using a commercially available carbonate electrolyte, that retained more than 80% of its initial capacity after 4000 cycles.
The group used a vapor deposition process, which unexpectedly produced a form of sulfur that did not react with the electrolyte, overcoming one of the key challenges for this battery chemistry.
