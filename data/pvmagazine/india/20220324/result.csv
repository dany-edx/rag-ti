https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/24/nextracker-unveils-new-tracker-for-sloping-ground/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MARCH 24, 2022",Nextracker unveils new tracker for sloping ground,"From pv magazine Global
US solar tracker company Nextracker has launched its NX Horizon-XTR tracker – a new product that is claimed to be particularly suitable for large scale PV projects deployed on sloping ground.
“[The] Horizon-XTR should be used in projects of more than 20MW in which undulating terrain occupies a significant part of the site’s topography,” Arturo Herrero, Nextracker’s VP for European sales, told pv magazine. “It allows for row flexibility and ground following without the added complexity and technological risk of articulated joints,” he added.
Traditional trackers must be built in “straight-line rows,” which requires lengthening the foundation piles, grading, or a combination of both, when a solar park is located on undulating terrain. The Horizon-XTR, according to the manufacturer, is designed to follow the natural contours of the existing ground and does not need to be installed in a single plane, reducing the length of foundation piles and minimizing grading.
“Earth movements are particularly difficult since they affect the photovoltaic project by a factor of three: first, having to carry out earth movements for grading; then, by repositioning the removed earth; and lastly, by solving the inevitable erosion and hydrology problems that result from the lack of a vegetated topsoil,” the company said.
The CEO and founder of the company, Dan Shugar, explained that the new product was created at the request of customers. “An important factor in Nextracker’s DNA is listening to our customers, evaluating their requests and, where possible, integrating their suggestions in the development of our products,” he stated.

Lithium iron phosphate batteries will overhaul nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) devices in 2028 and electric vehicle (EV) battery demand will continue to outstrip supply until next year, according to analyst Wood Mackenzie.
Pointing to EV battery shortages last year, prompted by rampant demand and rising raw material costs, WoodMac consultant Jiayue Zheng today predicted the vehicle market which accounts for almost 80% of current battery demand will amount to 3TWh of device storage capacity by the end of the decade.
The US-owned analyst issued a press release today in which it predicted European battery manufacturers will overhaul their North American rivals this year as global storage companies plan to develop 300 sites with a total of more than 5.5TWh of annual manufacturing capacity by 2030.
The 90% share of global device manufacturing held by Asia-Pacific countries – and dominated by China – last year is expected to retreat to 69% this decade, according to Edinburgh-based, Verisk-owned WoodMac.
By that point, Europe will have cornered more than 20% of the world market, according to the analyst, although Chinese giant Catl – Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd – will continue to lead, provided it follows through on plans for more than 800GWh of manufacturing capacity. South Korean rival LG has stated plans for around 450GWh of factories by 2030, according to WoodMac, with Japanese brand Panasonic expected to be the world’s third largest battery maker by that point, with annual production capacity of 300GWh.
A graphic issued by WoodMac, compiled from existing factory capacity and new project announcements, had Northvolt as the biggest European battery maker in 2030, with 150GWh of production capacity, and Farasis as North America’s sole representative, with around 125GWh of lines, although the Californian company plans to reach that milestone in 2025.
The analyst said NCM batteries retained half of the global battery market last year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/24/solar-power-generation-for-ev-charging-far-more-land-efficient-than-cultivation-for-ethanol-blending/,"AGRIVOLTAICS,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 24, 2022",Solar power generation for EV charging far more land-efficient than cultivation for ethanol blending,"India’s 2025 target for 20% ethanol blending in petrol requires large increases in ethanol from sugar and grains. A new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) shows that generating solar energy to recharge electric vehicle (EV) batteries would be a far more efficient use of land than growing crops for ethanol.
The report shows that matching the distance driven by EVs recharged from one hectare of solar generation would require ethanol derived from up to 251 hectares of sugar cane or 187 hectares of maize – even accounting for losses from electricity transmission, battery charging and grid storage.
The report proposes enhancing India’s EV adoption strategy as an alternative to further promotion of blended fuel. Enhancing goals for EV uptake could meet many of the goals set out in India’s Roadmap for Ethanol Blending (cutting emissions and air pollution, supporting domestic agricultural demand, and reducing the drain on India’s foreign exchange by limiting oil imports) while using a fraction of the land, it stated.
The ethanol-blending target, also known as E20, will require a doubling of ethanol from sugar and quadrupling of ethanol from grains in just four years, with significant land-use implications, the report stated. 
While sugar surpluses may be sufficient for the component of new ethanol earmarked for sugar, up to 30,000 sq km of land may be needed for the additional ethanol planned for grains (maize). 
“This large-scale diversion of agricultural land for ethanol blending conflicts with other key priorities for food production, water use, and renewable energy adoption,” said report author and guest contributor Dr Charles Worringham.
“While the government’s promotion of ethanol blending in petrol may seem like a way to ease the burden of soaring crude oil prices, it further increases the pressure on agricultural land just as the war in Ukraine threatens the world’s grain supply. This intensifies the competition between energy and food and significantly raises the stakes for wise land use in India.
“Although Russia has an 11% share of global oil exports, 26% of wheat exports come from Russia and Ukraine, and 16% of corn exports. In the end, food trump’s energy for claims on arable land if the food supply comes under pressure.”  
Future threats to agricultural production in South Asia have been reinforced by the recent IPCC Working Group II report, underlining the critical importance of wise land use in India. 
“A re-evaluation of the ethanol-blending policy and alternatives is needed urgently given that its targets have been brought forward to 2025 from 2030,” said Worringham.
The report builds on IEEFA’s recent examination of the interplay between the energy transition and land use in India, and of India’s potential in agrivoltaics, comparing the land required to meet the ethanol-blending target with land needed for solar generation.
