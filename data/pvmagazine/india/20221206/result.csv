The company accounted for the lion’s share of 17% in the overall 1.28 GW of PV panel shipments in the third quarter (July-August-September) of 2022. (The cumulative shipment is based on the data received from 14 leading suppliers.) Nearly 85% of the modules shipped were mono PERC modules.
Waaree Energies has supplied over 5 GW of solar modules globally. Currently, it has a module manufacturing capacity of 9 GW with two state-of-the-art factories in Vapi and Surat. It aims to further expand its module capacity with the integration of a 5.4GW PV cell line by Q3 2023.

This is a considerable increase compared to 2020, when renewable energy loans accounted for 74%, according to the fifth edition of Coal vs Renewable Financial Analysis by Climate Trends and Centre for Financial Accountability (CFA).
A total of INR 33,893 crore ($4,598 million) flowed to renewable energy projects, all of which were solar and wind. The total capacity across all projects identified was 8.5 GW. Like in 2020, solar power dominated with a 83% share of renewables financing deals. Wind’s share stood at 17%.
L&T Finance replaced State Bank of India (SBI) as the biggest financier for renewable energy projects in 2021.
“The total funding for new energy projects in 2021 was 60% down from 2017 levels, and no new finance went to coal power projects in the year 2021. Financing for renewable energy projects, on the other hand, recorded a 39% year-on-year increase from 2020,” said the authors.
The study assessed 44 project finance loans across 42 coal and renewable energy ( hydroelectric, geothermal, wave, wind or solar) projects in India that reached a financial closure between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021.
“The writing is on the wall. Lending institutions are increasingly moving away from coal lending given the risks. After Federal Bank, the first commercial bank to have announced a coal exit policy, Sarvodaya Small Finance Bank has also announced an end to financing coal projects. This should signal to institutions who have either provided loans or underwriting services, or have shareholdings in coal companies to rethink their lending,” said Joe Athially, Executive Director, Centre for Financial Accountability.
L&T Finance poured INR 4,214 crore into the RE sector in 2021. Rajasthan (INR 22,187 crore) followed by Gujarat (INR 4,025 crore) were the top beneficiaries of renewable energy lending. Collectively, these two states accounted for 77% of all renewable energy loans.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/06/panasonic-unveils-vehicle-to-home-system-for-pv-powered-homes/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 6, 2022",Panasonic unveils vehicle-to-home system for PV-powered homes,"From pv magazine Global
Panasonic Electric Works, a unit of Japanese electronics giant Panasonic, has developed a vehicle-to-home system (V2H) that facilitates two-way flows between solar-powered homes and electric vehicles.
The company said it will start selling its Eneplat system in Japan from February.
“In addition, from next summer we will also sell an upgraded version of our AiSEG2 management system that links various home appliances and equipment with Eneplat,” it said.
The company said its new V2H system is the first in the industry to handle the simultaneous charging and discharging of electric vehicles and batteries. The AiSEG2 system can reportedly forecast surplus power based on daily power consumption and automatically control the charging and discharging of batteries..
It has a rated output of 6 kW and can be charged with a maximum PV power output of 9 kW. The standard lithium-ion battery has a storage capacity of 6.7 kWh.
“The V2H system has a compact size and can be installed on a floor space smaller than that of one air conditioner outdoor unit,” Panasonic explained, adding it measures 1,250 mm x 420 mm x 210 mm and weighs 60 kg. “It is easy to install, even in a limited space in a parking lot.”
It said the system can increase the self-consumption rate of homes with rooftop PV and storage from about 50% to approximately 90%. It will sell for JPY 1.76 million ($13,075).
The company also said that in February, it will reveal which electric car models will be compatible with the new V2G system.
