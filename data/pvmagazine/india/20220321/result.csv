The investment gives Ola Electric access to StoreDot’s battery technology that charges a battery from 0 to 100% in just five minutes. Ola will also have exclusive rights to manufacture batteries integrating StoreDot’s fast charge technology in India.
The investment in StoreDot is the first of several global strategic investments planned by Ola Electric as it looks to ramp up its core R&D in advanced cell chemistry and manufacturing as well as other battery technologies and new energy systems.
Ola plans to set up a cell gigafactory in India to meet the demand generated by Ola Futurefactory, a global manufacturing hub for its electric two-wheelers and has already submitted a bid under the Government’s PLI scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery Storage.
Bhavish Aggarwal, founder and chief executive officer, Ola, said: “We are committed to Mission Electric, and to accelerate the world’s transition to electric mobility, our ambition is to build a complete ecosystem for EVs here in India. The future of EVs lies in better, faster and high energy density batteries, capable of rapid charging and delivering higher range. We are increasing our investments in core cell and battery technologies, ramping up our in-house capabilities and global talent hiring, and partnering with global companies doing cutting-edge work in this field. Our partnership with StoreDot, a pioneer of extreme fast-charging battery technologies, is of strategic importance and a first of many”.
Doron Myersdorf, StoreDot chief executive officer, said,“Ola Electric’s plans to bring StoreDot’s extreme fast-charging battery technology to India and manufacture for its range of EVs will offer Indian consumers vastly superior range and charging speed performance. We are also offering our customers a clear, hype-free technology roadmap that will extend far into the future of delivering 100 miles of range in just a 2-minute charge, within a decade.”
StoreDot plans mass production of its ‘5-minute charge’ EV battery technology in a couple of years and is already working on a ‘2-minute charge’ technology to be commercialized in the next ten years. Its silicon-dominant anode technology is a significant improvement over the conventional lithium-ion batteries, as it reduces EV charging times from hours to just five minutes.

The decision was taken during a recent three-day long visit to India by Prime Minister of Japan, Kishida Fumio.
India and Japan, which target net-zero by 2070 and 2050, respectively, are tapping into low-carbon sunrise sectors and exploiting new technologies and business models to reduce carbon emissions. This offers immense potential to enhance bilateral cooperation in clean and sustainable development.
Cooperation under the new clean energy partnership will build on the work already being covered out by the two sides under the ‘India-Japan Energy Dialogue’ established in 2007 and will substantially expand the areas of collaboration for mutual benefit. It will also encourage innovations and the creation of resilient and trustworthy supply chains between India and Japan as they progress in their respective energy transition plans.
Cooperation under this partnership will cover areas like electric vehicles (EVs), storage systems including batteries, electric vehicle charging infrastructure; energy conservation in buildings and industries, development of solar energy including PV cells; wind energy; clean (including green) hydrogen and clean (including green) ammonia; carbon capture; and clean coal technology.
Both sides also agreed to cooperate in other sunrise areas of growth and business opportunities like disposal, recycling, and reclamation of useful material from batteries, solar panels, turbine blades, and electronics.
“To truly capitalize on this opportunity and take innovative technologies from laboratory to factory and, ultimately, to consumers, involvement of the private sector and public sector undertakings is necessary. Both sides may look at various initiatives to connect their business ecosystems, such as public-private workshops and business matchmaking events,” read a statement issued by the government.

Danish BIPV module manufacturer Dansk Solenergi ApS has unveiled two new solar tiles for applications in residential projects.
“The two new products are manufactured at our facility in Denmark,” the company’s chief financial officer, Martín Rivadeneira, told pv magazine. “Our production capacity is currently 40MW per year.”
One of the two products is a dark grey tile named CFR G24BCM5. It measures 1,610x400x5.5mm and has a weight of 6.5kg. It features a power output of 70W and a power conversion efficiency of 18.15%. Its open-circuit voltage is 16.09V and the short-circuit current is 5.57A.

The other 70W tile is called CFR 6725R190 and features a terracotta color and the same other characteristics as the gray tile apart from that its efficiency is slightly lower, at 16.7%.
Both products can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,000V and come with IP65 protection, a 25-year linear power output guarantee, and a 12-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius.
According to Dansk Solenergi, the new products are ideal for use on heritage buildings, new residential complexes, architectural projects, churches, and building facades. Different tile patterns and colors can be developed by the company and adapted to different customer requirements.
The tiles are based on a monocrystalline all-contact solar cell technology provided by Singapore-headquartered solar manufacturer Maxeon Solar Technologies Ltd. Each cell has an area of 155cm2 and weighs around 6.6 grams. “The company’s patented coloring technology can be adapted to any production line,” a spokesperson said at the time.
“Danish solar energy is still looking for investors and partners to start large scale production,” Rivadeneira added, reiterating a concept expressed in October.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/21/australian-electrolyzer-invention-enables-green-hydrogen-under-us1-5-kg-by-mid-2020s/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MARCH 21, 2022",Australian electrolyzer invention enables green hydrogen under US$1.5/kg by ‘mid 2020s’,"From pv magazine Global
New South Wales company Hysata is on track to commercialize the world’s most efficient electrolyzer, capable of producing green hydrogen for less than US$1.5 per kilogram by the ‘mid 2020s,’ it says. Moreover, the company believes it can reach gigawatt scale hydrogen production within a similar timeframe, saying its design is simple and suitable for mass manufacture today.
The company was born out of an electrolysis breakthrough made at the University of Wollongong, south of Sydney, around three years ago. There, researchers led by Gerry Swiegers discovered hydrogen could be produced far more efficiently using capillary-fed electrolysis.
This was verified in a paper published today in peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature, which found the capillary-fed electrolyzer could produce green hydrogen from water at 98% cell energy efficiency.

The Hysata electrolyzer consumes 40.4kWh of energy for every kilogram of hydrogen it produces. The Nature paper noted commercial electrolysis cells tend to use around 47.5kWh/kg, though Hysata CEO Paul Barrett claimed it was closer to 52.5kWh/kg. This equates to around 75% system-level efficiency, whereas the Hysata system claims a total efficiency of 95%.
This 20% efficiency boost has enabled the massive cost reduction Hysata says it’s only a few years away from making a reality. “You really collapse the project economics through that efficiency lever,” Barrett told pv magazine Australia. The academic added the company has “a simplified system which really reduces the cost quite substantially.”
Barrett didn’t want to commit publicly to the price of the Hysata electrolyzer, but said the company is in conversation with around 30 “name brand companies,” needing green hydrogen, who are “thrilled” about the economics.
“Our technology will enable hydrogen production of below US$1.50 per kilogram by the mid-2020s, meeting Australian and global cost targets much earlier than generally expected,” Barrett said.
Barrett said the company is busy building its pilot line of electrolyzers in a house near Wollongong now. “We’re building a huge test capacity, like, today,” he said. He is hoping to begin testing them in parallel within the next few months, with plans to ramp up the pilot line in 2023.
From pilot scale, the company wants to jump directly into gigafactories. To enable this, Hysata will grow its team of 20 engineers significantly this year.
“We are planning to have systems in the field by 2025,” Barrett said.
“I’ve got plates working today at the efficiency and performance that we’ve got on that paper,” he added, referring to the study in Nature, and adding: “our next thing is to basically string lots of those together, not unlike the way you’d string multiple solar modules together. We’ll connect them in series and that becomes our stack.”
The company “certainly” plans to keep its manufacturing in Australia, Barrett said, possibly remaining in Wollongong – which is right next door to the proposed Port Kembla hydrogen hub.
“This can be an era defining company for Australia,” the CEO said, noting that Australia imports the vast majority of its renewables equipment today, such as solar panels and wind turbines. “There’s a real opportunity to build sovereign manufacturing capacity here in Australia and export it to the world,” he added.
This very much aligns with Matt Kean’s plan, the state’s environment and energy minister as well as treasurer. In February, he announced AU$250 million (US$180 million) in funding to boost locally manufactured renewable energy content and a further AU$300 million (US$216 million) to build a renewables-powered manufacturing base including renewable hydrogen.
The company is the “first in the world” to commercialize a capillary-fed electrolyzer, according to Barrett. To date, he says, electrolyzer technology has been “too inefficient and too complex” to make green hydrogen attractive. Hindering efficiency in electrolyzer cells is resistance, which has typically come from bubbles which are non-conducting, and mask electrodes.
 
Barrett said the research team at the University of Wollongong “basically looked at that problem with a blank sheet of paper and really tried to understand where all the resistance is, inside the cell.” That exercise led to the invention of capillary-fed electrolysis which eliminates these bubbles and boosts efficiency.
This leads to a “double whammy benefit on the economics,” Barrett says, because hydrogen projects would need less renewables to get the same hydrogen output, saving on capital outlays while also only needing to purchase a smaller electrolyzer.
The company’s electrolyzer is fives times smaller than a traditional alkaline electrolyzer, Barrett says, and contains 20 times less liquid. It fits inside a six-meter shipping container and can be moved by forklift for easy transportation, he added. “So we’ve got a drastically simplified balance of plan.”
Hysata’s electrolyzer cell frame is made using a scalable, low cost and mass manufacturing technique – making the product nimble so it can get to market as quickly as possible.
“We’re one of the few, if not the only, electrolyzer from time zero, to be mass manufacturable,” Barrett said.

Hysata, a start-up, only officially launched in June last year. It kicked off with AU$5 million (US$3.6 million) in seed funding from the UK-based IP Group, with AU$750,000 (US$539,000) from the government-owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
Swieger, who led the University of Wollongong ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science research, has since become Hysata’s chief technology officer.
