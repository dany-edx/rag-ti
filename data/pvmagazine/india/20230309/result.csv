The capacity is tendered under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s grid-connected rooftop solar program phase II, wherein central financial assistance (CFA) is provided for the installation of rooftop solar projects in residential buildings.
The consumers under this scheme shall be free to install their projects from any empanelled vendors provided the project is installed/commissioned as per the MNRE Phase-II Guidelines and subsequent amendments.
The vendors’ scope of work includes design, supply, erection, testing, commissioning, and five years of comprehensive operation and maintenance for the grid-interactive rooftop solar PV power plants. They shall also make necessary arrangements for evacuation and injection of surplus power to the grid at the interconnection points as agreed with the Discoms.
“For common facilities in group housing societies/residential welfare associations, the allowed rooftop solar system capacity shall be limited up to 500 kWp (@ 10 kWp per house), with the upper limit being inclusive of individual rooftop plants already installed by individual residents in that GHS/RWA at the time of installation,” states the tender document.

The hybrid plant benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) at INR 3.24 ($0.039)/kWh.
With the latest commissioning, AGEL’s operating wind-solar hybrid portfolio has reached 2,140 MW, continuing to be the largest in the world. The company’s overall operating renewable portfolio has reached 8,024 MW, the largest in India.
The new hybrid power plant consists of 600 MW solar and 510 MW wind plants. It deploys advanced renewable technologies like bifacial solar PV modules and horizontal single-axis trackers (HSAT) systems to enable maximum electricity generation from solar energy, stated AGEL.
The plant is co-located and is designed to deliver a capacity utilization factor (CUF) of a minimum 50%, the highest for any renewable project in India. It is housed under AGEL’s 100% subsidiary, Adani Hybrid Energy Jaisalmer Four Ltd.
Earlier in May 2022, AGEL had operationalized India’s first hybrid power plant of 390 MW. This was followed by the commissioning of the world’s largest co-located hybrid power plant of 600 MW in September 2022 and the third hybrid power plant of 450 MW in December 2022. All three of these hybrid energy generation assets are located in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/09/india-ratings-maintains-stable-outlook-for-solar-projects/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 9, 2023",India Ratings maintains stable outlook for solar projects,"India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has maintained a Stable outlook for the Indian solar sector in FY2023-24 while maintaining a Negative outlook on wind power projects. It has revised the rating outlook for thermal assets to ‘Positive’ from ‘Stable.’
India added 14 GW of solar and 1.8 GW of wind power generation capacity in 2022, according to analysts.
Solar projects continue to have stable operations, adequate debt service coverage, and comfortable internal liquidity. The fall in module prices over the six months ended February 2023 is positive for under-construction projects; however, timely project completion is critical, stated the analysts.
Wind projects continue to be marred by generation variability. “Elimination of reverse auction is likely to allow developers bid with a better risk-return profile and improve the capacity addition in the medium term,” according to the analysts.
The rating agency expects counterparties such as Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd, NTPC Ltd, and Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd to continue making timely tariff payments.
“Projects selling directly to distribution companies (discoms) have had an elongated receivable cycle across counterparties; however subsequent to the implementation of the LPS [late payment surcharge] rules 2022, the overall receivables across the energy sector are likely to have reduced. Internal liquidity compared to the strength and diversification of counterparties is a key rating factor for all generation assets,” Ind-Ra stated.
Ind-Ra revised the outlook for thermal power projects to Positive based on an improvement in the electricity demand which could increase the plant load factor to above 65%, better visibility of coal cost pass-through, and adequate liquidity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/09/topcon-shingle-solar-cell-achieves-22-0-efficiency-via-thermal-laser-separation/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 9, 2023",TOPCon shingle solar cell achieves 22.0% efficiency via thermal laser separation,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and US-based solar panel maker Solaria have developed a solar cell based on TOPCon technology and shingle design.
“To our best knowledge, this is the first publication dealing with TOPCon shingle solar cells separated by thermal laser separation (TLS) and edge-passivated by the passivated edge technology (PET),” researcher Elmar Lohmüller told pv magazine. “The PET is a proprietary development of Fraunhofer ISE, to address the cutting losses in today‘s half-cut, third-cut, or shingle solar cells, by simple, high-throughput post-processing of singulated cells.”
Fraunhofer ISE filed a patent application back in 2018 and is offering a sampling of the technology for interested partners. Solaria is one of the first industry partners testing post-metallization PET on TOPCon shingle solar cells.
“The PET approach could address a key need of the industry – to mitigate efficiency losses incurred by cell cutting and do so in a cost-effective way,” Ricky Dunbar, a Solaria spokesperson, told pv magazine. “Our cooperation with Fraunhofer ISE has shown that PET can effectively reduce these losses for TOPCon shingle cells at a promising throughput.”
The proposed manufacturing process uses thermal laser separation (TLS) instead of conventional laser scribing and mechanical cleaving (LSMC) for cell singulation. TLS only requires a short initial laser scribe with a cleave laser and water-air aerosol jet to create a starting crack that can then propagate through the wafer in any direction.
“This results in cuts with very smooth edge surfaces,” the scientists explained, noting that TLS was performed via the microDICE laser system developed by Germany’s 3D-Micromac.
“The TLS process optimized in this work yields up to 0.2% more efficient shingle cells directly after separation in comparison with shingle cells that have been singulated by LSMC,” the academics said, noting that the cell based on TLS achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.0% “It is shown that TLS can be performed such that no degradation of the surface passivation quality occurs in the vicinity to the dividing line.”
The research team introduced its findings in “TOPCon shingle solar cells: Thermal laser separation and passivated edge technology,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“As we are still in the development phase of an industrial PET tool, valid data for yield ratios of the two approaches for a reliable cost calculation is not sufficiently available, yet,” Lohmüller said. “Nevertheless, PET will add a process step, which to our current knowledge is easily scalable to current throughput demands, thus the demonstrated gain in efficiency has substantial potential to overcompensate the additional cost.”
