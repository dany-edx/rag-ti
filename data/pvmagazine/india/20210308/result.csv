The report said the electric rickshaw market size would, at this rate, touch $1,394.2 million by 2025 from $786.2 million in 2019. Among various regions, the State of Tripura would witness the fastest growth in e-rickshaw sales, whereas Uttar Pradesh would emerge as the largest revenue contributor to the industry.
According to the report, currently, e-rickshaws with 1,000–1,500W motors are the most popular. Solar-powered variants are gaining rapid popularity.
However, the market for electric rickshaws with >1500W motor would grow the fastest annually at 36.7% in the future. Their sales will rise fast as more organized automakers launch better-quality products with more-powerful motors, stated the report.
The report expects passenger carriers to continue to hold a larger share in the Indian electric rickshaw market in the years to come. “Due to the increasing urban population driving the demand for cost-effective first- and last-mile transportation, the number of passenger carrier e-rickshaws is burgeoning on the country’s roads,” it said.
The market, currently dominated by unorganized players, would see organized players gaining a larger share with their sales rising fast.  
The report cites state governments passing laws to allow such vehicles’ operation and the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a severe blow for unorganized players.

Spain-based CITCEA, a technology transfer center within the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), has developed a new power electronic technology for the management of surplus power in PV installations, which is claimed to be able to combine different storage technologies in a single electronic-based board interface.
The power electronic device is designed to integrate a heterogeneous grouping of storage systems for providing power quality and ancillary services within low voltage grids. It can be connected to the electricity grid and allow the management of the energy generated by a PV system through a set of converters and batteries, which make consumption and injection of surplus solar power into the network more efficient. The technology is said to address maintainability, flexibility, efficiency, fault tolerance, scalability, reliability and controllability to properly operate on the network.
The device is based on algorithms for the prediction of the daily demand and generation of energy and the subsequent planning of the charging and discharging of the batteries. It is said to be able to analyze data that makes it possible to anticipate congestion issues in the network or the variations in voltage that can affect the quality of the power supply for the PV system operator.
“This technology will facilitate the local consumption of renewable energy generation and will avoid the transport of the generated electricity away from consumption, contributing to a much more efficient energy system,” CITCEA said. “The performance of this device will be supported by a better observation of the network and artificial intelligence algorithms that, based on this information, will allow, on the one hand, to predict the demand and generation of energy at critical points of the network and, on the other hand, to optimally operate the grid and the energy flows with different time horizons.”

The device was developed through the EU-funded 3-year project Renewable penetration levered by Efficient Low Voltage Distribution grids (RESOLVD), which was launched in 2017.  It was coordinated by Spain’s Control Engineering and Intelligent Systems (eXiT) and includes, along with the CITCEA, the Institute of Informatics and Applications of the University of Girona (UdG), Spanish power distributor Estonell Distribución, the Joanneum Research research center in Austria, Greek telecommunications company Intracom Telecom, Slovenian technology company Comsensus, and the Smart Innovation Norway research center. 
The project was financed with funds from the European Commission, within the framework of the Horizon 2020 program.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/08/minigrid-company-husk-power-doubled-revenues-in-2020/,"FINANCE,MINIGRID,OFF-GRID SOLAR,AFRICA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 8, 2021",Mini-grid company Husk Power doubled revenues in 2020,"Husk Power Systems, a Bihar-based company operating renewable energy-powered mini-grids in Asia and Africa, has announced that it registered a 90% growth in revenue in 2020 over the previous year, while more than quadrupling its commercial business customers.
Husk Power ended 2020 with more than 5,000 small business customers, a 300% growth over 2019. The company expects that number to surpass 12,500 over the next 12 months and record a 125% revenue growth in 2021.
“In the face of a pandemic and a global economic downturn, Husk Power and its customers not only weathered these challenging times but saw record growth that positions the company for an even stronger year ahead,” said CEO Manoj Sinha. “In 2021, we are forecasting 125% revenue growth and expect to become the first mini-grid company to become operationally profitable on an annual basis.”
Sinha announced that Husk would be raising $50 million in equity and $60 million in debt this year to continue annual growth of 100% in 2022 and beyond.
Husk Power operates more than 100 mini-grids in India, Nigeria, and Tanzania, and is gearing for a ten-fold jump in its assets base to 1000. 
The minigrids have an average capacity of 50 kW, which can power multiple productive loads for a range of small businesses, including retail shops, factories, agricultural processing and cold storage, water filtration and schools, and households.
Board Chairman Brad Mattson stated: “Husk proved in 2020 that it could prosper no matter how negative the business environment. It has already grown its asset base by 10x in just over two years and is ready to scale another 10x to 1,000 mini-grids.” 
India plans
In India, Husk Power mini-grids have a capacity of over 5 MW and are located in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The company is investing heavily in the Indian market and sees huge growth potential, especially around interconnecting the mini-grids to the national grid to improve last-mile power distribution and service. 
Husk is currently developing a pilot with the national grid in Nigeria. Nigeria’s Electricity Regulatory Commission Mini-Grid Regulation 2016 provides a blueprint in the event the main grid reaches isolated mini-grids. Husk aims to use the Nigerian policy blueprint to prove their technical capabilities and demonstrate the ability for the two grid systems to buy and sell power. 
Based on the results, Husk plans to build upon the pilot projects and develop strategic partnerships with India’s Discoms that would allow Husk to integrate with large utilities.
