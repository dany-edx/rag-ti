The funding comprises a direct ADB loan of up to $58 million and a $10 million concessional loan by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia (CFPS). From ADB’s loan, 80% will be earmarked for lending to women borrowers or co-borrowers and 20% allocated to financing mortgages for green-certified homes. The CFPS loan will support IIFL’s green housing portfolio, specifically towards incentivizing developers to adopt green certification standards in building affordable housing.
“By leveraging IIFL’s focus on financial inclusion and CPFS’ leadership on climate-resilient housing, ADB can help low-income communities to manage the impacts of climate change,” said ADB Director General for Private Sector Operations Suzanne Gaboury. “We are pleased to support IIFL in demonstrating to the construction industry that you can build both affordable and green-certified housing for low-income households.”
Women often find it difficult to obtain mortgage loans in India. A 2017 study showed that only 5% of women have borrowed from a formal financial institution and only 3% have an outstanding housing loan. Lack of property ownership contributes to the low social status of women, their vulnerability to poverty, and low bargaining power within households.
“Funding from ADB will help us to improve the penetration of green affordable housing in deeper markets of India and fulfill the dreams of many Indian families to own their own homes. We are glad to be partnering with ADB in our growth journey,” said IIFL CEO and Executive Director Monu Ratra.
Green-certified buildings can be more expensive to build, which has limited their uptake among homebuyers and developers in India. The market is also constrained by a lack of awareness that building green homes can result in long-term savings of up to 35%, and are less vulnerable to climate-related risks.
IIFL has 125 branches across 18 states. With a focus on India’s lower income groups and economically weaker sections, IIFL can service almost all of its customers digitally.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/21/icra-expects-strong-demand-outlook-for-domestic-solar-manufacturers/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 21, 2022",ICRA expects strong demand outlook for domestic solar manufacturers,"Domestic solar manufacturers will continue to see strong demand for their modules aided by several policy measures over the medium term. However, it needs to be seen whether they will be able to meet all of this demand from the utility and non-utility segment, according to ICRA Ratings, which adds quality of these modules also remains monitorable.
Responding to government policies aimed to create a demand for domestic modules, many of the domestic OEMs have announced sizeable capital expenditure to augment their cell and module capacity. This includes the capex for integrated facilities under the PLI scheme by the winning bidders; the recent increase in the PLI scheme outlay for solar modules—to INR 240 billion from INR 45 billion earlier—is expected to support the setting up of additional cell and module manufacturing capacity of up to 40 GW.
Speaking about policy support, GirishKumar Kadam, senior vice president and co-group head, Corporate Rating ICRA, said, “The policy focus by the Government of India (GoI) in the renewable energy (RE) sector remains strong as also evident from the policy target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by CY 2030 as well as policy direction in the energy transition with net-zero emission target by 2070. In this context, capacity addition in solar energy segment within the RE is expected to remain significant with about 65-70% share by FY 2030, given the relatively lower execution challenges in the solar segment.”
“Further, the GoI has a solid policy focus to encourage the domestic manufacturing for photovoltaic (PV) modules through various policy measures announced in last two-three year period, such as notification of approved list of module manufacturers (ALMM) w.e.f. April 2021, imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported cells and modules w.e.f. April 2022, award of manufacturing-linked PPAs for an aggregate capacity of 12 GW, ongoing implementation of production linked incentive (PLI) scheme as well as that of various central schemes announced earlier, requiring the use of domestic modules. Further, ALMM list has only domestic solar OEMs and there remains an uncertainty for inclusion of foreign solar OEMs as of now.”
However, timely commissioning and ramp-up of on-going Capex in module manufacturing value chain remains critical in the near to medium term as domestic manufacturers relying on imported cells remain exposed to price fluctuations.
PV module prices have remained elevated over the last 10-12 months, owing to polysilicon demand-supply imbalances as well as supply chain disruptions in China. Given that the import dependency for the OEMs is expected to continue for sourcing of key components, the pricing behavior for polysilicon and cells in China thus remains a key monitorable, going forward.
Commenting further, Vikram V., vice president & sector head – Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said, “OEMs based on imported cells remain exposed to volatility in cell/module price levels. Based on an imported module price level of 27 cents/watt for mono PERC modules and cell price at 15 cents/watt, the cost of modules from such domestic OEMs is expected to be lower by 10-11% post-April 2022, assuming the applicable BCD on imported cells/modules. However, the extent of discount will reduce, if the prices of imported cells and modules reduce from the prevailing level.”
For OEMs having integrated facilities, the scale of operations, the pace of technology adoption with the emerging trends in key markets such as in China and Europe as well as module price movement remain critical factors to ensure viability, he added.

US-based start-up mPower Technology, a spin-off of the Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories, has developed a flexible monocrystalline silicon solar module technology, called DragonScales, which it claims can be used for both space and terrestrial applications.
“Our main business is expected to be in the space solar cell segment,” the company’s president and CEO, Kevin Hell , told pv magazine. “But we are also planning to enter the building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) business, as our products could be easily used for residential and commercial projects, and to produce solar modules for soldier portable and shelter power applications.”
The fully encapsulated modules are fabricated with conventional back contact silicon solar cells with a thickness of 150 um or less and are assembled using existing high-volume fabrication processes from the microelectronics industry. “Our pilot line is a conventional machine for the production of semiconductors that has been adapted to the manufacturing of our flexible solar modules,” mPower CTO Murat Okandan stated. “The panels can be customized according to the customers’ needs and adapted to different applications.”
According to the manufacturer, its production equipment can produce very high volumes of modules and allow rapid scaling as needed by the customers and applications for space.
The back-contact solar panels consist of micro-singulated silicon dies that are “hyper-interconnected” in series or in parallel. According to the company, the design allows customization of its “super modules” to any shape, thickness, voltage, size, material stack, and other design considerations to meet application-specific requirements at the lowest cost.
The modules feature efficiencies ranging from 22 to 23% and temperature coefficients spanning from 0.4 to 0.27 percent per degree Celsius, depending on the size or applications. Since the interconnect design is very customizable, it is possible to provide high voltage/low current or other desired array configuration details to fit the desired physical footprint and achieve the highest possible power delivery, the company stated.  This is also claimed to bring in a very high level of innate electrical and mechanical resilience at the system level.
This approach, according to the manufacturer, leverages the massive scale and high power of the terrestrial silicon PV market to minimize cost, while eliminating the challenging, hard-to-scale models of custom cell manufacturing.
“Our products are more expensive than conventional PV panels, but they are three to five times less expensive than III-V modules based on gallium arsenide for applications in space,” Hell further explained. “They are also significantly lighter since they are flexible and thus require less structural materials.”
At the beginning of February, mPower raised $10 million in a Series B financing round. The funds will be used to scale up the company’s manufacturing facility and integration and test facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and to further develop the cell technology.
The production line currently has a capacity of 100 kW and the company plans to expand it to 1.5 MW.  The yearly volume is projected to reach around 50 MW by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/21/novel-ibc-solar-cell-architecture-based-on-crystal-photonics-shows-efficiency-potential-of-29-1/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 21, 2022",Novel IBC solar cell architecture based on crystal photonics shows efficiency potential of 29.1%,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers in Germany have conducted a series of numerical simulations to assess how photonic crystals may increase the efficiency of interdigitated back-contact solar cells based on a passivating electron-selective n+-type polysilicon on oxide (POLO) junction at the minus contact of the cell and a hole-selective p+-type POLO junction at the plus contact.
Photonic crystals are periodic dielectric structures that are ideal for light-harvesting applications in photovoltaics, as they have a bandgap that forbids propagation of a certain frequency range of light, which increases the photon path length, especially for high wavelengths.
“The ‘practical efficiency limit’ of silicon single-junction cells with poly-Si on oxide contacts for both polarities – best placed on the rear side to minimize shading and parasitic absorption – is over 27%,” Robby Peibst, the research project’s corresponding author, told pv magazine. “The improved light trapping promised by photonic crystals could enable even higher efficiencies.”
The simulated cell was assumed to rely on a standard wafer thickness of 150 μm and the scientists found it may achieve an efficiency of over 28% under normal incident light. “Since Maxwell equations predict the formation of optical modes parallel to the surface, the optics are rather independent of the wafer thickness,” Peibst explained. “The latter could therefore be reduced strongly, which also reduces extrinsic and intrinsic recombination losses in the wafer.”
The German group also investigated how improving the hydrogenation process of the POLO junctions by a rear-side dielectric layer stack made of aluminum oxide and silicon nitride (Al2O3/SiNx/Al2O3) may further raise the device’s efficiency for the same standard thickness. This configuration was found to have the potential to reach an efficiency of up to 29.1%. “Even without photon crystals, an efficiency potential of 27.8% is predicted for the improved surface passivation quality on 150 μm-thick wafers,” the scientists stated.
“The transfer of the concept of photonic crystals into PV is at a very early stage,” Peibst explained. Although there is no doubt of the Maxwell equations and photonic crystals have already been commercialized for other applications, their benefit has not been demonstrated so far at the solar cell level, he added. “We are now planning to investigate concerns like angular dependency and the effect of spectral variations experimentally.”
According to him, another important step would be the development of an industrially feasible and cheap method for the fabrication of photonic crystals even on saw-damaged etched surfaces. “So far, photonic crystals are fabricated by various lithography techniques,” he stated. “However, their targeted size for application on the front side of solar cells of around 1-3µm is also realizable with other techniques that can be considered cheap enough for PV.”
As for the cost of solar cells based on photonic crystals, it would be the same as for high-efficiency premium cells. “The costs are so far higher than for standard PERC modules, but they can probably come down further by scaling effects, and in particular by emerging inexpensive metallization schemes such as non-alloying Al pastes for contacting of the poly-Si,” Peibst added, noting that these cells may find ideal applications in rooftop solar and vehicle-integrated photovoltaics.
The solar cell was introduced in the study Towards 28 %-efficient Si single-junction solar cells with better passivating POLO junctions and photonic crystals, published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The research group includes scientists from the Leibniz Universität Hannover and the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH).
