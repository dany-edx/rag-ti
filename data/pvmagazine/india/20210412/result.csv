Under the partnership, SwitchON Foundation shall set up a first loss default guarantee fund through which Punjab National Bank will be financing solar pumps.
“This partnership is extremely important in creating an ecosystem for encouraging large-scale deployment of solar pumps. It is perhaps the first-of-its-kind agreement between a private-not-for profit organization with a leading public sector bank to set up a Guarantee Fund, which is otherwise usually set up by Governments,” said Vinay Jaju, Managing Director of SwitchON Foundation.
Guarantee funds are set up to improve project bankability and reduce lender’s risk perception. The Ministry of MSME has set up such arrangements to increase lending for small business. 
In this unique arrangement, the guarantee fund is being set up to facilitate the financing of solar pumps for unbankable small and marginal farmers without having to oﬀer any collateral.
Because of the guarantee fund’s comfort, PNB is oﬀering a longer than usual payback period of seven years. It comes with a zero down payment for up to INR 1.6 lakh of loan for small and marginal farmers.
Previously, SwitchON partnered with RBL and Axis Bank to sanction loans for over 100 solar pumps, but the foundation said it is the first time a Nationalized Bank has come forward for the financial partnership. There have been zero non-performing assets to date, and farmers have seen a 1.6 times rise in income after adopting solar pumps. 
Stephanie Jones of Good Energies Foundation, one of the key funders of the guarantee fund, said that “We are confident that solar pumps can improve farm production and all participating farmers will easily pay back these loans. A default guarantee is a great tool for helping more farmers access bank loans while recognizing the bank’s need to gain first-hand experience with new technologies.”
SwitchON Foundation will conduct farmer sensitization, awareness drives, and farmer due diligence before finalizing each loan’s disbursal.

Contractors have until April 30 to bid for the capacity at GETCO substations.
4×20 MW
GSECL seeks EPC contractors as it intends to bid for 4×50 MW capacity in Dholera Solar park for purchase of power.
The 4×50 MW is part of the 700 MW PV capacity tendered by GUVNL in March.
To be eligible, the bidder should have designed, supplied, and erected/supervised, and commissioned a cumulative grid-connected solar capacity equivalent to a minimum 40% of the total bid capacity in MW. Out of this capacity, at least one plant should have been of 10 MW AC.

The transformer was installed at the BKC receiving station in active collaboration with Hitachi ABB Power Grids and Cargill.
The transformer uses natural ester with a high fire point (350 degrees Celsius), which eliminates fire risk. The fluid is made from a carbon-neutral renewable resource, is biodegradable, non-toxic and nonhazardous in soil and water. It also allows designing the transformer with increased capacity and reduced carbon footprint, making it an ideal solution for congested cities like Mumbai instead of conventional mineral oil-filled transformers.
Tata Power Transmission caters to around 70% of Mumbai’s electricity requirements. It has a network of about 1,200 circuit transmission lines in and around Mumbai with a transformation capacity of about 10,500 MVA. The company is committed to implementing cutting-edge solutions to cater to the increasing power demand in the city where space is a constraint.
Tata Power, together with its subsidiaries & jointly controlled entities, has an installed/ managed capacity of 12,772 MW. It has a presence across the entire power value chain—from the generation of renewable as well as conventional power, including hydro and thermal energy, to transmission & distribution, trading and coal & freight logistics. Renewable energy assets in solar and wind, with nearly 2.6 GW, account for 31% of the company’s portfolio.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/12/nickel-salen-for-a-battery-that-charges-in-10-seconds/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"APRIL 12, 2021",Nickel-salen for a battery that charges in 10 seconds,"From pv magazine International
For researchers, there is no shortage of promising materials for new energy storage applications. Narrowing down this list of possibilities, to find combinations of materials that overcomes problems with today’s battery technologies without creating new ones, is where it gets difficult.
Since 2016, a group of scientists at Russia’s St. Petersburg University has investigated a group of materials known as redox-active nitroxyl-containing polymers. These materials are known to have high energy density and a fast redox potential – bringing the potential for fast-charging batteries. They are held back, however, by low conductivity.
As a way to overcome this, the group set out to synthesize a polymer from a nickel-salen complex, which acts as a molecular wire to which nitroxyl “pendants” are attached. “We came up with the concept of this material in 2016. When studying the charge transport mechanism in this class of compounds, we discovered that there are two key directions of development,” explained Oleg Levin, professor of electrochemistry at St. Petersburg University. “Firstly, these compounds can be used as a protective layer to cover the main conductor cable of the battery, which would be otherwise made of traditional lithium-ion battery materials. And secondly, they can be used as an active component of electrochemical energy storage materials,”
The group first simulated the characteristics of different materials in the group, to understand the best combinations. Then they began to synthesize the compounds, eventually finding one that was stable and efficient enough to work with, and began testing its storage capabilities. Results of this testing are found in the paper The Fast and the Capacious: A [Ni(Salen)]‐TEMPO Redox‐Conducting Polymer for Organic Batteries, published in Batteries and Supercaps.
“NiSalen simultaneously serves as a charge collector for nitroxyl pendants and supports the redox capacity of the material,” states the group in the paper. “This novel polymer exhibits a specific capacity of up to 91.5 mAh g−1, retaining 87 % of its theoretical capacity at 800 C and more than 30 % at as high as 3000 C (66 % capacity retention after 2000 cycles).”
Levin further notes that batteries incorporating the polymer can charge up to ten times faster than today’s lithium-ion batteries, and overcome many more of the problems with this technology. The next step for the researchers is to work on improving the capacity, which they estimate is currently 30 to 40% below commercial lithium-ion.
“The new battery is capable of operating at low temperatures and will be an excellent option where fast charging is crucial. It is safe to use – there is nothing that may pose a combustion hazard, unlike the cobalt-based batteries that are widespread today,” states Levin. “It also contains significantly less metals that can cause environmental harm. Nickel is present in our polymer in a small amount, but there is much less of it than in lithium-ion batteries.”
