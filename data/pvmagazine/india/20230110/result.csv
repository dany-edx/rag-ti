The company’s software measures live data from solar plants to predict failures and enable proactive maintenance. It also makes assets climate-resilient with its climate dynamics-based forecasting tool.
SmartHelio is a global horizontal irradiance and wind forecasting tool that uses climate dynamics and urbanization factors to predict resource availability and assess climate risk for sustainable energy infrastructure development. The company claims its tool has a high accuracy of 98.5% on tested locations in Europe and India.
“We ran our climate risk assessment system on a PV asset in Europe and we detected that due to higher irradiation forecasted, our clients could gain $7.5 million per year for a 500 MWp plant with a more appropriate design,” said CEO Govinda Upadhayay.
The predictive analytics company automatically detects potential component failures such as inverter failures, string disconnection, and root causes of underperformance (tracker issues, early degradation, etc) to accordingly provide proactive maintenance recommendations to users through its platform, Autopilot. Its clients include Acciona (Spain), Schneider (France and Spain), EDP (USA and Portugal), ESB (Ireland), Verbund (Austria), and Adani (India).
“We understood that the challenge of the industry was not only to provide speed in fault detection but also to provide security and resilience to our clients’ infrastructures and data. As a result, the focus put by the company has been on offering a platform that can easily be integrated into any infrastructure,” said Upadhayay.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/10/centrotherms-order-book-exceeds-10-gw-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 10, 2023",Centrotherm’s order book exceeds 10 GW in India ,"Germany’s Centrotherm said this week it has received orders for over 10 GW of solar cell production line equipment from India. The orders have been placed by six different customers. 
“The spectrum of order includes existing customers with repeat orders, customers that are new to solar PV manufacturing, and customers that plan vertical integration by adding cell manufacturing to augment their module line,” it said.
 The order book includes the production solutions and services for a 4 GW PERC solar cell line, scheduled for delivery in 2023. Centrotherm international said this major order, with a value of 57 million euros, will contribute to the high utilization of its production capacities in Blaubeuren and Kunshan/China.  
Centrotherm’s order book swelled as several companies in India have embarked on cell manufacturing with conducive policy support from the government. Production-linked incentives for solar PV manufacturing, imposition of basic customs duty on solar cells and modules, and mandate of local procurement for Government schemes have together provided an impetus for local manufacturing in India. The demand for locally produced solar PV cells and modules is expected to grow many folds over the next several years to meet the 500 GW renewable target by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/10/iesa-launching-india-electric-mobility-council/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,EV BATTERIES,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 10, 2023",IESA launching India Electric Mobility Council,"Industry body India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) is launching a dedicated platform called ‘India Electric Mobility Council’ (IEMC) to cater to all EV stakeholders including EV OEMs, components providers, charging infrastructure, and battery swapping companies.
Currently, EVs make up only about 2% of total automobile sales in India, but the Union and state governments have set targets to increase EV adoption in the next decade. 
EV sales are expected to grow sharply driven by government programs like production-linked incentive (PLI), FAME, and phased manufacturing program. The technologies that are driving the revolution are becoming more precise, with a focus on decreasing prices and increasing manufacturing efficiency and product performance. 
At present, the industry priorities include improved battery technologies and motor capabilities and reduced charging duration to fulfil buyers’ performance and reliability requirements. The industry and governments are also focusing on indigenous value capture and localized manufacturing. 
“To take the whole industry forward, there is an urgent need for a single technology-agnostic platform to cater to all EV stakeholders. To address this gap, IESA is launching India Electric Mobility Council (IEMC) with the active participation of EV manufacturers, component and equipment providers, fleet operators, battery technology providers, charging infrastructure and service providers, battery swapping companies, and other key stakeholders,” stated IESA. 
IEMC aims to serve and support more than 100+ EV and infra-related member companies to become the largest EV platform in India by the end of this year.
Debi Prasad Dash, executive director of IESA, said, “The India Electric Mobility Council (IEMC) initiative by IESA is intended to explore opportunities for India to exploit the potential of R&D and manufacturing of e-mobility technologies and support quicker adoption of clean transport. IEMC will also work with the government and various stakeholders to address the barriers and focus on the aspects related to safety & standards, charging infrastructure development, battery swapping, and V2G mechanism for India.” 
Currently, under IEMC, IESA is working with 50+ EV ecosystem players.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/10/photocatalytic-water-splitting-with-9-2-solar-to-hydrogen-efficiency/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JANUARY 10, 2023",Photocatalytic water splitting with 9.2% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency,"From pv magazine International
University of Michigan researchers developed a new photocatalytic water splitting system that is reportedly able to reach a 9.2% solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency.
The proposed system uses the higher energy part of the solar spectrum to split water and the lower part of the spectrum to provide heat that encourages the reaction. The extra heat also allows the hydrogen and oxygen to remain separate, rather than renewing their bonds and forming water once more.
It works in an indoor environment and uses pure water, concentrated solar light, and an indium gallium nitride photocatalyst. The semiconductor catalyst, a forest of nanowires of indium gallium nitride grown onto a silicon surface, is able to become more efficient during use, according to the scientists. The device absorbs photons and converts them into electrons, which are used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
The nanowires are peppered with nanoscale balls of metal, 1/2000th of a millimeter across, that use those electrons and holes, positively charged gaps left behind when electrons are liberated by the light, to help direct the reaction.
“A simple insulating layer atop the panel keeps the temperature at a toasty 75 C, or 167 F – warm enough to help encourage the reaction while also being cool enough for the semiconductor catalyst to perform well,” the scientists said.
They claim that the system is nearly 10 times more efficient than other solar water-splitting systems of the same kind. They said that the final cost of hydrogen could fall with a bigger semiconductor.
“We reduced the size of the semiconductor by more than 100 times compared to some semiconductors only working at low light intensity,” said researcher Peng Zhou.
The research group described the system in the study “Solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of more than 9% in photocatalytic water splitting,” published in Nature.
“This temperature-dependent strategy also leads to an STH efficiency of about 7 % from widely available tap water and sea water and an STH efficiency of 6.2% in a large-scale photocatalytic water-splitting system with a natural solar light capacity of 257 watts,” they said.
They claimed that the next challenge is to further improve the efficiency and generate ultra-high purity hydrogen that can be directly fed into fuel cells.
