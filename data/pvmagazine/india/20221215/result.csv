This is the largest single order received by the company, stated KPI Green.
KPI Green’s scope of work includes engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the solar power project along with 25 years of operation and maintenance and land lease agreement. It will execute the project through its wholly-owned subsidiary KPIG Energia.
The [latest addition] will further strengthen and accelerate the speed to achieve our ambitious target of reaching 1 GWp capacity by 2025, stated KPI Green.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/15/roadblocks-to-rooftop-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",Roadblocks to rooftop solar  ,"pv magazine: Rooftop solar adoption could be more encouraging as seen in the utility-scale segment. What are the challenges impeding the growth of rooftop solar?
To start with, there is still a lack of understanding about what all it takes to make a rooftop solar plant work. Then there are policy restrictions and regulations, especially regarding net metering (for the commercial and industrial sector), which are the most critical roadblocks affecting rooftop solar adoption. Apart from these, administrative delays in securing various approvals from different state entities and in the disbursement of subsidies make the entire process of rooftop solar very cumbersome.
pv magazine: Do you think the government has done enough to remove these roadblocks?
It’s not that the government has not done enough. There have been very well-intentioned initiatives, like the launch of the recent National Portal for Rooftop Solar aimed at simplifying procedures for rooftop solar applicants. While it is in its early days right now and there are still improvements being made like addressing the issue of state-wise multiple registrations on the portal, we hope that it will ease out quite a lot of things in the future.
pv magazine: To what extent has the basic customs duty (BCD) on cells and modules impacted the rooftop solar segment? How are developers addressing the price increase?
BCD has led to a sharp rise in solar tariffs, as modules contribute 50%-60% of the total project cost. This is in addition to the rise in module prices due to the hike in silicon prices, along with other raw materials and metals, globally.
Beyond BCD, there is also ALMM, which Is challenging the basic requirement of high-quality and high-efficiency modules, a necessity as rooftop spaces are limited.
As developers, we cannot risk the long-term performance of solar plants by using modules that do not have a proven performance track record and we’ve been voicing our concerns accordingly.  
pv magazine: What states do you find most favorable for rooftop solar, and why?
It’s a mixed bag. Gujarat has been topping the charts in residential rooftop solar, UP is upping its game, particularly for open access. Karnataka used to be very accommodating in its rooftop solar policies for commercial and industrial, which Odisha is also following now.
All state governments will have to consider this an opportunity for long-term energy independence. Rooftop solar is the ideal solution for India to meet our green energy targets and for battling our fossil fuel emissions. When used in conjunction with storage they can cut down the use of urban diesel generators by homes and establishments, substantially.
pv magazine: What are the emerging trends in the module, mounting, and inverter technologies for rooftop solar?
There are continuing upgrades in the module wattage. At present, mono PERC modules that the industry uses are in the range of 500-550 Wp. The upcoming range will be tending towards 650 Wp in the same category.
In inverters, the industry has transitioned more towards string inverters (from central inverters), ranging from 2-5 kW to 200 kW, with multi-MPPT technology providing better efficiency and lower generation losses.
pv magazine: Are Indian manufacturers in sync with these trends and capable of delivering these at attractive prices?
In India, domestic manufacturers are largely producing polycrystalline modules with 330 Wp primarily. Very few suppliers of high-efficiency mono PERC or bifacial modules are available at the moment. While some manufacturers are investing, it will take time before we have an adequate domestic supply of efficient modules.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/15/customizable-sticker-to-turn-solar-panels-into-advertising-billboards/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 15, 2022",Customizable sticker to turn solar panels into advertising billboards,"From pv magazine Global
Italian startup Sunspeker has developed a customizable, fully recyclable sticker to wrap photovoltaic panels.
The company recently secured €115,000 ($120.950) in funding from Italian state-run investment bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) to bring its new technology to market.
“Our new product is intended at creating an all-in-one digital screen powered by photovoltaics,” CEO Fabrizio Chiara told pv magazine. “Every solar panel is potentially an advertising space with Sunspeker’s sticker.”
The company says the stickers can replicate high-definition images while remaining permeable to light. This reportedly ensures that the modules retain between 80% and 90% of their efficiency.
“The loss in power yield can be compensated by the gains coming from ad campaigns,” Chiara said. “Ads of this kind may also be sold at a higher price given the sustainability of the billboards.”
The images processed using Sunspeker’s patented process reportedly maintain a high rate of transparency.
“However, as a matter of aesthetic impact, in some cases, the energy efficiency is reduced to 80% so that the solar panel can be more integrated into the environment,” Chiara said. “Currently, we are working to create standard conditions to allow us to scale with some different aesthetic solutions to cover the majority of the cases.”
The adhesive film for the aesthetic covers is a thermoplastic that was developed for outdoor applications. The company said that in the R&D process it focused on sustainability. It sought a solution that was fully recyclable, in line with circular economic principles.
The solar screen technology is still under development and has a “level-six technology readiness level” (TRL 6). The TRL measures the maturity of technology components in a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing the most mature technologies for full commercial application.
The company manufactured the final product and is now ready to commercialize it in Canavese, near Turin, northern Italy. It hopes to raise another €450,000 via new funding rounds. It said it is currently implementing the first pilot projects.
“In the Veneto region, at the end of November, we installed the first residential pilot project of the solar rooftop with a ’tile’ texture in partnership with Energy Saving, an energy company based in Treviso that believed in the Sunspeker mission and technology,” said Chiara.

Kopp has unveiled SmartFlex, a four-panel rooftop PV system based on a fold-out substructure. The new system uses n-type TOPCon solar modules with outputs of 430 W and efficiency ratings of 22.02%.
“The system has a size of approximately 6.8 square meters when unfolded,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
It said the system is easier to install than conventional rooftop systems, as a crane lifts the modules out of their delivery boxes onto rooftops, where they can then be unfolded and connected. The modules can also be connected with just one tool.
The ballast material provides resistance to wind and other extreme weather conditions. A unit with four modules weighs between 150 kg and 300 kg, depending on the number of ballast stones. The substructure is made of Magnelis, a zinc-aluminum-magnesium alloy.
“With the new product, Kopp covers all processes, from technical planning to production and delivery,” said Zouhair Kefi, the head of Kopp’s energy and home automation division. “SmartFlex is a revolutionary solution for the growing need for autonomous energy supply using solar power.”
