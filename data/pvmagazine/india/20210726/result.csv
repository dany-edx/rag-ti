The savings can provide much-needed respite to public discoms, which reported a loss of INR 61,360 crore (USD 8.4 billion) in FY19. 
The CEEW findings are based on an investigation of 194 GW of Indian coal assets (out of a total capacity of nearly 205 GW) operational and generating between September 2017 and February 2020. The study found that prioritizing efficiency-based dispatch during this time could have improved coal fleet efficiency by 1.9%, resulting in annual coal savings of 42 million tonnes (MT) and a commensurate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 
CEEW explored factors leading to under-utilization of some of the new and efficient coal plants in the current system that prioritizes plants based on variable costs. It assessed the factors driving the efficiency and variable costs of the coal fleet and proposed a scenario that prioritizes efficiency over variable costs in the dispatch mechanism.
The study found that in the reassigned scenario, where efficient assets are dispatched on priority, plants consume less energy, operate at a higher load factor, and as a result, there were significant savings on variable costs of generation. The total savings on variable costs in this reassigned scenario amounted to INR 8,944 crore annually. 
A significant portion of this savings is attributable to the savings from avoided coal consumption on account of the higher energy efficiency of the system. The reassignment prevents nearly 42 MT of coal from being unnecessarily consumed annually to meet the power demand. The overall efficiency of the fleet improved by 6%.
The CEEW study also recommends considering 30 GW of India’s coal-based capacity for accelerated decommissioning. The proposed plants overlap with those identified for retirement in the National Electricity Plan (NEP), 2018. 
The study recommends temporarily mothballing a further 20 GW of relatively new capacity that does not feature in the NEP list. Factoring in planned renewables and coal capacity, relegating these newer plants would not adversely affect supply at a system level. In fact, relegating these inefficient plants would additionally result in a one-time saving of INR 10,000 crore (US$ 1.37 billion) on account of avoided pollution control retrofits, stated the report authors. 
Further, the study advocate for a unified electricity market that treats the whole country as a single dispatch region. The findings reinforce the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (CERC) proposal to move away from bilateral scheduling of generation and focus on shifting to market-based economic dispatch (MBED).
The MBED mechanism for procuring bulk power has been proposed to begin in April 2022. By dispatching power through a central clearing mechanism, it aims to reduce power procurement costs by INR 12,000 crore.
Karthik Ganesan, Director of Research Coordination, CEEW, and the study’s lead author, said, “The slower-than-expected growth of power demand and the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy in India have left our coal assets under-utilized. While India is contemplating a net-zero commitment year, its current plants are entirely premised on renewable energy addition only. Given that India will continue to rely on coal power in the coming decade, it must rein in wasteful coal use and improve generation efficiency. Decommissioning a part of the fleet today could make coal power generation more efficient and less polluting and accelerate decarbonization in the power sector. Decommissioning identified assets will usher in new investments in a more balanced generation system that does not have the sword of surplus hanging over it.”

The ±800 kV, 6GW link can meet the electricity needs of more than 80 million people. It stretches 1,800-kilometers to connect Raigarh in Central India to Pugalur in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Reliable power can now be transmitted in either direction depending on demand, with exceptionally low power losses and minimal environmental footprint. 
The link strengthens grid resilience and stabilizes the power infrastructure by combining traditional and renewable power generation. It enables further development and integration of sustainable energy, supporting the government’s goal of reaching 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. 
Using HVDC helps conserve the environment by only occupying about one-third of the land compared to a traditional AC link. In this case, the link amounts to a saving of approximately 130 square kilometers – equal to a quarter of the area of Mumbai. 
Hitachi ABB Power Grids worked with the customer, government agencies, local authorities and suppliers to deliver the link during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responsible project execution with health and safety at the forefront was key to this achievement. 
N Venu, Managing Director and CEO, Hitachi ABB Power Grids in India, said, “With the commissioning of this groundbreaking UHVDC link, we have kept our promise to enable more clean and reliable power for millions of people, helping to build a future where electricity will be the backbone of the entire energy system. During the entire project, the health and safety of our customers, employees, and partners remained our top priority.” 
The consortium of Hitachi ABB Power Grids and state-owned engineering and manufacturing firm BHEL won the order in 2016 from Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. Hitachi ABB Power Grids has been responsible for delivering the UHVDC converter stations, including design, engineering, construction, installation, and commissioning, as well as major equipment, including 800 kV converter transformers, converter valves, high-voltage products and control and protection technology. 
Switzerland-headquartered Hitachi ABB Power Grids is the global market leader in HVDC technology. In India, the company has introduced the HVDC technology with the Vindhyachal project in 1989. Raigarh-Pugalur is the company’s sixth HVDC project in India and the second UHVDC installation, following the multi-terminal NorthEast Agra link.

The agency will issue the tender to set up the capacity by August 31. 
The energy storage system projects will be set up on a build-own-operate basis. SECI shall sign a 25-year agreement with the successful bidders.
India has reached 96.95 GW of cumulative grid-interactive renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) as of June 30, 2021, and is aiming for 450 GW by 2030. 
With the increasing penetration of variable RE in the grid, the nation needs to accelerate the deployment of utility-scale battery storage to ensure grid stability. The battery storage can store the renewable power when it is available in excess and supply firm power later when generation is low, but demand is high.
SECI leads the way for utility-scale battery deployment by coming up with RE plus battery storage auctions that mandate round-the-clock RE power supply. The standalone energy storage system project of 2 GWh is the latest in this series.
Recently, state-run power producer NTPC had also invited an Expression of Interest (EoI) from Indian and global firms to set up 1 GWh of grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) at its power plants in India. The BESS may be deployed at a single location or split across multiple NTPC power plants.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/26/new-tech-may-bring-heterojunction-solar-cells-based-on-p-type-wafers-closer-to-mass-production/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 26, 2021",New tech may bring heterojunction solar cells based on p-type wafers closer to mass production,"From pv magazine International
A group of scientists from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia and Russian heterojunction solar module producer Hevel Solar has developed a novel hydrogenation process that is claimed to have the potential to improve the stabilized efficiency of p-type heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell based on gallium-doped silicon wafers.
The solar industry usually applies n-type phosphorus–doped Czochralski–grown silicon (Cz–Si) wafers in the production of SHJ cells, as these ensure no susceptibility to the boron-oxygen light-induced degradation (B-O LID) that is typical for p-type boron-doped wafers and severely affects the performance of SHJ cells over time. N-type wafers ensure more stability, however, they are currently more expensive to produce than p-type wafers, which are the mainstream solution for the manufacturing of PERC cells. This means that using p-type wafers may potentially lead to a further cost reduction for the heterojunction technology, as wafer costs still represent 40% of a cell’s total cost.
In order to compete with n-type devices, however, p-type heterojunction cells will have to show improved performance. “The same advanced hydrogenation techniques (AHTs) we use in mass production for solving LID and LeTID in p-type PERC solar cells can be used in p-type SHJ solar cells to solve B-O LID when using boron-doped p-type Cz wafers,” research co-author, Brett Hallam, told pv magazine. “Even though the gallium-doped and n-type SHJ solar cells were stable in this work and didn’t need the process to improve stability, we have shown that these same processes can improve the efficiency of gallium-doped and n-type SHJ solar cells by 0.4-0.7% absolute.”
The research group explained that the expiration of Shin Etsu‘s gallium doping patent (US6815605B1) has encouraged the solar industry to adopt p-type gallium-doped Cz-Si wafers, which it describes as a potential mainstream solution for the SHJ segment for the next decade.
Two solar cells were developed with a new advanced hydrogenation process (AHP) at an existing SHJ line operated by Hevel using 156.75x156.75 mm p-type wafers doped with boron (B) and gallium (Ga), respectively. The first products were provided by Chinese manufacturer Longi and the second by Taiwanese wafer maker Sino-American Silicon (SAS). The scientists also built a standard n-type SHJ device as a reference.
All the wafers were initially treated with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) saw-damage etch and KOH anisotropic texturing. B-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers were deposited in the rear side of the wafers and intrinsic and P-doped a-Si:H layers were then deposited in the front of the wafers using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). In the final step, indium-tin tin-oxide (ITO) transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers were deposited on both sides through physical vapour deposition.
According to the scientists, the cell built with B-doped wafers exhibited an efficiency of 20.5% and an open-circuit voltage of 719.6 mV, while the Ga-doped device was found to have an efficiency of 22.6%, a fill factor of 78.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 730 mV and no degradation during light-soaking. “The conversion efficiency of the gallium-doped SHJ solar cells is still lower than the n-type reference cells, which was largely due to a reduced fill factor (FF),” the Russian-Australian group affirmed. “Further work is required to overcome this FF limitation to facilitate high-efficiency gallium-doped SHJ solar cells.”
“We’ve demonstrated this versatile process with a number of n-type SHJ solar cell manufacturers and there are commercial tools available for this, which are already being implemented in production for industrial n-type SHJ solar cells,” Hallam stated, referring to the immediate applicability of this process to industrial production. “We would likely need to do more work on understanding the exact requirements for different SHJ solar cell manufacturers with different toolsets and processing conditions.”
A cost assessment must still be carried out. “The costs would be the same as for methods solving LID/LeTID in p-type PERC cells and when advanced hydrogenation tools are implemented for industrial n-type SHJ solar cells and TOPCon solar cells,” the UNSW researcher stated.
The solar cell and the related hydrogenation process are presented in the paper Stability Study of Silicon Heterojunction Solar cells fabricated with Gallium- and Boron-doped Silicon Wafers, published in RRL Solar.
