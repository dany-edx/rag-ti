Our green hydrogen is going to be the cheapest in the world because our cost of renewable energy production is the cheapest in the world,” said power minister RK Singh while addressing the India Energy Transition Summit 2023 recently in New Delhi. 
The minister said the cost of setting up 1 MW of renewable energy capacity in India is $600,000.
The minister said the government is going to come out with bids for round-the-clock renewable power using green hydrogen as storage.
“We estimate that the cost of round-the-clock renewable power using green hydrogen as storage would not be more than INR 6 ($0.07)/kWh. Once that price comes down, India’s entire transition will be round-the-clock renewable energy.” 
“India has already set green hydrogen standards. The government has stipulated that carbon emissions in the making of green hydrogen end-to-end should not exceed 2 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent for every kilogram of hydrogen produced [taken as an average over the last 12-month period]. That’s the best green hydrogen standard in the world,” said the minister.
The minister reaffirmed the government’s focus on making India the biggest manufacturer of the latest solar cells and modules. “The government wants only state-of-the-art solar cell and module production [in India]. The nation will continue to expand its manufacturing capacity with the best technology in the world,” he added.
“India already has 28 GW of PV module manufacturing capacity. Another 48 GW is coming up under the PLI scheme, out of which 24 GW is polysilicon-to-modules and the remaining 24 GW is wafer-to-module and cell-and-module. Outside of the PLI Scheme, the industry is setting up huge capacity, so the total manufacturing capacity which is in the process of being set up is about 100 GW.”
“That has happened because we are the biggest and the fastest growing renewable energy market in the world, and we shall continue to be so and we want to make it happen with made-in-India products,” said the minister.
The minister underlined that India’s current non-fossil capacity stands at an impressive 188 GW, with an additional 88 GW already under installation. “We pledged to reach 500 gigawatts by 2030, and we are set to achieve that goal well in advance,” he added. 
The minister noted that despite constituting 17% of the world’s population, India contributes only 4% to the global carbon dioxide emissions. He emphasized that India’s per capita emissions are around 2.2 tonnes, significantly lower than the global average of 6.3 tonnes. 
Speaking on the occasion, Bhupinder Singh Bhalla, Secretary at the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, said, “Last year, we achieved a renewable energy capacity addition of 15 GW. This year, we are targeting an increase to 25 GW, with plans to escalate it further to 40 GW next year.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/27/vertical-agrivoltaics-to-reduce-pv-curtailment-increase-water-efficiency/,"AGRIVOLTAICS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2023","Vertical agrivoltaics to reduce PV curtailment, increase water efficiency","From pv magazine global
A research group led by the University of Liège in Belgium has looked at the potential of vertical agrivoltaics to improve water usage and reduce PV curtailment in regions with severe drought. The scientists focused their analysis on Chile’s Maule region, which has a strong agricultural profile and is affected by chronic periods of drought.
“I think vertical PV would be feasible and interesting in many other regions of Chile considering the troubles they have with scarcity of water and the type of crop they have,” the research’s corresponding author, Roxane Bruhweyler, told pv magazine. “We decided to focus on the central region because of the additional problem of the water conflict between farmers and hydropower centrals and the importance of irrigated agricultural lands in that region. This particularly makes sense when you are evaluating the geometry of an agrivoltaic system that you suspect to be able to reduce the evapotranspiration of the crop.”
They quantified the anticipated reduction in water usage when converting irrigated agricultural land to vertical agrivoltaics and assessed the expected power generation of a 100 kW north-tilted PV array in Chanco, located in the Maule region’s Cauquenes province. The PV system reduces the cultivated area of the agricultural surface by 15%, and a 14 m gap between the rows of bifacial solar modules enables the use of agricultural machinery.
“Shading of the crop on the solar panels is negligible for most cereals and forage crops and there is no effect at all for a crop height below 105 cm,” the scientists explained.
They conducted a series of simulations on the system considering the global horizontal irradiance, ambient temperature, and wind speed as input data. They also used hourly weather data for 2021 and the PVLIB-Python modeling tool produced by Sandia National Laboratory, which calculates solar irradiance on the plane of a PV panel (POAI), measured as kWh/m2/day, to analyze the array’s power production.
Through these measurements, the academics were able to verify that the vertical PV system could reduce water demand for the irrigated main crops. They also found that the PV installation produces 10% less energy than conventional PV systems.
“However, the agrivoltaic facility offers a two-peak generation profile that allows the spreading of the production of photovoltaic energy over the day, reducing the risk of curtailments,” they stated. The microclimate heterogeneity analysis of this vertical agrivoltaics suggests that plants will need slightly different amounts of water depending on their position between the rows of panels.”
The researchers presented their modeling in “Vertical agrivoltaics and its potential for electricity production and agricultural water demand: A case study in the area of Chanco, Chile,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments.
“Future work will aim to further validate the computational models tested in this study through field monitoring of vertical AV sites in collaboration with other partners, with a specific focus on the effects of these installations on microclimate and water balance, energy yield prediction uncertainties, and crop growth,” they said, in reference to their future plans.
The research group includes scientists from Hochschule Anhalt University of Applied Sciences in Germany, French technology company Naldeo Technologies Industries, and Universidad de Santo Tomás in Chile.

The agreement requires the two nations to collaborate on safety, regulatory measures, and market analysis to facilitate government and industry planning and investments.
GIZ, the German development agency, has launched the International Green Hydrogen Promotion Program (H2Uppp) on behalf of the German Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection (BMWK). The program aims to bolster green hydrogen projects and their value chains in Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay, Mexico, and Brazil. The funding for the projects ranges from €50,000 ($52.874) to €2 million, with a requirement that the private sector contributes at least 50% of the contract. Eligibility criteria include the lead applicant company being based in the European Union and having a minimum of three years in existence. The call for proposals remains open until the end of the year.
DHL, HH2E, and Sasol have signed an agreement to set up a collaborative project focused on building potential production capacities for sustainable aviation fuels derived from green hydrogen (eSAF). The project will be built in an undisclosed location in eastern Germany to serve various airports, including Leipzig/Halle. The initial plan foresees a production volume of at least 200,000 tons of eSAF per year, with the potential to scale up to 500,000 tons annually. This scaled production is expected to lead to a reduction of 632,000 tons of CO2 emissions yearly. Airbus is also expected to join the consortium at a later stage.
Tata Motors has supplied two 12-meter-long hydrogen fuel cell-powered (FCEV) buses to Indian Oil Corp., the largest petroleum company in India. These deliveries are part of Indian Oil’s ongoing trials of 15 buses powered by green hydrogen across Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.
Mauritania could be in an advantageous position to export hydrogen to international markets, potentially surpassing countries such as Morocco and Egypt in this regard, according to Michaël Tanchum, a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute. Mauritania’s smaller population, vast coverage by the Sahara Desert with abundant direct normal irradiation (DNI) levels, and rich wind energy resources contribute to its favorable position. Additionally, being the only Sahel nation with a coastline allows Mauritania to facilitate off-take for export markets.
Galp has made a final investment decision on two large-scale projects to reduce the carbon footprint of the Sines refinery, including a 100 MW of electrolyzers for up to 15 ktpa of green hydrogen production. The unit, for a total investment of €250 million, is expected to have its first start up in 2025. The electrolyzers will be supplied by renewable power, originating from long-term supply agreements. Plug Power was awarded the order for the 100 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, while Technip Energies will be the main EPCM provider.
