The factory, a greenfield project, would initially have a manufacturing capacity for up to 3 GW of solar installation per annum. 
The plant is expected to be commissioned within 18-24 months.
AIS will take a minority stake in the solar glass business. 
Vishakha Group is one of the largest manufacturers of flexible polymer packaging in India. It also manufactures other key components in the entire solar panel value chain, including solar backsheets, EVA encapsulant sheets, and aluminum frames for solar modules.
Asahi India Glass has become the second player after New Delhi-headquartered Gold Plus Glass Industry (Gold Plus) to foray into solar glass manufacturing this year. 
Currently, Borosil Renewables is the only solar glass manufacturer in the country. It has a factory at Bharuch in Gujarat, meeting about 40% of India’s solar glass requirement. Imports meet the balance of demand. With rising sales, it is also expanding its capacity from 450 tons per day to 950 tons per day by adding a third solar glass line of 500 tons per day along with processing facilities. 
The announcements for capacity additions come as a surge in solar installations in India is driving huge demand for solar power equipment/panels and solar glass.
As part of its commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, India has now embarked on an ambitious target of generating 450 GW of renewable energy by the year 2030. 
Sanjay Labroo, managing director and chief executive officer of Asahi India Glass Ltd (AIS), said: “Although a different market segment, solar glass is still an adjacent business to the existing businesses of AIS. We are delighted to partner with the Vishakha group in their vision of creating the entire ecosystem and value chain for indigenizing solar energy generation in India.” 
Jigish Doshi, Chairman of Vishakha Group, said: “India has been one of the few nations that have accelerated its global commitment towards climate change and we intend to do our part to achieve the renewable energy target. The joint venture into solar glass manufacturing will support the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiative of the Government of India, contribute to achieving energy independence and lead to massive job creation in the Gujarat region…We plan to complement the technical expertise and experience of AIS with synergies from our other businesses in the entire solar value chain”. 
Asahi India Glass is India’s leading integrated glass company engaged in the production and delivery of next-generation glass products and solutions to retail and institutional customers. A dominant player in automotive and architectural glass segments, it provides end-to-end solutions across the entire value chain in both these segments – from the manufacturing of float glass to glass processing, fabrication, and installation. It commands about a 72% share in the Indian passenger car glass market.

This included 330 MW of rooftop (on-site) solar and 171 MW open-access (off-site). The cumulative commercial and industrial solar capacity stands at 10,485 MW as on March 31, 2021, according to Bridge To India’s Q1 2021 India Corporate Renewable Brief.
Installation activity picked up slightly in Q1 in response to easing Covid-related restrictions and increasing power demand. But activity is again expected to have slowed down in Q2 due to lockdowns across most states, stated the report.
Overall C&I renewable capacity (including open-access solar, open-access wind, and rooftop solar) is estimated to have reached 17,800 MW by March 31, 2021.
C&I renewable power penetration is highest in Karnataka at 25%, followed by Tamil Nadu (23%), but growth is picking up in other states, including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. In response to favorable policy (in Gujarat) and higher renewable power demand from consumers, wind-solar hybrid (WSH) projects are becoming more popular. 
Speaking about the report findings, Vinay Rustagi, Managing Director, Bridge To India, said, “The C&I renewable market is gaining serious momentum with consumers keen to reduce their power bills as well as carbon emissions. There is also very strong interest from investors as we continue to see leading independent power producers, private equity funds, and other institutional investors committing huge sums to this market. Corporate consumers can be a major pillar in India’s renewable growth story if the government can provide a stable and predictable policy framework.”
Market impediments vary across states. Karnataka, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu propose to limit net metering provisions for rooftop solar. Several states are imposing further ad-hoc restrictions on rooftop solar systems besides curbs on power banking provision and extra open-access charges outside the prevailing regulatory framework.
Going forward, solar addition will slow down next year as basic customs duty (BCD) of 25% on solar cells and 40% on modules from April 1, 2022 increases the cost of power by about INR 0.30/ kWh.

Combining ultra-thin layers of different materials can raise the photovoltaic effect of solar cells by a factor of 1,000, according to researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) in Germany.
Their findings, published in the journal “Science Advances,” described a lattice arrangement of three different layers of ferroelectric crystals (in this case, of barium titanate, strontium titanate, and calcium titanate) that created a powerful solar energy producing effect.
Ferroelectric means that the material has spatially separated positive and negative charges. The charge separation leads to an asymmetric structure that enables electricity to be generated from light.
Ferroelectric crystals differ from conventional silicon cells in that they do not require a p-n junction to create the PV effect. In other words, there is no need to create positively and negatively doped layers within the cell. The researchers said that change could make solar panels easier to produce.
MLU researchers have been experimenting with barium titanate to take advantage of these properties. However, pure barium titanate does not absorb much sunlight; as a result, it generates a relatively low photocurrent. The research showed that combining ultra-thin layers of different materials can significantly increase a cell’s yield.
Researchers added a thin paraelectric layer to the cell. Although this layer does not have separated charges, it can become ferroelectric under certain conditions; for example, in low temperatures or when the chemical structure is slightly modified.
MLU physicist Dr. Akash Bhatnagar and his team discovered that a much stronger photovoltaic effect occurs when the ferroelectric layer alternates with not one, but two different paraelectric layers.
The team embedded barium titanate between strontium titanate and calcium titanate. This was achieved by vaporizing the crystals with a high-powered laser, redepositing them on carrier substrates. The result was a material made of 500 layers that was only about 200 nanometers thick.
The MLU team irradiated the cell with laser light to test the new material, and the results surprised them. Compared to pure barium titanate of a similar thickness, the current flow was up to 1,000 times stronger, despite the proportion of barium titanate having been reduced by almost two-thirds.
“The interaction between the lattice layers appears to lead to a much higher permittivity – in other words, the electrons are able to flow much more easily due to the excitation by the light photons,” Bhatnagar said.
The studies show the effect is also resilient as it remained nearly constant over a six-month test period. Further research is underway to understand what exactly causes this photovoltaic effect.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/06/the-impact-of-electricity-rules-amendment-on-rooftop-solar-sector/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,INDIA",,"AUGUST 6, 2021",The impact of electricity rules amendment on rooftop solar sector,"Rooftop Solar in India has grown consistently from an installed base of around 600 MW in 2015 to 6 GW to date. While the growth seems remarkable on a standalone basis, it is a bit understated compared to the corresponding growth in utility solar. The government of India has set an ambitious 40 GW target for rooftop solar by 2022, and with less than an year to go, we are way short of meeting this target.
While the reasons for such sluggish growth in the solar rooftop sector are many, the recent disappointment came with a steep policy level shift that is certainly going to not only slow down the capacity addition but also leave a lot of uncertainty till the time final adoption of the draft amendment to Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020 is done by all states.
It is a well-known fact that it took years and tremendous efforts by not only the Ministry of Power (MoP) but also by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), and other stakeholders to work closely with the all the states for adopting and implementing the Net metering regulations across India. Net metering is one of the key drivers for faster adoption of Solar Rooftop since the concept is such that it works as an incentive for both – the supplier and the consumer.
This also was an attractive proposition for DISCOMS to increase efficiency in power supply and consumers, who could sell back surplus generation to the grid at retail tariffs. But with the increase in capacity addition of Rooftop Solar, DISCOMS were no longer enthusiastic about it due to multiple factors like losing out on the quantum of power being bought by high paying Commercial & Industrial consumers, variability of power and the commercials in comparison to buying green power at a much lower tariff available.
However, rooftop solar currently occupies less than 3-4% of India’s total generation capacity and the losses to DISCOM from rooftop were relatively marginal if other benefits to DISCOMs such as reductions in transmission and distribution losses, reductions in peak demands and contributions to Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO) have not been quantified or included in assessment. Despite this, different states came out with different regulations restricting the provision of Net Metering for Commercial and Industrial consumers.
The amendment to Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020 issued by MoP against the earlier proposed rules of December 2020, is a welcome move and a big relief to the solar rooftop segment. It provides multiple options in addition to Net Metering, like Net Billing/Feed-in and gross metering, which will balance out the concerns of all the stakeholders.
Also, if the Commissions implement the time-of-the-day (ToD) tariffs whereby Prosumers are incentivized to install energy storage for utilization of solar energy stored by them or feeding into the grid during peak hours, thus helping the grid by participating in demand response of the Discoms, then this will certainly help in rapid implementation of Solar coupled with Storage solutions by making them commercially viable.
Having said that, we still have a long way to go and the key to the next phase of growth for the rooftop segment is dependent on multiple factors: One, State regulators should come up with the regulations in accordance with the amended Rules rapidly and assure greater clarity. Two, the Feed-in Tariff determined by the State Regulatory Commissions should provide commercial viability. Finally, a reduced timeframe for DISCOMs to adopt the regulations and ensure smooth implementation at the grassroot level.
In the present changing landscape of the power sector in India, the dominance of DISCOMs as the sole energy provider will fade away, and they will have to understand that co-existence is important to stay relevant. All stakeholders like power producers, DISCOMS, financiers and consumers will have to collaborate to create the right environment for the sector’s growth.
The industry welcomes the amendment and is ready to adapt to the dynamics of the sector. We foresee a temporary slowdown impact, but the amendment will pave the way for further growth of the sector, given the inclusion of a balanced approach for all stakeholders. We look forward to a positive and effective implementation by State Regulators so that an overall conducive eco-system is created for solar rooftop in India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/06/indian-scientists-develop-zinc-iron-redox-flow-battery-with-zero-dendrite-growth/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 6, 2021",Indian scientists develop zinc-iron redox flow battery with zero dendrite growth,"From pv magazine international
Redox flow batteries present an attractive alternative to lithium-ion in the stationary storage segment, thanks to potentially longer lifetimes and capability for daily 100% discharge without loss of performance.
Many commercial projects featuring different types of flow batteries are already underway for both large-scale and residential energy storage. However, questions are being raised about the materials used in some of the batteries, with the toxicity of vanadium used in most of the large-scale projects a particular sticking point.
Zinc-based flow batteries present a less toxic option, and a zinc-bromine chemistry has already seen some commercial development. Zinc-iron (Zn-Fe) is another option widely explored by researchers, with the abundance of iron making it a particularly attractive option. However, dendrite growth and the related performance loss and short-circuiting, have held this chemistry back so far.
Scientists led by the University of Calicut in India fabricated a zinc-iron redox flow battery that demonstrated discharge voltage of approximately 1.34 V at 25 mA cm−2, with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 92%, voltage efficiency (VE) of 85% and energy efficiency (EE) of ~78% for 30 charge-discharge cycles. Most importantly, the battery showed no performance degradation over those initial 30 cycles, and zero dendrite growth. The battery is described in full in the paper A dendrite free Zn-Fe hybrid redox flow battery for renewable energy storage, published in Energy Storage.
Though it would have to retain these characteristics for a lot more than 30 cycles, the results are encouraging. The group credits the suppression of dendrites to its use of an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) that it designed and fabricated using guanidine carbonate, formaldehyde, melamine and polymer binding agent.
They note that when this was replaced with a porous PVC membrane as a control experiment dendrite formation could be observed even on the battery’s first charge. “Absence of dendrite growth might be due to the fact that, only the chloride ions shuttles between two electrolyte solutions through AEM and this probably promotes uniform zinc deposition and prevents the dendrite growth,” the group states.
They expect to follow up with further details on the fabrication of the AEM and its role in the battery’s performance, and the group remains convinced that its approach can prove useful for the stationary storage of renewable energy, among other applications. “We have successfully demonstrated working of a high efficiency and stable Zn-Fe hybrid redox flow battery with no dendrite growth during zinc deposition by optimizing charge-discharge conditions and employing an anion exchange membrane as separator,” their paper concludes.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/06/lithium-ion-technology-will-lead-the-indian-battery-energy-storage-systems-market/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 6, 2021",Lithium-ion technology to lead the Indian battery energy storage systems market by 2030,"Stationary storage within battery-enabled storage systems (BESS) would witness significant growth over the next ten years. This growth will be led by lithium-ion technology as battery prices decline at an average 6% annually between 2018-30, according to a recent report by India-based consultancy firm Praxis Global Alliance.
The report authors made a reference to IEA’s projections that India would lead the battery storage market and contribute 35% of the total global battery deployment for energy storage by 2040. The Indian stationary storage requirement is expected to grow nine times at 22% annually during FY2022-32, as per a report by India Smart Grid Forum. The key factors driving this growth are robust solar energy generation targets and end-user demand towards green energy transition.
The Praxis report projects lithium-ion technology to lead the Indian battery energy storage systems market by 2030 due to a decline in battery prices for both lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) and Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt, and Manganese (NCM) batteries, the two most commonly used lithium-ion battery technologies.
The overall battery price decline by 2030 is expected to be about US$ 80/kWh for LFP and about US$ 100/kWh for NCM. Further, the total cost of ownership (TCO) is expected to almost halve from current levels for both Lithium-ion battery technologies.
The cost economics of solar power and battery storage on account of the falling prices will result in the LFP batteries’ tariff for electricity to range between INR 7.0–INR 7.7 per kWh (US$ 0.09 – US$ 0.10) by 2030, while NCM battery tariffs are expected to range between INR 7.8–INR 8.7 per kWh (US$ 0.10 – US$ 0.12).
In their report, Praxis analysts also looked at the electricity storage technologies used globally and the application of BESS. They suggested that utility-scale and end-consumer models existing globally for battery storage could be replicated in India as battery prices decline. The use case for commercial and industrial consumers to replace diesel gensets is already available today.
Aryaman Tandon, Managing Partner and Co-Founder, Praxis Global Alliance, said, “Battery storage would lead India’s march towards net-zero targets in this decade, with global battery prices declining significantly. The improving economics with a declining total cost of ownership (TCO) and favorable government policies will result in increasing battery storage manufacturing and adoption in India.”
Savio Monteiro, Senior Vice President, Energy, Oil & Gas and Utilities, Praxis Global Alliance, said, “The decline in Lithium-ion battery storage prices over the next few years would make green energy affordable at both residential, commercial & industrial levels as well as at grid level and has the potential to replace fossil fuels significantly. We would witness increasing use cases and newer business models evolving as the overall battery storage cost declines over the next ten years.”
