Annual solar installations across the globe have increased from 18 GW in 2010 to 183 GW in 2021 and is projected to increase to 334 GW by 2030. Similarly in India, the cumulative installed solar capacity has increased manifold from 161 MW in 2010 to 42 GW as of December 2021.
One major reason for such a large-scale adoption of solar is its low cost. On a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) basis, solar has become the lowest cost electricity generation source in several major countries. In India, tariff discovered in utility scale solar tenders have fallen from INR 10.95/kWh in 2010 to INR 1.99/kWh in 2020, which is significantly lower than INR 5-7/kWh tariffs for new thermal power projects.
A major driver of such a downtrend of solar tariffs has been solar modules, which contributes 62-67% of the total project cost and their price/Wp have consistently fallen over the years. Average monthly global solar module (crystalline) price fell from $2.649/Wp in 2010 to $0.192/Wp in July of 2020. This represents an approximate 23% year-on-year fall in module prices in the same period. It was an inherent assumption of all stakeholders that this trend will continue. Thus, the solar developers could easily put this number in their financial models and bid aggressively in solar tenders predicting cheaper solar modules by the time project procurement begins.
Unfortunately, since the mid of 2020, solar module prices have become increasingly unpredictable and volatile. In a complete reversal of the previous trend, solar module prices (mono PERC) in the global market actually increased from August 2020 to November 2021 by 42%. On similar lines, solar module prices (mono PERC) in India also increased from August 2020 to November 2021 by 40%.

Key reasons for increasing solar module prices in India and abroad are:
Reviewing the points mentioned above in detail, supply demand mismatch turns out to be most crucial factor which is directly or indirectly leading to increase in module prices. At present, demand far outstrips the supply (especially poly-Si). Balance between the supply and demand is essential for stabilization of solar module prices. COP26, held in Glasgow in November 2021, wherein ambitious country wise RE targets were set. Ongoing conflict in eastern Europe have also highlighted the need for Energy Security and self-sufficiency. Thus, the demand and hunger for solar is not likely to come down anytime soon.
With ever increasing demand, it is imperative for supply to catch up to stabilize solar module prices. However, setting up a new poly-Si factory is capital and time intensive. It takes a minimum of 18-24 months construction time for a new poly-Si production facility. Since the poly-Si prices have shot up during 2021, several new projects have been announced. Indian government is also targeting vertically integrated solar manufacturing through its Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. It is expected that these new facilities will start production by mid-2023 at the earliest.
Including domestic factors of BCD, ALMM implementation to the geopolitical and supply demand mismatch, it can be concluded that solar module prices are not expected to come down anytime soon. Considering all factors, it is expected post late 2023 or Q1 2024 is the period when we may finally see downward trajectory in solar module prices again.

This included 12,438 MW solar (10,217 MW utility-scale and 2,221 MW rooftop) and 1,111 MW wind, according to a new report by Bridge To India.
Rajasthan (5,806 MW) and Gujarat (2,469 MW) together accounted for 61% of the total RE capacity addition.
The nation now has 96.2 GW of cumulative installed renewable capacity, excluding small hydro and biomass.
The record installation in 2021-22 was mainly due to the completion of projects delayed from the previous year, even as the sector faced challenges like rising input costs, delay in imported module shipments, and an environmental directive from the Supreme Court on transmission lines in most of Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Vinay Rustagi, managing director, Bridge To India, said, “The renewable sector has shown remarkable resilience in the face of multiple challenges. But it is important to acknowledge that the record high numbers in FY 2022 came mainly because of the Covid spillover effect from the previous year. Investor sentiment is in balance affected, on the one hand, by strong macro-fundamentals of the energy transition, and on the other hand, by acute policy and execution barriers. The government’s revised target of 500 GW renewable capacity by 2030, equivalent to over 40 GW of capacity addition per annum, warrants a holistic reassessment of the sector.”
Rooftop solar capacity addition was at an all-time high at 2.2 GW (up 68% over last year). The increase was predominantly driven by the residential solar segment, which saw 746 MW of new installations.
The total project capacity (allocated by the government and public agencies) in the pipeline stood at 67 GW (54 GW of solar and 13 GW wind), with SECI having the highest offtake share of 60% (40 GW), followed by Discoms (22%, 15 GW).
Module prices surged by 34% in the first half (April-September period) due to supply-side constraints in China but eased slightly in the second half. Year-end imported and domestic module prices at US 26 cents/watt and 32 cents/watt, respectively, were still about 25% up over the last year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/22/natural-hydrogen-how-it-works-and-why-companies-are-interested/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"APRIL 22, 2022",Natural hydrogen – how it works and why companies are interested,"From pv magazine Global
In April, the newly formed Western Australian company HyTerra announced plans to acquire 100% of Neutralysis Industries. Neutralysis, also Australian, holds a stake in an established Nebraska project alongside Natural Hydrogen Energy, a company with one of the field’s top researchers, Viacheslav Zgonnik, at its helm. The move would effectively be HyTerra’s “in,” giving it access to expertise, room to demonstrate, and a wellspring of naturally occurring hydrogen.
While the world has known for many decades about hydrogen accumulating under the earth’s surface, the phenomenon has largely been ignored. The main reason for that, HyTerra Business Development Manager Luke Velterop told pv magazine Australia, is simply because there’s previously been no market for it. Hydrogen is finicky to handle and in the past oil and gas have been considered just fine.
Now the urgent need to decarbonize has changed that, opening up new avenues of interest. In February, pv magazine reported that in the past year, exploration licenses amounting to one-third of South Australia’s total landmass have been either granted or applied for by companies in search of natural hydrogen.
As HyTerra Executive Director and Chief Technical Officer Avon McIntyre explains, it isn’t that South Australia is particularly bountiful in natural hydrogen accumulations, but simply that the state leads the country in terms of exploration regulations for the nascent industry. Accumulations, he says, may well be found all across Australia. And HyTerra and a handful of other companies are vying to secure them first.
Two mechanisms
While there remains some debate natural hydrogen, which has until now rarely been a focal point, there is consensus around the two main ways underground accumulations of the molecule develop.
The first, called “serpentinization,” is an underground reaction between iron and water. As McIntyre, who spent 13 years at Shell as an exploration geologist explains, the reaction occurs when water comes into contact with iron rich rocks below the atmospheric incursion level.
“Then those iron-rich rocks, they effectively want to rust, they want to turn into iron oxides … so they will strip the oxygen atom off the H2O and that releases the hydrogen,” McIntyre told pv magazine Australia. “This is a well understood process and people have known about it for many, many years. It’s just that nobody’s really considered if this could be an economically viable process.”

The latest set of annual clean energy statistics published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) has spelled out the freeze in off-grid solar installations which began with the onset of Covid-19 outside China, in 2020.
The majority of the world’s nations which host off-grid solar arrays had the same installed capacity at the end of December as they had 12 months earlier, according to Irena’s Renewable Capacity Statistics 2022 report.
In Bangladesh and Myanmar, the volume of connected off-grid solar generation capacity actually fell last year, with Bangladesh losing 16 MW of arrays to have 139 MW at the end of the year, and Myanmar falling from 44.5 MW to 40.4 MW. The latter nation also shed 4 MW of grid connected photovoltaics last year, according to Irena, to host 80 MW of grid capacity at the end of December.
In off-grid terms, Lebanon added the only 10 kW of capacity observed in the Middle East last year, Fiji added all of Oceania’s 33 kW, and Ecuador added the only 23 kW recorded in South America.
While most of Africa’s off-grid numbers remained in stasis, however, Mali’s standalone PV generation capacity rose from 19.5 MW to 49.5 MW last year and Somalia’s advanced from 15.5 MW to 23.5 MW.
Grid connected solar capacity additions remained robust last year, according to the study, with China adding almost 53 GW to reach 306 GW, India adding 10.3 GW to hit 49 GW, and the US seeing almost 20 GW of new solar, to reach 93.7 GW.
EU member states provided 21.4 GW of the new panel capacity recorded across the European continent last year, led by Germany, which added more than 4.7 GW to reach a cumulative 58.5 GW. Other hot markets included Belgium, which added more than a gigawatt to reach 6.59 GW; the Netherlands, which added almost 3.3 GW for a total 14.2 GW; Poland, which advanced from 3.96 GW to 6.26 GW last year; Portugal (up from 1.1 GW to 1.8 GW); and Spain (10.3 GW to 13.6 GW).
Estonia, Ireland, and Moldova also made significant advances, albeit from low baselines but Czechia and Slovenia lost solar capacity last year, the former retreating from 2,123 MW at the end of 2020 to 2,119 MW, and the latter from 370 MW to 367 MW.
While Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Morocco, Senegal, the Seychelles, Somalia, Togo and Zimbabwe all made advances in solar in 2021, South Africa added 231 MW of the underwhelming 298 MW of new PV connected to African grids during the year.
Kazakhstan was an Asian solar star in 2021, according to Irena, adding 1,115 MW of grid-connected photovoltaics to advance from 1.72 GW to 2.83 GW and there were also advances in Brunei, Cambodia, Japan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore and Uzbekistan – which turbocharged its solar sector to advance from just 4 MW of grid solar to 104 MW. The remarkable solar revolution witnessed in Vietnam, however, appears to have stalled. After rocketing from 8 MW of grid solar five years ago to 16.7 GW in 2020, Irena’s number crunchers said the nation added no new capacity last year.
Panama almost doubled its grid solar capacity last year, from 242 MW to 465 MW, and there were notable Central American additions too in Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, with Nicaragua adding its first megawatt of grid solar, although the zero capacity previously recorded by Irena can include up to 500 kW of panels.
Turkey drove most of Eurasia’s new solar in 2021, according to the statistics, rising from 6.67 GW to 7.82 GW, with Armenia almost doubling its grid solar fleet, from 95 MW to 183 MW. Similarly, Australia provided 1,732 MW of the 1,736 MW of new panels installed in Oceania, with New Zealand accounting for the balance, and Saudi Arabia made the only notable solar deployment in the Middle East, as it reached 389 MW of grid connected capacity from just 59 MW at the start of the year.
Brazil added more than 5 GW of new grid solar last year, to reach a cumulative 13 GW, with the markets in Argentina and Chile also ticking over as Colombia more than doubled its capacity, from 86 MW to 184 MW.
According to Irena, there are still a dozen territories worldwide without any grid-connected solar capacity: the Central African Republic, Djibouti, Lesotho, and Sao Tome et Principe, in Africa; and the British Virgin Islands, St Barth, and Dominica – which had 1 MW in 2026 and 2017, according to the Irena stats – in the Caribbean; plus Bhutan; the Faroe Islands; the Malvinas/Falklands; Paraguay; and Greenland.
