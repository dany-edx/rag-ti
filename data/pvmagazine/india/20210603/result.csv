The project will be built with an estimated total CAPEX of US$ 400 million, with 75% debt financing from an Indian state-owned lender. Scatec will hold a 50% economic interest in the project, with Acme retaining the balance 50%. 
Acme will carry out the turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) work. Scatec will ensure delivery as per international standards of Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) and Environment and Social (E&S), as well as optimization of engineering, procurement, and operations of the plants. 
Commissioning of the plant is scheduled in 2022.
When operational, the plant is expected to produce 1,600 GWh of electricity annually. The power generated will be supplied under a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
The Rajasthan project with Acme marks Scatec’s first project in India and positions it for future growth in the Indian market.
“[India] is targeting significant growth in the renewable energy capacity by 2030 and is a key growth market for renewables. We have already established presence on the ground and are positioning for future tenders within solar, wind and hybrids,” said Raymond Carlsen, CEO of Scatec.
Scatec targets 15 GW capacity by the end of 2025 and expects India to be a key market in the years to come. “We see opportunities to offer various large-scale solutions across technologies in India, both based on federal and state tenders, as well as through entering into direct PPAs with corporate off-takers. Our proven track record from renewables in emerging markets and solid partnerships will support our entry into the Indian market,” said Carlsen.
“We look forward to building a much larger portfolio of renewable energy projects with this partnership. This partnership is a testimony of the robust growth potential India offers with a plan to achieve 450 GW of renewable energy power by 2030, enabling policies, ease of doing business, and support by government of India to investors and renewable companies globally. ACME brings the value of local expertise, indigenous and cutting-edge technology to execute large scale projects at affordable prices,” said Manoj Kumar Upadhyay, Founder and Chairman of Acme Group.
Headquartered in Oslo, Scatec develops, builds, owns, and operates solar, wind, and hydropower plants and storage solutions. It has more than 3.5 GW in operation and under construction on four continents.
Acme has a cumulative portfolio of 5.0 GW, out of which 2.3 GW is operating and 2.7 GW under construction. The company aims to achieve an operating capacity of 25 GW by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/03/solar-developers-approach-centre-as-uttar-pradesh-cancels-500-mw-auction/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTTAR PRADESH",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 3, 2021",Solar developers approach Centre as Uttar Pradesh cancels 500 MW auction ,"Industry body National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) has sought the central government’s intervention to stop 500 MW solar auction cancellation by Uttar Pradesh and direct the State Government to issue a letter of Intent (LoI) to winning developers. 
The Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (UPNEDA) had floated the 500 MW tender in 2019. The auction in February 2020 saw the consortium of Saudi Arabia’s Al Jomaih and India’s Jakson Power emerge winner for 100 MW. Singapore’s NV Vogt secured 50 MW, Vijay Printing 25 MW and SolarArise 9 MW. NV Vogt quoted the lowest winning tariff of INR 3.17/kWh. The remaining three developers won their respective capacities at INR 3.18/kWh. 
As per the tender document, UPNEDA was supposed to issue the LoI by May 15, 2020 (within 94 days of the e-reverse result). However, it failed to issue the LOI within these timelines despite the regular follow-up by the winning developers and requested an extension of the bid period validity on various occasions. 
NSEFI said its members duly accepted UPNEDA’s request and have also been extending the EMD (the EMD submitted is valid till June 30) along with an extension of the bid validity period to enable UPNEDA to issue the LoI. Despite this, UPNEDA communicated to the developers that the tender was canceled, stating their bids had become time-barred and infructuous as they didn’t take any action for the bid period extension. 
The bid cancellation follows the discovery of much lower tariffs in subsequent auctions by different States, and appears to be a deliberate move by UPNEDA to avoid paying power prices which now appear unjustifiably high. 
“UPNEDA failed to issue the LOI for the reasons only known to it,” NSEFI said, adding the authority cannot cancel it at this stage unilaterally. 
“There has been an increasing trend among the states towards cancellation or re-negotiation of the bids (e.g., power purchase agreement renegotiation by Andhra Pradesh, tariff discount negotiation by Punjab, and Dholera LoI cancellation by Gujarat), as per their convenience, making it difficult for companies to execute projects in India,” stated NSEFI. “This uncertainty will affect the foreign direct investment in the solar sector and therefore India’s renewable energy journey and targets.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/03/ihsm-clean-energy-insights-high-module-prices-and-shipping-costs-jeopardize-2021-installation-outlook/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JUNE 3, 2021",IHSM clean energy insights: High module prices and shipping costs jeopardize 2021 installation outlook,"IHS Markit currently maintains its 181 GW installation forecast for 2021. Our down case scenario for 2021 is 156 GW (down case still 9% growth Y-o-Y) with demand spill over to 2022 and uneven impact of higher costs across different markets.
The current environment poses a significant threat, but it is too early to tell what the consequences will be since the solar industry has faced other crisis before (e.g. COVID-19 in 2020) and showed extreme resilience and continued growth despite all challenges.
The price on module raw materials started to rise in July 2020 and has significantly impacted module costs from Q4 2020. Market expectation was that production costs would decline from the second quarter of 2021, dropping module quote prices, but we have seen just the opposite. The supply chain is experiencing further price peaks for some materials in Q2 2021 including polysilicon, copper, or steel, among others. The rise of raw materials is putting additional pressure on module makers who are only passing part of this higher cost into customers and adjusting utilization rates to control the rise of materials due to an overheated market.
In this high-price PERC environment, we are seeing a revival of demand for multicrystalline BSF, a technology that was being phased out, and that has seen its demand and prices increase in some utility markets (e.g. India, Middle-East) and even in C&I applications. The IHS Markit view is that this increase in demand and prices for BFS multi is a short-lived phenomenon triggered by extraordinarily high PERC prices and multi will continue its phasing out in 2022, remaining a product for some niche markets due to lower efficiencies.
While the trade imbalance between China and Western markets is not a new phenomenon, the rapid surge in goods demand in Western markets from very low demand during lockdowns to high demand during relaxations of COVID-19 restrictions and reopening of economic activity has caused serious challenges to logistics. Freight costs have increased 3-4 times in the last 3 quarters for shipments from China to Europe or the Americas and IHS Markit projects the situation will not dramatically improve this year.
This is a global phenomenon that is impacting all industries (semiconductors, automotive, consumer electronics…). The most recent IHS Markit global survey of manufacturers found that the stretching of supply chains in the last quarters has extended delivery times to the highest level in more than 20 years of data availability with delays being most pronounced in Europe, United States, and Taiwan. Solar PV is one of the most impacted due to the high concentration of manufacturing in China. Freight costs and long lead times might challenge solar project completions in 2021, delaying projects to 2022. Higher freight costs are also impacting other system components like trackers, which are a high-weight and low-value component, with final impact on total system CAPEX.
In this high-price environment that started in Q3 2020, international developers are putting off procurement in the hope that equipment and freight prices will be lower in 2022. Extreme volatility in raw materials, module prices and freight costs are not helping manufacturers nor developers to close contracts whose terms change on a weekly basis.  Given long lead times, if procurement is delayed beyond the summer, the risk to the 2021 installations outlook will become a reality.
In previous years, if demand slowed down around the summer and inventories grew, this triggered a price decline that quickly reactivated the procurement process. This year, however, even if inventories start growing and manufacturers would be willing to scarify margins, this would still have a small impact on the total module cost for a developer. Module costs for a developer will still be high due to the unchanged high cost of freight that will remain flat or could even increase in the second half of the year with the reactivation of economies in Europe and the United States.
High component and high freight costs are having a direct impact on CAPEX and project IRRs, which is expected to continue in H2 2021. This could be the first year where global average solar CAPEX might not decline after major Y-o-Y reductions in the last decade. Although developers are trying to delay procurement as much as possible, there is a significant part of the project pipeline under PPA contracts or schemes that require completion in 2021. In some cases, developers are accepting lower IRRs than originally forecast. In others, EPCs might decide to pay penalties for project delays – which could represent a lower cost than proceeding with building on time in the current price environment. The final decision depends on a variety of factors (company type, contract terms, possibility to lower other CAPEX contributors, etc) and cannot be generalized.
IHS Markit forecasts that Europe and India are the regions that are at a higher risk of underperformance. Europe faces the highest risk of being the most impacted by high component pricing, costly shipping, and long lead times since regional market growth hinges on the progression of the highly sensitive utility-scale segment and many contract negotiations and shipments are now paralyzed. The US market is at a lower risk since it is less price sensitive, but it is also being impacted by long-lead times and the surge in freight costs and higher prices that could push some project completion to 2022.
Finally, despite a low-connection first quarter, mainland China—unburdened by shipping challenges—should stay on course to grow on a Y-o-Y basis. However, IHS Markit remains cautious that additional module price increases, some recent bidding prices reached higher than 1.70 RMB/W, could put at risk the 2021 installation forecast that is strongly skewed to the second half of the year.
