India ranks third after the US and China in terms of the size of the startup ecosystem. It has more than 61,000 startups recognized and registered as of January 2022. At the COP26 in Glasgow, the nation pledged to take several measures to decarbonize its economy towards achieving Net Zero in 2070.
The report states that given the pace at which the country needs to ramp up renewables, reducing emissions while adapting to extreme weather events is an uphill climb. India should enable the startup community to play its part in meeting India’s targets.
Currently, most of the startups in India are concentrated in the IT sector, with most in the clean-tech sector either in renewable energy or EVs.
The report observes that funding is available for very early-stage ideas mainly as grants, and for startups that have broken through to establish their business model. It highlights the need to support startups to scale from their initial prototype to being ready to enter the market.
“Our analysis shows us that there is the need for climate tech to receive dedicated backing, especially during the “missing middle” to enable startups to scale technology underpinning a sustainable planet. Ultimately climate-tech startups can help drive systemic change in the fight against climate change,” says Akhilesh Magal, director, ClimateDot.
A clear impetus by the Indian Government on startups through various schemes such as the Startup India Scheme, Atmanirbhar Bharat among others, have helped startups flourish in India. However, these are focussed around Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, and a few universities.
The report states policymakers need to ensure financial support and provide the right ecosystem to accelerate climate tech innovation geographically distributed across India.
Europe is one of the fastest-growing regions globally for climate tech. The report recommends India can explore a model like the European Union’s European Institute of Technology (EIT InnoEnergy) model. The European Commission initially supported this fund to accelerate climate tech startups, but the fund now operates and finances itself independently. India can adopt and tailor this model to integrate it with Startup India.
“There is a need for accelerated and deep decarbonization. While India has mainly relied on domestic sources for its renewable energy projects, there is a need for a significant fund flow into the country to enable the energy transition. At COP26, India announced the need for one trillion dollars towards climate finance. Climate-tech startups can facilitate the flow of funds domestically and internationally,” said Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends.
This report becomes particularly relevant in the context of the Copenhagen Accord where developed countries agreed to mobilise $100 billion annually and still remains a promise to be fulfilled.

(formerly Neyveli Lignite Corp.) has opened bids to set up 500 MW of solar projects on a turnkey basis, connected to the interstate transmission system (ISTS) at any location in India.
The projects are tendered under the Open category, allowing the use of solar cells and modules of any origin.
Installers can bid for any capacity from a minimum 100 MW to 500 MW, in multiples of 100 MW.
The work includes getting approval for connectivity and long-term access and obtaining government land, as well as the design, engineering, and commissioning of the total awarded capacity of a minimum 100 MW solar project to the respective contractor.
It will also include associated power evacuation systems up to the delivery point at an ISTS/central transmission utility substation and operation and maintenance support for three years.

The company shipped close to 10% of the overall 17,105 MW (DC) module supplies in India in the calendar year 2021, as per JMK Research’s Annual India Solar Report Card for CY2021. Its annual sales in the nation were boosted by an increasing demand from the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment, with businesses opting for rooftop solar to save on their electricity bills.
In Q1 2022 alone, Trina shipments to India surpassed 1.5 GW, making it the nation’s second-largest panel supplier, next only to JinkoSolar, during the quarter, according to JMK Q1 2022 RE Update.
“Solar modules for commercial and industrial (C&I) businesses accounted for 60% of Trina Solar’s shipments to India last year and in 2022’s first quarter, while about 40% of shipments were for utility-scale projects,” said Gaurav Mathur, India director for Trina Solar.

Some parts of India have been experiencing power outages, especially during the heat wave. Diesel-powered generators were once a popular alternative but are now proving even more costly due to rising oil prices.
Turning to solar energy also helps companies to reduce their carbon footprint and is in line with India’s pledge to achieve a target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070.
The company’s bestselling modules last year were the Vertex 540W and Vertex 550W, indicating Indian consumers’ shift toward higher power, higher efficiency modules.
“Trina Solar shipment volume in the first quarter of 2022 is at historic highs…We are positioned in India as a high-quality brand of module known for its high standard of after-sales service,” said Mathur. “We have strong customer relationships..the majority of the sales and customer support team have been with Trina Solar for more than seven years.”
Trina has now started selling its Vertex 670W module. This module has an efficiency of up to 21.6% and is among the highest power wattage offered in the market currently.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/26/comparing-performance-of-transparent-solar-windows-to-traditional-windows/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 26, 2022",Comparing performance of transparent solar windows to traditional windows,"From pv magazine Global
In the IN2 NEXT project, PV-coated windows from NEXT Energy Technologies were tested against traditional commercial windows, tracking performance based on their respective solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), an industry-standard performance metric for commercial windows. The results show that NEXT Energy’s technology could lower the SHGC from an otherwise equal window to below .20.
NEXT Energy is a Calif.-based company that is developing transparent energy harvesting window technology. The goal is to enable glass facades to be turned into producers of low-cost, on-site, renewable energy for buildings. NEXT Energy participated in a multi-year photovoltaic window project as part of the Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator (IN2), which measured the overall energy-efficiency performance of NEXT Energy transparent PV windows compared to traditional commercial windows.
Commercial buildings account for 36% of all US electricity consumption at a cost of more than $190 billion annually. Additionally, windows represent 30% of a commercial building’s heating and cooling energy, costing US building owners about $50 billion annually, according to DOE. Considering the potential savings, in addition to energy generation, lowering the SHGC to .20 is significant. SHGC measures the amount of heat, or solar gain, created by sunlight passively entering buildings through windows. Excessive solar gain can lead to overheating within a space and inefficient energy management throughout a building.
“These are extremely significant results for the energy efficiency of insulating glass. Achieving a SHGC below .20 while providing neutral aesthetics has been a monumental challenge for all of us that create vacuum deposition architectural coated glass. Balancing performance and appearance is the heart of ideal harmony and it appears NEXT has done just that,” said Garret Henson, vice president sales and marketing at Viracon, a manufacturer of architectural glass for commercial buildings in North America.
In making NEXT Energy’s windows, the PV technology is enabled by proprietary organic semiconducting materials that are earth-abundant and low-cost, the company reports. This material is coated uniformly onto glass as an ink in a high-speed, low-cost, low-energy process, enabling the glass to harvest the sun’s light and convert it into electricity rather than heat.
“The results of the collaboration with NEXT give us data on how to redefine ways architects and building owners measure the performance of commercial windows,” said Trish Cozart, program manager of IN2 and director of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center at NREL. “If you can generate substantial amounts of electricity with a building’s windows, it can mark a new chapter. Now, the goal is the evaluation of SHGC to account for impacts of power generation as well as solar heat gain.”
