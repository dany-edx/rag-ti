https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/18/wafer-formats-continue-to-evolve/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"AUGUST 18, 2023",Wafer formats continue to evolve,"From pv magazine 07-08/23
Cost reduction and efficiency improvement are the shared pursuits of the PV industry, with the former of vital importance in the wafer sector. Manufacturers strive to seek the best wafer thickness and format, leading to the current technology roadmaps for fabricating thinner and larger wafers.
With tier-1 manufacturers taking the lead, the mainstream thickness of positively-doped, p-type wafers now sits at 150 microns and the typical thickness of n-type wafers is 130 microns.
While wafer thickness appears to be gradually unifying, wafer size and shape is a different story. Between 2013 and 2017, 156 mm “M0” and 156.75 mm “M2” wafers dominated the market upon the emergence of aluminum back surface field solar cell technology.

In 2018, the switch to mono PERC (passivated emitter rear contact) technology began a fast-changing wafer-format landscape as manufacturers sought cost optimization. By 2019 and 2020, there were numerous formats available on the market. Today, M6 (166 mm), M10 (182 mm), and G12 (210 mm) wafers account for appreciable market shares, with the latter two the most widely adopted.
When large-format wafers were still nascent, module makers did not reach a consensus on module specs, posing more problems to their raw material suppliers. In September 2021, Longi, Jinko, and JA Solar came to an agreement for modules based on 182 mm cells, with 72-cell, 2,278 mm by 1,134 mm being the most mainstream spec, ramping up the unification of module design across the industry.
Increasing wafer area improves module efficiency and reduces balance of system (BOS) costs and the overall levelized cost of energy for solar. Initially, vertically integrated companies with wafer production capacity adjusted wafer formats to achieve the highest module output. For instance, Longi introduced 182 mm by 183.75 mm wafers using triangle ribbon and flat ribbon segmentation, and JA Solar launched 182 mm by 185.3 mm pieces using gapless flexible interconnection technology. Henceforth, the combination of “rectangular wafers” and “high-density encapsulation” became a focus of the industry for future development.
Having attempted to make the most use of module area while keeping the module spec of 2,278 mm by 1,134 mm, module makers came to realize that the original format did not fully utilize shipping containers. They adjusted the length of modules as a result, coming up with varying specs to accommodate larger wafers.
Module makers kept the width at 1,134 mm to stack two arrays of pallets in a 40 ft shipping container without exceeding the door opening height. In addition to the original spec of 2,278 mm for modules with a higher cell count, manufacturers also innovated while keeping the length within 2,386 mm, in order to house 20 pallets in a 40-foot cube container. Considering EU structural design standards the “Eurocodes,” some tried to keep the length of modules with smaller cell counts within 2 m.
The resulting myriad of wafer formats brings chaos and inconvenience to the PV industry. Non-vertically integrated companies selling or buying customized wafers are having a hard time. Wafer makers have to negotiate orders for rectangular wafers in each format, while cell and module makers struggle to sell leftover customized products. Adjusting fixers or encapsulant, glass, and other components pushes up costs, testing the supply chain management ability of manufacturers.
End users must track the changes of module specs because such diversification complicates system design and management. Once module specs change, customers have to adjust their BOS equipment accordingly, including the distance between mounting holes, the tracking systems, and inverters. Dispatching solar module supply also becomes more difficult for them.
Despite the heterogeneity, and the absence of an official announcement from any module maker, this year’s SNEC and Intersolar Europe trade shows featured modules from leading manufacturers comprised of rectangular wafers that displayed a smaller disparity in specs.
The length of 45-cell and 48-cell modules still varied between 1,722 mm, 1,762 mm, and 1,780 mm, however. As for 66-cell and 72-cell modules, in addition to the regular 2,278 mm by 1,134 mm, there was also a gain in popularity for 2,380-something mm by 1,134 mm devices. In mid-June, nine manufacturers were reportedly on board for unified module specs, paving the way for the future standardization of modules.

Iberdrola has started the filling process for the Alto Tâmega reservoir, a significant part of Portugal’s largest pumped hydroelectric storage installation. This project includes Alto Tâmega, which has a capacity of 160 MW, alongside Gouvães, an 880 MW pumped storage plant, and the 118 MW Daivões section. All three facilities have been operational since 2022.
The completion of the Alto Tâmega dome dam – characterized by its double curvature design and height of 104.5 meters, with 220,000 cubic meters of concrete – marks a significant milestone. With this phase accomplished, attention now shifts to the filling of the Alto Tâmega reservoir. This strategic step will facilitate the harnessing of water resources for the generation of renewable electricity at the Alto Tâmega power plant, which is strategically situated at the base of the dam.
Elaborating on the technical details, Iberdrola highlights the recent closure of the river diversion tunnel. Over the coming three months, a substantial 28-meter-long concrete plug is set to be meticulously constructed within the tunnel, a critical measure aimed at ensuring the comprehensive and enduring closure of the diversion tunnel for the entirety of the facility’s operational lifespan. Throughout this three-month period, the river’s flow will continue its circulation through the dam’s bottom outlets, maintaining a continuous natural rhythm.
“The Tâmega hydroelectric complex is one of the largest energy initiatives in Portugal’s history,” said Iberdrola.

Scientists at the University of Rome Tor Vergata have developed a perovskite solar cell for indoor applications such as autonomous wireless sensors, low-power consumer electronics, smart homes, domotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
“All these elements require efficient and easy-to-integrate energy harvesting devices to power them,” researcher Thomas M. Brown told pv magazine. “Indoor photovoltaic power sources, on ultra-thin bendable substrates, will have the potential to facilitate these technological innovations if they can provide sufficient energy under indoor illumination rather than the sun.”
The research team built the cell with a substrate made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
“Compared to other plastic substrates such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), PET offers greater UV durability and is six times more cost-effective,” Brown explained. “These qualities position it as the transparent polymer substrate of choice for plastic electronics.”
The researchers constructed the cell using a sequence of layers, including a PET substrate, an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL), a perovskite absorber, a tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) layer, a Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer (HTL), and a top electrode made of gold (Au).
The incorporation of TBAB atop the 3D perovskite matrix helped to reduce defect density and enhance the stability of the overall bulk 3D perovskite structure.
“This, in turn, reduces trap-assisted recombination which is critical for efficient carrier collection in indoor low-light conditions since the photogeneration rate of carriers is low,” the researchers said. “The overall result is a considerable enhancement in device performance.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 32.5%. It also maintained more than 80% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 bending cycles.
“The resulting PV cell has 1.4 times higher carrier lifetime, one order of magnitude lower leakage currents, and 3 times lower defect densities, suppressing recombination,” the group stated.
The researchers described the solar cell in “Highly Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells on Polyethylene Terephthalate Films via Dual Halide and Low-Dimensional Interface Engineering for Indoor Photovoltaics,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. The research team includes scientists from the University of Guilan in Iran, GreatCell Solar Italia, the Centre for Hybrid and Organic Solar Energy (CHOSE), the Institute of Crystallography (IC-CNR), the Institute of Nanotechnology (CNR NANOTEC), and the University of Salento.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/18/advancing-circular-economy-in-photovoltaics-the-hot-knife-pv-module-recycling-method/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"AUGUST 18, 2023",Advancing circular economy in photovoltaics: The Hot Knife PV module recycling method,"From pv magazine Global
Recycling has emerged as a pivotal element in forging a circular economy within the photovoltaic (PV) industry, enabling a sustainable and resource-efficient future. While the durability of PV modules presents a challenge for recycling efforts, a novel solution has surfaced in the form of the Hot Knife method. Collaborating with a leading technology manufacturer, Task 12 of the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) has released a new report, offering a comprehensive environmental life cycle assessment of this innovative PV recycling technique.
Recycling: A Cornerstone of Circular Economy for PV
As the number of decommissioned PV modules increases, the responsible management of end-of-life modules becomes essential to minimize waste and maximize resource recovery. Recycling not only conserves valuable materials but also significantly reduces the industry’s environmental footprint, making it a critical driver of sustainable growth.
PV modules are engineered to withstand harsh environmental conditions for decades, showcasing the robustness and longevity of these devices. However, this very durability creates challenges in the recycling process. Among the most formidable obstacles is the intricate task of separating the glass from other layers of the module. Traditional recycling methods often struggle to efficiently and economically delaminate PV modules, necessitating a different approach.
Introducing the Hot Knife Method: A Novel Solution
The Hot Knife method stands out as a cutting-edge and innovative solution to the delamination challenge. By utilizing thermal treatment, this novel technique melts the polymers that bind the glass to the ‘cells/Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)’ backsheet, facilitating the separation process. Preliminary treatment steps also achieve the removal of the junction box, cables and aluminum frames. The materials that can efficiently be recovered are aluminum and glass sheets, as opposed to contaminated crushed glass, which is the product of other recycling techniques.  Other components sold for further treatment/recovery include the copper cables and cells/EVA backsheets. As a result, the Hot Knife method not only streamlines recycling efforts but also demonstrates the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with recycling.
IEA PVPS Task 12 Collaboration: Assessing the life cycle related environmental impacts
Recycling processes are most valuable if their contribution to the overall system environmental footprint is low. IEA PVPS Task 12, in collaboration with a prominent PV technology manufacturer, embarked on the journey to assess the environmental impact of the Hot Knife method.
The report “Life Cycle Assessment of Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Module Delamination with Hot Knife Technology” delves into the comprehensive scope of life cycle assessment, encompassing all stages of the Hot Knife recycling process. From material extraction to module manufacturing, usage, and eventual recycling, the LCA offers a holistic evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with the Hot Knife method. The environmental impacts caused by the delamination process are attributed to the materials recovered and compared to the environmental impacts caused if these materials were produced from primary resources.
The findings of the report underscore the impressive environmental efficiency of the Hot Knife method. It efficiently recovers aluminum and glass and separates the backsheet (containing cells/Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)). Based on measured data from the manufacturer, the use of this technology contributes 0.3% or less to the life cycle related environmental footprint of PV electricity in any impact category. Additionally, compared to the environmental impacts of virgin materials, the environmental impacts of recovered materials are lower by 80-98% depending on the impact category. Notably, the recycling process significantly reduces energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and the overall environmental footprint compared to corresponding primary materials. Additionally, the recovery of valuable materials highlights the potential for greater resource efficiency within the PV industry.
Due to the high environmental efficiency, the technology is now being used in one of the largest commercial scale PV recycling facilities in the world (by ENVIE in Saint Loubès, France), as well as some facilities in Japan. Through this early experience, further improvements, such as gains in energy and consumables efficiency are to be expected as this technology is deployed in other applications and upscaled to larger volumes.
Conclusion
As we strive to build a cleaner, greener future, embracing PV recycling emerges as a fundamental pillar in the transition towards a sustainable energy landscape. As proven by the Task 12 report, the Hot Knife method represents an innovative approach to address the challenges of PV module recycling in an environmentally efficient way. Certain aspects however had to be excluded from the Task 12 study due to the lack of available data, including the treatment of copper cables, the treatment of the backsheet and the recovery of copper and silver during these treatments. These processes still need to be added in a future life cycle assessment study.
