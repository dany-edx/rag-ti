This will enable the replacement of high-cost fossil fuel based energy with cheaper renewable energy under the existing PPAs. The gains from the bundling of renewable energy with thermal will be shared between the generator and distribution companies or other procurers on a 50:50 basis. As the renewable energy will be balanced with thermal energy, the DISCOMs will now need not acquire any separate capacity for balancing of renewable energy.
“This is a very significant step towards achieving the goal of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. The distribution companies will be able to count the renewable energy supplied under the scheme towards their renewable purchase obligation and this will be without the financial burden of separate PPA. This step by the Central Government will lead to a faster energy transition and will be beneficial for both the generators and the distribution companies,” read the power ministry statement.

The conference was organized by India’s ministry of heavy industries to discuss and address the bidders’ queries.
Last month, the Ministry of Heavy Industries had invited bids to develop a cumulative 50 GWh of advanced-chemistry battery cell manufacturing units in India under its production-linked incentive scheme with an outlay of INR18,100 crore. The selected bidders would be supported with fiscal benefits in the form of a cash subsidy for production.
To be eligible for the government subsidy, the bidder would have to commit to setting up an advance-chemistry cell manufacturing facility between 5 GWh and 20 GWh capacity within five years from the date of appointment. Further, it must commit to a value-addition of a minimum 25% within two years from the appointed date and a minimum of 60% within five years from the appointed date, at the mother unit level in case of an integrated unit, or the project level through indigenous manufacturers, in a hub and spoke structure. 
The pre-bid conference received wide participation and interest from bidders both in person and virtually with around 100 participants from about 20 companies.

NTPC and Indian Oil have come together for the generation and storage of renewable energy or other forms of energy, including gas-based power, primarily to cater to Indian Oil refineries or other installations.
This partnership between the two leading national energy majors of India will support the country’s commitment to achieve renewable energy targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Gurdeep Singh, chairman and managing director, NTPC, said, “NTPC is taking various steps to make its energy portfolio greener by adding significant capacity of renewable energy sources so that our non-fossil fuel-based capacity will become equal or greater than our thermal portfolio by 2032. Through this MoU, the strengths of both the organizations can be leveraged to achieve the aim of the country to meet its net-zero commitments.”
Shrikant Madhav Vaidya, Chairman, Indian Oil, said, “As a global energy major, environmental priority is being weaved into every business aspect of Indian Oil and now, we intend to use green energy to power new projects and refinery expansions.”
NTPC Ltd, India’s largest integrated energy company, has an installed capacity of 67,657.5 MW (including 13,425 MW through JVs/Subsidiaries) comprising 47 NTPC stations (23 coal-based stations, seven gas-based stations, one hydro station, one small hydro, 14 solar PV and one wind-based station) and 26 joint venture stations (nine coal-based, four gas-based, eight hydro, one small hydro, two wind and two solar PV).

He will be visiting the city to launch several projects on the birth anniversary of Veerangana Maharani Lakshmibai. 
The mega solar park will be developed by state-owned hydropower producer THDC in a joint venture with the Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (UPNEDA) under the ultra-mega renewable energy park scheme of the ministry of new and renewable energy. The JV company, TUSCO, will get central financial assistance at INR 20 lakh per MW or 30% of the project cost, whichever is lower, for the development of the internal infrastructure including the cost of transmission to the central/state transmission utility.
The park will come upon government land and farmers’ land on a lease basis in villages Sujanpura, Jaswantpura, Jalalpura, Pura, and Khadra adjoining Dhasan river in Garoutha tehsil.
NTPC prepared and submitted the detailed project report to both the Solar Energy Corporation of India and MNRE.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/16/chile-wants-to-export-solar-energy-to-asia-via-15000km-submarine-cable/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 16, 2021","Chile wants to export solar energy to Asia via 15,000km submarine cable","From pv magazine International
The Chilean government is planning to build a submarine cable to export photovoltaic energy to China, according to Chilean solar energy association – ACESOL – which cited a statement made by Chilean president, Sebastián Piñera, during the National Meeting of Entrepreneurs (ENADE).
Called Antípodas, the project is aimed at taking advantage of the huge solar potential of the Atacama Desert, which is the world’s region with the highest solar radiation.
Piñera explained that, through the cable, the electricity produced by between 200 and 600 GW of photovoltaic generation capacity may transmit power to Asian countries when it is daytime in Chile and nighttime across the Pacific, or when it is winter in Asia and summer in the southern hemisphere.
“We have the deserts with the highest solar radiation in the world and a gigantic potential for generating clean, renewable and economic solar energy, which we can export during our day to supply Asian countries,” said Piñera.
The president clarified that the idea is particularly ambitious and that just to carry it out requires studies and strategic alliances with large Asian economies. The cable should be about 15,000km long and building a 1,300km cable would cost $2 billion. In addition, it would be necessary to invest in new solar plants since Chile has 3,106 MW of photovoltaic capacity installed, according to IRENA.
In Europe, British company Xlinks announced in the spring that it plans to build 10.5 GW of wind and solar power in Morocco and sell the power generated by the massive plant in the U.K. This would be possible thanks to a 3,800km, high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line. In total, Xlinks expected to invest about £18 billion ($24.1 billion).
In Asia, Sun Cable is leading a consortium that wants to build the Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) project, which would export solar energy from Australia’s Outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link.
