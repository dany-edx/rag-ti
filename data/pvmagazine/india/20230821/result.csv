(PFC), a government-owned non-banking finance company and principal lender to the Indian power sector, recorded its highest-ever net profit of INR 11,605 crore ($1,396.61 million) in FY 2022-23, up 16% from the previous fiscal. The total income stood at INR 39,666 crore.
PFC has a lending portfolio comprising loans to power generation (including renewables), transmission, distribution, and other infrastructure projects.
The company registered double-digit growth of 13% in its loan asset book during FY 2022-23. As a result, its loan asset portfolio surpassed the INR 4 lakh crore mark and stood at INR 4,22,498 crore as on March 31, 2023. PFC also achieved all-time high loan sanctions of INR 2.32 lakh crore and disbursed INR 85,756 crore during the year.
Aligning with India’s green goals, PFC is focusing more and more on finance for renewable energy projects. As on March 31, 2023, its gross loan assets comprised INR 48,198 crore in renewable energy comprising INR 16,251 crore of large hydro projects (>25MW) and INR 31,947 crore other than large hydro projects.
India aims for a non-fossil energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070.
“To achieve India’s energy transition targets, the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, which is presently about 27%, will have to reach 50% by 2030. This requires quadrupling the present solar and wind generation capacity. We would also have to add about 10 GW of pumped storage capacity and over 100 GWh of battery storage to meet the energy-balancing needs. Commensurate equipment manufacturing capacity and evacuation infrastructure also need to be in place,” stated PFC. “Given the huge investment required for decarbonization of our economy, funding of energy transition-related projects will be our mainstay for the foreseeable future.” 
PFC is looking to fund the entire value chain of the energy transition. In addition to the traditional solar/wind projects, it is also exploring bankable projects in renewable equipment manufacturing, energy storage, green evacuation corridors and electric mobility, green hydrogen and ammonia production, and manufacturing of electric vehicles.

On a global scale, the nation ranks fourth in installed renewable energy capacity (including wind and solar power installations), as indicated by the REN21 Renewables 2022 Global Status Report. As part of its commitment at COP26, the country has set an ambitious goal of achieving 500 GW of energy derived from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. This ambitious target represents the largest renewable energy expansion plan worldwide.
Undoubtedly, India has made remarkable progress in renewable energy adoption, but some challenges need to be addressed.
Initial high costs: Solar and wind power technologies often incur higher initial costs than conventional fossil fuel-based power generation. This can deter businesses and individuals from switching to RE despite the long-term benefits.
Intermittency and grid integration: The intermittent nature of solar and wind energy sources poses a significant challenge to seamless integration into the existing grid. The absence of adequate reserve power resources can lead to grid instability and potential blackouts.
Further, the distribution of renewable energy adoption varies significantly among Indian states. Rajasthan accounts for around 20% of the overall RE installed capacity (wind and solar) as of July 31, 2023. A substantial proportion of variable renewable energy (VRE) results in mounting difficulties for the states to integrate these sources into the grid. 
State leaders are apprehensive about potential surplus VRE generation, prompting considerations for increased power export, displacement of coal-fired plants by renewables, or the curtailment of solar and wind power to ensure grid stability. Emerging issues include escalating fluctuations in hourly demand, heightened ramping needs, short-term frequency fluctuations, and localized voltage challenges.
Inadequate grid infrastructure: India’s current grid infrastructure was designed to support conventional fossil fuel-based power generation, which is more predictable and reliable. The integration of renewable energy requires significant upgrades to the grid to accommodate the variability and decentralized nature of these sources.
Land procurement and environmental concerns: Securing large tracts of unobstructed land for renewable energy projects, particularly solar installations, can be complex and time-consuming. Opposition from specific population segments due to environmental damage and land use concerns can further hinder progress. Overcoming these objections requires effective communication and stakeholder engagement.
Government support and incentives: The Indian government has demonstrated a strong commitment to renewable energy by implementing regulations and incentives. Aggressive expansion benchmarks and up to 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) for renewable energy initiatives showcase the government’s pro-renewables stance. Furthermore, the government has put efforts to stimulate green energy, including exempting inter-state transmission system charges for solar and wind power sales and establishing of a renewable purchase obligation trajectory until 2029-30 and Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Parks Scheme to expedite solar projects. 
Declining technology costs: The cost of renewable energy technologies has been on a downward trajectory, enhancing affordability for businesses and individual consumers alike. This trend is expected to continue, bolstering the competitiveness of renewable energy against conventional fossil fuel-based power generation.
Innovations such as battery storage and intelligent infrastructure hold promise for overcoming challenges associated with renewable energy integration.
Growing energy demand: India’s robust economic growth translates to rising demand for energy. This demand provides a substantial market for renewable energy investments, encouraging firms to venture into this sector.
Employment: The renewable energy industry in India has the potential to create significant employment opportunities. As the sector expands, more jobs will be generated, offering individuals a chance to contribute to the sustainable energy transition.
Global leadership potential: With government support, falling costs, and increasing demand, India is well-positioned to emerge as a global leader in renewable energy. The country’s commitment to sustainable development could pave the way for substantial contributions to the global renewable energy landscape.
India’s renewable energy targets are reshaping its energy landscape. The surge in energy demand, coupled with robust economic growth and rising population, underscores the significance of clean energy adoption for homes, businesses, and communities to curb pollution while fostering self-reliance. India can navigate the various challenges to scaling up RE adoption through strategic planning, investments, and collaborative efforts and emerge as a shining example of sustainable energy transformation on the global stage.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/21/siemens-to-open-us-utility-scale-solar-inverter-factory/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 21, 2023",Siemens to open US utility-scale solar inverter factory,"From pv magazine USA
Germany-based Siemens has revealed plans to add manufacturing capacity in the United States, with a new factory that will produce 800 MW of utility-scale string inverters per yeae from 2024. 
The facility, which will be operated by Siemens’ manufacturing partner, Sanmina, will produce Blueplanet string inverters. Siemens acquired Kaco’s inverter business in 2019. At the time of the acquisition, Kaco was already actively producing inverters at the site in Kenosha, Wisconsin. 
Tax credits and demand-side incentives, like the domestic content bonus in the US Inflation Reduction Act, are attracting record levels of clean energy manufacturing to the United States, and the Siemens announcement adds to the growing domestic supply chain. Over the past four years, the German group has invested $3 billion in US manufacturing and other acquisitions. 
“Working with Sanmina to establish this new production line, Siemens is well positioned to address supply challenges our country is facing as we work to localize production for green and renewable infrastructure,” said Brian Dula, vice president of electrification and automation at Siemens Smart Infrastructure USA. 
Kaco Blueplanet inverters range from 110 kW to 165 kW and offer a more modular, transportable option for utility- scale projects than large, containerized central inverters. The inverters are made with a reliable silicon carbide design, are NEMA 4X enclosed, and are compatible with fused, cable-trunking systems, eliminating the need for string-combiner boxes. 
“Single-MPPT inverters are proving to be the preferred choice when it comes to ease of layout and flexibility in design. It is clear that in today’s inverter landscape there is no one multi-MPPT inverter which can provide a satisfactory design for all high-power modules,” said Siemens in a white paper for the inverter. “The Kaco single MPPT string inverter range offers a much easier and more flexible design through the use of DC combiners which is crucial when optimizing your PV module layout.”

Switzerland’s Meyer Burger Technology AG produced 302 MW of its heterojunction solar modules in Freiberg, Germany, during the first half of this year, surpassing its output for all of 2022. The company reported a 71% year-on-year jump in sales to CHF 96.9 million ($110.5 million). It says that it remains financially strong and is capable of proceeding with its production expansion plans.
However, the company is now shifting its strategic focus from Europe to the US market. This transition became evident in July, when its announced plans to establish a 2 GW cell production facility in the United States, alongside an existing module plant.
By combining US module and cell manufacturing, Meyer Burger will benefit from the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit 45X system, a component of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This initiative could potentially provide up to CHF 1.4 billion in cumulative funding from mid-2024 to the end of 2032.
Meyer Burger is capitalizing on the favorable financial conditions in the US market, but it is also actively tackling current market obstacles in Europe. The European market has experienced the entry of Chinese PV manufacturers, introducing 85 GW of solar modules in the first half of this year, frequently at prices below manufacturing costs.
This influx has significantly influenced market dynamics. During the first quarter, Meyer Burger effectively sustained its selling prices at almost consistent levels. However, in the second quarter, the company made price adjustments downwards in reaction to the broader decrease in solar module prices.
Global demand for solar modules is rising, including in Europe, but market conditions are not ideal, according to Meyer Burger.

With the recent selections, DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) has announced investments of more than $122 million in 72 projects since January 2021. “These projects support DOE’s Hydrogen Shot initiative, which seeks to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per 1 kilogram in one decade to grow new, clean hydrogen pathways in the United States,” said the DOE.
A research team from Korea and US, led by Chanho Pak from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in Korea, has developed a novel mesoporous tantalum oxide (Ta2O5)-supported iridium nanostructure catalyst via a modified formic acid reduction method that reportedly achieves efficient PEM water electrolysis.“The electron-rich Ir nanostructure was uniformly dispersed on the stable mesoporous Ta2O5 support prepared via a soft-template method combined with an ethylenediamine encircling process, which effectively decreased the amount of Ir in a single PEMWE cell to 0.3 mg cm–2,” said Pak. The Ir/Ta2O5 catalyst design improved the utilization of Ir, while facilitating higher electrical conductivity and a large electrochemically active surface area. “X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectroscopies are used to demonstrate the strong metal-support interaction between Ir and Ta. The charge transfer from Ta to Ir has confirmed through density functional theory, which leads to enhanced OER activity of Ir/Ta2O5 (ɳ = 0.385 V) over IrO2 (ɳ = 0.48 V). Ir/Ta2O5 presents a higher activity with an overpotential of 288 ± 3.9 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and mass activity of 876.1 ± 125.1 A gIr−1 at 1.55 VRHE,” the researchers wrote in the paper “Electron-rich Ir nanostructure supported on mesoporous Ta2O5 for enhanced activity and stability of oxygen evolution reaction,” which was published in the Journal of Power Sources.
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced that Fidelis New Energy has selected Mason County as the site for a lifecycle carbon-neutral hydrogen production facility called The Mountaineer GigaSystem. “Mountaineer will be implementing the proprietary FidelisH2 technology that enables the production of hydrogen with zero lifecycle carbon emissions from a combination of natural gas, carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) and renewable energy,” said the West Virginia Governor. The project should be built in four phases, each producing over 500 metric tons per day (MTPD) of net-zero carbon hydrogen at an approximate capital cost of $2 billion per phase. The first FidelisH2 train of the Mountaineer GigaSystem should commence operations in 2028. Fidelis New Energy is also working on an onshore CO2 storage facility in Aalborg, Denmark.
