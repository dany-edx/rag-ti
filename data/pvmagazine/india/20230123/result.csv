https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/23/india-can-save-19-5-billion-annually-with-shift-from-coal-to-clean-power/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 23, 2023",India can save $19.5 billion annually with shift from coal to clean power,"India plans to add 76 GW of utility-scale solar and wind power by 2025, leading to savings of up to $19.5 billion a year versus burning coal, according to new research from Global Energy Monitor.
The report says data in the Global Solar Power Tracker and the Global Wind Power Tracker rank India in the top seven countries globally in terms of prospective renewable power. This buildout can avoid the use of almost 78 million tons of coal annually, or roughly 32 GW in coal power plant capacity, which is more new coal capacity than the country has added since 2018.
“Annual savings in India can skyrocket if the coal-to-clean switch matches the country’s ambitions. India plans to add an additional 420 GW of wind and solar power by 2030, which would increase the annual savings from avoiding coal power to more than $58 billion, with total savings reaching $368 billion by 2030,” states the report.
“If India were to bring online all of its planned utility-scale solar and wind projects, it would cost roughly $51 billion. But with a US$19.5 billion annual savings in direct fuel costs, India could pay for this in just two and a half years,” it adds. 
India accounts for 5% of all prospective utility-scale solar power globally, trailing only China, the U.S., and Australia, while placed 17th globally in prospective wind power capacity. 
Shradhey Prasad, project manager for the Global Wind Power Tracker, said, “Save money, slash emissions – India’s switch from coal to clean power is a win-win. A promising step towards meeting the country’s net zero emissions target by 2070, India will be richer and cleaner by quitting coal.”
“Costs for solar and wind power continue to plummet, and compared to volatile fossil fuel prices, renewables present a far better option for building new energy infrastructure.”
 The Global Wind Power Tracker catalogs 21,182 operating utility-scale wind farm phases generating 728 GW in 149 countries, and an additional 5,564 prospective projects that would generate 1,215 GW.
The Global Solar Power Tracker catalogs 6,139 operating utility-scale solar farm phases totaling 366 GW in 152 countries, and an additional 6,532 prospective projects that would have the potential to reach 979 GW. Utility-scale solar accounts for roughly 35% of total global solar capacity with the remaining 65% being residential and commercial installations.

The company also plans to start EV assembly in India by the end of December, with battery technology developed through its Gurugram-based partner iPower
The JV targets to set up over 50 retail outlets across Sri Lanka in the next five years. It will invest about $5 million over the next three years, starting with retail and distribution in the first phase, followed by local assembly and manufacturing in the country in the second phase.
The company’s aggressive plans are part of its strategy to capitalize on the tremendous growth potential for electric two-wheelers in India and Sri Lanka. “Electric scooter sales in India have almost doubled every year. In 2020, 2.5 lakh electric scooters were sold in our country. The sales jumped to 5 lakhs in 2021, 7 lakhs in 2022, and are expected to touch 25 lahks in the next one-and-a-half year,” said Amit Das, founder and CEO of Electric One Mobility.
Arjuna Ranatunga, a former Sri Lankan cricketer and a former Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Govt. of Sri Lanka, has been involved in solar and mini hydro projects for the last few years. “In the last couple of years people struggled with a fuel shortage and economic crisis back in my country [Sri Lanka], for which I decided to enter the electric vehicle segment,” he said.
Dhiraj Tripathi, co-founder and COO, said, Electric One also plans to expand into markets of Africa and the Middle East apart from South Asia.

The minister said the state government would also invest in solar plants and will install 500 MW solar projects during the year 2023-24. Out of the planned 500 MW, 200 MW would be installed by Himachal Pradesh Power Corp. Ltd (HPPCL). Land for 70 MW capacity has been identified and the rest of the sites will be finalized soon. Solar projects up to 150 MW capacity would be installed by HIMURJA through private participation. Priority would be given to natives of the state in awarding these projects. The capacity of the projects will range from 250 kW to 1 MW, he added.
The minister directed the officers to open all the solar projects up to 5 MW capacity for allotment. To ensure financial benefits for the State, he directed HIMURJA to evolve a mechanism for royalty from solar projects above 3 MW capacity. “In case of land being given to state-owned units for developing solar projects, some percentage of land equity may be charged as well,” he added. 
The minister HIMURJA to ensure a 5% premium for the state in each solar power project up to 5 MW and a 10% share in solar power projects of more than 5 MW capacity. HPPCL will appoint a consultant for the preparation of the Detailed Project Report (DPR) and submit the report within a month so that the work on the solar projects could be started. The Department of Energy and HPPCL will also identify sites in other states like Rajasthan where land is available at discounted rates for the installation of mega solar plants.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/23/new-modular-solar-solution-features-cost-cutting-slide-together-system/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 23, 2023",New modular solar solution features cost-cutting ‘slide-together’ system,"From pv magazine Global
Green Energy Systems, a subsidiary of Sydney-based building systems company New Building Systems Pty Ltd., has unveiled its prefabricated modular Solar Waves solution, a PV array in which panels come preassembled on an all-aluminum framing system.
Green Energy Systems Chief Executive Officer Glenn Carless said the design of the Solar Waves system “is revolutionary in that we have increased the strength, achieved a number of new outcomes has dramatically lowered the cost, by simplifying the framework to be a sliding assembly … Our mission was to produce an entirely new system to deploy solar PV. We had two aims: devise a method to get rid of most of the labor out of the system because that is expensive; and to reduce the system down to its bare bones as far as traditional methods of construction and deployment. And that included removing nuts, bolts, screws, rivets, clamps … all of that stuff is gone.”
Carless said the Solar Waves system has been designed to eliminate as much manpower from both the project site and factory as possible with the company having also engineered machinery that allows for the full automation of the in-factory assembly process.
“That’s where we have been able to make some very big inroads in the way of costs,” he said. “We have invented and patented what we believe to be the strongest and cheapest solar deployment system in the world. The complication is all gone. It’s very, very simple.”
The solution is reminiscent of the Maverick technology offered by fellow Sydney company 5B, but Carless said there are significant differences. Solar Waves uses no concrete pre-cast footings and, without changing the assembly, it can be ground mounted, floated on bodies of still water or installed as a waterproof roofing system over car parks or agrisolar applications.

Shintora Kosan, a Japanese water jet product supplier, has developed a new technique for solar module recycling based on its own water jet cutting technology.
Its water jet tech is commonly used in the construction sector. It includes a water generation pump and can reportedly discharge high-pressure water with small amounts of water. It also uses an inverter to minimize power consumption.
Shintora Kosan claims that the new patented water jet for solar panels can peel off and pulverize the solar cells and the backsheet by spraying high-pressure water from the module’s backside, without damaging the glass. After this process is completed, the glass shows no presence of harmful substances or damages of any kind, the company said, adding that it uses a special filtration device to remove wastewater.
Shintora Kosan said it may now cooperate with Japan-based machinery company Sugino Machine to develop equipment based on its water jet technology. It did not disclose any additional technical details.
