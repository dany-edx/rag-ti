The PV project is part of the first phase of Westlands Solar Park in California’s San Joaquin Valley.
Waaree has provided 385Wp and 390Wp mono PERC solar PV modules for the installation at WSP.
The solar modules supplied by Waaree have undergone quality testing at Waaree’s module manufacturing facility, which houses IEC-CB-CTF laboratory for reliability testing and certification.
 Waaree has already supplied over 3 GW solar panels globally and commissioned solar EPC projects in India and Southeast Asia.
Sunil Rathi, director-Sales and Marketing, Waaree Energies Ltd, said, “This order is in line with the Government of India’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat (making India a self-reliant nation) and shows the capabilities of Indian manufacturers to compete in the global market. This order for Westlands Solar Park has brought US$105 million of foreign exchange into our country and created good employment opportunities.”
Emboldened by its sales, Waaree plans to strengthen its base in the USA by opening a local office in California shortly.
WSP is one of the largest permitted solar parks globally, with a 2.7 GW capacity of renewable power. The 250 MW Aquamarine, part of its first phase, is expected to start power generation in late 2021. The solar arrays are being installed on steel posts at the height of 8 to 10 feet above the ground with a maximum tilt angle. Waaree solar panels supplied for this project are made of dark non-reflective materials to reduce glint and glare potential.
Waaree Energies Ltd, the flagship company of Waaree Group, has a solar PV module manufacturing capacity of 2 GW. It provides EPC services too. The company has its presence in over 375+ locations nationally and 68 countries globally.

The plants are to be set up in capacities ranging from 1 kWp to 10 kWp at various places across the State.
The proposed standalone solar photovoltaic power generator/plant comprises solar PV modules of given capacity, with lithium ferro phosphate (LiFePO4) battery bank, PCU with necessary control electronics, interconnecting wires/cables, module mounting structures, necessary grounding/earthing, etc.
The scope of work includes supply, erection, testing, and commissioning of the plants, including comprehensive warranty maintenance for five years.
The estimated cost of the work is INR 42 crore. The project work completion period is four months.
System integrators are also allowed to participate in the bid. To be eligible, the bidder should have continuously supplied and installed off-grid solar power systems/products for 30% of the bid quantity in the last three financial years (2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20).
Only solar modules from the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy are allowed for the plants.

To begin with, it will install a 40MW ground-mounted, grid-connected solar power plant at its Bhatgaon and Bishrampur operating sites in Chhattisgarh. 
The project will be executed through Coal Lignite Urja Vikas Pvt Ltd (CLUVPL), a joint venture of CIL and NLC India. The work was awarded to CLUVPL based on its detailed project report and project management consultancy offer. 
The total cost of the project is estimated at INR 148.60 crore. 
“Under the scope of work, CLUVPL shall provide project report, facilitate tendering work, and also assist South Eastern Coalfields Limited in getting project approval, permits, and related works. The work order mandates that site study, testing, and commissioning should be completed within nine months.” 
Both the solar sites are expected to result in total energy bill savings of INR 40.75 crore annually.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/27/indianoil-to-build-indias-first-green-hydrogen-plant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,INDIA,UTTAR PRADESH",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 27, 2021",IndianOil to build India’s first green hydrogen plant,"IndianOil (Indian Oil Corporation Limited) has announced it will build India’s first green hydrogen plant at its Mathura refinery in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh. The project will strengthen the clean energy offerings of the state-run oil and gas major that has already been pursuing hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen-enriched  hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (H-CNG) and solar.
The company has a wind power project in Rajasthan and plans to wheel that power to the Mathura refinery to produce green hydrogen from water electrolysis.
“Mathura has been selected because of its proximity to TTZ (Taj Trapezium Zone)…the Green hydrogen will replace carbon-emitting fuels used in the refinery to process crude oil into value-added products such as petrol and diesel,” said IndianOil chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya.
The Government of India sees hydrogen as the next big sunrise sector for the nation. India will see a five-fold growth in hydrogen demand by 2050, according to a report by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).
Recognizing hydrogen as an emerging energy vertical, IndianOil has drawn a strategic growth path to focus on its core refining and fuel marketing businesses while making bigger inroads into petrochemicals, hydrogen, and electric mobility over the next ten years. To strengthen its hydrogen capabilities, in February it signed an MoU with Greenstat Hydrogen India, a subsidiary of Greenstat Norway, to set up a Centre of Excellence on Hydrogen.
Vaidya remarked, “Forecasts by various agencies sees Indian fuel demand climbing to 400-450 million tonnes by 2040 as against 250 million tonnes now. This demand surge offers enough legroom for all forms of energy to co-exist. And, while exploring the multiple energy avenues, environmental conscience will be a critical priority for IndianOil. We are pushing ahead with research on carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies.”
IndianOil R&D Centre is undertaking cutting-edge research in all facets of hydrogen, including production, storage and applications like fuel cells. It recently set up a compact reformer plant in Delhi to produce H-CNG and carried out a six-month trial run of 50 buses on the blended fuel.
“Our HCNG experiment in Delhi, wherein we converted 50 CNG BS-IV buses to run on HCNG fuel, has revealed significant benefits in reducing exhaust emissions and improving the fuel economy. Also, with the support of the MoPNG, IndianOil is in the process of setting up one-tonne-per-day capacity pilot plants based on four innovative hydrogen production technologies, and we would also be operating 15 fuel cell buses in the Delhi NCR region along with Tata Motors,” Vaidya said.
IndianOil also intends to enable hydrogen mobility in Gujarat. It will make available the surplus quantities of hydrogen available at the Gujarat refinery with a hydrogen dispensing facility for fuel cell electric vehicles. Initially, this facility will be refuelling 25 buses per day with a ramp-up capability to refuel 75 fuel cell buses per day. The project is expected to be operational soon, running the first set of buses from Gujarat Refinery to the Statue of Unity and other iconic sites in the vicinity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/27/israels-solaredge-launches-expanded-line-of-commercial-inverters/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,ISRAEL,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 27, 2021",Israel’s SolarEdge launches expanded line of commercial inverters,"From pv magazine international
Israel-headquartered SolarEdge has released a new series of inverters for commercial and industrial solar installers with modular designs in multiple variants.
The inverters offer what the company claims are improved uptimes through modularity and independently working units. Due to the modularity of the design, commercial and industrial installers will only need two-person crews to integrate the inverters into their solar arrays. 
A precommissioning feature for in-depth visibility allows installers to fully and automatically validate system components from smartphones before connecting to the grid. SolarEdge’s Synergy Manager enables service without the need to open inverter covers for reconfiguration or maintenance. 
DC oversizing of up to 150% is achievable with the new line of power converters, the company said. The devices also use built-in nighttime potential induced degradation (PID) rectifiers to reduce module performance degradation. Module-level monitoring is additionally integrated into the system. 
Thermal sensors are installed on terminal blocks for both AC and DC connections. The inverters can withstand surges with Type 2 AC and DC surge protection devices, and provide surge event alerts. Automatic NEC-complaint rapid shutdown has also been integrated into the new products.
