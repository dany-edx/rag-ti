The Barcelona-based startup will use ION Energy’s ‘smart’ FS-LT battery management system for its smart electric scooter, the RAY 7.7, which is powered by a 10.7kW motor coupled to a 7.7kWh battery. 
The fixed high-density lithium-ion battery of the e-scooter promises to deliver a top speed of 125km/h and a range of up to 150km with fast charging support. 
“Inherently, lithium-ion batteries are unstable and require dedicated management to prevent damage and degradation of the asset. Battery management systems, also known as the “brain” of the battery, are responsible for the efficiency, safety, and longevity of lithium-ion batteries. The battery management systems’ primary role is to ensure the battery operates within its safe operating area by continuously monitoring its current state and logging performance data in real-time. ION Energy’s ‘smart’ FS-LT BMS delivers on both safety and performance, making it the perfect system to manage the RAY 7.7,” read an ION Energy statement. 
In addition to automotive-grade safety features, the FS-LT BMS is built with wireless smartphone connectivity and compatible with ION Energy’s cloud-based analytics platform. The platform will allow Ray Electric Motors to send over-the-air (OTA) updates to its scooters, continuously improving the asset’s life and performance. 
In its first year, RAY will manufacture a limited set of 1000 vehicles and plans to scale up to a minimum of 10,000 e-scooters by 2023. The company plans to target major metropolitan areas of Europe before expanding to the United States and other regions. 
Started in 2016, ION Energy has supplied its BMS technology for over 60,000 electric vehicles in India and Europe. The company provides its technology to 75+ customers spread across 15+ countries.

Balancing the cost of a cleaning cycle against the revenue lost from dust and dirt soiling a PV panel is often a difficult equation for PV plant operators, one that’s as unpredictable as the weather. Getting it wrong either way can lead to a significant loss of revenue, so there is plenty of interest in the topic and the development of models to predict the effects of soiling and calculate an optimal schedule for module cleaning.
While the soiling profile can vary greatly even between two sites in the same region, there is value in looking at regional data. Scientists led by East West University in Bangladesh analyzed soiling trends in different regions, aiming to provide a global overview of the effects of soiling in different parts of the world, and to develop a model to calculate the best cleaning cycle to optimize project revenue.
The model is described in the paper Global analysis of optimal cleaning cycle and profit of soiling affected solar panels, published in Applied Energy. In their analysis the scientists assumed a project size (yield under 1-sun) of 100 MW, a cost per cleaning operation of US$2670, which it notes is at the lower end of cost estimates for cleaning, and an electricity tariff for the project of US$0.069/kWh – though they note that cleaning costs can be much higher in certain regions, which will affect optimal cycle calculation.
The group was able to show that based on studies of two solar plants located in Saudi Arabia and Chile, calculations from their model fell within 0.1% of the actual numbers, demonstrating the model’s validity to PV project investors.
The study also concluded that there is little value in seasonal variations to cleaning schedules, with only negligible increases in revenue resulting from such optimization. For regions prone to sandstorms, the modeling becomes much more complicated, and the researchers warn that investors should carefully consider the viability of projects in such regions.
And a global level, the model finds the worst soiling conditions in Asia and the Middle East, where even with optimal cleaning schedules implemented  – usually every 5-6 days – soiling losses still amount to around 2.5%. In Europe and North America, a cleaning schedule every 10-12 days is enough to limit soiling losses to below 1.5%.

Research teams at these institutions are developing crystalline silicon solar cells with an efficiency of a minimum 21%, in addition to roll-to-roll perovskite solar cells.
“Under the Ministry’s Renewable Energy Research and Technology Development Programme, various research institutions and industry are provided financial support for carrying out renewable energy research in solar cells and modules with the overall objective of improving efficiency, reducing cost and developing new technologies,” said power minister in the parliament in reply to a query.
Speaking about the beneficiaries, he said, “The Ministry has provided support for developing crystalline silicon solar cell with targeted efficiency of 22% to National Centre for Photovoltaic Research and Education (NCPRE) at IIT Bombay; roll-to-roll perovskite solar cells to IIT Bombay; and PERC solar cells with targeted efficiency of 21% to Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Gurugram,” he added.
To attract investments in the solar manufacturing sector, a Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Cell and a Project Development Cell have been created in the MNRE. Further, to enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities and exports, the Government has approved the introduction of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme in ten sectors, including high-efficiency solar PV modules. The scheme provides an INR 4,500-crore outlay for high-efficiency solar modules.
Perovskites
In terms of cell design and processes, perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology is very close to dye-sensitized solar cells and organic solar cells. There is more than one process to produce perovskite solar cells. In its simplest method, PSCs can be manufactured by roll-to-roll coating, including well-known technologies such as slot die, spray coating, and ink-jet printing, or through evaporation. This process essentially eliminates the need for wafer manufacturing and other related processes used in crystalline silicon (c-Si) cells.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/11/andhra-pradesh-inching-towards-10-gw-solar-for-farming-needs/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ANDHRA PRADESH",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 11, 2021",Andhra Pradesh inching towards 10 GW solar for farming needs,"The successful auction for the development of 5.8 GW solar power plants, out of the 6.4 GW tendered by the state-owned Andhra Pradesh Green Energy Corporation Limited (APGECL), is a positive move as it will allow the supply of uninterrupted, free power during the daytime to the farmers, according to data analytics company GlobalData.
The move forms part of the state government’s strategy to achieve 10 GW solar target for the farming needs of Andhra Pradesh. The state government approved the proposal last year as it has been incurring more than Rs 10,000 crore to meet the agriculture subsidy, lift irrigation power charges, and aquaculture subsidy every year.
The subsidy has been on a continuous rise over the years with the increasing cost of power supply and also an increase in the number of agricultural pump set connections.
The successful bidders of the auction are Adani Renewable Energy Holding Twelve Limited (2.4 GW), Shirdi Sai Electricals Limited (2.2 GW), NTPC Limited 0.6 GW), Torrent Power Limited (0.3 GW), and HES Infra Private Limited (0.3 GW). The tariffs for successful bids were in the range of INR2.47 to INR 2.49 per kWh. A bid from Adani for an additional 600 MW Chandrasekharapuram Solar PV Park in Prakasam district was not finalized yet and is currently under further examination by the committee due to a higher tariff of INR 2.58/kWh.
Pavan Vyakaranam, project manager-power at GlobalData, commented: “The tariffs under the 6.4 GW tender are 52% lower than what the state government is currently procuring at and is set to reduce the financial burden on the government exchequer.”
However, the winning prices failed to be anywhere near the record INR 1.99 per kWh tariff achieved by Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd’s (GUVNL) 500 MW auction in December 2020, as foreign or foreign funded developer did not evince interest.
Vyakaranam said, “It is important for the Andhra Pradesh government to implement these projects and regain investor confidence, especially in light of the cancellation of renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) last year.”
