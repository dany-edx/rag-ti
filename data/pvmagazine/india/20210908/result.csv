Netherlands-based module manufacturer Solarge B.V. has developed a 72-cell monocrystalline solar module for PV systems deployed on flat rooftops with limited weight-bearing capacity.
The Solarge DUO panel is based on M10 PERC cells and weighs 50% less than conventional glass-backsheet panels, with a rooftop load of just 6 kg/m2, the company claimed.
“The module configuration is the typical east-west configuration with 12 degrees tilt angle, which can basically be installed on the roof in any desired orientation,” CCO Huib Van der Heuvel told pv magazine. “The mounting system is fixed to the roof by means of roofing anchors, eliminating the need for ballast.”
The product measures 2,327 mm x 1,137 mm x 14 mm and weighs in at 14.5 kg, or 5.5 kg/m2. It features a power output of 500 W, an open-circuit voltage of 49 V, a short-circuit current of 12.4 A, and a fill factor of 0.78%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.39% per degree Celsius and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V. The operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 to 85 C.
Solarge offers a 10-year product warranty and a 20-year power output guarantee. Annual linear degradation over 20 years is guaranteed at a maximum of 0.5 %.
The manufacturer is currently producing the modules through a pilot line at its manufacturing facility in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands. It is now completing the financing of a high-volume manufacturing plant, which is scheduled to open by mid-2022 in the Netherlands. Commercial operations are scheduled to start in the second half of next year.
“Next to the low weight, the sustainability performance of this innovative solar panels are remarkable,” Van der Heuve said. “The product will have a CO2 footprint which is 80% lower than conventional solar panels and the panel is completely circular in design and uses no Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) materials, unlike all other solar panels that use a polymeric film instead of glass.”

Transportation accounts for approximately 28% of global energy demand, and approximately 24% of global CO2 emissions. 
India has a massive and diverse transport sector, which is also the third most CO2 emitting sector, according to a report published by The International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2020. This makes it imperative for the country to accelerate the advancement and adoption of sustainable mobility solutions like electric vehicles. Its adoption will help India curb the rapidly rising pollution and energy consumption.
The good news, however, is on the horizon, as there are now more electric vehicle models available than ever before with the private sector driving a global shift away from automobiles relying on more traditional sources of fuel. These shifts can have an impact on not only the environment, but could also bring about new entrepreneurial ecosystems, the technological innovation that goes beyond the transportation sector, and social benefits. 
India’s Electric Vehicles industry has grown in recent times, thanks to new manufacturing hubs and an increased need for upgraded charging infrastructure. The India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) also asserts that the Indian EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 36% by 2026.
“Transitioning to cleaner transportation systems is important considering the economic, social and environmental impact to meet sustainable development goals for transport policies, planning, and operation,” said Simay Akar, an IEEE member and member of the IEEE Transportation Electrification Community, a cross-disciplinary working group that coordinates the activities of 11 IEEE societies and other groups in the electric transportation sector. Members of the IEEE TEC innovate and collaborate across the transportation domain on the battery technology, electronic controls, sensors, and power grid innovations that will support advances in electric cars, ships, rail, and aircraft.
While the transition to cleaner transportation systems will not happen overnight, there are key emerging technologies enabling this shift to occur. 
1.      Batteries are getting less expensive. New research and economies of scale are driving down the cost of electric vehicle batteries so much that they may soon be less expensive than gasoline-powered vehicles.
2.      Electric vehicle batteries are getting better. Electric Vehicle batteries need to overcome two big challenges: faster charging and increased range. Universities, multinational car-makers, government lab and start-ups across the globe are devoting billions of dollars to this problem. They’re experimenting with different battery chemistries, components and configurations. One promising development: trading carbon-graphite components for nano-engineered materials to increase lithium density.  
3.      Autonomous vehicles may make big improvements. Self-driving vehicles are likely to generate increased demand for transportation, so it’s important that they be developed as electric vehicles. Self-driving cars can use network technologies like 5G, and sensing technologies like LiDAR to help autonomous vehicles choose faster routes for fuel-efficiency or optimize braking and fuel consumption. 
4.      Electric bikes are changing cities. Technology is only one part of the electrification equation. Zero-emissions e-bikes and pay-as-you-go electric scooters are revolutionizing urban mobility. Akar says, “This transition requires redesigning cities to be more bike-friendly. Data analytics technologies can aid smart and green cities planners’ efforts.”
5.      Electric battery recycling is taking off. Lithium-ion batteries are full of rare and expensive elements. While the batteries can have remarkable longevity, they don’t last forever. There’s a new movement to recycle batteries. A new plant in Rochester, NY, may become one of the largest domestic sources of lithium and nickel in the U.S.
6.      “Green” hydrogen is coming closer and closer to commercial reality. Too often, the electricity used to produce hydrogen comes from a coal or natural gas-fired power plant. Increasingly, researchers exploring the use of renewable sources for hydrogen production, like wind and solar, are reporting big jumps in efficiency. That hydrogen could be used to power hydrogen fuel-cell cars and even aircraft. 
7.      Hydrogen can be used as a battery. Renewable energy sources are sometimes curtailed because there isn’t enough demand. Under exploration right now: systems that would use off-peak electricity to generate and store hydrogen for later use.
8.      Hydrogen-EV vehicles are also a big possibility. Electric vehicle batteries at this point can’t match diesel-powered motors used in long-haul trucking. Replacing some of those batteries with hydrogen fuel cells, however, levels the playing field by making the truck lighter. At the same time, the power train can be designed to charge the batteries in transit, so truckers would only have to refuel for hydrogen, reducing the need for lengthy re-charging stops.  
“Technological innovation in transportation and the related industrial and entrepreneurial ecosystems enables technology deployment on cleaner transportation systems,” Akar said. “The demand for electric vehicles will likely rise substantially,” Akar said. “Clean transportation technology improvement promises a cleaner, safer future.”

The project is located at Anchukallumoodu in the Kollam district of Kerala.
The installation uses 68 numbers of JA Solar 540 Wp half-cell mono PERC modules, supplied by Redington Solar, one of the largest solar PV distribution companies in India. Besides, it uses three-phase 27 kW Fronius inverter (model ECO 27.0-3-S) 
The system is an on-grid solar PV system without any battery backup.

“It is designed not to run any specific house load but it is sufficient enough to run even the centralized AC unit of this house. So, in a nutshell, we could say that irrespective of the connected load, this solar system could run any house load connected to it and the electricity generation is more than enough to offset the customer’s monthly electricity bill,” Prabi Prasad, technical director at Maxwatt Solar, told pv magazine. 
“Technically speaking, 1 kWp could easily generate 4 units of electrical energy (kWh) per day. Therefore, 36.72 kWp could generate 146.88 kWh daily but based on our experience with previous systems, you can consider 4.5 kWh instead of 4 kWh. Then it will be 165.24 kWh daily, or 60,312.60 kWh annually.” 
“The daily electricity consumption of our customer’s house is 40 kWh (based on their monthly electricity bill). So the daily electricity generation of 165.24 kWh/day by the solar system will be four times their daily requirement. In this case, the customer will be able to feed this extra 120 kWh/day to the State discom Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd (KSEB), which is a win-win situation for both parties.”

A group of scientists at Utrecht University, in the Netherlands, has assessed the effects of south-oriented, large scale PV plants on vegetation, soil, and microclimate in 13 solar parks in the Netherlands and has found that a distance between panel rows of at least 1.5 times panel height is crucial to create the best environmental conditions.
“Definitely, some solar panel arrangements are better than others,” Merel Soons, professor of plant dispersal ecology and conservation at Utrecht University, told pv magazine. “Our study only included south-oriented solar panel arrays, which are much better for soil and vegetation than east-west oriented solar panel arrays, where light and water are limiting plant growth and soil functioning.”
The analyzed solar parks are located on greenfield land; conventional grassland; terrain pre-sown with flowery herbs; and terrain sown with grassland species. “For the Netherlands, it is the first time that these impacts were evaluated for a broad range of solar parks with different initial land uses,” Pita A Verweij, associate professor in land use and biodiversity at Utrecht, further explained. “In particular, in intensively used pastures and other low-biodiversity starting conditions, we found a biodiversity gain. Initial land use, therefore, matters.”
The two scientists recommend a distance between panel rows of at least 1.5 times panel height. “This would be enough [to leave] sufficient space for vegetation to develop naturally in between panel arrays,” Verweij also stated. “Rather than a lack of moisture or rainfall, the limiting factor for plant growth appeared to be light.”
In the study, the Dutch group explained that the vegetation cover, the species richness, and the Shannon diversity – which characterizes species diversity in a community – were reduced, compared to solar parks’ surrounding areas. It also found that daytime temperatures and temperature fluctuations were lower under the PV modules, and that soil and air moisture levels were higher, compared to the surrounding areas.
The academics also found the species richness and Shannon diversity were reduced on the northern side of the solar panels and vegetation was taller, with a higher vegetation cover, which they linked to higher soil moisture. “South of panel arrays, vegetation and soil parameters were comparable to the control situation without solar panels,” they emphasized.
They also ascertained that lower species richness was strongly dependent on previous land use and was highest in parks with high initial biodiversity value. “It is therefore advised to avoid such areas in solar park allocation,” they highlighted. “By contrast, our findings suggest that enhancement of biodiversity is possible by planning solar parks in areas with low initial biodiversity value, and proper solar park design and management.
In August, the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) presented a new approach for building east-west oriented solar parks, which it claimed can prevent soil deterioration and offer the same yield as south-oriented PV plants.
