The plant will supply electricity under 25-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) at INR 2.69/kWh.
The plant consists of 600 MW solar and 150 MW wind power capacity. It employs bifacial PV modules and horizontal single-axis tracker technology to capture maximum energy from the sun.
“The co-located hybrid power plant shall not only reduce the intermittency of RE power but shall also help the nation in optimal utilization of transmission network,” stated the company.
Earlier, in May 2022, AGEL had operationalized India’s first hybrid power plant with a capacity of 390 MW in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. With the commissioning of this 600 MW plant, AGEL now has a total operational renewable capacity of 6.7 GW, including a hybrid power capacity of 1 GW, the largest in the world.
AGEL has a total renewable portfolio of 20.4 GW, including operating, under-construction, and awarded assets, and targets 45 GW capacity by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/29/emmvee-introduces-545-w-glass-to-glass-bifacial-solar-module/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2022",Emmvee introduces 545 W glass-to-glass bifacial solar module,"Karnataka-based Emmvee has unveiled Sapphire series glass-to-glass bifacial modules at Renewable Energy India Expo 2022. The modules are available in power outputs ranging from 530 W to 545 W, with conversion efficiencies between 20.52% and 21.10% under standard temperature conditions. At low irradiance (200 W/m2, 25 degree Celsius and AM1.5), the module is claimed to yield at least 95% of its STC efficiency. Open-circuit voltage is 49.2-49.75 V, and short-circuit current is 13.56 A to 13.88 A.
Each module is built with 144 mono PERC half cells and ten busbars. It weighs 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm and weighs 30 kg. The modules come with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year linear performance warranty. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2.0%, and the 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.95% of the nominal output power.
Currently, Emmvee has 1.25 GW of module capacity in Karnataka. “We are adding another 2 GW of modules capacity with 1.5 GW of mono PERC and TopCon cell capacity at our existing manufacturing site. This capacity will become operational by December 2023,” Suhas Donthi, director-Sales and Operations at Emmvee India, told pv magazine.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/29/adani-plans-to-have-10-gw-of-polysilicon-to-solar-module-capacity-by-2025/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2022",Adani targets 10 GW of polysilicon-to-solar module capacity by 2025,"Adani Solar, the solar PV manufacturing arm of Adani Group, will have 10 GW of polysilicon-to-solar module manufacturing capacity up and running by 2025. 
Currently, the Indian manufacturer has 2 GW of monocrystalline cell and module capacity in Gujarat. It is executing the expansion and backward integration in stages at its existing manufacturing sites in the state. 
“We will increase our cell and module capacity to 10 GW by 2025, from 2 GW at present. Of the new 8 GW addition, we expect to commission a 2 GW module line in January and the cell line in June next year. This 2 GW addition will be based on n-type TopCon. For the balance 6 GW, we are weighing the pros and cons of technologies like heterojunction and TopCon,” Rahul Bhutiani, head of sales and marketing at Adani Solar, told pv magazine during Renewable Energy India Expo 2022.  
Adani Solar is also setting up 2 GW of ingot and wafer capacity, which will likely become operational by December 2023. The company will scale the ingot and wafer capacity to 10 GW by 2025. Additionally, it will have an equivalent polysilicon capacity ready by June 2025.
At the same location, Adani will house ancillary units for key elements like aluminum frames, glass, junction boxes, backsheet, and trackers. “For ancillary production, we could promote a local entrepreneur by raising a stake and support offtake by using the production for our captive consumption,” said Bhutiani.
