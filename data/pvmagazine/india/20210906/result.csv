Under the partnership, the two companies will collaborate on developing projects for green hydrogen. 
In its Union Budget 2021, the Government of India announced its plan to launch the National Hydrogen Mission. The collaboration between Ayana and Greenstat will accelerate the development of an Indian ecosystem for green hydrogen initiatives. 
Ayana Renewable focuses on the development of utility-scale renewable projects in India. The MoU brings together the development and operating expertise of Ayana in India, along with the technical expertise of the Greenstat Group.
Speaking on the partnership, Shivanand Nimbargi, managing director and CEO, Ayana Renewable Power said, “For India, hydrogen presents a great potential opportunity as it will decrease reliance on fossil fuels and focus on sustainable sources of energy. We anticipate that our initiatives will support the National Hydrogen Mission, to fast-track India’s decarbonization of grid and providing energy storage solutions for the industrial sector, and transportation sector over the next few years.”
Greenstat has already partnered with India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to set up a Centre of Excellence for hydrogen in India and accelerate the deployment of hydrogen technologies in the country.
On the partnership with Ayana, Sturle Pedersen, Chairman, Greenstat Hydrogen India, said, “Leading a broad representation of Norwegian cutting-edge expertise within the hydrogen sector, we are thrilled to be a part of this exciting journey together with Ayana Power, the Indian industry, R&D institutes, and the Indian government. Hydrogen is already a dominant part of the energy value chain worldwide; the challenge now is to revert the energy ecosystem back into its natural evolution. Renewable energy must replace fossil fuels, to preserve our habitat, and to preserve our mobility. Hydrogen is the natural energy carrier representing a vital part of the sustainable energy solution together with sustainable battery manufacturing. We look forward to learning from our partners and sharing our knowledge with great gratitude to our partners.”
Ayana Renewable Power is also backed by CDC Group, the UK’s development finance institution, and EverSource Capital managed Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF). The platform develops utility-scale renewable power solar and wind generation projects across India. To date, Ayana has received equity funding of US$ 721 million; sufficient to scale up its renewable energy portfolio to over 4GW over the next two years. Currently, it has 2.2 GW of solar generation capacity under various stages of development/operation across multiple Indian states, and a strong future pipeline of renewable energy opportunities.

Germany-based solar panel manufacturer OpesSolutions and the Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP have developed a flexible, lightweight standard solar module for vehicle integration that is claimed to be particularly suitable for cargo bikes, as well as for electric buses, trucks and vans.
“For a light commercial vehicle charged with the current electricity mix, integrated solar panels can reduce annual CO2 emissions by up to 890kg and reduce operating costs by providing electricity for refrigeration systems,” the panel maker said in a statement. “In buses, with their large roof areas, integrated photovoltaics can provide up to 100% of the HVAC system’s energy needs – especially helpful when the engine is off.”
Called SolFlex, the frameless panel is based on 22%-efficient solar cells and is designed for high, one-sided heat load. The standard product measures 100x100x2.9cm, weighs in at 3.4kg, and has a power output of 170 W. Its open-circuit voltage is 24.23 V and its short-circuit current is 9.55 A. A customized panel may also reach a power output of up to 600 W and have a size of 3,000×1,200×2.9mm.
The module has, also, a bending radius of up to 15 degrees and a scratch-resistant surface. “Innovative interconnection, integrated bypass diodes and half-cell technology ensure optimum yields even with shading and low irradiation,” the manufacturer further explained, adding that the panel can be produced at lower costs, compared to similar products, as it relies on series production located in Changzhou, in China’s southern Jiangsu province.
Electric cars incorporating PV panels on their bodywork or roof have the potential of reaching more than 10,000km per year of pure solar-powered driving and the modules could have a payback time of only three or four years, according to a recent study from the Netherlands. The 10,000km range, however, is still difficult to reach for most electric cars that are currently on the market, due to their current vehicle energy efficiency. On the other hand, the benefits of vehicle-integrated PV are proportional to the solar radiation levels of a given area, its demand for electric vehicles, and its power prices.
*The article was updated to reflect that the panel size is 100x100x2.9cm and not 100x100x2.9nm, as we previously reported.

The report calculates that if India were to achieve a net-zero target by 2050, solar could occupy 50,000-75,000 square kilometers (km2) of land, while wind could use a further 1,500-2,000 km2 (for the land area directly impacted by turbine pads, sub-stations, roads, and buildings) or 15,000-20,000 km2 (the total project area including space between turbines and other infrastructure).
The amount of land that could be needed for solar is equivalent to 1.7-2.5% of India’s total landmass, or 2.2-3.3% of non-forested land. 
The report’s author Dr Charles Worringham, researcher and IEEFA guest contributor, explains that the higher end of the land-use range is deliberately generous to allow plenty of leeway for planning.
“This is a precautionary approach for the purposes of planning and putting in place smart land-use policies today for future renewable infrastructure,” he says.
Comparing the effects of large-scale renewable expansion to those of meeting electricity requirements from additional coal-fired power, Worringham noted that the locations for renewable energy generation can be chosen using India’s preferred social and environmental criteria and can be widely distributed across the country. 
“Additional coal can only come from already heavily mined districts or from new coal blocks, which are often in significant forest areas and where displacement of Adivasi communities is an issue. 
“Nor does renewable energy permanently alter land and natural resources in the same way as coal.”
The report notes the potential for land-use conflict to arise over renewable energy installations, even in sparsely populated areas, slowing the rollout of infrastructure.
“Whether or not India commits to a mid-century net-zero emissions target, its huge expansion of renewable energy capacity over the coming decades will enhance energy security enormously, but this requires a large amount of land for infrastructure,” says Worringham.
“The energy transition will also require important choices about where this infrastructure should be located. But careful planning and solutions like agrivoltaics, distributed energy systems, and offshore wind can also greatly reduce the potential for renewable generation to conflict with social and environmental values whilst diversifying and strengthening India’s national grid. By bringing more generation closer to both urban and rural loads, transmission costs could also be kept in check.”
The report discusses how to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of land use for the energy transition. Recommendations for policymakers fall into three categories.
1. Minimising total land-use requirements through offshore wind, distributed rooftop solar, and solar on artificial water bodies.
2. Optimizing the identification and assessment of land. Measures include developing clear environmental and social criteria for rating potential sites and undertaking comprehensive independent assessments of potential sites against these criteria in advance of tenders or project proposals. Tenders must be designed to incentivize the use of the highest-ranked locations (those of least environmental and social concern). Further, widely distributed renewable generation at a range of scales must be supported.
3. Increasing the stock of potentially suitable geographically diverse lands by boosting the uptake of agrivoltaics where crops, soils, and conditions are suitable and yields can be maintained or improved. 
Agricultural land has the potential to host a much larger proportion of renewable generation, providing a boost to the rural economy and reducing pressure on other land, according to the report.
Nurturing an Indian agrivoltaics sector could provide benefits to farmers such as a second income stream, says Worringham.
