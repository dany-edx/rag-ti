Under the deal, CubicPV will supply, per annum, 1 GW of Direct Wafer cells to Waaree.
Laureen Sanderson, chief communications officer at CubicPV, told pv magazine, “The cells will be supplied from CubicPV’s 2 GW wafer/cell facility planned in India. The company is in active discussions regarding the factory’s location. Effectively immediately, the five-year agreement – subject to certain terms and conditions and with options for renewal – establishes a commitment for an annual purchase volume of 1 GW of Direct Wafer cells from Cubic’s factory.”
Waaree will begin purchasing cells from CubicPV upon completion of the factory, Sanderson added.
CubicPV was formed from the merger of U.S.-based wafer maker 1366 Technologies and U.S.-based solar technology company Hunt Perovskite Technologies (HPT).
The cells will feature wafers made with CubicPV’s transformative Direct Wafer technology that produces wafers in one-step, directly from a molten bath of silicon. The resulting product is claimed to deliver the world’s lowest cost of electricity today, while offering a significant reduction in carbon footprint over conventional methods.
The CubicPV technology will strategically position Waaree to capture the robust industry growth by delivering the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to the Indian utility-scale market.
“Our Direct Wafer technology is the ideal solution for India’s domestic utility market and Waaree, by choosing this technology over generic methods, is setting the tone for an Indian manufacturing future that makes better use of materials, requires less energy and is defined by high efficiency,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO, CubicPV. “CubicPV is honored to begin our journey in India with Waaree. The synergy between one of the leading module manufacturers in India and Cubic’s innovation agenda will create value for both companies and the solar industry in India.”
The partnership with CubicPV provides Waaree with a domestic supply line and thus a level of immunity with respect to the logistics challenges and volatile commodity pricing that has defined the import market.
 “As an early entrant in the solar industry, Waaree recognizes the value of innovation to our continued leadership position. We believe that CubicPV’s technologies will deliver significant benefit to our customers and to the Indian solar market both immediately and in the long-run. We are proud to bring a module to the market featuring domestically-produced wafers and cells manufactured with a low carbon footprint,” said Hitesh Doshi, Chairman and MD, Waaree.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/28/indias-race-to-175-gw-renewables-slowed-by-key-states-performance/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,RENEWABLE ENERGY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 28, 2022",India’s race to 175 GW renewables slowed by performance of key States,"A report published today by the global think tank Ember reveals that four of India’s states and union territories have already surpassed their 2022 renewable (RE) capacity targets as India chases 175 GW RE by December 2022. But 27 states and union territories are yet to achieve even half of their respective targets and would need a big step up to meet them by the year-end.
The research, titled India’s race to 175 GW, shows that India has installed 110 GW of RE capacity (excluding large hydro) as of March 2022, which is 63% of the 175 GW target. With 54 GW of solar capacity and 40 GW of wind capacity on the grid, the nation is at half its solar power target and two-thirds its wind power target for 2022.
As of March 2022, the states of Telangana (248%), Rajasthan (119%), Karnataka (107%), and the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar (129%) have surpassed their end-of-year targets, while Gujarat (97%) and Tamil Nadu (75%) are inching closer to their targets. Uttarakhand (52%) and Sikkim (66%) are the only other states which have achieved more than 50% of their target.
The report says all states need to contribute as the nation will need 65 GW more in the next nine months to meet its RE target of 175 GW by December 2022. Five key Indian states account for two-thirds of this 65 GW shortfall: Maharashtra (11 GW), Uttar Pradesh (10 GW), Andhra Pradesh (9 GW), Madhya Pradesh (7 GW), and Tamil Nadu (5 GW). 
“Lack of progress in key states is holding back India’s race to 175 GW,” said Ember’s senior electricity policy analyst Aditya Lolla. “Solar and wind deployments need a big push in the coming months to drive India closer to this target.”
Solar needs 85% growth in the next nine months to meet its 100 GW target by the end of 2022. Wind power needs almost a 50% rise in the next three quarters to reach the 60 GW target.
India targets 450 GW of renewables and 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. With 110 GW already installed, the nation needs to deploy 340 GW of new RE capacity (on an average, 42.5 GW RE annually for the next eight years) to meet the 2030 target. It would require the country’s solar capacity to rise five-fold to 280 GW from 54 GW and wind to rise four-fold to 140 GW from 40 GW during this period. This translates to 29 GW of new solar and 12.5 GW of new wind capacity addition every year on average till the end of this decade – a far faster pace than the nation’s record annual addition of 15 GW RE (14 GW of solar and 1 GW wind) in FY 2021-22. 
The report says it is more than possible for India to deliver on its 2030 targets of 450 GW RE or 500 GW non-fossil capacity if all the states are fully engaged and aligned with the national targets.

A group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has fabricated a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell that is able to harvest high-energy photons from a white-hot heat source and convert them into electricity.
The device is described as a heat engine with no moving parts that is able to produce power from a heat source of between 1,900 to 2,400 C. This concept is known as thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) and consists of a low-cost, grid-scale energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity above 2,000 C. “It is a battery that takes in electricity, converts it to high-temperature heat, stores the heat and then converts it back to electricity by TPVs on demand,” the US group explained.
The system was built with two-junction TPV devices comprising III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that were optimized for the planned temperature range and TEGS applications. These cells utilize band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter.
The scientists tested several system configurations and a thermophotovoltaic device with bandgaps between 1.2 and 1.4 eV was found to have the highest efficiency at 41.1% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 C. Another device with a 1.2/1.0 eV bandgap reached a maximum efficiency of 39.3%, at a power density of 1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 C.
The thermophotovoltaic cell should now be integrated into a grid-scale thermal battery. “The system would absorb excess energy from renewable sources such as the sun and store that energy in heavily insulated banks of hot graphite,” the researchers emphasized. “When the energy is needed, such as on overcast days, TPV cells would convert the heat into electricity, and dispatch the energy to a power grid.”
The device was presented in the study “Thermophotovoltaic efficiency of 40%,” which was recently published in nature.  Their work demonstrated the main parts of the system in separate, small-scale experiments and the research group is currently working to integrate the parts to demonstrate a fully operational system. “Thermophotovoltaic cells were the last key step toward demonstrating that thermal batteries are a viable concept,” said MIT researcher Asegun Henry. “One of the advantages of solid-state energy converters are that they can operate at higher temperatures with lower maintenance costs because they have no moving parts.”
