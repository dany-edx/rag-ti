Jakson Green will set up the project along with an integrated hybrid renewable power complex in a phase-wise manner. The project is expected to generate over 32,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities across various phases of the scale-up, planned between 2023 and 2028. 
The Government of Rajasthan would facilitate Jakson Green in obtaining necessary registrations, approvals, clearances, and provide incentives, among others.
“Given our strong focus on technology and execution, with a proven team that has delivered over 10 GW of green energy assets across 26 countries, we are confident of delivering a state-of-the-art green ammonia and green hydrogen facility in Rajasthan,” said Bikesh Ogra, founding promoter, managing director and CEO of Jakson Green.
Jakson Green recently announced its global ambitions to become a leading developer and integrator of green hydrogen and green ammonia assets across select geographies. It is eyeing projects in independent hydrogen and ammonia production and electrolyzer manufacturing space. The firm is actively developing a pipeline of renewable energy, green hydrogen, and green ammonia projects, both in India and abroad.
Promoted and led by Bikesh Ogra, a renewable sector veteran with over 10GW of experience across 26 countries, Jakson Green has built up an impressive global presence in a short span since its inception and plans to deliver 10 GW of renewable energy assets by 2025 and 20 GW by 2030.
The firm plans to enter the electrolyzer manufacturing space, besides building and operating green hydrogen assets globally, in line with its vision of being a power-to-X player cumulatively producing over 1 million tons per annum of green hydrogen/ammonia by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/25/su-vastika-launches-up-to-500-kva-lithium-battery-ups/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 25, 2022",Su-vastika launches up to 500 kVA lithium battery UPS,"Gurugram-based solar startup Su-vastika has launched lithium battery-based three-phase uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) as an environment-friendly and efficient alternative to polluting diesel generators in residential societies, commercial buildings, educational buildings, hospitals, malls, and other applications. 
The UPS are available in power ratings of 10 kVA to 500 kVA and work on IGBT-based bi-directional technology. 
The company claims the UPS running cost is 75% less than DG sets. The batteries are based on lithium ferro phosphate technology and can be recharged to 100% in four hours. 
The UPS uses advanced static switches that reduce switching time to just 2 ms to 5 ms, which is fast enough to prevent a computer and the majority of sensitive equipment from resetting, it said.
The backup time provided by them can be extended by using solar power in conjunction with the battery bank.
“The heavy-duty UPS by Su-vastika are a far superior alternative to DG sets due to their high-capacity energy storage, fast switching technology, negligible maintenance cost, long-lasting batteries, and capability to protect machinery and appliances during power surges,” stated the company.
“The UPS systems have Wi-Fi and GSM connectivity (optional). Our application will monitor your UPS and send regular reports to Su-vastika technicians. In case of any issues, an automatic alert will be sent, and a service call will be made,” it added. The company’s online monitoring system also keeps track of the battery bank usage and sends an alert when the replacement of the battery bank is required.
