Most recently, India-based KPIT has developed a sodium-ion-based battery technology that it plans to license to prospective partners who could manufacture and commercialize this technology.
KPIT, which has a strong foothold in software development, integration, and validation for electrification programs for major OEMs in the global automotive space, has developed this technology in cooperation with the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) based in Pune. The scientific team made contributions to material synthesis, characterization, and battery testing.
“Lithium deposits are concentrated in very few places in the world and lithium processing is concentrated in one or two countries. That is why about eight years ago we started looking at alternatives to lithium and we wanted to look at those alternatives which were ubiquitously available across the globe and that’s why we started working on sodium-ion technology,” Ravi Pandit, chairman of KPIT tells pv magazine.
Thus far, the company has developed multiple variants of its sodium-ion technology with distinct performance characteristics and energy density ranging from 100-170 Wh/kg.
“When we started working on sodium-ion batteries, the initial expectation of energy density was quite low but over the last eight years the energy density has been going up because of the developments that we and other companies have been carrying out,” Pandit says.
The current iteration of KPIT’s sodium-ion cells has an energy density of 110 Wh/kg and feature carbon-based anode and polyanionic cathode.
“We soon realized multiple advantages of sodium-ion chemistry such as power density. You can charge a sodium ion battery 100% percent in less than 20 minutes with 3C charging and still you can get a long life,” Pandit says. “We have been testing the cells for about 4,000 to 5,000 cycles with such aggressive charging. However, in real world you don’t have to do 3C charge all the time and you don’t have to charge to 100% all the time so the actual cycle life can be much higher.”
According to Pandit, KPIT also has batteries with an energy density of 135 and even 170 Wh/kg which are showing stable behavior. However, the latter ones have not been run for 3,000 cycles. “We believe that we can even go to way up to 220 Wh/kg with different combinations of anodes and cathodes, which comes quite close to the lithium-iron-phosphate lithium-ion chemistry,” Pandit says.
In addition to power density and long-life perks as well as faster charging than lithium-ion batteries, Pandit also underlines excellent sub-zero and high-temperature tolerance with minimal thermal management as another advantage of sodium-ion battery technology.
“Unlike lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion can be discharged to zero and then safely transported,” he adds.
Sodium-ion technology has several use cases for automotive and mobility, especially for electric two and 3-wheelers and commercial vehicles. It also has promising applications in stationary deployments, such as UPS backups and grid storage, as well as in the marine and defense sectors.
“When we started, we were mostly looking at electric vehicle applications for sodium-ion technology because our key focus is on urban mobility,” Pandit says. “We see great possibilities for this technology is shared transportation, but also in personal vehicles. Combining sodium-ion batteries with fuel cells is particularly interesting for long-distance heavy-duty application.”
Since KPIT has developed the chemistry ground-up, it can readily tune it to different types of applications. “If you were to look at an energy density of 60 or 70 Wh/kg per and at charging at 1.5 C then you can easily expect 20,000 charge-discharge cycles which would make it a great fit for grid-scale storage applications,” Pandit says.
KPIT has already established a network of supply chain partners and is now actively looking for manufacturing partners, also among its OEM clients.
“Our technology was developed as a complete drop-in technology for the lithium-ion batteries, so we will need only small modification in the precursor stage or in the mixing stage to use the same manufacturing lines to produce sodium-ion batteries,” Pandit says. “This means that setting up a manufacturing plant can take anywhere between 10 to 12 months depending on the partner’s state of readiness so that is the time it will take for a launch in a commercial sense.”
According to Pandit, KPIT is already in contact with a company in Germany that does prototype manufacturing on a 10 MW production line and can be expanded to a gigawatt-scale.
“I believe sodium-ion will play a big role in the automotive sector even before 2030 and we’ll see significant scale in two years time,” he says. “In the stationary storage application, the possibilities are huge. Only pumped hydro will be able to match the price point of large-scale sodium-ion batteries.”
Before its latest technology announcement, KPIT was primarily engaged in the work on battery management systems, battery packaging, as well as the overall electric powertrain. In addition, it has also worked on fuel cells, which according to Pandit will be officially launched in the foreseeable future.

To meet its requirements, the nation needs to add capacity that can provide round-the-clock power, said RK Singh, union minister for power and new & renewable energy, recently.
The minister shared that large-scale integration of variable and intermittent renewable energy resources with the grid requires power sources that can act as base load and balance the grid for grid stability. Hence, dependence on coal-based generation is likely to continue till cost-effective energy storage solutions are available.
Power demand in India is increasing rapidly with the rapid growth of the economy.  The peak demand has increased to 243,000 MW during the current financial year (till Nov. 2023), from 1,35,000 MW in FY 2013-14. The projected peak demand as per the 20th Electric Power Survey  will be 277,200 MW in FY 2026-27 and 3,66,400 MW in FY 2031-32.
During the period 2014-15, India added 97,501.2 MW of conventional power capacity and 96,282.9 MW of renewable energy capacity, transforming from a power deficit to a power surplus nation in the past decade. The nation’s electricity generation capacity has increased by 70% from 248,554 MW in March 2014 to 425,536 MW in October 2023.

As per the National Electricity Plan, the installed power capacity requirement for the year 2031-32 is likely to be 9,00,422 MW, comprising 2,84,467 MW of fossil-based capacity (coal and lignite 2,59,643 MW, gas 24,824 MW) and 6,15,955 MW of non-fossil-based capacity (nuclear 19,680 MW, large hydro 62,178 MW, solar 364,566 MW, wind 121,895 MW, small hydro 5450 MW, biomass 15,500 MW, pumped storage projects 26,686 MW) along with battery energy storage system capacity of 47,244 MW/236,220 MWh).
To ensure an uninterrupted power supply for the nation’s growth, a cumulative 132,148.5 MW of power generation capacity is under construction and the total anticipated power capacity addition by 2031-32 is likely to be 517,403 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/19/cubicpv-announces-1-billion-long-term-silicon-supply-agreement/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",CubicPV announces $1 billion long-term silicon supply agreement,"From pv magazine USA
Silicon solar wafer manufacturer CubicPV and silicon producer OCIM announced an eight-year supply agreement in which Cubic becomes OCIM’s first U.S. customer for its low-carbon, U.S. compliant silicon.
The contract, which Cubic reports is valued at approximately $1 billion, establishes a commitment for an annual supply volume by OCIM, providing Cubic with the polysilicon it needs in order to begin manufacturing at its U.S. plant
One year ago CubicPV announced plans to establish 10 GW of conventional mono wafer capacity in the United States. Driven by incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, Cubic reports that the wafers produced by the new facility could fill a void in the domestic supply chain as well as create 1,500 new direct jobs.
The silicon supply from OCIM reportedly satisfies U.S. law, helping CubicPV to produce domestic silicon wafers to serve the U.S. solar industry. Cubic reports that during the past six months it has produced “significant wafer volumes” using OCIM silicon, which meet or exceed customer specifications.
“This agreement with one of the world’s foremost leaders in polysilicon production is testament to our manufacturing capabilities and the progress against our U.S. manufacturing plans,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO, CubicPV. “OCIM’s high-quality, U.S. compliant silicon is in extremely high demand, and we are fortunate to lock-in our supply with a trusted supplier,”
Under the terms of the agreement, OCIM will begin to provide silicon in 2025 from its manufacturing facility, which OCIM reports is powered by clean, hydroelectricity.
CubicPV was formed from the merger of Hunt Perovskite Technologies and 1366 Technologies, a company that was founded in 2008 and headquartered in Bedford, Mass. 1366 Technologies was known for its direct wafer technology, which forms wafers directly, using molten silicon, instead of silicon ingots sawn into wafers. The advantage is less loss because it uses a kerfless wafer production that does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers, a time-consuming process that wastes material as silicon dust. Instead, 1366’s technology forms wafers directly, using molten silicon.
CubicPV intends to produce M10 and G12 n-type wafers in its facility in the U.S. The exact location has not yet been disclosed.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/19/germany-sets-new-ceiling-prices-for-solar-auctions/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",Germany sets new ceiling prices for solar auctions,"From pv magazine Germany
The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has announced price caps for PV and wind power tenders for 2024.
For onshore wind farms and ground-mounted photovoltaic systems, the agency set ceiling prices of €0.0735/kWh and €0.0737/kWh, respectively. It set the ceiling price for rooftop PV at €0.1050/kWh.
“We are creating a reliable framework for the auctions,” Klaus Müller, the president of Bundesnetzagentur.
Bundesnetzagentur said the slightly lower level will be sufficient “to enable adequate bids,” and said it also considered falling costs for rooftop PV systems. In addition, there were no “significant additional bids above a value of €0.1050/kWh” in the last round of tenders in 2023, it said.
The October tender for rooftop PV systems was twice oversubscribed and the average award value was €0.0958/kWh.
If Bundesnetzagentur had not made this new determination, the ceiling prices in the tenders would have fallen to a significantly lower level, according to provisions issued earlier this year. It would have imposed a ceiling price of €0.0588/kWh for wind power projects and a value of €0.0590/kWh for solar plants. The cap price for rooftop PV would have dropped to €0.0891/kWh.
“However, these values are not sufficient,” said Bundesnetzagentur.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/19/german-decommissioned-nuclear-plant-to-become-800-mw-1600-mwh-battery/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,"DECEMBER 19, 2023","German decommissioned nuclear plant to become 800 MW/1,600 MWh battery","From pv magazine Germany
Europe’s largest battery storage facility could be built on the site of the decommissioned Brokdorf nuclear power plant in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany.
The former operator of the nuclear power plant, PreussenElektra, announced plans for an 800 MW/1,600 MWh storage facility. To begin construction, the site operator needs a decommissioning and dismantling permit for the nuclear power plant.
PreussenElektra submitted the dismantling application in 2017 and is still waiting to have it approved.
The location is suitable for the project. The 12-hectare area that must be available for the storage facility could be developed on the site of the former power plant. The company reports that it is not necessary to reseal currently vacant areas. In addition, the nuclear power plant’s grid connection is still available and could be used for the battery power plant, reducing investment costs.
The location is also favorable. Brokdorf is located north of Hamburg on the Elbe River. The Wilster substation in the immediate vicinity would mainly transport wind power and faces major challenges due to fluctuating feed-in. A large battery storage system would be particularly useful in this strategic location.
“With the Brokdorf location, we have ideal conditions to be part of the solution in the current tense network situation in the region,” said Guido Knott, chairman of the PreussenElektra management board. “Together with our partners in the Eon Group, we would now like to start detailed planning. We now need planning security for the use of our facility site.”
PreussenElektra is currently still waiting to secure a permit to decommission and dismantle the nuclear plant. It applied for it in 2017. On Dec. 31, 2021, the nuclear power plant stopped operating. Since then, the operator has wanted to continue to use the location to add value to the energy industry, but without the mining permit, no progress is possible.
Once the planning security steps have been completed, capital will need to be secured. PreussenElektra says that it will coordinate with an investor within the E.ON Group, to which PreussenElektra also belongs.
PreussenElektra said it will provide additional details, including the final investment amount, after obtaining all necessary approvals. The multi-stage plan will align with the nuclear power plant dismantling progress. The first stage will be developed on the unused side of the plant site, while the second stage will require the dismantling of the nuclear plant.
