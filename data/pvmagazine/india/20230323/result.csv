Airtouch scope of work includes sales, supply, installation, operation, and maintenance of cleaning robots for Acme’s solar plant in Rajasthan.
Airtouch will receive around $1.5 million for the sale and installation. The 25-year operation and maintenance services agreement is expected to generate additional revenues of around $2.5 million.
Tal Laufer, CEO of Airtouch Solar, said the deal represents Acme’s great confidence in the solution offered by Airtouch. “We believe there is great potential for expanding our collaboration with Acme. The Indian market currently recognizes the need to invest in robotic solutions for dry (water-free) cleaning of the panels in PV solar fields, partly in light of the climate crisis and the demand for water conservation. Utilizing Airtouch’s new manufacturing plant in India, completed in the past year, we are optimally prepared to meet the demand and significantly expand our operations in India, while expanding our operations in other markets,” he added.
Acme is a leading solar developer in India, which has diversified into green hydrogen and ammonia.
Acme’s COO Sandeep Kashyap said, “The adoption of robotic cleaning systems will not only help in conserving water but will also bring greater efficiency in the cleaning of solar panels. The new system will service Acme solar plant in Rajasthan. We look forward to reaching closer levels of cooperation in various projects with Airtouch in our future projects.”

Scorpius has developed its own patented tracker controller, software, and innovative structure designs, which, it claims, help deliver faster payback periods and result in higher overall returns on investment. 
With the acquisition of Scorpius Trackers, Gensol will be able to offer its clients an end-to-end EPC solution that includes innovative solar tracking technology.
Scorpius Trackers will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gensol Engineering. 
 Scorpius has 600 MW capacity in operation across India, Japan, Africa, and the Middle East. Further, it has Letter of Intents for 800 MW in hand.
Due to the strong synergies between the two businesses, Gensol estimates the combined revenue of its solar division to reach INR 23 billion in FY 2023-24. 
“By combining our expertise in solar EPC and Scorpius’s strong reputation and expertise in solar trackers, will help us offer a comprehensive EPC package. We see the global demand for trackers is growing faster than the overall demand for mounting systems as solar energy projects that use trackers generate significantly more ROI [return on investment] than projects that do not” said Anmol Singh Jaggi, managing director of Gensol Engineering. 
“According to Wood Mackenzie, the global tracker market is expected to be a $71 billion cumulative opportunity from 2020 to 2030, representing approximately 682 GW of solar installed over that time period. We are excited to join forces with Gensol and bring our innovative solar tracking solutions to even more clients globally,” added Shailesh Vaidya, CEO of Scorpius Trackers. “Together, we will be able to create leading positions in major markets for solar in India and outside.”

The two companies plan a long-term partnership to explore the opportunities unfolding in the emerging green hydrogen market.
Under this partnership, McPhy will grant an exclusive license of its pressurized alkaline electrolyzer technology to L&T for the manufacturing of electrolyzers, including future product upgrades.
L&T plans to set up a gigawatt-scale manufacturing facility for electrolyzers based on McPhy technology in India to serve the domestic requirements as well as cater to the other selected geographies.
L&T sees the proposed agreement in line with its strategic vision to be present across the green energy value chain, while the collaboration also furthers McPhy’s aim to expand beyond the European market. The partnership will leverage L&T’s strong presence across the entire value chain of manufacturing, EPC, and services in the energy sector, and McPhy’s technology and research leadership in this sector.
Through this partnership, both organizations will harness their inherent strengths to establish cost leadership through local manufacturing and sourcing.
India is well suited for green hydrogen production due to the low costs of renewable electricity generation. The nation aims to be among the world’s largest green hydrogen hubs and plans green hydrogen adoption across different sectors. It can also provide India the energy security by reducing the ever-increasing oil import bill while charting a pathway to green alternatives for “hard-to-abate” industries like refineries, fertilisers, steel, and transport.
Green hydrogen production capacity in India is estimated to grow to at least 5 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA0 by 2030 in line with the nation’s Green Hydrogen Mission, which would require investments upward of $100 billion.

IRENA says developers installed 295 GW of renewable energy throughout the world in 2022, driving up global cumulative installed capacity by 9.6% to 3,372 GW. It was a year of record growth, largely based on newly installed PV systems, according to IRENA.
The organization says 191 GW of solar was installed last year. It notes that growth is still largely concentrated in a handful of countries and regions such as Asia, the United States, and Europe. Asia accounted for 60% of new capacity additions, where 1.63 TW of renewables are now installed.
China accounted for almost half of the new global renewables capacity in 2022, at 141 GW. A total of 57.3 GW were added in North America in 2022 and 29.1 GW in Europe, according to IRENA. Africa continued its steady growth at 2.7 GW, slightly above the figures for the previous year.
“This sustained record growth demonstrates the resilience of renewable energy amid the current energy crisis,” said IRENA Director General Francesco La Camera.
IRENA says hydropower still accounts for the largest share of installed renewables capacity at 1,255 GW. But last year, only 21 GW were added. Solar is catching up and last year passed the terawatt milestone of installed capacity.
IRENA has listed the top 10 global PV markets in terms of cumulative installed capacity:
