And as the nation targets net-zero carbon emission by 2070, “the Budget builds on the government’s focus on green growth,” said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech in the parliament today.
The budget puts the focus on emerging clean technologies like energy storage, green hydrogen, and electric mobility. It also signifies the government’s resolve to boost domestic solar and battery manufacturing as it continues nil customs duty on specified inputs for solar cell and module components and waives import duty on capital goods and machinery required to manufacture lithium battery cells for EVs.
The minister also announced viability gap funding (VGF) for battery energy storage projects with a capacity 4 GWh. A detailed framework for pumped storage projects will also be formulated.
Customs duty has been waived off on capital goods and machinery required to manufacture lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. This will come into effect from February 2 and will be applicable till March 31, 2024. The move follows the INR18,100 crore production-linked incentive scheme for advanced chemistry battery cells, providing further impetus to domestic battery manufacturing for green mobility.
The minister said India targets green hydrogen production capacity of 5 MMT per year by 2030. And that the recently launched National Green Hydrogen Mission, with an outlay of INR 19,700 crore, will facilitate transition of the economy to low carbon intensity, reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, and make the country assume technology and market leadership in this sunrise sector.
The minister also announced construction of inter-state transmission system for evacuation and grid integration of 13 GW renewable energy from Ladakh with investment of INR 20,700 crore including central support of INR 8,300 crore.
The budget provides INR 35,000 crore for priority capital investments towards energy transition and net-zero objectives, and energy security by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas.
For encouraging behavioural change, a Green Credit Programme will be notified under the Environment (Protection) Act. This will incentivize environmentally sustainable and responsive actions by companies, individuals and local bodies, and help mobilize additional resources for such activities, said the minister.
Industry stakeholders have lauded the budget announcements and stress on detailed policy structure and timely implementation of the measures.
NSEFI CEO Subrahmanyam Pulipaka expressed happiness that the Ministry of Finance has accepted their request to create a detailed framework for pumped storage projects in the country. “The viability gap funding announced for storage system with the capacity of 4 GWh will help penetration of solar as a dispatchable energy generation source,” he added.
Pulipaka also welcomed the continuation of nil basic customs duty (BCD) on specified inputs for use in the manufacturing of EVA sheets or backsheets, solar tempered glass, flat copper wire for use in the manufacture of photovoltaic ribbons that are used in the manufacturing of solar cells and modules. This will help the growth of solar manufacturing as well as the allied balance-of-system (BoS) manufacturers, especially as gigawatt-scale facilities come up in India under the two PLIs announced for solar modules.
Debi Prasad Dash, executive director, India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA), said their demand for custom duty exemption on capital goods and machineries for Li-ion cell manufacturing has been met in this budget. Dash added that VGF for battery energy storage projects with a capacity 4 GWh will help to advance the battery projects in India and will support higher renewable adoptions for the grid. This will help SECI, NTPC and various state agencies to come up with more battery storage projects in India.
Under India Battery Supply Chain Council (IBSCC), IESA work with 50+ potential battery giga-factory and supply chain players and expect to see 140+ GWh of battery cell manufacturing capacity by 2030. IESA released India Energy Storage Vision document last year which projects a grid-scale market potential of 160 GWh by 2030.
Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice president & group head-corporate ratings, ICRA Ltd, said the announcement of a VGF scheme for battery energy storage projects and the stated intent of coming out with a framework for pumped hydro projects is a positive for the RE energy sector, given the importance of storage for RE sources, which are intermittent in nature. However, the fleshing out of the details is awaited; and timely implementation of these measures will remain crucial.
“The proposal for investment in transmission lines for large-scale evacuation of green power from Ladakh is likely to support RE capacity addition and grid integration. The already announced National Green Hydrogen Mission with a target to produce 5 MMT of green hydrogen is also a positive, although the cost competitiveness of the same remains a key monitorable,” he added.
Srinivasan Viswanathan, chief executive officer of Vibrant Energy, said the budget is progressive and beneficial to the energy sector. “The statement on Green Growth is highly comprehensive, with a vision for the green hydrogen mission costing INR 19,700 crore, which would undoubtedly accelerate the energy transformation. The promotion of Ladakh green energy corridor is a welcome step. We appreciate the INR 35,000 crore capital investment for reaching the net zero goal, however, we look forward to receiving the policy structured in a detailed manner,” he said.

Researchers from the University of Oxford have looked at how second-life batteries (SLBs) could be combined with rooftop solar in remote school buildings throughout East Africa. They found that such devices could provide a lower LCOE than new storage systems.
They described their findings in “Second-life battery systems for affordable energy access in Kenyan primary schools,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. They investigated the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed system configuration and said that its use could be extended to electrify all rural households.
“Lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles are particularly high-value SLBs,” they explained. “At their ‘end-of-life’, they still typically have 70% to 80% of their capacity remaining. This equates to thousands of charge/discharge cycles and hours of usable energy storage.”
The academics spoke to 12 East African schools about their respective consumption profiles and projected energy needs, as well as the technical and financial challenges. They aimed to compare the performance of the proposed system configuration with two reference systems featuring conventional batteries and grid electricity.
The electricity produced by the solar-plus-storage system would be used for classroom lighting, security lighting, information technology, and phone charging.
“These all use relatively little power, which speaks well to the potential suitability of hybrid battery and PV solutions to meet school energy needs,” the scientists explained.
Th appliances are roughly the same for the four schools. They would require an average installed power of around 5 kW, given an annual average demand of 10,220 kWh.
The scientists calculated the LCOE of the three system configurations over 25 years.
“This was estimated at $0.31/kWh, resulting from the current electricity cost of $0.28/kWh and considering an annual utility escalating factor of 1%,” they said. “Results for each scenario show that the LCOE varies between $0.11/kWh and $0.22/kWh and that in 97.2% of the scenarios studies, using second-life batteries is cheaper compared to new batteries as per the LCOE obtained.”
They identified a minimum payback time of 2.9 years for a hybrid system consisting of a 5 kW PV system and 5 kWh of SLB storage. They found that locally sourced SLBs were cheaper than imported new batteries in all of the scenarios. They also determined that the maximum reduction in LCOE of 29.4% could be achieved for a system that combines 7.5 kW of PV with 20 kWh of SLB storage, or for a 10 kW of PV paired with 20 kWh of SLB storage.
“While we have shown that SLBs can reduce the costs of school energy access in Kenya significantly while effectively mitigating the challenges of battery waste, there are still a number of issues that need to be overcome for SLBs to be effectively used on a wide scale,” the scientists concluded, noting that more research will be needed to address the aforementioned issues.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/01/retired-coal-sites-to-host-multi-day-iron-air-batteries/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 1, 2023",Retired coal sites to host multi-day iron-air batteries,"From pv magazine Global
Solar and wind power have variability in their productive hours, as multi-day weather events can impact output. Therefore, multi-day storage that is cost effective is important in grid reliability.
This is the logic that supported the creation of Boston startup Form Energy’s iron-air batteries. The grid-scale batteries can store intermittent renewables-sourced electricity for 100 hours at costs competitive with conventional power plants.
Utility Xcel Energy said it will install two 10 MW/1,000 MWh iron-air batteries – one at a retired coal plant in Minnesota and another on a restored site in Colorado. The projects are expected to go online in 2025, following regulatory approval.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air, creating rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
The technology is less energy-dense than its lithium-ion counterparts, making it a better fit for large grid-scale applications. This may come as an advantage for the company, as EV batteries are in competition for lithium, a metal with geo-political mining concerns and battery fire risks.
“Form was founded with a unified mission to develop a multi-day energy storage battery that would unlock the power of extremely low-cost renewable energy to transform the electric grid,” said Mateo Jaramillo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Form Energy.
Form Energy said an individual battery module is about the size of a side-by-side washer/dryer set and contains a stack of approximately 50 one-meter-tall cells. The cells include iron and air electrodes, the parts of the battery that enable the electrochemical reactions to store and discharge electricity. Each of these cells are filled with water-based, non-flammable electrolyte, like the electrolyte used in AA batteries.
These battery modules are grouped together in environmentally protected enclosures. Hundreds of these enclosures are grouped together in modular megawatt-scale power blocks. Depending on the system size, tens to hundreds of these power blocks can be connected to the electricity grid. For scale, in its least dense configuration, a one-megawatt system comprises half an acre of land. Higher density configurations would achieve >3 mw/acre.
“We’re on track to reduce our electric system carbon emissions 80% by 2030 and to deliver carbon-free electricity by 2050,” said Bob Frenzel, chief executive officer of Xcel Energy. “As we build more renewable energy into our systems, our partnership with Form Energy opens the door to significantly improve how we deliver carbon-free energy.”
Form Energy held a $200 million Series D funding round in 2021 led by ArcelorMittal and a $450 million Series E round led by TPG Rise Climate, and numerous Canada-based funds.
In December, it announced a West Virginia-based manufacturing facility. Emerging from startup mode, Form expects to begin construction of its Weirton factory in 2023 and start manufacturing iron-air batteries in 2024 for broad commercialization.
The governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, said that the state was able to structure a unique financial incentive package worth up to $290 million in asset-based, performance financing to support their decision to locate in Weirton. The West Virginia Economic Development Authority allocated $75 million toward the purchase of land and the construction of buildings in Weirton. The governor said he plans on working with the West Virginia Legislature and federal partners to obtain an additional $215 million needed to finalize the agreement.
The Xcel collaboration was modeled using Form Energy’s investment and operational modeling tool for grids, called Formware. This modeling helped Xcel Energy validate how Form’s multi-day storage will support Xcel Energy’s ability to reliably and cost-effectively integrate large amounts of wind energy and other renewable resources on its system.
Additionally, this analysis demonstrated how the 100-hour iron-air battery technology will strengthen the grid against normal day-to-day, week-to-week, and season-to-season weather variability, in addition to extreme weather events including severe winter storms and polar vortex events.
“Xcel Energy operates across some of the richest wind-resource areas in North America,” said Jaramillo. “This partnership highlights Xcel Energy’s commitment to ensuring grid resiliency and reliability, energy security, and access to low-cost clean energy when and where it is needed – every day of the year.”
