Over the last year, North America has become the fastest growing region for planned battery cell manufacturing capacity. Much of the growth is buoyed by federal incentives of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, according to an industry report by Clean Energy Associates (CEA).
CEA’s Energy Storage System (ESS) Supplier Market Intelligence Program (SMIP) offers a biannual market report about the leading global lithium-ion battery cell manufacturers and energy storage system integrators.
As the U.S. ramps up to become a major battery cell supplier in at least two more years, China remains the largest global supplier of lithium-ion batteries at year end 2022. CEA forecasts a two-year 186% growth rate on the 1,706 GWh of batteries produced in 2022.
Contemporary Amparex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) was the largest Tier 1 battery cell supplier in 2022, with its 387 GWh of batteries supplied representing the largest portion (30%) of the 75% market share held by Tier 1 suppliers. Following CATL were LG Energy Solution (198 GWh) and BYD (149 GWh) among major Tier 1 suppliers.
Tier 1 companies produced 1,270 GWh of 1,706 GWh of lithium batteries last year. Tier 1 is a designation for companies that supply more than one multinational original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or EV producer outside of China, with capacity of greater than 10 GWh per year. Tier 2 suppliers are not yet qualified to supply multinational automotive OEMs or EV companies, while Tier 3 suppliers are not yet qualified to supply EV end markets and annual capacity is less than 1 GWh per year.
CEA notes that industry fragmentation between the different tiers is expected to increase in the coming years due to global expansion of the Energy Storage systems market, as specialized companies emerge among the stationary storage market, such as Pylontech (7 GWh) and Hithium (15 GWh), the only two suppliers to appear on CEA’s top suppliers chart that focus exclusively on the storage market.
Future onshored North America battery supply is being driven by multi-year financial incentives for domestic content under the Inflation Reduction Award and Department of Energy-led grant funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 for sourcing advanced materials for battery production in the U.S.
Recent planned battery cell capacity in the U.S. driven by the IRA include:
CEA’s Supplier Market Intelligence Program recognizes ten battery systems integrators of lithium-ion batteries used in the utility-scale storage market. Evaluating the integration of battery cells, modules, racking, enclosures, inverters, battery management and energy management systems to engineering and construction functions, CEA found that Tesla is the only company that is currently developing a battery cell supply chain for the utility storage market.
CEA, an Intertek company, is a market intelligence company that provides product consulting support to buyers and long-term owners of solar and energy storage equipment. The company has consulted for project developers, power producers, engineering groups and investors, executing on more than 160 GW of solar and 15 GWh of storage projects to date.

The company’s total income (or total revenue) for FY 2023 was $1,087 million, 29.1% up from FY 2022. Net loss for FY 2023 narrowed to $ 61 million from $196 million in FY 2022. 
Total Income for Q4 FY 2023 was $315 million, an increase of 47.1% over Q4 FY 2022. The company reported a net profit of $1 million for Q4 FY 2023 compared to a net loss of $43 million for Q4 FY 2022.
As of March 31, 2023, the company’s portfolio consisted of 13.7 GW (8 GW commissioned and 5.7 GW committed)—a 28.2% increase year-on-year. The developer signed power purchase agreements for 101 MW in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and only 1% of its total portfolio has Letters of Award that await a PPA.
In May this year, ReNew partnered with Petronas’ clean energy arm Gentari, where Gentari will purchase a 49% equity stake in ReNew’s 403 MW peak power project. As part of the partnership, ReNew will invest around $38 million for its 51% stake in the project and, through its affiliates, will undertake EPC, O&M, and project management.
The peak power project benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement with Solar Energy Corp. of India (“SECI”), an Indian central government-owned entity with a AAA rating by ICRA, and will supply electricity at a peak tariff of INR 6.85 ($0.083)/kWh and an off-peak tariff of INR 2.88 ($0.035)/kWh.
ReNew expects to complete construction of 1,750 to 2,250 MW capacity by the end of fiscal 2024.

Researchers from Ulster University in the United Kingdom have developed a mini-split air conditioning bed unit powered exclusively by off-grid solar power and battery storage.
“This system has enormous potential for serving low-income households in developing countries, as it requires considerably less input power,” they stated in the paper “A Solar Powered Off-Grid Air Conditioning System with Natural Refrigerant for Residential Buildings: A Theoretical and Experimental Evaluation,” published in Cleaner Energy Systems. “This system offers a more energy-efficient alternative to conventional split units by cooling a canopy at night.”
The system, which the scientists said is designed to utilize low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, consists of two 400 W solar panels, two 130 Ah lead-acid batteries, and a vapor compression cycle (VCC) unit.
The external unit comprises a compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve, and the two batteries connected in parallel with a charge controller and inverter. The internal unit includes an evaporator, external ducts, and an indoor canopy. “The internal components comprise of the canopy, supply and extract flex ducts and the AC unit,” the research group explained.

The proposed system configuration was assumed to operate in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The scientists said the simulation was performed at different condensation temperatures and showed that the batteries charged by the solar panels are capable of supporting the air conditioning unit during the night.
The system was assumed to run during the summertime, with operating temperatures ranging from 35 C to 40 C and the operating humidity being between 50% to 60%.
The scientists identified the GWP refrigerants R600a and R290 as the best candidates to replace the commonly used R134a and R410A. “Compared to R134a, the experimental coefficient of performance (COP) of R290 improved by 2.42 %, with less input work of 2.31 % and greater exergetic efficiency of 2.37 %,” they explained, noting that the COP shows the maximum value for all candidates as the temperature lift decreases. “Reducing the temperature lift between evaporator and condenser enhances the performance of the system.”
They also found that the unit using R290 requires less than one-third horsepower and that the two batteries were charged enough to operate the system for seven hours. “These results indicate that the unit is practically feasible,” they concluded.

As part of efforts to boost solar power production and produce fresh water from salty water, Bangladesh’s government eliminated the Advance Tax (AT) on imported components required for solar-powered water desalination plants.
The move aims to reduce water production costs and enhance reliance on solar power in 19 coastal districts facing grid electricity shortages due to lower imports of coal and fuel.
People in coastal belts depend on seawater as ponds and underground water have become salty due to climate change. Cyclones contaminate ponds and canals, rendering water unusable. Rising sea levels have increased salinity in many parts of Bangladesh, including inland areas.
Several solar-powered water desalination units currently operate in southern Bangladesh. Each system includes a 500 W solar power system driving a 0.5 hp (373 W) water pump.In 2020, Australia-based company F Cubed secured a government contract to supply 1,140 desalination machines, providing clean drinking water to around 30,000 people in Bangladesh.
An official at the Department of Public Health Engineering who was involved in the project told the pv magazine that the DPHE ran the pilot project in 16 coastal districts. “From each desalination unit five families can get safe drinking water,” he said.
“This project was financed by the government from its exchequer, but considering the benefits of desalination machines, funds will be sought from development partners to further expand such facility,” he added.
Bangladesh is presently experiencing a 25% low electricity generation in this scorching summer thus at least 3,000 MW of load shedding is occurring every hour.
