The prime minister also announced India’s updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) at the meet. The nation pledged to increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and meet 50% of its overall energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. India would reduce its emissions intensity by close to 45% by 2030 as well as reduce one billion tonnes of carbon emissions by 2030, announced the prime minister. 
Under the 2015 Paris agreement, India had committed to achieving 40% of all installed electricity generation capacity to be from non-fossil energy sources by 2030 and reducing emissions intensity by 33% to 35% below 2005 levels. 
Currently, India has an installed electricity generation capacity of close to 380 GW. With 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity in the electricity system by 2030, India shall be able to cut its dependency on thermal power assets which are suffering from low efficiency and vagaries of import prices. 
PM Modi also asked developed countries to provide climate finance of $1 trillion to support developing countries in climate action. “Today, it is necessary that as we track the progress made in climate mitigation, we should also track climate finance,” he said.
Experts have hailed the prime minister’s bold announcements.
Ajay Mathur, Director General, International Solar Alliance, said, “PM Modi cut through the rhetoric and delivered a big promise of climate action from India. Reducing one billion tonnes of emissions by 2030 and expanding non-fossil capacity to 500 GW are enormous and transformative steps. 50% of electricity generation from renewable energy sources speaks to India’s leadership and commitment to climate action.” 
Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said, “India has clearly put the ball in the court of the developed world. This is real climate action. Now India demands US$ 1 trillion in climate finance as soon as possible and will monitor not just climate action but also climate finance. Most importantly, India has called once again for a change in lifestyle. If we cannot fix how we live, we can’t fix how we live on this planet.” 
Chandra Bhushan, CEO, iForest, said, “India’s announcement of an ambitious 2030 target and a net-zero target is a big step for climate collaboration. I congratulate the PM for announcing this bold step which will go a long way in greening the Indian economy and solving the climate crisis.” 
Navroz Dubash, Professor, Centre for Policy Research, said, “The overseas media will focus on India’s net-zero by 2070 statement. But while it may mean something diplomatically—the last major economy in the bag— it will not be what drives change in India. Much more Intriguing are the announcements on railways, on non-fossil capacity and the benchmark for renewable energy. These are what give scope for India to drive a low carbon development transition in the next decade.” 
On one billion tonnes of carbon emission reduction, R.R. Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, said, “One billion tonne of reduction in absolute terms is massive. Compare this with the entire GHG inventory which is less than 3 billion tonnes today, and will be 4.5 billion tonnes in 2030. Committing to 1 billion is 25% of the inventory in 2030. This shows a tremendous leadership gesture and commitment to act now and fix the road to 2030. It also sets the stage for carbon markets. In a way, this means absolute emission reductions and this also means that India has set itself to commit to a peak in emissions without saying so explicitly.” 
Dave Jones, Global Lead, Ember, said, “The world’s top 10 coal power countries have now all committed to Net Zero, as India announces a net-zero pledge at COP26. But coal will need to end one, two or even three decades before the net-zero dates that have been laid out. These net-zero ambitions now need to transform into near-term action on coal. Failing to act on coal will undermine the credibility of net-zero pledges.” 
Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist and India lead, IEEFA, said, India’s pledge to increase the share of renewable energy sources to 50% by 2030 would also reduce the emissions intensity of the economy by at least 45% from its 2005 levels. India is leading on climate action, it is doing more than its fair share. 
“India is rightly asking for climate justice and asking developed nations to fulfill their promise of providing tech transfer and finance. In the past, developed nations have failed to fulfill their promise. India wants that expectation of such pledges should be based on principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility, where the burden of accelerating the energy transition should fall more on the developed world in terms of timeline and that they should also facilitate tech transfer and finance,” Vibhuti added.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/02/solliance-hits-29-2-efficiency-on-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",Solliance hits 29.2% efficiency on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell,"From pv magazine International
European Solliance Solar Research (Solliance), a consortium based in the Netherlands, said last week that researchers from three of its partners – the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), EnergyVille, and the Eindhoven University of Technology – have achieved a 29.2% power conversion efficiency on a transparent bifacial perovskite solar cell combined with a crystalline silicon solar cell in a four-terminal tandem configuration.
In April, the consortium achieved a 28.7% record efficiency for the device, but the new results mark a significant improvement. “This was made possible by further increasing the wide-bandgap of the perovskite cells with high near-infrared transparency,” Gianluca Coletti, TNO’s program manager for tandem PV technology, told pv magazine. 
Solliance said the perovskite cell has reached a stabilized efficiency of 17.8% during five-minute, maximum-power-point tracking. “In combination with the Panasonic silicon bottom cell, a new world-record 4T perovskite/Si tandem efficiency of 29.2% is realized,” it said, noting that the efficiency rating refers exclusively to the front side of the cell.
The cell is based on a highly near-infrared transparent perovskite cell built by TNO, EnergyVille, and an 11.4%-efficient c-Si interdigitated back contact (IBC) silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell developed by Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic.
In a recent paper, the research team explained that the cell was used in 24.5 mW/cm2 bifacial tandem mini-modules with an area of 100 cm2 in combination with a PERC bottom cell. The panels exhibited a 3 mW/cm2 gain compared to the same device with a monofacial architecture. According to the scientists, outdoor results have shown that the module can outperform the monofacial counterpart by more than 25% in a 10% albedo environment.
“The record 4T  tandem device and the scaled up tandem modules can be used for the utility scale and commercial rooftop market segments thanks to the opportunity for bifacial installations,” Coletti said.
The research team combined the transparent perovskite cell with a flexible copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tandem solar cell built by MiaSolé Hi-Tech, a U.S. unit of Chinese thin-film specialist Hanergy. The efficiency rating was 27.1%, up slightly from 27.0% in April.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/02/should-i-include-a-battery-with-my-home-solar-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COST AND PRICES,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",Should I include a battery with my home solar project?,"From pv magazine USA
Attaching a solar array to a home is a long-term commitment, with many considerations, and one that offers great potential for energy bill savings. A recent addition to the list of options is whether or not to attach a battery energy storage system.
A battery can often add $10,000 or more to the total cost of a residential solar system, said EnergySage. But it comes with a range of benefits that vary depending on the home’s electricity needs and experience with the utility company. So, what are the benefits?
In this article, pv magazine reviews the capabilities of batteries beyond backup power, and evaluates costs, benefits, and timing.
Without a battery, a grid-tied home solar array will export any unused power directly to the grid in real-time. With a battery, electricity can be charged and discharged in ways that optimize energy bill savings.
Take demand charges, for instance. Some utilities, including providers in Massachusetts, Arizona, and Illinois, charge an additional fee based on the maximum amount of power required over a single hour, or 15-minute period, in a given month. A battery can be scheduled to discharge power during peak use times so that peak energy demand is smoothed, and demand charges are lower.
Utilities also use a billing design called time-of-use, which, similarly to demand charges, are intended to discourage power use during peak demand periods. 
With a battery, the home is able to store energy during off-peak hours, which typically occur during the day when the solar array is producing the most. The battery can then export power to the home during on-peak hours, which are often in the evening as people return from work and run appliances and the array produces less power. Without a battery, homeowners are subject to whatever rate is being charged if the array is not actively producing.
A third benefit is the ability of the battery to provide value in utilities without net metering. Net metering is the process of exporting energy to the power grid in exchange for credits that can be used to offset utility bill costs.
Some utilities offer a one-to-one value, meaning each kWh of power sent out will cover one kWh of utility bill costs. Others have a decreased value for net metering. 
For example, power may be billed by the utility at $0.16/kWh, but the value of exported energy only offers a credit value of $0.08/kWh. Other utilities offer no net metering credit whatsoever, like in Hawaii, where battery attachment rates are much higher than the rest of the United States at 80%. Again, in the net metering scenario, batteries are able to store and provide power, limiting exposure to the value loss in poor net metering climates.
Cost factors
A lithium-ion home battery comes with a sizeable price tag, usually around $10,000. Currently, energy storage that is paired with a residential solar system is eligible for the 26% federal investment tax credit.
Certain states and utilities offer additional incentives for including batteries, and in some cases the value adder can make a dramatic difference. The SMART program in Massachusetts, the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) of California, and incentive programs in Maryland and Long Island provide up-front cost relief for batteries.
Programs like ConnectedSolutions of New England offer further savings to homeowners who opt-in to a “bring-your-own-battery” program, wherein an incentive is paid to homeowner who agree to allow their batteries to export power to the grid during times of extreme peak demand.
In addition to the ticket-price of the battery, there may be hardware costs associated, as well. Tesla estimates supporting hardware for the battery costs $1,100, and installation will range from $800 to $2,000. Electrical work like a main panel upgrade may drive costs higher, and some installers will require the customer to cover costs like permit fees or retailer/connection charges, said EnergySage.
Retrofit later?
Bloomberg’s New Energy Finance reports lithium-ion battery pack prices have fallen 87% from 2010 to 2019. With global supply chains ramping up lithium production due to increased demand (also driven by electric vehicle adoption) it is possible that further price reductions may occur. But is it worth waiting for a cheaper battery?
The answer depends, but in the past, the cost of installing a battery after-the-fact, or “retrofitting”, is dependent on the inverters on the array, said EnergySage. Most home solar arrays are installed with AC-coupled inverters, which would then need to be re-converted by an additional inverter back to DC for use by the battery. This means a retrofitted battery would come with an additional cost of another inverter, plus installation costs.
A solar system with a battery included at initial install can include just one DC-coupled inverter, which reduces costs, and converts and stores energy more efficiently than AC-coupled solutions.
It should be taken under consideration that some installers do not perform battery retrofits altogether.
Inverter companies are actively working to make retrofits easier. For example, Enphase recently released a microinverter that the company said can be retrofit to any type of home energy storage battery without the need for recoupling.
