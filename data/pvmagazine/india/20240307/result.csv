1,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/07/topcon-module-production-hits-cells-bottleneck/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,2024-03-07,TOPCon module production hits cells bottleneck,"At the Intersolar India 2024 in Gujarat, pv magazine spoke with several solar manufacturers in India. Most have started TOPCon module production and are getting a good response from the market. TOPCon is expected to command almost 50% market by the end of this year.
While TOPCon cell capacities are underway by some manufacturers, these will be insufficient to cater to the current requirements of domestic module manufacturers.
The lack of domestically produced cells is a challenge even for mono PERC module manufacturers. This limits the market for domestic panel manufacturers as government projects under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s schemes and programmes mandate cells to be made in India under the domestic content requirement.
The cell manufacturers in India have been prioritizing domestic cell production for in-house module manufacturing or exports, particularly to the US market, exacerbating the scarcity of cells for domestic projects.
“While the demand for domestic mono PERC solar cells has surged due to government utility-based tenders and subsidy schemes, the domestic manufacturing capacity has not kept pace, leading to a significant demand-supply gap. This has resulted in the cost of domestic solar cells being more than two to almost three times that of imported A-grade cells, despite the wafers for cell manufacturing being sourced internationally. Adding to the complexity, India cells are about 20-35% costlier than imported cells having the same wafers. This discrepancy has put module manufacturers, especially those without their own cell production lines, in a difficult position, making it challenging to meet the demand for DCR modules effectively,” Anurag Garg, CEO, Jakson Solar Modules & Product Business, told pv magazine.
“With p-type mono PERC cell (M10 size) as the current dominant technology in India and n-type cells gaining traction, there is an evident need to expand production capacities. The industry is gradually moving towards technologies like TOPCon, which is upgradable from mono PERC, and HJT, which requires a different cell process. This transition underscores the need for technological upgrades and increased investment in cell manufacturing capabilities.”

According to Garg, key challenges to ramping up cell production include high capital expenditure for establishing manufacturing facilities, the necessity of technological advancements, and the recruitment of skilled manpower.
Right now, TOPCon and HJT are the two competing technologies. “HJT technology typically involves more complex manufacturing processes than conventional solar cell technologies like monocrystalline PERC and TOPCon. This complexity can result in higher production costs, making HJT panels more expensive. In markets like India where cost competitiveness is crucial, the higher upfront cost of HJT panels could be a barrier to adoption,” said Tanmoy Duari, CEO, AXITEC Energy India.
The current shortage of DCR cells indeed poses a significant challenge, given an expected increase in the demand from government-supported residential solar projects.
“This year, rooftop solar is trending as the government has approved the PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana with a total outlay of about $9 billion to install rooftop solar and provide free electricity every month for 10 million households. There is new excitement among solar panel manufacturers to fulfill this demand in the next 18 months,” Amol Anand, co-founder and director of Loom Solar tells pv magazine.
However, DCR cells supply is seen as a transient issue. “The construction of new cell manufacturing plants and the eventual operationalization of capacities under the PLI scheme to mitigate the demand-supply gap. However, these solutions will require time to fully materialize and may initially be insufficient to meet the combined demands of the domestic and export markets,” Garg said.
Given the crisis in sourcing quality domestic cells and the logical disconnect in their pricing, there’s a strong argument against the continuation of the DCR mandate in its current form.
“The variance in prices among suppliers claiming to use DCR cells, which affects the cost and efficiency of solar projects, further complicates the issue. Instead of a strict DCR mandate, adopting a broader Domestic Content Requirement that encompasses up to 50% of the total Balance of System (BoS) could stimulate the development of ancillary industries like frames and glass, which are crucial to the solar panel sector but not covered under the PLI scheme,” said Garg.

The projects were awarded by MSEB Solar Agro Power Ltd (MSAPL), a state-owned enterprise of the government of Maharashtra. These will involve a greenfield investment of INR 50 billion and will span 192 locations in 10 districts.
Avaada Energy will develop the projects under Mukhyamantri Saur Krushi Vahini Yojana 2.0 (MSKVY 2.0), also known as ‘Mission 2025’, which aims at transforming the agricultural energy supply with a 30% feeder solarisation target by 2025.
Maharashtra is home to around 29 million consumers, of which 4.5 million are agriculture consumers accounting for 22% of the electricity consumption. The introduction of decentralized agriculture Solar PV projects will ensure farmers receive uninterrupted power during the day, thereby alleviating the inconvenience caused by the previous rotational day and night supply.
The MSKVY 2.0 scheme, under the broader umbrella of the PM-KUSUM Yojana, is a pan-India scheme by Government of India to meet the daytime electricity requirements of farmers for irrigation. By moving the agricultural load to solar power during the day, the initiative aims to streamline the load curve and minimize carbon emissions. Additionally, the solarisation of agriculture feeders is expected to bolster the state’s power distribution infrastructure, enhancing the grid’s performance and aiding in the reduction of AT&C losses for Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd.

The European Council has adopted new modifications to European legislation on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), which includes products such as computers, refrigerators, and solar panels.
The amendments are designed to adapt the WEEE Directive to a 2022 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union on the partial invalidity of the directive itself. This was due to the retroactive application of extended producer responsibility to waste solar panels placed on the market between Aug. 13, 2005, and Aug. 13, 2012.
The amendments state that the costs of management and disposal of waste solar panels marketed after Aug. 13, 2012, correspond to the producer of the electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). The expanded producer responsibility for EEE that was added to the scope of the directive in 2018 should apply to electronic products placed on the market after that date.
The amendments also introduce a review clause under which the European Commission must assess the need to review the directive by no later than 2026. The European Commission adopted its proposal for specific amendments to the WEEE Directive on Feb. 7, 2023. In November 2023, the co-legislators reached a provisional political agreement after adopting negotiating positions in June and October 2023. The European Parliament formally voted on the agreement on Feb. 6, 2024.
The latest European Council vote closes the adoption procedure. The text of the amendments will now be signed by the co-legislators. It will then be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will go into force 20 days later. Member states will have up to 18 months to transpose the amended directive into their national legal systems.

5,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/07/standard-energy-unveils-vanadium-ion-battery-with-1-degradation/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,2024-03-07,Standard Energy unveils vanadium-ion battery with 1% degradation,"From pv magazine Global
South Korea-based Standard Energy has developed a battery with just 1% degradation after 20,000 testing cycles. The company uses vanadium-ion batteries (ViB).
It showcased the ViB at the recent Smart Energy Week in Tokyo. The company’s chief project and marketing officer, Gyucheol Lee, said that 10 years ago, the company was developing vanadium-redox flow batteries. However, this type of battery could never get above 80% roundtrip efficiency, as electric pumps were needed to move large amounts of electrolyte from tank to tank.
The company therefore shifted its focus to using vanadium in the same fashion as lithium – as an ion battery. Vanadium is an exciting candidate for cathode materials, Lee said, because it has many dispensable electrons in its atoms and features four ionic states. Multiple ionic states allow its electrons to move without the material changing from metal to ion state between charging and discharging. According to Lee, the change from metal to ion state promotes cathode-electrolyte-interphase growth – the principal degradation mode in lithium-ion batteries.
With no metal dissolution occurring in vanadium-ion batteries, the company has tested its batteries in its laboratory. Cycling them at a strenuous C-rate of 3, with 100% depth of discharge for 20,000 cycles, the company noted a degradation of just 1%.
In addition to this superior cycling life, the batteries are also said to be safer than their lithium-ion competitors. Standard Energy can use aqueous electrolytes in its batteries, rendering them virtually non-flammable. The current product also boasts a high-power delivery of a C-rate of 5, with a roundtrip efficiency of 96 %, according to test data.
High C-rates are only wanted sometimes. There are various requirements for energy and power delivery between different applications. Lee said vanadium-ion batteries do not require a change in cathode design, as with lithium-ion batteries – referring to the other use cases of LFP, NMC, and NCA batteries. Vanadium-ion batteries could be designed to deliver 10-hour duration storage for PV and wind systems or 5 C for UPS and frequency regulation without a change in their cathode design.
There are some drawbacks, however. Lee said vanadium is much heavier than lithium, making his batteries only usable in stationary applications, like large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) and residential storage systems.
Another issue is cost. At present, vanadium is very expensive. The price has risen 20-fold since the company started developing the product. With the startup-like production capacity and high resource prices, the batteries cost around double what competitively priced lithium-ion batteries cost.
Lee said he hopes the product will become more competitively priced when the company’s planned gigafactory starts operations in two years. He said he also thinks that vanadium prices could come down again. Vanadium is not scarce, with large quantities available in Australia, China, and South Korea. New mining projects could bring down the price of raw materials.
The company started selling its products in South Korea in December 2023. So far, it has sold 10 MWh of batteries. Standard Energy sells complete systems and helps project developers and engineering contractors with installation and system design. The company is now waiting for certification for use in Japanese grids. European certification could take another two to five years, but is now in the planning stage, said Lee.

6,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/07/indias-2-1-billion-green-hydrogen-programme-off-to-a-good-start-but-theres-room-for-improvement/,"ELECTROLYZER,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,2024-03-07,India’s $2.1 billion green hydrogen programme off to a good start but there’s room for improvement,"India’s $2.1 billion push to transform it into a global green hydrogen powerhouse has received a strong response from large strategic investors in the country’s private sector, but the scheme can be further improved to attract start-ups and global players, according to a new joint report released by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research & Analytics.

The report finds that large Indian corporations have evinced strong interest in the tenders issued for both electrolyser manufacturing and green hydrogen production under the National Green Hydrogen Mission’s Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) programme. For both tenders, the Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), overseeing the SIGHT programme, received bids exceeding the capacity offered under the SIGHT programme’s incentives.
“By leveraging India’s advantage in low-cost renewable electricity, the SIGHT program aims to achieve competitive domestic electrolyser manufacturing and reduce the costs of green hydrogen production. The programme has received an enthusiastic response from the industry,” says the report’s contributing author Vibhuti Garg, Director – South Asia, IEEFA.
 “The programme can be improved further to attract start-ups, be competitive for global players and create a supply chain and secure demand to ensure the industry’s long-term viability. If successful, it could help build India’s green hydrogen industry with benefits for a range of sectors, including agriculture, transport and manufacturing,” she added.
The SIGHT programme offers INR 4.44 billion ($541 million) of incentives for companies to set up 1.5 GW of electrolyser manufacturing capacity in India. SECI received 21 offers totalling 3,328.5 MW, which is more than double the capacity target. Eight companies were successful, including Reliance Electrolyser Manufacturing, John Cockerill Green Hydrogen Solutions and Jindal India, each securing 300 MW. The remaining capacity was divided between Ohmium Operations, Advait Infratech and Larsen & Toubro, HomiHydrogen and Adani New Industries.
“Most of the winning participants had prior tie-ups with electrolyser technology companies, some even securing technology licence agreements before bid submission, showcasing proactive strategies that contributed to their success,” says the report’s co-author Jyoti Gulia, Founder, JMK Research & Analytics.
Similarly, the tender for green hydrogen production was largely oversubscribed. SECI received 13 offers totaling 551,500 mtpa capacity, against the 450,000 mtpa target to be supported with INR 130.5 billion ($1.57 billion) incentives. Winners include Reliance, Greenko, ACME, HHP Two (Hygenco), Torrent Power, CESC Projects, Welspun, UPL, JSW Neo Energy and Bharat Petroleum. However, almost 38,000 mtpa of biomass-based capacity remains unallocated.
“Despite this enthusiasm, using green hydrogen to decarbonise domestic end-use industries remains uncertain due to challenges such as infrastructure limitations, regulatory ambiguities and the absence of clear mandates for its use,” says the report’s co-author Kapil Gupta, Manager, JMK Research.
“The winners will likely focus on export markets due to challenges and price concerns in the domestic market. The sector grapples with stringent safety regulations, technology changes, project delays, policy uncertainties and a need for robust hydrogen supply chain infrastructure,” he added.
The report highlights that while the SIGHT programme is off to a good start with enthusiasm from the industry, its ambitious goals can be hurt by its short tenure (five years) and comparatively low subsidies.
“Government intervention in establishing standards, policies and regulations and streamlining offtake for demand creation is crucial for developing the domestic green hydrogen market. Without such measures, India will likely remain a marginal player in the global green hydrogen market,” says the report’s contributing author Charith Konda, Energy Specialist, IEEFA.
The report also calls for strengthening the regulatory framework by issuing a clear set of emission standards for the green hydrogen industry, greater funding support for research & development and the adoption of global standards for India’s hydrogen ecosystem.
