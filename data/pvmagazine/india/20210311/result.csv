Chinese PV manufacturer Trina Solar has launched a new Vertex solar module with a power output of 670 W.
The new product, which features a conversion efficiency of 21.6%, was conceived for large scale solar power projects and is the most powerful panel manufactured by the company to date.
Trina said the panel is based on 210mm wafers, non-destructive cutting, high-density interconnection, and multi-busbar (MBB) technology. “The MBB and high-density interconnection improve the module efficiency to up to 21.6% while the non-destructive cutting pioneered by Trina Solar significantly reduces the risks of cell micro-crack[-ing] and power loss,” it explained.

How much better can PV plants perform and how much extra yield and cash can owners squeeze out of them? The simple answer is, the global solar fleet could generate an extra $14.48 billion in 2024 if asset management and operations and maintenance (O&M) were carried out to the highest standards.
That remarkable claim is the result of a study by digital asset management company Raycatch. The automated diagnostics provider fed the data of 75 solar plants into its proprietary DeepSolar artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analytics software and received what it described as the first quantification of technical issues in PV plants from real-data analysis.
In January, a Raycatch team collected data from sites in the United States, Japan, Germany, India, Italy, the United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, Norway, Finland, France, Spain, Romania, Israel, Taiwan, and Thailand, representing a cumulative generation capacity of 1.2 GW.
Running the numbers through AI-driven software enabled Raycatch to eliminate data ‘noise’ such as that generated by faulty sensors, shading, temperature changes, clouds, and electrical issues. Without the analytical properties of the AI-driven software, the researchers claimed, such noise would have obscured meaningful information which identified patterns and the root-causes of problems.
The arrays studied had an average generation capacity of 16.1 MW and featured 2,298 strings connected to 115 inverters.
The data analysis identified worn-out equipment as one of the most common causes of solar system under-performance. That might comprise degradation, back sheet, or soldering issues in modules, with panel problems making up a striking 80% of the performance issues analyzed. Inverter efficiency loss, which occurred in 55% of the plants analyzed; and string disconnection, which occurred in 65%, were also big culprits. Solar tracker malfunctions and faulty cables, connectors, and sensors were another problem, with faulty sensors occurring at a quarter of the sites. A lack of cleaning and grass cutting was among the other issues observed, as well as inefficient and lengthy manual repairs, according to the Raycatch analysis.
Having filtered out the irrelevant noise in the data, the Raycatch team ran the figures to estimate the volume of “recoverable energy” based on generation levels in the previous 12 months. The team estimated the plants had an average 5.27% recoverable energy. Translated into an annual figure, that added up to a $160,000 increase for the average, 16.1 MW plant.
The findings were married up with forecast assumptions made by industry body SolarPower Europe to calculate $6.3 billion worth of solar electricity will have been lost due to such failings in 2019, when the world had an estimated 630 GW of solar generation capacity. Based on the expectation that the global solar fleet could swell to 1,448 GW by 2024, the annual bill for such component failures could hit $14.48 billion.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/11/solar-manufacturer-wants-customs-duty-waiver-to-domestic-sales-by-sez-units/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 11, 2021",Solar manufacturer wants customs duty waiver to domestic sales by SEZ units,"Module manufacturer Vikram Solar has urged the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to consider basic customs duty (BCD) exemption to domestic sales by solar manufacturing units located in special economic zones (SEZs).
Solar modules and cells imported by India are set to attract basic customs duty of 40% and 25%, respectively, from April 2022, as the nation’s finance ministry has given the green light to the proposal.
The move, aimed to help domestic manufacturers compete with regional rivals, puts Indian SEZ units too at a disadvantage as their supplies to the domestic market would become costlier than manufacturers in the domestic tariff area (DTA).
Special economic zones are considered as international land for economic activities. And domestic sales by manufacturing units located within special economic zones (SEZs) are treated as exports. Therefore their domestic customers would be required to pay customs duty on the complete value of solar modules–even if the manufacturer used imported solar cells. Module manufacturers located in DTAs, on the other hand, would pay BCD only on the imported value of goods (cells) and there won’t be any BCD to be paid by their customers on the value addition done in DTA.
Gyanesh Chaudhary, Managing Director of Vikram Solar, welcomed the BCD implementation announcement but urged the MNRE for duty exemption to domestic sales by SEZ units.
He said, “The move is a testament of the government’s intent towards enabling Aatmanirbhar Bharat and making India the global manufacturing hub for solar energy. BCD implementation will provide the necessary impetus to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for solar equipment manufacturing in India, job-creation and reduce solar imports.
“[However] considering that 43% of solar panel manufacturing units and 63% of solar cell manufacturing units are located in SEZs, imposing BCD on SEZ units will impact the domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem. Imposition of BCD on SEZ units will make them highly uncompetitive resulting in underutilization of capacities, loss of investment and jobs. There will be a question mark on the very existence and survival of module manufacturers in SEZ units.”
The solar cell manufacturing capacity installed in SEZs is about 2,000 MW, compared to 1,164 MW in the domestic tariff areas (DTAs) or areas outside SEZs. Module manufacturing capacity installed in SEZs is 3,825 MW compared to 5,053 MW in DTAs.
