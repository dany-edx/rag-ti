The projects, connected to the state transmission utility grid, are to be deployed on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis.
The projects will be awarded through competitive bidding followed by reverse auction.
RUVNL will enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders.
“Already commissioned projects cannot be considered under this RfS. Projects under construction or projects which are not yet commissioned will, however, be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other Central or State Schemes,” states the tender document.
Minimum bid capacity is 50 MW. The projects are to be quoted in multiples of 10 MW only.
Identification of land, installation and ownership of the project, along with obtaining connectivity and necessary approvals and interconnection with the STU network for supply of power to RUVNL, will be under the scope of the solar power developer.

The project is also the single largest PV commissioning for Rays Power.
The plant is spread over 600 acres of land. It will offset over 375 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions over its lifetime, which is equivalent to emissions from 2.5 lakh fuel-engine cars, stated Rays Power Infra.
Rays Power Infra completed the project within the scheduled time frame of 14 months despite a challenging execution environment and difficult soil and weather conditions. The company is now focusing on establishing more such power plants in Bangladesh and other countries.

JSW Renew Energy Five will set up the battery storage as two projects of 250 MW/500 MWh each. 
SECI will sign a 12-year battery energy storage purchase agreement with JSW Energy or its arm. Under the agreement, JSW will receive a fixed capacity charge of INR 10.8 lakh per MW per month for twelve years. 
SECI is obligated to off-take 60% of the project capacity/energy and utilization of the remaining 40% capacity is to be managed by JSW Energy. 
The LoA for battery energy storage system marks JSW Energy’s foray into energy storage solutions.  JSW Energy will set up the battery energy storage system in Rajasthan, close to the Fatehgarh-III substations of the interstate power transmission system.
JSW Energy began commercial operations in 2000, with the commissioning of its first 2×130 MW thermal power plants at Vijayanagar, Karnataka. Since then, the company has enhanced its power generation capacity to 4,811 MW comprising thermal 3,158 MW, hydel 1,391 MW and solar 235 MW. The company is presently constructing various renewable power projects to the tune of 2.2 GW, and targets to achieve a total power generation capacity of 20 GW by the year 2030, with renewables accounting for 81% share of the total capacity. 
JSW Energy aims for a 50% reduction in its carbon footprint by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050 by transitioning towards renewable energy.

Longi Solar said it will invest CNY 42.5 billion to more than double its PV wafer and cell capacity. It plans to build new wafer and cell factories.
The company signed an investment agreement with the local government of Xixian New District, Shaanxi province. Construction of the new facilities should take no longer than 18 months and will be handled in multiple phases, with no phase lasting longer than six months, according to a company statement.
Longi expects the factories to be commissioned by 2025. They will create more than 15,000 jobs.
By the end of 2021, Longi’s wafer capacity stood at 105 GW, including 37 GW of PV cells and 60 GW of modules. It believes that those figures increased to 150 GW, 60 GW, and 85 GW, respectively, by the end of 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/19/all-perovskite-tandem-solar-cell-with-27-1-efficiency-via-gas-quenching/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 19, 2023",All-perovskite tandem solar cell with 27.1% efficiency via gas quenching,"From pv magazine Global
NREL researchers have fabricated an all-perovskite tandem solar cell with perovskite films to show reduced defect density and achieve a power conversion efficiency of 27.1%.
The new cell builds on another inverted perovskite solar cell fabricated with p-i-n structure, which was unveiled by the research group in September. This device, according to the scientists, was able to retain 87% of its original efficiency after 2,400 hours of operation at 55 C.
For the new cell, the group did not use an antisolvent to create a uniform perovskite film and used instead gas quenching, which consists of cooling the parts of a material down from critical temperature quickly in order to strengthen and harden. It is commonly used to maintain the properties associated with a crystalline structure or phase distribution.
“The result addressed the problem of the bromine and iodine separating, resulting in a perovskite film with improved structural and optoelectronic properties,” the scientists explained. “The gas-quenching process, when applied to high-bromine-content perovskite chemicals, forces the crystals to grow together, tightly packed from top to bottom, so they become like a single grain and significantly reduces the number of defects.”
Through this approach, the researchers were able to achieve a 20% efficiency for the wide-bandgap layer, which also showed operational stability, with less than 5% degradation over 1,100 hours.
When connected to a 1.25 eV narrow-bandgap bottom perovskite cell, the perovskite layer was able to bring the overall cell efficiency to 27.1% and its open-circuit voltage to 2.2 V.
“The gas-quench method is a general way for improving the performance of wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells,” said the scientists.
They presented the cell tech in “Compositional texture engineering for highly stable wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science.
“The new growth approach demonstrated the potential of high-performance all-perovskite tandem devices and advanced the development of other perovskite-based tandem architectures such as those that incorporate silicon,” they concluded.
