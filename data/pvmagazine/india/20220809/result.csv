Actis owns Sprng through its Mauritius-based unit, Solenergi Power. Shell Overseas Investment, an arm of Shell, acquired 100% of Solenergi Power and, with it, the Sprng Energy group of companies from Actis Solenergi (Actis). The transaction value of the Solenergi Power purchase is $1.55 billion, including 50% as cash capex and the remainder as debt obligations.
Actis set up Sprng Energy in 2017 as a renewable energy platform based in Pune, India. It develops and manages renewable energy facilities such as solar projects, wind farms, and infrastructure assets.
Shell’s operational renewables capacity will triple following the acquisition of Sprng Energy’s solar and wind assets. The deal also positions the energy giant as one of the first movers in building a truly integrated energy transition business in India. In India, its Shell Energy gas business serves customers through a fully owned and integrated value chain. It has also invested in companies like Husk Power Systems and Cleantech Solar Pte Ltd.

They have formed a hydrogen corpus fund to fund R&D related to multiple as of hydrogen, including its application as an automotive fuel, according to a recent statement by union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas, Rameswar Teli, in the upper house of parliament (Rajya Sabha). Oil and gas companies have also launched R&D projects to use green hydrogen for fuel cell-based mobility.
In addition, the government is supporting R&D and technology demonstration projects at academic institutions. Some of these projects are hydrogen fuel-based two-wheelers, developed and demonstrated by Banaras Hindu University, and hydrogen fuel-based three-wheelers developed and demonstrated by Banaras Hindu University, IIT Delhi and Mahindra & Mahindra. 
Indian Oil has developed a compact reforming process to produce hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (H-CNG) as a fuel for buses in Delhi. As part of a joint study with Indraprastha Gas Ltd., it installed its compact reformer plant at Delhi Transport Corp.’s Rajghat bus depot and carried out a six-month trial to run 50 gas-powered buses on the blended fuel.

Demand is pushing solar growth across the world to new heights, as Bloomberg senior analyst Rob Barnett forecasts deployment to increase by 30% this year. Total global solar deployment is closing in on 1 TW installed – an impressive milestone for the energy transition.
“The global solar picture is just staggering at this point,” Barnett told Yahoo Finance. “We are on track to install something like 250 GW of solar capacity this year.”
China is contributing the largest share to capacity growth this year, with about 108 GW of new operational PV. This is a near-doubling of the roughly 55 GW installed by China last year. The country has the world’s largest exposure to renewable energy, with 323 GW of solar and 338 GW of wind energy. President Xi Jinping aims for 1,200 GW combined by 2030, and the nation is currently ahead of schedule on that goal, said Bloomberg.
Renewable energy is hitting all-time highs in the United States, too. Renewable generation from solar and wind installations reached 28% in April – a new record for the category. And Barnett said the solar boom has just begun.
“There really is this big, top-line growth scenario that we see unfolding for all of the companies that are participating in the solar supply chain,” said Barnett.
Climate goals are one driver of the red-hot demand for solar, but Barnett said there is another force that is accelerating demand in the near-term.
“I would actually argue that the bigger driver for clean energy demand, particularly here in Europe, is elevated energy costs,” he said.
Costs continue to fall for PV, making it increasingly cost-competitive with oil, which has spiked in price since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Shipments of solar modules have fallen precipitously over 20 years, from $4.88/W in 2000 to $0.34/W in 2021, based on a recent report by the Energy Information Administration.
Barnett said he expects solar demand to retain its momentum, even if oil and natural gas prices cool off.
“It’s certainly possible that if you had some easing in the traditional fuel markets, that it might take the accelerator off, but I don’t really see that as being a material risk on the demand side of the equation for clean energy,” he said.
This demand-side momentum is likely to continue as prices improve and the global economy targets decarbonization.
“I do think that the economics are already quite good. And so you’d have to see such a sea change in terms of gas prices or coal prices, if you’re thinking about the power grid, to really reverse some of the trends. And I just don’t think there’s any appetite for it either,” said Barnett.

Frontier Energy said that results from a pre-feasibility study (PFS) into its proposed Bristol Springs Solar project in Western Australia show that it has the potential to be an early mover, low-cost green hydrogen producer.
The PFS, conducted by Perth-based Xodus Group, is based on the development of a large-scale green hydrogen production facility at Bristol Springs, with power sourced from the company’s planned first stage 114 MWdc solar farm. The solar would power a 36.6 MW alkaline electrolyzer, producing an estimated 4.4 million kilograms of green hydrogen per year.

Frontier said the projected unit cost of $2.83 per kg is also far lower than the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) current green hydrogen production cost forecast of between $6 to $9 per kg based on current electrolyser and renewable energy costs.
Frontier executive chair Grant Davey said the low cost is due in part to the project’s location near Waroona, about 120 kilometres south of Perth. To be built on a 195-hectare site next to the Worsley alumina refinery, the project is able to access existing infrastructure, including the Landwehr Terminal power line, allowing for excess solar energy to be sold via WA’s main energy grid. The company said there are also several established water sources in the area, meaning there is no requirement for capital-intensive infrastructure like desalination.
“Green hydrogen is a unique opportunity to store, move and distribute renewable energy and is set to play a huge role in helping humanity in decarbonising the energy we need,” Davey said.
“The Frontier Energy green hydrogen project is strategically located with suitable land, abundant water, South West Interconnected System (SWIS) access, gas pipeline access and transport infrastructure so as to be an Australian leader in ensuring that green hydrogen production and distribution becomes a near-term reality.”
