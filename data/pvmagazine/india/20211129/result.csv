https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/29/arci-signs-lithium-battery-technology-transfer-pact-with-nsure/,"EV BATTERIES,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021",ARCI signs lithium battery technology transfer pact with Nsure,"The International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI), an autonomous R&D center under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India, has signed an agreement with Bengaluru-based Nsure Reliable Power Solutions, for technical know-how transfer and training in Li-ion battery fabrication.
The Centre for Automotive Energy Materials, ARCI, has developed Li-ion battery technology and demonstrated its successful application in electric scooters and solar street lamps.
It has successfully fabricated prismatic/cylindrical cells (up to 20 Ah) and lithium-ion battery modules up to 48V, 1 kWh. On-road test trials conducted with e-cycle and e-scooter using these lithium battery modules have shown a range of 30 km/charge and 52 km/charge, respectively.
Dr. Anil Kakodkar, Chairman, Governing Council, ARCI, said that the partnership between ARCI and Nsure Reliable Power Solutions is an important milestone to address challenges associated with climate change and carbon footprints. He emphasized the need for indigenous technology development for sustenance and highlighted the importance of partnership between R&D labs and industries to take technologies to higher technology readiness levels. He also stressed the need for competent human resources, multiple formats to leverage complementary resources of stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem, and government support for technology upscaling and commercialization. 
Kakodkar said that the ARCI-Nsure agreement can be a role model for how such an ecosystem can evolve in the country.
“The cost of electrode materials contributes significantly towards the overall cost of LiBs, and as India is heavily dependent on import of these materials, it has become essential to indigenously develop a technology and support industrial organizations in LIB technology,” said Dr Tata Narasinga Rao, Director, ARCI.
ARCI is developing several cathodes, anodes, and binder materials that could increase the performance and lifetime of lithium-ion batteries for EVs. The cathode materials include LFP, NMC, NCA, LMO, LNMO, and FeF3, whereas high energy/power density anodes include Si, Sn, MoO3, WO3, SnO2, Fe3O4, graphene, carbon nanohorns/nanotubes.

The plant, to be built with an investment of INR 301.92 crore, will be set up in Odisha for captive consumption of Mahanadi Coalfields through long-term open access.
Following the launch of a tender in August, Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd has selected a Chennai-based firm to build the PV project within 10 months. 
Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd targets to install 182 MW of solar power by 2024 in its pursuit to become a net-zero energy company. Towards achieving that goal, it commissioned a 2 MWp solar plant in October 2014, which has been operational with an average performance ratio of 75%. To date, the plant has reduced 1,08,77,805 kg of carbon emission. In addition, 66 service buildings of Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd have been identified for the installation of the rooftop solar plants.

Spanish start-up Tornasol Energy has launched a solar kit to enable flexible PV power generation on balconies, terraces, awnings, caravans and boats.
The kit consists of one or two modules, a microinverter, and a five-meter cable. Thanks to its plug-in technology, it can be connected to any electrical outlet and immediately begin generating electricity.
The company sells a 300 W kit including only one panel, at a price of €450; and a 600 W kit, including two modules, at a price of €790.
The SunPower-branded modules have a size of 1,710×1,029×5.6mm and a weight of 6kg. The cell efficiency is indicated at 24.8%. The microinverter, which is provided by Chinese manufacturer Envertech, measures 248x236x27.5mm and weighs in at 2.8kg. Its efficiency is around 95%.
The offer also includes the mounting structures to hang the panels on a balcony railing.
“The idea came from our own experience. Seeing the trend in the cost of electricity, we wanted to rely on solar energy by installing panels on our balconies but the bulky conventional panels we found did not allow it,” said Santiago Vernetta, co-founder of the company. “It was then that we decided to investigate [creating] kits that would allow a more versatile use.”
According to the company, the solar panels are flexible and easy to handle, and they connect directly to any socket feeding the home network. Tornasol Energy is currently working on including batteries in the kits.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/29/solar-heat-pump-solution-for-water-pool-heating/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021","Solar heat pump solution for water, pool heating","From pv magazine International
U.S. solar thermal panel manufacturer Fafco has developed a photovoltaic-thermal heat pump solution for water and pool heating.
“The solution utilizes an open-loop solar drain-back style system that is coupled to the Phoenix which would be mounted on a wall near a hot water storage tank,” the company’s founder, Freeman Ford, told pv magazine. “The simplicity of the system lends itself to a quick to understand and install solar system along with an all-in-one heat pump, circulation module and additional thermal storage of approximately 5kWh.”
The Phoenix system consists of three elements: a CoolPV photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module manufactured by Fafco; a 5 kWh thermal battery with a heat pump, two braised heat exchangers, two pumps, and multifunction software; and a 50-gallon electric hot water heater provided by unspecified manufacturers in California.
“The system consists of several well-known and proven technologies connected in a novel way with patents issued and pending,” Ford further explained. “The system uses software for several purposes including to optimize performance and load level for the utilities.”
According to Fafco, the two circulation pumps with speed control are designed for optimal efficiency. One supplies the solar loop and the other for getting the heated water to and from the hot water storage tank. These pumps interface with the refrigerant loop in the heat pump via the two brazed plate heat exchangers that have been specified, optimized, and tested for this purpose.
The system, according to the manufacturer, has several advantages compared to what is available on the market today. For example, the system is connected to 120Vac, which eliminates the requirement to rewire for 220Va, and, is said to be 50% more efficient than the air-sourced systems being sold today. “Furthermore, it is designed for retrofit in existing systems or a different version can be used in new home construction,” Ford said. “Phoenix systems will be interconnected for use by the electric utilities to shift load from peak to off-peak demand.”
The 60-cell monocrystalline PVT panel is made with a photovoltaic module provided by U.S. manufacturer Silfab that has been retrofitted by Fafco with its own thermal collector system. It is available with PV power output ranging from 310 to 330 W and power conversion efficiencies ranging from 18.2 to 19.4%. The open-circuit voltage spans from 36.69 to 40.50 V and the short-circuit current from 10.22 to 10.42 A.
All CoolPV modules (including the thermal unit) measure 1,700 x 1,000 x 123 mm, weigh in at 26 kg, and have a roof load of 15.3 kg/m2. The power temperature coefficient is -0.36% per degree Celsius and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
As for the thermal panel, which is the same for all three module wattages, it has an operating pressure of 20 pounds per square inch (psi) and an operating temperature range between 15 and 38 degrees Celsius. Its stagnation temperature is 58 degree Celsius. For a commercial pool case study, the manufacturer recommends the installation of 40 CoolPV modules with an aggregate capacity of over 12 kW.
The California-based company plans to launch the Phoenix system next year. “Initially our sales will focus on new home construction, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and PV dealers,” Ford said. “We expect to be selling Phoenix by late 2022 accelerating exponentially in the years to follow.”
