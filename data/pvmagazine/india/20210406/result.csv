This project in North Goa benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with GIM. The PPA was signed on October 23, 2020.
As per the contract, GIM will purchase all the energy produced by the solar panels on the roof of its building. It can feed the unused excess energy into the grid.
The Goa plant is Technique Solaire’s first private PPA-based project in India, and also happens to be its first rooftop project in the nation. Its local subsidiary JLTM has already commissioned a 27 MW ground-mounted project in Maharashtra and a 5.5 MW plant in Uttarakhand.
“A lot of time was spent on planning this project, but the execution was done very fast. There were multiple challenges because of distributed roofs and maintaining the aesthetics of the beautiful GIM campus, but the support from the Goa Institute of Management and Goa Electricity Department was exemplary. This project reaffirms Technique Solaire’s commitment to the Indian solar sector,” said Manu Bishnoi, director of Technique Solaire India (JLTM).
In Goa, more than 90% of rooftop solar installations are under the net metering scheme, which allows consumers to feed the surplus electricity generated by the solar plant into the grid and get an equivalent amount on their bill.

The device-level, industrial Internet of Things-enabled solution by Urja combines smart sensors and analytics platform to detect energy losses and predict maintenance of production machinery, allowing small and medium businesses to save on their electricity consumption. Companies can track circuit-level energy wastage in real-time.
Urja intends to use the new investment to scale up its sales strategy, expand B2B business and strengthen back-end technology using advanced artificial intelligence/machine learning capabilities.
Tata Power declined to comment on the investment when contacted by pv magazine.
The target industries for the Urja energy analytics solution are industrial manufacturing, power and industrial HVACs.
With this offering, Tata Power aims to become a fully integrated Energy as a Service (EaaS) solution provider.
“We are glad to strengthen our partnership with a deep tech company like Urja. It shares our goal of delivering an enhanced value-added energy management experience for customers. With this seed support, we look forward to creating a robust solution to offer newer services to our customers in the space of energy consumption and optimization,” said Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director, Tata Power.
Manoj Kumar, founder and chief executive officer of Social Alpha, said their co-investment in Urja alongside Tata Power provides Urja access to their entire ecosystem of technology and business offerings and investor network to help it become growth-ready.
According to Urja founders, their patented sensors and analytics solution has the global potential for energy saving to the tune of over US$ 2 billion. They claim to have already tracked INR 20 crore worth of energy consumption through their EcoSense solution till now.
“We are just scratching the surface of how powerful device-level insights can be when it’s offered at a massive scale to a manufacturing and power ecosystem. The financial backing of Social Alpha and Tata Power will help us execute our vision even more rapidly and build scalable products, learning from experience, perspective and relationships of a leading Power Company,” said Saurabh Jhamb, Chief Executive Officer, Urja.
RISE Institute Sweden has estimated that device-level energy innovations such as Urja can enable the avoidance of 13 MtCO2e per year by 2030.
Urja is being incubated since 2019 at Social Alpha’s Clean Energy International Incubation Centre (CEIIC), a joint initiative of the Government of India and Tata Trusts, and supported by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), BIRAC, Tata Power, and Tata Power-DDL. CEIIC is India’s first international incubator in clean energy under the aegis of Mission Innovation.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/06/azure-power-sells-152-mw-solar-rooftop-portfolio-to-radiance-renewables/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 6, 2021",Azure Power sells 152 MW solar rooftop portfolio to Radiance Renewables,"In its first-ever asset sale, New Delhi-based Azure Power Global has agreed to sell its solar rooftop portfolio to distributed renewable energy platform Radiance Renewables for INR 536.5 crore (US$ 73.5 million). The deal for the asset sale was announced by the two players yesterday. 
Radiance Renewables is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the UK-India Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF), managed by EverSource Capital, and is focused on serving corporate, commercial, industrial, and residential customers. 
As per the agreement, Radiance Renewables will acquire solar rooftop assets aggregating to 152.5 MW, including 8.1 MW of under-construction and 18.5 MW of newly commissioned assets.
Azure Power expects the transaction to improve its run rate Cash Flow to Equity (CFe) and reduce general and administrative (G&A) expenses.
The company’s rooftop portfolio generated INR 33.1 crore (US$ 4.5 million) in EBITDA for the January-December period of the year 2020. After excluding rooftop revenues, it estimates its FY2021-22 revenue to be INR 1720-1820 crore (or US$ 236 – $249 million). Besides, the company now expects its general and administrative expenses (excluding stock compensation expenses and transaction costs) to reduce to US$ 20 million from the previous estimate of US$ 22 million inclusive of the rooftop portfolio.
Azure expects to take an estimated INR 290-440 crore (US$ 40 – $60 million) one-time charge subject to purchase price adjustments and other conditions related to this sale. 
Proceeds are expected to be received before December 31, 2021. 
KPMG was the financial advisor, and Trilegal was counsel to Azure Power on this transaction.
Speaking on this occasion, Ranjit Gupta, Chief Executive Officer, Azure Power said, “This sale, the first-ever asset sale in Azure Power’s history, illustrates the company’s commitment to capital discipline. The sale of this non-strategic portfolio allows us to enhance returns on invested capital through efficiency gains and cost optimisation whilst recycling capital into higher return, committed projects. Our focus is on creation of shareholder value.”
On the other hand, this strategic acquisition will position Radiance as a significant pan India player in the Commercial, Industrial and Institutional segments with exposure to long-term power purchase agreements with quality customers. 
“This transaction allows Radiance to bring its high-quality asset management skills to improve asset performance given its focus on enhancing and delivering value to its stakeholders. We plan to introduce cutting-edge asset management tools such as real-time monitoring with analytics and aim to make Radiance a leading Renewable Energy as a Service (REaaS) player in India,” said Manikkan Sangameswaran, Executive Director, Radiance Renewables.
