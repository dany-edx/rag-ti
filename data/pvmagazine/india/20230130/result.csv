The  Optima project, located in Maharashtra, will deliver clean power to commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in the State.
The developer said the Optima project has been developed by its India team using its proprietary software platform, which optimizes multiple renewable technologies to meet customers’ load requirements. The renewable power project will meet up to 80% of C&I customers’ power consumption and potentially save customers up to 25% annually on their energy bills while avoiding carbon emissions equivalent to up to 6 million tonnes for project life.
The project will consist of co-located wind and solar components, making efficient utilization of grid infrastructure and enabling ease of operations for the grid operator.
“BrightNight is growing rapidly in its quest to globally deliver the next-generation of renewable power projects,” BrightNight CEO Martin Hermann said. “India is a high-growth market with a strong demand for renewable power. I am proud of the India team’s progress and excited about the tremendous potential this market presents for BrightNight.”
Having secured the grid connectivity at the state grid substation, BrightNight is targeting to commission the project by March 2024. BrightNight will work with C&I customers to sign long-term power offtake agreements for the project to meet the highest portion of their power load requirements.
BrightNight has a global portfolio of 23 GW across the U.S. and Asia Pacific and is backed by Cordelio, a subsidiary of the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). It has identified India as a core market for its global platform and entered the market with a 1 GW+ portfolio under development led by India CEO Sajay KV and India COO and CFO Naveen Khandelwal, who with the team have collectively delivered more than 7 GW of in-country wind and solar projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/30/union-budget-2023-mainstreaming-flexible-and-resilient-grids/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SMART GRIDS,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"JANUARY 30, 2023",Union Budget 2023: Mainstreaming flexible and resilient grids,"2023 is going to be a critical year for India, with the country taking up the G-20 presidency and this being the penultimate year for the next general elections. Thus, a slew of economic reforms could be expected.
In the electricity sector, there have been several hits and misses in the past but the Indian growth story remains strong. The sector bounced back rather quickly post-Covid, particularly in terms of electricity demand that registered the highest ever daily peak of 212.6 GW in June’22, up 9% from the prior year and up 16% from pre-COVID-19 levels. The sharp increase in demand is a testimony to our growing economy as well as an indication of rising temperatures and climate change.
To combat climate change, India has pledged to increase its non-fossil fuel-based installed capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. The flipside to clean energy (esp. wind and solar) is that it’s intermittent and variable, unlike conventional supply sources based on coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydro, etc. Thus, as we work towards our decarbonization goals, we increasingly need resources and mechanisms to balance the intermittency in the electricity supply.
The patterns are changing on the demand side as well. Our peak demand (Megawatts) is outpacing our energy demand (Megawatt Hours), creating the need for a physical upgrade in generation and network capacity to meet demand only for short periods. Further, there is an ingress of distributed resources such as solar rooftops that can inject power back into the grid, electrification of transport and associated charging infrastructure, electrification of heating, etc., all of which is increasing the variability in electricity demand.
This is a double whammy, necessitating power systems to be more flexible and capable of producing a quick and calibrated response to changes in demand and supply. A range of flexibility sources are available, such as (i) demand side flexibility e.g., Demand Response (DR) and Time of Use (ToU) tariffs to nudge consumers to modulate demand in response to price signals, (ii) flexible generation, involving hybrid RE + energy storage, synthetic inertia by instant power injection through energy storage, retrofitting coal-fired plants for cycling duty etc. (iii) operational flexibility involving better RE forecasting, joint market operation of energy storage (in day-ahead and real-time markets), improved scheduling and dispatch practices, etc. Sector coupling is also becoming increasingly important for decarbonization and flexibility, as it helps convert surplus clean energy into heat and gas (hydrogen, ammonia, etc.) and vice-versa.
Power system flexibility also requires robust, interconnected, and smart transmission and distribution networks. This enables better visibility and control over loads and resources, better forecasting of network constraints, and deployment of a portfolio of resources to balance demand and supply.
However, power system or grid flexibility is a complex, interconnected space that spans technologies, markets, and sectors. For instance, energy storage is a common technology that can be deployed on the demand side, supply side, and networks to provide flexibility. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) are two of the techno-commercially feasible and versatile storage media. Hydrogen is gradually coming into focus and there are other more exotic concepts like flywheels, gravity storage, and supercapacitors.
From a market enablement perspective, we require harmonized grid codes, standards, and practices to integrate new technologies with existing grids; policies and regulations to enable participation of emerging technologies and innovative business models, say ‘Storage as a Service’ or ‘Demand Response’ to participate in the energy and balancing markets. Incentives are needed to pilot and subsidize such new models and technologies to achieve commercial scale, in the same way we did with solar and wind a decade ago. Similarly, harmonization of policies is required among different sectors such as power, oil & gas, transport, renewable, metals & mining, manufacturing, etc. to create synergies and enable broad-spectrum technologies like batteries and hydrogen to thrive.
Last, but not least, power systems face a multitude of external threats which have a large potential to disrupt our interconnected grids and inflict heavy socio-economic damages. Such threats could be Natural (floods, cyclones, landslides.), Human Induced (cybercrimes, terrorist attacks, riots, etc.), Technological (equipment failure, software, and hardware failure, malware, etc.), and Health Emergencies (e.g., Covid-19, Swine Flu, Ebola).
Along with flexibility, grids also need to be resilient, i.e., capable of anticipating, preparing, absorbing, mitigating, and recovering from such events in a timely and efficient manner. This requires technological interventions as well as business/sector-level protocols and planning to respond to threats.
While the current policy regime supports the adoption of flexible resources like batteries, grid flexibility and resilience require more focus and a range of calibrated efforts, including due acknowledgment as a sector priority and robust planning at the central and state level. The upcoming union budget provides an opportunity for the government to develop flexible and resilient grids. Some of the desired measures are indicated below:
Flexibility and resilience are critical for the clean energy transition. This is also an opportunity to create a more reliable and efficient power sector that could propel our growing economy and buttress the aspirations of our upwardly mobile citizens.

The report, mischievously timed before Adani’s Follow on Public Offer (FPO), was rubbished by the Indian conglomerate as “not merely an unwarranted attack on any specific company but a calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity, and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India.”
Hindenburg holds short positions in various listed companies of the Adani portfolio through U.S. traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivatives, along with other non-Indian-traded reference securities. Adani termed Hindenburg as an unethical short seller who intended to make a windfall gain by causing a downward spiral of share price through false allegations. [A short seller in the securities market books gains from the subsequent reduction in prices of shares.]
Adani Group said none of the 88 questions raised by the Hindenburg’s report was based on independent or journalistic fact-finding.
The group said 65 of the 88 questions related to matters that have been duly disclosed by Adani Portfolio companies in their annual reports available on their websites, offering memorandums, financial statements, and stock exchange disclosures. Of the balance 23 questions, 18 related to public shareholders and third parties, while the balance five are baseless allegations.
“Hindenburg’s conduct is nothing short of a calculated securities fraud under applicable law,” Adani Group said in its response.

Ltd (SCCL), which has diversified into thermal and solar power generation in addition to its core business of coal mining, has commissioned its first floating solar power plant at the Singareni Thermal Power Station (STPS) in Jaipur village of the Mancherial district in Telangana. 
SCCL is setting up a 15 MW (AC)/19.5 MW (DC) floating solar power plant at the STPS reservoir. In the first phase, it commissioned and synchronized 5 MW of the floating solar plant. The second phase of 10 MW is expected to be commissioned in the next few months.
The 5 MW(AC)/6.5 MW(DC) floating solar plant was executed by Hyderabad-headquartered Novus Green Energy Systems. “The plant uses transparent glass-to-glass solar modules, which are more efficient than traditional solar modules,” said Anshuman Yenigalla, managing director of Novus Green.
Novus Green carried out end-to-end manufacturing and built the 5 MW floating PV plant through its in-house teams and manufacturing facility. Solar panels used in the plant were manufactured at its facility in India. Indian company FloatVolt supplied the floating boards.
“The project faced several challenges, such as the design and manufacturing of floating boards meeting all testing standards and fixing frameless glass-to-glass modules onto the float boards. The overall design was vetted by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), making it the first floating solar project to be vetted by a premium institute like IIT,” said Yenigalla.

After having published the agronomic results on viticulture and arboriculture, French agrivoltaic specialist Sun’Agri has now unveiled a report on a crop of eggplants grown in the Brinkhoff agrivoltaic greenhouse in Granges-sur-Lot, in the region of Lot-et-Garonne.
Commissioned in September 2020, the 2500 m² facility meets the needs of the operator to adapt production to ever greater climatic hazards. The increase in the average temperature in greenhouses (30 C in spring and 40C in summer) causes burns on flowers and acceleration of the development of new pests.
One year after commissioning, the first results showed higher yields under the panels compared to a reference area without modules. More than 800 kg of vegetables were harvested under the device compared to around 500 kg for the reference area. Furthermore, eggplants harvested under panels have a higher biomass, synonymous with better development of the plant.
“We are pleased that this feedback from the Brinkhoff greenhouse confirms in the field the benefits of dynamic agrivoltaics for market gardening and greenhouse crops,” said Cécile Magherini, director of Sun’Agri. “Beyond being a tool for adaptation and resilience in the face of climate challenges for the farmer, intelligent management of our technology makes it possible to optimize agricultural production.”
The group has equipped the crops with three types of sensors for a detailed analysis of their condition and the consideration of meteorological factors. Micro-meteorological sensors placed at different heights of the plant measure air temperature, humidity, wind, and radiation.
Moreover, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR ) sensors measure the active radiation for photosynthesis, making it possible to estimate the growth of the plant and its needs using the models.  “Plant sensors” make it possible to observe the behavior of the plant (water status, functioning, stress, organ temperature) and to optimize its well-being in real time.
“We grow various vegetables under these louvers without needing to bleach the greenhouses in the summer. With two years of hindsight, there is less pressure from pests such as aphids. The upcoming harvests will allow us to confirm and complete the first encouraging results of this tool,” stated Youp Brinkhoff, manager of the farm.
Since the greenhouse was commissioned, nine fruits and vegetables have been grown: tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, peppers, celery, fennel, spinach, lamb’s lettuce and green beans.
