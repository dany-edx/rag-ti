The IREDA loan to Husk represents the biggest debt financing for rural microgrids in India to date. It is part of a line of credit provided by German development bank KfW to IREDA to assist developers in scaling off-grid energy projects.
Husk will use the amount to finance 140 microgrids in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where it has been serving rural communities since 2008, including thousands of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). 
Besides the IREDA loan, Husk expects to raise an additional $18 million in debt in 2022 to fuel accelerated project deployment, while also kicking off fundraising for a Series D equity round in the first quarter. The company has built a robust project pipeline in both India and Africa and expects to have about 1,300 grids in operation by 2025 across multiple markets.
“The IREDA financing demonstrates the Government of India’s vision in making microgrids an integral part of its net-zero goal put forward at COP26,” said Husk CEO and Co-Founder Manoj Sinha. “This is a huge validation of Husk Power’s leadership in being the first company to achieve commercial scale. The IREDA funding will give Husk a much-needed boost to achieve our target of expanding our microgrid fleet 10x by 2025.”
Husk CFO Naveen Garg added, “We’re extremely grateful to IREDA, KfW, and technical consultants PwC for the close collaboration that made this financing possible.”
Husk recently signed an Energy Compact with the United Nations, committing to build 5,000 microgrids with one million connections by 2030 in India, Nigeria, and other countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

The kit is useful for pumping water in remote areas and helps small scale farmers who could pool money to use the equipment on a shared basis.
The technology has already been deployed in hard-to-reach areas of Odisha.
IIT Bhubaneswar academics Srinivas Bhaskar Karanki, of the school of electrical sciences, and Satish D Dhandole, from the school of mechanical sciences, led the project.
Karanki told pv magazine: “We have used a tractor trolley for the movable system. The trolley is designed to have a foldable structure to accommodate six panels. The trolley needs to be attached with the tractor head to move from one place to another. The system works with two different types of pumps, one submersible and the other surface-mounted. The surface-mount is taken along with the movable SPV [solar photovoltaic] system. Further, the movable structure is equipped with an inverter.”  
The system can generate enough power to operate submersible and monoblock-pump AC motors even at low irradiation. The inverter circuitry is designed to achieve maximum solar energy harvesting with single-stage power conversion from DC to AC, thereby increasing reliability and reducing the overall cost.

The system can also be operated from a single-phase grid electricity supply, if needed, and is designed to operate a 2hp AC pump with the inverter able to accommodate up to 5hp loads.
The mobile solar pumps have been installed in 13 locations in districts including Angul, Dhenkanal, Puri, Bhadrak, Korput, Keonjhar, Nayagarh, and Mayurbhaj. Three more systems have been installed in the villages of Podapada, Kanaspada, and Khudupur, with those settlements having been adopted by IIT Bhubaneswar under the government’s Unnat Bharat Abhiyan policy, which aims to leverage scientific advances developed in academic institutions in rural settings.
The mobile solar project is funded by the Directorate of Agriculture and Food Production of the government of Odisha under the central government’s Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana agricultural development program.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/17/a-4000-cycle-lithium-sulfur-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,LITHIUM-SULFUR,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 17, 2022","A 4,000 cycle lithium-sulfur battery","From pv magazine Global
Among the many different battery chemistries promising a big jump in the capacity, lifetime and cost of energy storage, lithium-sulfur stands out for its potential for strong performance without turning to rare or difficult to obtain materials.
Lithium-sulfur batteries, however, tend to lose their capacity very quickly thanks to an unwanted side reaction that occurs between cathode and electrolyte as the battery cycles. This leads to the formation of polysulfides, which cannot be reversed and quickly causes the battery to shut down. Most of the solutions to this suggested by researchers have focused on working with different electrolytes better able to cycle with sulfur, or changes to the separator film keeping the two components apart.
Scientists led by Drexel University in the US instead decided to focus on modifying the sulfur containing cathode to work better with commercially available carbonate electrolytes. “Having a cathode that works with the carbonate electrolyte that they’re already using is the path of least resistance for commercial manufacturers,” explained Vibha Kalra, a professor at Drexel University who led the research. “So rather than pushing for the industry adoption of a new electrolyte, our goal was to make a cathode that could work in the pre-existing Li-ion electrolyte system.”
Monoclinic gamma-phase sulfur
The group’s initial approach relied on embedding sulfur within a carbon nanofiber mesh designed to mitigate the polysulfide reaction. While this wasn’t successful, their cathode performed far better than expected in testing, and they set out to explain why. After a lot more testing, the group was able to confirm that during deposition, the sulfur had crystallized in an unexpected way, forming a variation on the element known as monoclinic gamma-phase sulfur.
“At first, it was hard to believe that this is what we were detecting, because in all previous research monoclinic sulfur has been unstable under 95 degrees Celsius,” said Rahul Pai, a doctoral student at Drexel. “In the last century there have only been a handful of studies that produced monoclinic gamma sulfur and it has only been stable for 20-30 minutes at most. But we had created it in a cathode that was undergoing thousands of charge-discharge cycles without diminished performance — and a year later, our examination of it shows that the chemical phase has remained the same.”
The battery is described in full in the paper Stabilization of gamma sulfur at room temperature to enable the use of carbonate electrolyte in Li-S batteries, published in Communications Chemistry. It demonstrated an initial capacity of 800 milliamp hours per gram (mAh/g−1), which had fallen to 650mAh/g−1 after 4000 cycles.
“While we are still working to understand the exact mechanism behind the creation of this stable monoclinic sulfur at room temperature, this remains an exciting discovery and one that could open a number of doors for developing more sustainable and affordable battery technology,”
The group notes that further investigation of the cathode’s surface, the role of carbon nanofibers and potential additives to the electrolyte would be needed for the technology to reach “commercial-grade performance.” And they hope this work will inspire more research into the fundamental behavior of sulfur in various battery types. “This will enable a deeper understanding of the system facilitating the commercialization of Li–S batteries,” they conclude.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/17/rooftop-solar-price-to-keep-rising-this-year/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 17, 2022",Rooftop solar price to keep rising this year,"From pv magazine Global 
With consumers being warned daily about inflation on everything from the weekly food shop to tabletop wargame miniatures, London-based analyst GlobalData has stated rooftop solar panels will be no exception.
With the pandemic and its knock-on effects on global supply chains having, since 2020, halted years of thumping panel price cost reductions, a report published today by GlobalData stated that as far as rooftop solar modules are concerned: “Cost is expected to moderately increase in 2022.”
Interestingly, a note issued by the analyst to publicize its Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Market, 2021 – Global Market Size, Market Share, Major Trends, and Key Country Analysis to 2030 report did not point to last year’s shortage of panel raw material polysilicon as a reason for rising module prices.
GlobalData power analyst Attaurrahman Ojindaram Saibasan instead highlighted the fact post-Covid supply chain headaches had reduced the volume of solar cells and modules available for shipping, with delays in shipments confounded by shortages of workers due to pandemic-related restrictions on movement.
Basing its numbers on the 10-12 340W solar panels required to power a 1,200 square foot residence, GlobalData said the cost of rooftop arrays had fallen $600-900 per year from a level of around $9,300 in 2014 to $4,550 by the time Covid-19 brought the world to a standstill in 2020.
Last year, by contrast, the price of a rooftop system rebounded $700 to a level not seen since 2018, GlobalData said, and that increasing expense is not expected to be reversed this year.
Even when a return to falling rooftop solar prices arrives in 2023, the rest of the decade will be marked by costs that decline “gradually,” according to the analyst, as component costs retreat again, production volume is scaled up, and panel technology advances.
The study noted that with the world’s rooftop solar systems in 2020 roughly split a third for residential and two-thirds for commercial and industrial arrays, China accounted for 12.4% of the near-249GW of rooftop panel generation capacity installed by the end of that year.
That contribution helped Asia claim 53.5% of the world’s rooftop panels at the end of 2020, with 29.1% in Europe and 13.6% in the Americas, according to GlobalData.
