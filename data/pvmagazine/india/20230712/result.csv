It recommends four ways to achieve this goal: Demand-side measures like time-of-use tariffs, a well-connected national grid, various energy storage options for grid balancing services, and conversion of fossil-fuel-powered fleet to operate flexibly. 
“For India to meet growing electricity demand while addressing climate concerns, increased integration of clean energy, including variable renewable energy is essential,” stated the report’s author Charith Konda, Energy Analyst, IEEFA.
“While raising non-fossil fuel power’s installed capacity share to 50% by 2030 may be relatively easier to achieve, reducing the emissions intensity of its economy by 45% by 2030 from 2005 levels requires increased integration of variable renewable energy in the power system,” he added.    
According to the report, to increase renewable energy integration in the power system, one of the immediate measures is introducing effective time-of-use (ToU) electricity tariffs. ToU tariffs help change the electricity consumption pattern. These tariffs encourage electricity consumption when the renewable energy supply is high and can even help balance the grid by regulating load from rooftop solar and electric vehicle users.
Konda recommends a step-wise approach of introducing dynamic ToU electricity prices across consumer segments to reap the benefits. “India needs dynamic ToU tariffs rather than static ones. Studies suggest that successfully implementing a dynamic ToU pricing regime can reduce peak demand by 5-25%,” he said.
The report also suggests that a well-connected national grid that transcends several regions ensures optimal utilization of uneven distribution of energy sources.
“A strong inter-regional grid will better absorb and balance regional variations in renewable energy generation and reduce renewable energy curtailment,” said Konda.
“India is on the right path in proactively building the transmission infrastructure, which would, in turn, help integrate more renewable capacity into the power system and improve grid stability,” he added.
The report finds that pumped hydro storage (PHS) projects and battery energy storage systems (BESS) are promising energy storage technologies that can play a crucial role in grid-balancing services.
“As a next step, the country should widen the scope of energy storage applications to provide a variety of grid balancing services rather than viewing energy storage in one dimension of firming renewable energy supply,” said Konda.
Finally, the report states converting existing coal power plants to operate flexibly will ensure the utilization of a large existing fleet to provide load-balancing services and create space for integrating higher shares of variable renewable energy. 
“Running coal plants flexibly can save already-established coal power plants from getting stranded. It also increases the per unit cost of coal power, making renewable energy plus storage more competitive in the merit order dispatch system,” said Konda.
“Converting India’s coal power fleet to run flexibly will lead to some technical, financial, and regulatory/contractual challenges. The solutions include identifying suitable plants for conversion into flexible plants based on technical and financial parameters, redesigning coal power purchase contracts, and developing markets that allow flexible operations,” he added.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/12/fully-printed-carbon-electrode-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-19-2-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JULY 12, 2023",Fully printed carbon electrode perovskite solar cell achieves 19.2% efficiency,"Researchers in Germany have sought to improve the performance of carbon electrode perovskite solar cells through a hole-transporting bilayer made of organic semiconductors, instead of a conventional hole transport layer (HTL), which they said is able to enhance their fill factor and open-circuit voltage.
They explained that replacing costly gold, silver, and copper with carbon in perovskite solar cells typically causes efficiency losses and stability issues compared to benchmark devices. “For the printable cells, we aim at eventually transferring this technology into a roll-to-roll fabrication line,” Tian Du, corresponding co-author told pv magazine, noting that the next steps on the path to commercialization are to fabricate a mini solar module on glass substrates, then a mini solar module on flexible substrate, and then transfer to roll-to-roll fabrication.
The German team built the cell with a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), the perovskite absorber, the hole-transporting bilayer (HTbl), and the carbon contact. “The HTbL configuration forms an energy cascade at the interface, with the outer HTL 2 reinforcing Ohmic contact with the carbon, whereas the inner HTL 1 reduces surface
recombination of the perovskite,” it explained.
For the absorber, they used a  mix cation perovskite known as (FAPbI3)0.93 (MAPbBr 3)0.07. They applied the two layers in sequential blade coating which they said can maximize hole injection/extraction at the electrode interface while minimizing surface recombination of perovskite layers.
They tested the device under standard illumination conditions and found it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V, a short-circuit current of 23.7 A, and a fill factor of 76%. For comparison, a reference cell with a single hole transport layer reached an efficiency of 17.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.06 V, a short-circuit current of 23.3 A, and a fill factor of 76%.
The cell based on the bilayer also showed stable operation of 2,500 h at 65 C in a nitrogen environment.
The cell is described in the study “Efficient, stable, and fully printed carbon-electrode perovskite solar cells enabled by hole-transporting bilayers,” published in Joule. The research team comprises academics from the Institute of Materials for Electronics and Energy Technology (i-MEET) and the Institute of Micro- and Nanostructure Research & Center for Nanoanalysis and Electron Microscopy (CENEM).
“Our results highlight that carbon electrodes can significantly enhance the intrinsic stability of perovskite solar cell without dedicated interfacial modifications,” they concluded.

The wide-ranging MoU includes research and joint convenings in the field of sustainable finance.
As per the Landscape of Green Finance in India report published by CPI in 2022, total tracked climate investments are of the order of $40 to $50 billion per year for FY 2018 to FY 2020, of which approximately 85% were through domestic sources.
“This is not sufficient to address the widening gap between required investment and financing to meet the India climate investment requirement. Greater international capital flows are required for a successful low-carbon transition in India. IFSCA can play a critical role in enabling climate investments in India from international sources through the capital markets route,” said Dhruba Purkayastha, India Director, Climate Policy Initiative.
IFSCA is a statutory authority established under the International Financial Services Centres Authority Act, 2019 with a mandate to develop and regulate the financial products, financial services, and financial institutions in the International Financial Services Centres (IFSC). GIFT-IFSC is the maiden IFSC in India.
Praveen Trivedi, executive director of IFSCA, said, “IFSCA intends to play a key role for India and other emerging economies to meet their net-zero ambitions and achieve SDGs by developing IFSC as a global hub for sustainable finance. This MoU between IFSCA and CPI, focusing on broad areas of sustainable finance, is a step towards achieving a key objective to develop an ecosystem for mobilizing global capital towards sustainable projects.”

The revised optimal energy mix, laid out by the Central Electricity Authority, posits India’s total installed power generation capacity to increase to 777 GW by FY 2029-30, with solar accounting for 293 GW. 
The report stated India’s installed solar PV capacity reached 68 GW as of May 31, 2023, with around 12.8 GW added in FY 2022-23.
“The National Electricity Plan (NEP) envisions energy demand in India to grow annually at 7% from FY 2021-22 to FY 2026-27. To meet this in a clean way, the revised version of the optimal energy mix posits an increased role for solar energy,” stated the report authors. 
“We estimate that the pace of solar addition shall have to nearly double to over 30 GW/year to meet this target…this means adding way more than 93 GW which were bid out till FY 2021-22. As of now, 130-140 GW are planned to be added during the period FY 2023-24 to FY 2027-28.”
