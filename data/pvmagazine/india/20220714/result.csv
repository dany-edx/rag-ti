However, they are still up to five times higher than in 2019 and the banking group has warned that it does not see a return to pre-pandemic lows on the horizon.
Driven by pandemic-related disruptions, international container freight rates have increased dramatically since January 2019, reaching a record price of nearly $10,400 in September 2021. In June 2022, the global freight rate index stood at almost $7,100.
The higher freight costs and supply-chain disruptions are affecting all industries, but solar PV is one of the most effected due to the high concentration of solar panel manufacturing in China. The elevated freight costs and shipping constraints are also affecting other system components like trackers, inverters, and batteries.
Rabobank says in its “Global Ocean Freight Outlook” that container freight prices will continue to gradually decline over the next 12 months from the “irrational” highs reached late last year. However, it said it does not expect them to return to pre-pandemic lows.
Viet Nguyen, a RaboResearch global supply chain analyst, said that shipping container prices were “never” expected to return to the low pre-pandemic rates of approximately $3,000 per container. However, Nguyen predicted they would decline from the current level of $7,000 to $78,000 per container mark in the year ahead.
Nguyen said several global “macro drivers” are influencing shipping dynamics. While heightened inflation and all-time low global consumer confidence levels are exerting downward pressure on ocean rates, Nguyen said rates are being supported at higher levels by imbalanced global trade flows, which hinder a cost-effective repositioning of empty containers.
“Added to this, geographical uncertainties are adding risks and there are also growing operational costs for the sector from higher energy costs and sustainability regulations,” he said.
While shipping rates are forecast to soften, Rabobank expects schedule reliability for containers to also recover, albeit slowly. Port congestion, a major contributor to the continuing supply disruptions, is forecast to remain at key ports until the first half of next year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/14/the-stabilizing-effect-of-vertical-east-west-oriented-pv-systems/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 14, 2022",The stabilizing effect of vertical east-west oriented PV systems,"Scientists from the Leipzig University of Applied Sciences have looked at the potential impact of deploying vertical west-east oriented PV systems on a massive scale in the German energy market. They have found that such installations could have a beneficial effect in stabilizing the country’s grid, while allowing greater integration with agricultural activities than with conventional ground-mounted PV plants.
The researchers used the EnergyPLAN model developed by Aalborg University in Denmark. It is commonly used to simulate the operation of national energy systems on an hourly basis, including the electricity, heating, cooling, industry, and transport sectors. It helps to predict how the German energy system might look like with more vertical PV by 2030.
“Only two parameters are systematically varied: firstly, the share of installed power of the different PV variants,” the academics said, noting that they did not consider solar trackers. “Secondly, two scenarios are considered, in which either a large-scale electricity storage is integrated or not.”
For conventional ground-mounted systems, the scientists considered a tilt angle of 20 degrees and an average estimated energy yield 1,020 Wh/W. For the bifacial vertical west-east oriented systems, they assumed a bifaciality factor of 90% and an annual energy yield of 999 Wh/W, while for vertical systems with a north-south orientation the annual energy yield was indicated at 926 Wh/W.
“In our model electricity demand for 2030 increases to 1,214 TWh/a and depends mainly on the assumptions for energy saving and fuel switch,” they said. “The greatest uncertainties are in the heat supply for buildings and industry.”
They also took into account the higher costs of bifacial panels, as well as that the installable power per area of vertical installation is lower due to shading effects, as the module row distance usually ranges from 8 meters to 12 meters, which in turn increases wiring costs.
“The additional cost for the land itself must be shared with the retained agricultural land use or benefit due to biodiversity promotion,” they said.
The scientists found that vertical PV systems can shift solar yield into hours of higher electricity demand and more electricity supply in the winter months, thus reducing solar curtailment.
“If electricity storage of 1 TW charging and discharging power and 1  TWh capacity is integrated into the energy system model, the effect is reduced to CO2 savings of up to 2.1 Mt/a with 70% vertical east-west and 30% inclined south facing modules,” they said. “Finally, while it might seem unrealistic for some to achieve a rate of 70% vertical power plants, even a lower rate has a beneficial impact.”
They described their findings in “Integration of vertical solar power plants into a future German energy system, published in Smart Energy. “The intention of this paper is by no means suggesting for all utility PV systems being vertically mounted in future,” they concluded. “Much rather a new opportunity is highlighted. Vertical PV systems can support the overall energy system.”
