The tendered capacity includes 500 MW of interstate transmission system (ISTS) connected and 100 MW state transmission unit connected projects.
The scope of work includes engineering, procurement and construction of the plants, along with power evacuation up to the interconnecting substation, and comprehensive operation and maintenance for 10 years. Arranging land for the solar plant also falls under the contractor’s scope.
The plants are tendered under the Open category, allowing solar cells and modules of any origin.
As per the 500 MW ISTS project tender, a bidder can offer to build any capacity from a minimum of 100 MW up to the entire tendered capacity. Projects can be at multiple locations, provided each project is a minimum 100 MW in size, rising in multiples of 25 MW thereafter.

The plant, built with more than 1 lakh of solar modules, spans 75 acres on the water surface and uses a unique anchoring design for the panels.
The floating project is expected to generate enough electricity to light around 7,000 households and to offset at least 46,000 tons of CO2 during its lifetime. It could also prevent 1,364 million liters of water evaporating annually – enough to meet the yearly requirement of 6,700 households.
NTPC has 66.9 GW of power generation capacity across 71 power stations, including 29 renewable energy projects. The group says it also has more than 17 GW of power plant capacity under construction, including 5 GW of renewables. NTPC is aiming to install 60 GW of renewables capacity by 2032.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/23/novel-pv-module-recycling-tech-from-south-korea/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 23, 2021",Novel PV module recycling tech from South Korea,"From pv magazine International
Researchers at the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) have developed a “non-destructive” solar module recycling technology that is claimed to be able to recover 100% of a module’s glass.
The novel technique can be applied to either damaged or undamaged panels and works in four steps: The automated dismantling of the frame and the junction box; glass separation; metal recovery; and solar cell recycling. “The core process is glass separation, with the glass recovery rate approaching 100%,” the scientists emphasized, noting that this was obtained by separating the interface between the glass and the module encapsulant.
The Korean group claims that the new technique, which was, so far, tested on an undefined series of 72-cell panels, reduces power consumption by a third compared to other recycling technology, thanks to process optimization. The system is also said to allow the recovery of high-quality glass with an iron content of less than 200 parts per million, and of more than 65% of the components that make up a panel.
The scientists were also able to refine the silicon recovered from waste panels to make six-inch single crystal ingots and wafers. The wafers were used to manufacture a 20.05%, high-efficiency solar cell. “Recycling a ton of discarded photovoltaic modules means a reduction of 1.2 tons of greenhouse emissions,” said KIER researcher Jinseok Lee. “So this technique is crucial to achieving a net-zero economy.”
More technical details on the four processes were not disclosed.
The research project was supported by South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology. Korea-based provider of commercial heat treatment for metal and coating processing services, HST Co Ltd, has now been tasked to bring the technology to the market.
