It supplied these chargers for public sector projects, retail customers, and other strategic projects.
Out of these 1,400 chargers, Servotech delivered and set up 600 electric vehicle chargers at different retail locations of BPCL. “The majority of these chargers have been supplied and set up in carefully chosen locations throughout BPCL’s retail fuel and gas stations in various cities around the country,” stated Servotech. “States like Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Gujarat among others have been covered under what is being dubbed as the green corridor which will be dotted with EV charging points and capabilities.” 
Solution suppliers and charging network owners and operators play a crucial role in scaling the EV charging infrastructure. A larger ecosystem comprising infrastructure fund providers, utilities, grid operators, and original equipment manufacturers can help address a variety of issues. 
“To provide EV owners easy access to the charging network, Servotech will also be setting up, commissioning, and maintaining these DC fast chargers. This will help ensure the implementation of e-mobility contact points that address payments, accessibility, exploration, and connectivity,” stated Servotech.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/20/soiling-a-multibillion-dollar-issue/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,SOILING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 20, 2023",Soiling – a multibillion-dollar issue,"From pv magazine Global
Soiling – where PV modules become coated with dust, dirt, sand or snow and thus receive less sunlight – is still an underestimated problem for solar power systems. Specialized solutions are now available in the form of anti-soiling glass coatings, automated and manual cleaning products, and models to predict the ways to use them most economically. But our understanding of the issue is still evolving, particularly as PV systems move into new regions with different environmental conditions, and the technology itself continues to change and improve.
A new report by IEA-PVPS Task 13 seeks to push understanding of soiling a step further, taking a detailed look at the mechanisms causing soiling right down to the size and shape of the individual particles that build up on module’s surface, and the surrounding conditions that lessen or worsen its impacts.
The report estimates that in 2018, soiling caused at least a 3% to 4% loss to global annual energy production from PV – amounting to lost revenue of €3-5 billion. And this is expected to increase to around 4% to 5%, and €4 billion to €7 billion this year, thanks to an increase in PV installations in regions highly prone to soiling, economic pressures, and the fact that more efficient PV modules will suffer larger losses to their output due to soiling.
The report shows that soiling is a highly site-specific issue, and that even different areas within a single site can see quite different conditions. This leads the authors to place emphasis on accurate monitoring of these as a key part of the solution.
“An ideal solution should be installable with as little maintenance as possible and be able to detect heterogeneous soiling at both module and site level with high accuracy,” the scientists said.
Meanwhile, additional work is needed to develop accurate models to predict soiling rates at a given site, with current efforts either limited to a very small area, or based only on satellite data that is too generalized to give an accurate portrayal of site conditions.
They note encouraging progress in soiling reduction – with both preventive and corrective solutions now widely available – including anti-soiling coatings and design aspects such as optimized tilt angle, as well as cleaning solutions carefully designed not to damage modules or remove the aforementioned coatings. However, the best solution for any project will depend on the site conditions, and can be a delicate economic calculation placing emphasis on accurate monitoring and measurement.
The authors also note encouraging progress in both models and technologies to deal with snow loading on modules – as solar installations move into more regions affected by snowy conditions. Here they note that further work is needed on specialized components and designs for snowy conditions, with frameless modules, steeper tilt angles, snow-shedding coatings, bifacial modules, and attention to array heights to minimize snow accumulation on the bottom edges of modules all promising approaches.
The report does not address “anthropogenic, zoological or biological sources” of soiling – such as pollution, bird droppings or moss growth. The conclusion for all though is similar, as noted in the report.
“PV soiling will continue to be a global issue, which is expected to be exacerbated by climate change with rising global temperatures and subsequent droughts,” the researchers said. “Further advancements in soiling modelling, adaptation and mitigation are critically necessary.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/20/gamechange-releases-new-solar-tracker/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 20, 2023",GameChange releases new solar tracker,"From pv magazine Global
GameChange Solar, a specialist in fixed-tilt racking and tracker equipment, has announced the launch of the 1P-2Row Genius Tracker, which comes standard with preassembled components.
“The system is a cost-effective and optimal solution for certain projects and countries,” said Derick Botha, chief commercial officer at GameChange Solar.
In November, the company announced the MaxDensity system, which is a fixed-tilt racking system for ground-mounted projects. It has a 5-degree or 10-degree east-west landscape configuration. The system is designed to maximize the number of modules packed onto a site, with a ground coverage ratio of up to 98%. It can be installed in blocks of up to 7 MW, in configurations of up to 12,000 modules. It supports all commercially available framed modules, according to the company.
In December, GameChange announced plans to increase its annual domestic manufacturing capacity in the United States to 24 GW. The company has expanded existing facilities and established new factories, and reports that it now has factories in Michigan, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky.
In 2021, the company released BifacialReflector, a patent-pending technology designed to boost power production by 15% to 20% for the Genius Tracker when using bifacial modules. It said the BifacialReflector is a highly reflective (.95 albedo) surface that reflects light from just above ground level to the back of the bifacial modules. The solution is self-cleaning and has a 40-year life expectancy.
In December 2021, GameChange Solar Holdings Corp. received an investment of $150 million from Koch Strategic Platforms (KSP), a subsidiary of Koch Investments Group. The preferred stock investment, if converted, would represent a minority stake in the company. In addition to capital investment, the two are exploring further synergies across Koch Industries, including KBX, a global transportation, logistics, and technology arm, and Koch Engineered Solutions.
