https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/09/eib-to-support-green-hydrogen-in-india-with-eur-1-billion-loan/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,EUROPE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",EIB to support green hydrogen in India with EUR 1 billion loan,"European Investment Bank, the bank of the European Union, has joined the India Hydrogen Alliance (IH2A)— an industry coalition of global and Indian companies committed to creating a hydrogen value chain and economy in India. It also agreed to increase support for large-scale green hydrogen hubs and projects across India with indicative funding of EUR 1 billion. The funding will be subject to the Indian government and EIB approvals.
The EIB is currently exploring a credit facility with the Indian government to provide investments to critical public sectors supporting the development of the green hydrogen industry. This facility would support the government’s efforts to commercialize upcoming green hydrogen technologies and accelerate cost reduction with continued investments in innovation, R&D, green hydrogen hubs, and pilot projects.
“The European Investment Bank recognizes the huge potential of developing and reducing the cost of green hydrogen in India. Together with industry, national government, and state authorities, we are exploring how the EU Bank might play a role in supporting India’s National Hydrogen mission, to enable the use of green hydrogen to decarbonize energy, industry, and transport,” said Kris Peeters, vice president of the European Investment Bank. “The strengthened cooperation through the India Hydrogen Alliance will contribute to implementing a national green hydrogen roadmap that delivers India’s energy transition and net-zero carbon plans alongside strengthening energy security in the years ahead.”
Jillian Evanko, president and CEO of Chart Industries and Founding Member, IH2A, said, “Funding for large-scale green hydrogen projects is nascent and EIB’s participation will help solve a key eco-system problem. We look forward to working closely with EIB, investors, industry, and the government to help realize hydrogen commercialization at scale, in the next half-decade.”
The European Investment Bank is the world’s largest international public bank and leading financier of renewable energy and climate action around the world. The new memorandum of understanding with IH2A will enable the EIB to further support clean energy investment and back the development of green hydrogen in India.
IH2A is focusing on attracting global climate finance for the development of large-scale hydrogen hub development in India, working with the Government of India, state governments, global hydrogen players, and Indian companies. This memorandum of understanding follows the Government of India’s confirmation of a $2 billion public finance allocation for the National Green Hydrogen Mission and will support IH2A in bringing together global climate finance players and funding agencies, to work with industry players and government agencies to plan and execute large-scale green hydrogen projects and develop the green hydrogen economy in India.
The EIB is financing green hydrogen investment in Europe and working closely with partners across Africa, Latin America, and Asia to accelerate large-scale green hydrogen investment.

Scientists from the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have designed a molten salt battery based on an anode made of molten sodium (Na) and a cathode made of aluminum (Al) and sodium tetrachloroaluminate (NaAlCl4).
They described the novel battery as a low-cost, grid-scale solution for long-duration renewable energy storage and said the use of NaAlCl4 offers extra accessible capacity hidden in acidic chloroaluminate. They said the proposed battery chemistry relies on the sixth and second most abundant elements on Earth.
“This enables higher specific capacity and average discharge voltages than previous Na-Al batteries, utilizing two distinct cell reaction mechanisms in one battery,” the researchers said, noting that this second reaction, on top of the neutral molten salt reaction, is the crucial factor for the device’s higher voltage and capacity. “Specifically, after 345 charge/discharge cycles at high current, this acidic reaction mechanism retained 82.8 percent of peak charge capacity.”
The researchers assembled Na-Al full cells in the discharged state in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. They then closed the cells with stainless steel endcaps and sealed them hermetically by tightening a set of eight screws in a star pattern.
“The system design allows only sodium to move through the solid-state electrolyte to charge the battery,” they explained. “This flat cell design allows the cell capacity to be increased by simply using a thicker cathode, which we leveraged in this work to demonstrate a triple capacity cell with sustained discharge of 28.2-hours under laboratory conditions.”
Th research group found that the battery achieves a high areal capacity cell of 138.5 mAh cm−2 at a high current density of 4.67 mA cm−2. The scientists said the battery could potentially achieve an energy density of up to 100 Wh/kg at a cost of $7.02 kWh.
“We have eliminated the need for nickel, a relatively scarce and expensive element, without sacrificing battery performance,” said Li. in reference to another advantage offered by the new battery design. “The aluminum cathode charges more quickly, which is crucial to enable the longer discharge duration demonstrated in this work.”
They presented the battery tech in “Unlocking the NaCl-AlCl3 phase diagram for low-cost, long-duration Na-Al batteries,” which was recently published in Energy Storage Materials.
“We showed that this new molten salt battery design has the potential to charge and discharge much faster than other conventional high-temperature sodium batteries, operate at a lower temperature, and maintain an excellent energy storage capacity,” said researcher Guosheng Li.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/09/dutch-startup-unveils-controller-to-store-excess-pv-power-in-hot-water/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",Dutch startup unveils controller to store excess PV power in hot water,"From pv magazine Global
Dutch solar startup Solyx Energy has developed a system to maximize residential PV self-consumption.
“The concept is to store excess solar power for households in form of warm water,” Solyx Energy co-founder Emma Snaak told pv magazine, noting that the technology can be paired with PV modules and water heaters of any brand and capacity, but most effectively with single-phase inverters.
The solution consists of two components. A  sensor with a measuring clamp attaches to the household’s grid connection – usually an electricity meter – and the Solar iBoost controller. The clamp attaches to the power line one wants to measure. It detects the direction the electricity is flowing in, and continually measures the amount of excess PV power that is sent to the grid. The sensor, powered by two AA batteries, then communicates that value to the Solar iBoost, wirelessly via radio waves with an indoor range of 1 meter to 30 meters.
“The sensor measures the net exported solar power. That is essential to understanding how the solution works. It is not just taking into account how much solar is being generated, but it also takes into account the consumption of the house,” explained Snaak.
The Solar iBoost is connected to an electric water heater. It has a voltage range of 220 V to 240 V, a maximum load of 3 kW, and weighs 1.36 kg. The controller regulates the amount of energy fed into the water heater to the exact value measured by the sensor. This way, no export of solar power onto the grid takes place.
Solyx has partnered with UK-based Marlec, the manufacturer of the Solar iBoost. “This product is the second version [of the Solar iBoost], the first version has been on the market longer. Solyx has been providing Marlec with inputs and requirements for fitting the product to the EU,” said Snaak .
“Water tanks are usually switched on or off,” she continued. The Solar iBoost modulates the energy fed into the water heater to match varying solar production and household electricity consumption. The purported advantage is that water can start being heated with as little as 100 W of power, in comparison with the usual 2 kW to 3 kW, according to Snaak.
“The water is heated only with the excess PV power, which varies throughout the day,” she said. “If there is less sun, or you are using your vacuum cleaner, it will heat a little less. If there’s a lot of sun or appliances aren’t in use, it will heat a lot more.”
The device maximizes solar self-consumption and, at €595 ($638) including value-added tax (VAT), it is a cheaper alternative to most batteries or heat pumps. Solyx Energy predicts average savings of €338 a year for Dutch households. The solution can be used alongside energy storage and heat pumps for home heating, but not with heat pump boilers. Snaak argues the Solar iBoost is a better match with solar PV than heat pumps.
“Heat pumps are very efficient when constantly on and delivering a little bit of heat the entire day. If you just have excess power right now and you want to use it, heat pumps aren’t very efficient,” she claimed. “With the electric heater and the Solar iBoost, you can switch on when you have peaks in your solar, or turn it off when you have loads. That balancing act you can do throughout the day is I think really interesting with emerging trends like flexible energy tariffs.”
The product currently does not offer the option to switch on or off according to the most profitable tariff, but it has the potential to do so in the future. Solyx currently only offers the product in the Netherlands and Belgium, but it says it will consider expanding to the rest of Europe and other world markets after consolidating its presence in the two countries.
