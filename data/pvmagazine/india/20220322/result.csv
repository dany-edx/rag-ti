C&I segment itself accounts for about 40-45% of all-India energy demand. According to the analysts, even if the C&I sector meets 20% of its energy requirements through RE, it could bring an incremental RE capacity addition of about 75GW by 2030. 
ICRA cites improving RE tariffs and sustainability goals as the main reasons driving C&I players to source RE. Government policy focus on RE to meet the nation’s ‘net-zero by 2070’ target provides the added impetus.
Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president and co-group head – corporate ratings, ICRA, said, “From the C&I off-taker’s perspective, cost of sourcing of RE through open access remains at a discount to grid tariffs after factoring the applicable open access charges. The grid tariffs have shown a rise, and the energy charge in the same also varies widely between INR 6-7/kWh and INR 6-10/unit for HT industrial and commercial segment, respectively, across the states.” 
Kadam highlights the regulatory risk for open-access-based RE projects, as reflected through an increasing trend in the open-access charges and tightening of banking norms/charges.
“The open access and banking charges/norms also vary widely with effective cost ranging from INR 1.5 to 5/kWh across key states, with an increasing trend seen due to upward pressure on the cost of power supply and continued high level of cross-subsidization in the tariff structure for the discoms.”
The open-access charges mainly comprise cross-subsidy surcharge (CSS), additional surcharge (AS), wheeling charges, and banking charges as per the applicable norms by State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERCs) across the states. 
CSS varies widely between INR 0.7 and 2.2/kWh as observed across the key states, with the removal of concessions/exemptions by SERCs – which were earlier available for RE projects in third-party open access route. 
Most States also levy AS varying between INR 0.25 to 1.3/kWh.
As a result, captive or group captive projects are being preferred due to relatively lower regulatory risk (non-applicability of CSS and AS) as compared with third-party sale route, said the analysts. 
Vikram V, vice president and sector head – Corporate Ratings, said, “Recent directive by Supreme Court in December 2021 for non-applicability of additional surcharge for captive projects remains positive for captive RE projects. The clarity on the extent of waiver of inter-state transmission charges (ISTS) for projects to be commissioned by FY 2028 also remains a positive. Moreover, draft rules on RE open access by the Ministry of Power, dated August 2021 are yet to be notified and would benefit RE players if the same is notified and implemented by SERCs given the certainty and clarity proposed in open access and banking norms.”
ICRA finds third-party sale route under open access still remains fairly attractive for the IPPs in States like Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, wherein the maximum discount that can be offered by the IPPs varies between 15 to 30% assuming net tariff of INR 3.25/kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/22/china-and-hong-kong-are-indias-biggest-lithium-battery-suppliers/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION CELLS,MARKETS,PROCUREMENT,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 22, 2022",China and Hong Kong are India’s biggest lithium battery suppliers,"India imported lithium cells and batteries – including rechargeable li-ion type devices – worth INR8,984 crore in the last fiscal year, according to Ministry of Mines statistics.
That figure consisted of INR173 crore of non-rechargeable lithium devices and INR8,811 crore of lithium-ion products.
China and Hong Kong were the chief sources of the imports with China shipping 72.73% of the lithium-ion products imported by India and 32.05% of the non-rechargeable lithium cell devices. Hong Kong products accounted for 23.48% and 37.32% of those, respective markets.
Indian lithium battery demand is expected to surge with the products used in renewable energy storage facilities and electric vehicles as well as data centers and consumer electronics.
The government wants to establish domestic battery manufacturing and has launched an INR18,100 crore production-linked incentive scheme to attempt to drive the deployment of factories capable of producing 50GWh worth of advanced chemistry battery cells. At the same time, the government is attempting to source lithium from nations such as Australia and Bolivia as well as searching for deposits of the raw material on home soil.
The Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, part of government body the Department Atomic Energy, is searching for lithium in parts of the Mandya and Yadgir districts of Karnataka. Preliminary surveys have indicated the presence of around 1,600 tons of lithium in the Marlagalla area of Mandya.
The Ministry of Mines-based Geological Survey of India is also exploring for lithium and associated elements.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/22/polo-ibc-solar-cell-with-23-7-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 22, 2022",POLO-IBC solar cell with 23.7% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists from the Leibniz Universität Hannover and the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany has developed two different kinds of solar cells based on n-type doped electron-collecting poly-Si on oxide (POLO) junctions with an aluminum-alloyed p+ junction for hole collection — a back-contacted back junction cells (POLO-BJ) and an interdigitated back-contacted cells (POLO-IBC).
“We developed both technologies in parallel, as their process flow is very similar and the development showed many synergies,” Robby Peibst, the research project’s corresponding author, told pv magazine. “One of the main motivations for the parallel development was certainly risk minimization, as initially, it was not certain that we would be able to solve the respective challenges. For the POLO-BJ device, for example, the question was whether it was really possible to print an aluminum finger grid so thin that it would be suitable as the front-side metallization of a high-efficiency solar cell, which now seems to be the case.”
The scientists explained that the aluminum-alloyed p+ junction for hole collection is the standard in the manufacturing of PERC solar cells and can be inexpensively formed during the metallization process without the necessity for boron diffusion or silver metallization. Through simulation-based sensitivity analysis on the quality of these hole-collecting junctions, the German group was able to ascertain that the reduction of Al-p+ recombination and resistance is of high importance for both cell structures. “A reduction of pre-factor of the recombination current density from current values of 600 (830) fA/cm2 down to 400 fA/cm2 is compatible with a high-efficiency potential of 25.4% for POLO-IBC and 24.6% for POLO-BJ,” it further explained. “We conclude that the optimization of the quality of the Al-p+ region is a solvable challenge and not a road blocker. An even better quality of the Al-p+ region would facilitate even higher efficiencies.”
The champion POLO-IBC device developed by the academics achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.71%, an open-circuit voltage of 711.5mV, a short-circuit current of 41.3mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 80.9%. The best-performing POLO-BJ cell reached an efficiency of 22.9%, an open-circuit voltage of 714mV, a short-circuit current of 39.6mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 80.9%.
“The IBC cells required an additional patterning step and the development of a ‘non-standard’ module interconnect technology,” Peibst emphasized. “Therefore, POLO-BJ initially seemed to us to be a more obvious upgrade to PERC.” According to him, however, there is currently a significant momentum in the industry towards IBC cells. “Nevertheless, double-side contacted cells will certainly continue to dominate at least in the mid-term. Perhaps POLO-BJ could be the first upgrade of a PERC line, and POLO-IBC a subsequent version,” he affirmed.
The solar cell was described in the paper On the chances and challenges of combining electron-collecting nPOLO and hole-collecting Al-p+ contacts in highly efficient p-type c-Si solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics. “I personally see it as an attractive option that parts of our development can flow into mass production,” Peibst went on to say. “If, for example, we can successfully demonstrate with POLO-BJ that front-side metallization with Al fingers is possible and allows stable module interconnection, this would also be an option for saving silver in n-type TOPCon cells. Our work on Al metallization of poly-Si is also relevant for this purpose.”
The same research group recently conducted a series of numerical simulations to assess how photonic crystals may increase the efficiency of IBC solar cells based on POLO junction at the minus contact of the cell and a hole-selective p+-type POLO junction at the plus contact. The simulated cell was assumed to rely on a standard wafer thickness of 150 μm and the scientists found it may achieve an efficiency of over 28% under normal incident light.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/22/invasion-of-ukraine-an-inadvertent-boost-for-green-hydrogen/,"GEOPOLITICS,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 22, 2022",Invasion of Ukraine an inadvertent boost for green hydrogen,"From pv magazine Global
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having widespread geopolitical and economic impacts, not the least of which can be seen in the price spike of gas-powered grey hydrogen and ammonia compared to green versions of the fuels. 
Earlier this month, BloombergNEF published a report suggesting “a delivered hydrogen price of $6.59/kg is now sufficient to make green ammonia cheaper than ‘gray’ ammonia, made from unabated natural gas on a short-run, marginal cost basis. This is just enough for a green ammonia facility in Germany to be competitive.” Of course, Bloomberg pointed out that prices in countries like Spain, India and China would be even more competitive. 
This week, Rystad Energy similarly predicted that a surging cost of blue and gray hydrogen in line with fossil fuel hikes increased the growing feasibility “of green hydrogen as an affordable and secure source of renewable energy in Europe”. 
According to Rystad, the war in Ukraine has “turbocharged” the green hydrogen production sector, which was already set to experience a boom year as it passed the 1GW milestone. Thanks to a 70% increase, Rystad predicts the cost of fossil fuel-linked blue and gray hydrogen could reach from $8/kg to $14/kg “in a matter of days”. For green hydrogen, however, since the invasion of Ukraine Rystad is predicting lower production costs of $4/kg, particularly in Spain, which looking to produce more than 4GW of green hydrogen by 2030. 
Swing support 
The market is well and truly swinging, and to add weight to that swing the EU has already announced plans for a €300 million funding package for hydrogen, as well as REPowerEU’s Hydrogen Accelerator initiative to unhook the region from its dependence on Russian gas. 
Rystad Energy’s head of hydrogen research Minh Khoi Le said “While industry and governments are heading in the right direction, their challenge is to lower the risks for green hydrogen investors and create incentives necessary to scale up quickly both the demand and supply. Fundamentally, a world where green hydrogen fulfills the role currently played by oil, gas and coal will look very different,” Le continued.
To realize that world green hydrogen production needs to increase to more than 10 million tons worldwide by 2030 and see its costs cut to at least $1.5/kg. 10 million tons might sound like a lot, but according to Rystad if green hydrogen and its derivatives were to replace gas and coal in Europe’s power mix base case by 2030 it would need 54 million tons. 
Currently, Europe is working to produce 3 million tons of green hydrogen annually by 2030, while RePower Europe has set a target of 15 million tons per annum. Clearly, there remains an enormous gap, but the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may just have swung the economics in green hydrogen’s favor.
