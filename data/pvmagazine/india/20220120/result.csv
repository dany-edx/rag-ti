The two companies today announced the signing of an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture company to meet the energy storage needs of customers across India. The JV is expected to start operations within the first half of 2022.
India’s Central Electricity Authority projects the Indian energy storage market to reach 27 GW/108 GWh by 2030 from just a few MWh today. The Fluence and ReNew Power joint venture, managed and operated by an independent management team and board, will cater to Indian customers by localizing and integrating Fluence’s energy storage products and packages in India.
Founded by AES (a global energy company) and Siemens in 2018, Fluence has more than 3.6 GW of energy storage deployed or contracted in 30 markets globally as of September 30, 2021. In 2019, Fluence delivered India’s first battery-based energy storage project at Tata Power’s Delhi substation. This 10 MW grid-connected battery energy storage system uses Advancion energy storage platform of Fluence.
The Fluence-ReNew Power JV will kick off with ReNew as the first customer of its energy storage products. ReNew will deploy the JV’s 150 MWh energy storage solution for its 300 MW peak power project in Karnataka state. 
Energy storage will be a key enabler for grid integration of large-scale variable renewables as India targets installed renewable capacity of 500 GW by 2030. ReNew, which has a renewable energy portfolio of over 10 GW, has a head-start in India’s stationary energy storage space with an intelligent energy solution portfolio comprising the 300 MW peak power project and a 400 MW round-the-clock (RTC) power project. 
Sumant Sinha, Chairman and CEO, ReNew Power, said, “India’s energy transition and its ambition to achieve net-zero by 2070 calls for strong and rapid storage integration with the grid. We’re delighted to partner with Fluence, a global market leader in energy storage products and services, to bring localized solutions for India. I expect it to set new milestones for the storage industry in India.” 
Manuel Pérez Dubuc, Fluence CEO, said, “Fluence is committed to accelerating India’s clean energy transition. We will support the country’s ambitious climate goals in a capital-efficient manner by localizing our products to align with specific market needs, making our patented technologies and designs available to the joint venture, and increasing the made-in-India content over time. By partnering with a leading developer such as ReNew to form a local company, we can rapidly increase our India presence and bring our industry-leading experience and technology to local developers.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/20/floating-pv-could-reach-4-8-gw-globally-by-2026/,"FLOATING SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 20, 2022",Floating PV could reach 4.8 GW globally by 2026,"From pv magazine International
Floating photovoltaics (FPV), or “floatovoltaics,” are expected to establish a new global market by 2026, said Global Industry Analysts (GIA). It has projected 4.8 GW of deployment by that year.
FPV typically features solar panels mounted on a floating structure over a lake or reservoir, often with embedded trackers. It removes the added costs of purchasing or leasing expensive land areas. It also frees up more land area for other uses. And, water bodies are often government-owned, which is a feature that makes permitting easier to obtain, said GIA.
Generally, 1MW of FPV plant covers water bodies of about 17 to 25 acres and can generate electricity of 1,500MWh, said GIA.
While FPV projects often don’t reach the same level power output of ground mounts, they serve land-restricted areas. The systems can offer environmental benefits like managing algal growth and reducing evaporation. Water offers system benefits like cooling the panels, which can reduce degradation and lower maintenance costs, said the report.
The market is currently about 1.6 GW globally, and GIA predicts it will move at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.7% by 2026, reaching 4.8 GW. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the largest market share at around 60%, with China the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 59.4%.  FPV’s cost is much higher that that of stationary solar panels, which is the key obstacle to its growth, said GIA.
GIA said the United States has more than 24,000 man-made water bodies that are anticipated to be useful in FPV development. Human-made water bodies are preferable for their ability to be managed, and most are located near existing infrastructure and roads.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/20/discover-battery-unveils-lithium-ferro-phosphate-battery-for-off-grid-solar-tiny-homes/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 20, 2022","Discover Battery unveils lithium ferro-phosphate battery for off-grid solar, tiny homes","From pv magazine International
pv magazine recently met with Discover Battery at Intersolar North America in Long Beach, California, to view the unveiling of Helios ESS, a lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery with use cases in off-grid solar, tiny homes, and RVs. The battery comes in 24V or 48V designs, with 60Ah and 30Ah-rated capacities, respectively. It has a nominal energy rating of 1.54 kWh.
Up to 20 Helios batteries can be linked in series and controlled by Discover’s Lynk II Gateway, a battery management system (BMS) that can dynamically manage charges and perform remote troubleshooting when connected with the internet. The Lynk II can be integrated with major inverters from Schneider, Victron, Sol-Ark, SMA, Studer, and more. The BMS is located in a cabin at the top of the battery unit for ease of access. When charged in a closed-loop managed by proprietary BMS, the batteries can be charged 25% faster, said Discover Battery.
Discover Battery said the battery case is designed in house, making the devices stable, especially when used in mobile applications. In remote, cold climates, the Helios battery employs its integrated self-heating layer for optimal performance. The battery also has an on/off switch for flexibility and energy conservation. It is now available globally, with shipments starting in February.
LFP batteries have a significantly lower risk of thermal runway compared to their conventional lithium counterparts, as they remove the key culprit, cobalt, from the battery chemistry. Helios is UL 1971 certified.
Discover Battery has been making batteries since 1949, and primarily works in the lead-acid space. The team brings 100+ years of combined solar industry experience, using that expertise to create a product that is sensitive to the needs of solar installers and service teams. Remote management via BMS means less truck rolls, and a removable BMS that does not require moving cells prevents the need for shipping lithium when repairs are needed.
Coming down the line for Discover this summer is its Element battery, a 5 kW LFP battery that can also be placed in a series of 20 and managed by Lynk II. This device joins Discover Battery’s workhorse, the AES battery, a 3.0kWh and 7.4kWh, 48V unit.
