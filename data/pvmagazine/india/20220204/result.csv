The report estimates the annual lithium-ion battery demand for automotive applications to increase from 2.3 GWh in FY2020-21 to 104 GWh by FY2029-30 on the back of favorable government policies including Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & EV (FAME) and various state-level EV policies. The demand for lithium batteries in non-automotive applications is forecast to increase from 0.3 GWh to 12 GWh driven by telecom towers, data centers, and grid-scale renewable energy (RE) integration, and rooftop solar.
The Government of India’s target of 30% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030 and 34 GW/136 GWh of battery storage needed to add 450GW of renewables in India by 2030, as estimated by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), will further drive the nation to become a key lithium battery consumer, stated the report.
Considering the huge upcoming demand, the report emphasizes stepping up lithium battery production in India.
Battery packs have been assembled in India for many years. However, lithium cell manufacturing on a commercial scale is yet to start. As a result, the nation meets its cell requirements through imports.
The report highlights various compelling reasons for cell manufacturing in India. It states cell manufacturing costs in India, as of 2020, were the lowest (US$92.8/kWh) when compared with the United States, European nations, and even China (US$98.2/kWh) and South Korea (US$98.1/kWh). Similarly, India offers huge cost benefits in terms of cheap labor and power (gross monthly minimum wage levels in India in 2019 were US$65 against US$217 in China). On the demand side, falling battery prices and initiatives including the FAME scheme are encouraging EV adoption in India.
The report says “for now, India is likely to import all the raw materials required for cell manufacturing but can lower this dependency by entering into long-term contracts with raw material suppliers or acquiring some assets in mineral-rich nations. Local capabilities are also slated to be built up gradually.”
The report states challenges to cell manufacturing in India range from unavailability of key raw materials to the requirement of huge investments and absence of technological know-how. It suggests battery recycling as one of the alternate solutions to meet surging LiB demand. It will result in the recovery of 90% of lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite and put India on the path to a circular economy, the report adds.
“Overall, however, as India already has huge cost advantages in battery assembly and software-driven BMS capabilities, it can also realize significant benefits through a vertically integrated value chain once lithium-ion cell manufacturing booms. For cell manufacturing and battery pack assembly, the future looks promising in India provided issues like battery standardization and battery safety issues are addressed and the industry and government work in sync,” the report concludes.

The scramble for new battery storage solutions is picking up the pace with news coming from both established players and new entrants. The latest such move has seen U.S.-based start-up Sparkz announce a pilot plant in Livermore, northern California, where it plans to begin construction of a pilot manufacturing facility for its patented solid-state battery technology.
The company’s move to establish its first pilot production was spurred by support from the California Energy Commission (CEC). Last year, Sparkz won a $2.6 million grant from the CEC to extend its development into solid-state batteries as the company takes steps to shift its second product line from development to commercialization.
“The California Energy Commission’s funding and continued support of Sparkz was an important step towards securing this facility,” said Sparkz CEO Sanjiv Malhotra. “The CEC understands that to challenge China’s domination of next-gen battery production, and reach America’s clean energy potential, we need to build sustainable battery facilities in the U.S. Sparkz is quickly approaching this goal and putting Americans to work.”
Founded in late 2019, Sparkz has recently completed the transfer of six patents from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which continues to be the company’s R&D partner.
Sparks’ lithium-ion batteries are said to offer double the energy density compared to other zero cobalt chemistries, that is lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that are predominantly made in China. Its initial research shows the ability to reduce the cost of cell manufacturing by about 40%, while maintaining energy density and lifecycles comparable to chemistries that utilize cobalt.
Sparks’ high-density lithium battery design uses novel cathode and anode compositions, including early transition metal-stabilized high capacity oxidatively stable cathodes. This innovation improves on lithium-ion cathodes by replacing early transition metals, namely cobalt, at relevant sites in cathodes, and by varying the lithium composition.
Its other licensed technologies include a nonaqueous electrolyte with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide salt for fast charging/discharging of lithium-ion batteries, which enables the batteries to perform at a 23% higher capacity during a 12-minute charge than other formulas; as well as a scaling process which enables industrial-scale production of battery materials through a series of chemical processes.
Sparkz also operates an R&D and innovation center in Knoxville, Tennessee, and is also exploring new plants in the Appalachia to begin manufacturing its batteries for OEM partners. The company has the exclusive licenses to produce zero cobalt, lithium batteries and is committed to producing them in the U.S.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/04/multi-level-fin-heat-sinks-for-solar-module-cooling/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",Multi-level fin heat sinks for solar module cooling,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia have developed a passive cooling technique for photovoltaic modules based on the use of multi-level aluminum fin heat sinks (MLFHS) applied on the rear side of the panels.
“The novel fins were designed based on the temperature behavior of all types of crystalline modules,” the research’s corresponding author, Adnan Ibrahim, told pv magazine. “So, they can be used for either monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels.”
The heat sinks were built with the commercially available aluminum alloy 6063 and were attached using epoxy resin with metal powder to the rear side of a 120 W monocrystalline panel. The use of epoxy is claimed to eliminate air gaps and improve thermal conductivity between the cooling system and the module and the proposed heat sink design is described by the researchers as able to reduce the stagnation zone within the heat sinks by inducing more air turbulence and better heat transfer.
The system has a dual fins height of 40 to 60 mm and the fins were L-shaped to offer a better heat dissipation rate per unit mass compared with the conventional heat sink.”The novelty of the proposed fins aims to improve the temperature non-uniformity by flattening the PV temperature curves,” they also explained.

This system configuration was tested on south-oriented 120 W monocrystalline PV modules installed with a tilt angle of 18 degrees and its performance was compared with that of a reference identical panel without the cooling system. “Since Malaysia is located near the equator, the climate is categorized as equatorial, hot, humid, and cloudy throughout the year,” the researchers specified. “The recorded temperatures were high and stable between 29 °C to 38 °C throughout the day, even when the solar irradiance dropped below 600 W/m2.”
Their measurements showed that the reference module without the cooling system reached an average temperature of 64.2 degrees while that with the cooling tech reached 56.1 degrees Celsius, which means the proposed system was found able to reduce the module operating temperature by up to 8.45 degrees Celsius.  The scientists warned, however, that this result may be achieved in hot weather countries that receive more than 600 W/m2 of solar irradiance, while the technology may not be economically viable for countries with average solar irradiance below 500 W/m2. “We estimated the cost of the MLFHS at $0.60/W,” Ibrahim told pv magazine.
All the details of the technique can be found in the paper “Outdoor performance evaluation of a novel photovoltaic heat sinks to enhance power conversion efficiency and temperature uniformity,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
“The maximum electrical power output increases up to 10.75% by integrating the proposed MLFHS at the backside of the PV module,” the paper reads. “The proposed new fin heat sink design is a viable solution and economical to achieve temperature uniformity as the hotspot phenomenon can lead to mechanical damage and reduce its lifespan.”
