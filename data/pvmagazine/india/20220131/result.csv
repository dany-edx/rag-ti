The Indian government has set a target of 30% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. Currently, EV sales remain dismal mainly due to the high upfront costs of EVs and lack of charging infrastructure.
Debi Prasad Dash, executive director, India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA), calls for lowering of goods and services tax (GST) on batteries to ensure EV affordability.
“Although the GST rate on EVs is reduced from 12% to 5%, GST for advanced batteries in EVs is still on higher side ranging between 18% to 28%. We request [the government] to bring down the GST on batteries under 5% bracket in order to ensure affordability and smooth transition towards EVs from ICEs,” Dash said.
Anmol Bohre, managing director and co-founder, Enigma Automobiles (an EV manufacturer), said, “The GST on lithium batteries is now levied at 18% when sold separately and 28% on lead-acid along with certain spare parts, while a vehicle sold with battery is levied at 5%; and because the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has permitted the registration of EVs without batteries, cars without batteries should also come within the EV GST category. As a result, we encourage the government to cut it [GST on batteries] to 5%, equivalent to the GST on EVs.”
Bohre also expects the upcoming Union budget to restructure the use of FAME II funds “since just 5% of the Rs 10,000 crore allotted under FAME’s second phase was used from April 2019 to March 2021.”
Akshay Singhal, founder, Log9 Materials (an EV battery company), calls for extension of the FAME Subsidy corpus to EV retrofitment (ICE to EV conversion) kits. Additionally, he urges that more R&D incentives be given to energy storage and EV technology-related developments in India and that R&D investments into local technology developments be made 100% adjustable against corporate taxes.
Deepak MV, chief executive officer and co-founder, Etrio (EV maker), also expects to see B2B retrofitment brought under the ambit of FAME-II. At the consumers’ end, he expects the budget to address the critically-important area of making a wide and varied range of financing options available for EV commercial vehicle buyers. To this end, he suggests the Government should make the EV sector a priority lending sector for the financial institutions.
For commercial EVs, “the Government must also come up with additional sops or incentives for the nation’s fleet aggregators to switch entirely from IC engines to EVs as the increased adoption of EVs in the logistics and the last-mile delivery segment is the need of the hour to reduce Carbon emissions,” he added.
Inderveer Singh, founder and chief executive officer, EVage Ventures (an electric commercial vehicle manufacturer), lobbies for low-cost finance for commercial EVs.
“Commercial vehicles in India contribute close to 66% of the PML of on-road transportation pollution, and in addition, we have two million driver partners being exposed to these smoke emitting machines every day. This ultimately leads to a damaging health impact on the entire society. We are optimistic that our Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will consider these concerning facts to help India transition towards a more sustainable method of the goods delivery.”
“We are hopeful EVs get faster access to loans in the priority-sector lending scheme, and banks are mandated to give loans for EVs at 30% lower rates than their ICE counterparts. Further, the GST of 18% on charging EVs needs to be reduced preferably to the 5% level.”
Singh also advocates for a government-mandated standard, defining the residual value for EVs. “This, ideally, should be higher than ICE vehicles and directly proportionate to the battery life remaining, as it accounts for close to 50% cost of the EV. The absence of this standard is one of the biggest hindrances in acquiring affordable financing to fleet operators and commercial EV manufacturers,” he said.
As per Indian government estimates, India imports INR 20,000 crore (around US$2,694 million) worth of battery storage equipment every year. If, through production-linked incentives scheme, advanced-chemistry battery cells can be manufactured domestically, India can significantly reduce its reliance on imports and become a key supplier for advanced storage technologies for driving the growth of green energy and clean transportation around the globe.
The PLI scheme for advance-chemistry battery cell manufacturing received an encouraging response with bids received for 2.6 times the 50 GWh manufacturing capacity to be awarded.
IESA’s Debi Prasad Dash recommends enhancing the ACC manufacturing capacity under the PLI scheme to 75 GWh, as well as increasing the Scheme’s financial layout. This, he said, will help achieve the Prime Minister’s vision and utilize the interest from investors. He also urged for increasing the capacity and financial outlay for niche ACC manufacturing planned under PLI to support new and advanced battery technologies.
Among other budget expectations are infrastructure status to energy storage projects (covering both manufacturing and deployment) and support to intermediate material manufacturers. 
“We strongly recommend the Ministry to consider looking into export promotion investments. The government is requested to consider either capital investment subsidy or a separate PLI scheme for intermediate material manufacturing,” Dash added.
Maxson Lewis, managing director and CEO, EV solutions provider Magenta, expects the budget to address the critical issue of EV charging through electricity supply under open access, as well as the associated taxation and wheeling costs. This will necessitate a rethinking of the CERC and Open Access through the perspective of the permitted activity, he said. 
To reduce working capital constraints in the EV charger manufacturing business, Lewis said, the government could offer end-use-based advantages to the EV industry, such as cutting GST rates on raw materials and permitting duty-free imports, refunds for research and development, as well as capital spending on EV chargers.

A Chinese-Egyptian research group has investigated how rooftop PV may be coupled with thermoelectric coolers (TEC), which are also known as Peltier heat pumps as they operate according to the Peltier effect. This effect creates a temperature difference by transferring heat between the two electrical junctions of a semiconductor-based electronic component, which is the key element, working as a small solid-state heat pump. According to the research team, TECs have the advantage of being easy to install and refrigerant free as well as having no movable parts and offering resilient operation.
The proposed combination was labeled a solar thermoelectric air-conditioning system (STEACS) and its performance was analyzed through a machine learning prediction model known as a random vector functional link network (RVFL), which is a randomized version of a single-layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN). The latter is the simplest kind of neural network, in which there is only one layer of input nodes that send weighted inputs to a subsequent layer of receiving nodes.
The RVFL was used in combination with four different techniques: the Jellyfish Search Algorithm (JFSA); the Artificial Ecosystem-based Optimization (AEO); the Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) model; and the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). Through the four models, the academics assessed the PV-fed current, the cooling power, the average air chamber temperature, and the coefficient of performance (COP) of a PV-powered STEACS for air conditioning of a 1m3 test chamber under diversified cooling loads varying from 65 to 260W.
The system was built with six solar panels, an air duct system, four batteries, a charge controller, TECs, an inverter, heat sinks, a test chamber, and condenser fans. “The TECs were mainly connected with the air duct arrangement and placed close to each other [and] were placed between the air duct and heat sinks,” the researchers explained. “When direct PV current was fed to TECs arranged on the sheet of the air duct system, one face [became] cold, defined as a cold air duct, and another side [became] hot, called “hot air.” The air ducts were composed of an acrylic enclosure wrapped with a protection sheet.”
Six rectangular finned heat sinks were linked to the hot side of TECs for increasing heat dissipation and an aluminum foil was wrapped over the air duct to avoid heat losses. Under this configuration, the STEACS was able to provide up to 272W of cooling power.
The modeling based on the RVFL combined with the Jellyfish Search Algorithm (JFSA) was found to outperform the other three hybrid models in predicting the system performance. “The determination coefficient (R2) of the predicted PV input current by RVFL-JFSA during the training stage was equal to unity for PV input current, average chamber temperature, and cooling capacity; while it was 0.999 for COP,” the scientists explained. “The values of R2 are slightly decreased during the test stage, to be 0.993899, 0.999282, 0.995293, and 0.948428 for PV input current, average chamber temperature … cooling capacity, and COP, respectively.”
The model was proposed in the study “Modeling of a solar-powered thermoelectric air-conditioning system using a random vector functional link network integrated with jellyfish search algorithm,” published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. The research team includes scientists from the Zagazig and Tanta universities, in Egypt, as well as from the Henan Institute of Science and Technology, in China.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/31/solar-plus-storage-autonomous-power-generator-from-spain/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Solar-plus-storage autonomous power generator from Spain,"From pv magazine Global
The Spanish companies Solartia and IED — experts in energy and electronics, respectively — have launched Arca, an autonomous solar power generator described as a robust and low-maintenance system that aims to alleviate energy poverty.
The system integrates solar panels, power electronics, energy storage and prepayment in a compact, robust and simple way, which allows it to be able to supply energy permanently anywhere in the world, according to the manufacturer. The solution is also designed to be installed in any location without qualified personnel.
Arca Lite has a rated installed power of 490 Wp, and Arca Plus of 980 Wp. The voltage range is 30-50 V and 60-100 V, respectively.
The system also features encapsulated electronics, which are claimed to allow the device to withstand up to 100% relative humidity, as well as  LiFePO4 batteries. A charge and discharge algorithm prevents overcharging and deep discharging of the system, offering between 3,000 and 6,000 cycles at 80% depth of discharge (DoD).
The system can assess the state of the battery in terms of the deterioration of its storage capacity and can thus carry out predictive maintenance, according to the manufacturers. Its passive cooling avoids the use of active elements such as fans, which shorten the lifetime of the system.
Arca can work at temperatures between -15 to 65 degrees Celsius. The manufacturers offer a 7-year warranty.
The system is also said to be able to model the usage patterns of users to know the energy needs of the network to which it is connected.

Solartia and IED also stated that the system requires very low maintenance and that no skilled labor is needed for its deployment.
“Arca is not only a generator with storage, but also an information system, as it is designed to communicate with the end-user and monitor human behavior, aspects that seem key to us in these non-interconnected areas,” said IED CEO Iñigo Ayerra.
Founded in 1999, Solartia specializes in solar energy, smart microgrid energy storage, and energy access. IED was established in the early 1990s in the town of Aizoáin, Navarra, with the aim of supplying the industry with electronic products tailored to the particular needs of each segment. Focused on the design, production and assembly of electronic equipment, as well as its marketing and post-sale, IED currently offers solutions for practically all industrial sectors: renewable energy, lifting, construction and electric mobility.
