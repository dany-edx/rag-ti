Based on the latest remote sensing technology that gives real-time alerts on energy generation and savings and equipped with all safety devices like walkway and safety lifeline, this solar plant at Alchemist Hospital will generate 72.5 MWh of clean electricity annually, offsetting 1,397 tonnes of carbon emissions, the EPC firm said in a release.
Hartek Solar executed the project right from installing solar panels and inverter to supply, design, engineering and commissioning. It synced the solar plant with a smart grid-interactive inverter system to enable the hospital to run its medical emergency services and diagnostic facilities without any glitches.
Commenting on the successful execution of the project, Hartek Solar Director and CEO Simarpreet Singh said, “The potential of rooftop solar in the private institutional category is immense, and we are going all out to tap it.”
Simarpreet said there is a growing realization among institutions like hospitals and schools about how rooftop solar can substantially reduce their electricity bills and provide a reliable and uninterrupted electricity source without depending on bulky inverters and diesel-based generator sets. “Going by the favorable trends, private institutions and commercial units will set the pace for rooftop solar in coming months,” he said.
“The tariff rates for rooftop solar work out to be 17-27% cheaper than commercial tariffs and this is what is primarily driving the adoption of rooftop solar in the commercial domain.”
Hartek Solar has installed rooftop PV capacity of over 40 MW across the industrial, commercial and residential categories in more than ten states in four years of its inception.

The modules must be delivered to the site within four weeks from the receipt of the purchase order. These shall be warranted for a period of five years from the date of installation and commissioning or five-years-and-six-months from the date of supply, whichever is earlier.
The conversion efficiency of the module should be a minimum of 16% under standard test conditions.

The array, on two artificial lakes at the 130-acre airport golf course, covers an acre of the water surfaces.
The installation takes the airport’s solar generation capacity to 40 MWp, helping it produce around 1.6 lakh kWh per day against daily consumption of about 1.3 lakh kWh, the airport said.
The floating plant features high-density polyethylene floats which host 1,300 solar panels.
Pre-commissioning trials demonstrated the panels, which cost around INR2 crore, were producing power with maximum output efficiency, as one of eight solar arrays distributed on airport property, added the airport.
The floating plant is connected to the Kerala State Electricity Board grid. 
French floating PV specialist Ciel & Terre provided technical assistance on the project.
“Traditionally, the installation of [a] floating power plant costs two to three times more than that of [a] ground-mounted one but the use of … novel French technology allowed [the airport] to bring down the project cost [to be on] par with that of [a] floor installation,” stated the airport.

The state minister for new and renewable energy, Hardeep Singh Dang, has given the instructions to complete the proposed solar parks in the State within the scheduled time-frame. 
He gave the instructions to complete the 1500 MW solar park in Agar-Shajapur-Neemuch by December 2022, 600 MW Omkareshwar Dam floating solar power project by July 2023, 950 MW in Chattarpur by July 2023, and 1400 MW project in Morena by October 2023.
The minister also asked to complete the installation of 45,000 solar pumps in the State before July 2023. Rooftop solar plants are also proposed to be installed on school buildings in the State.
Madhya Pradesh is already home to a 750 MW solar project in Rewa. Set upon an area of 1590 hectares, it is one of the world’s largest single-site solar plants. Seventy-six percent of the power generated from the project is being provided to the state’s Power Management Company and 24% to Delhi Metro.
