The system, mounted on a trolley, comprises PV panels and a variable frequency drive.
“In Sangli district, a farmer can have two-three sources of water for irrigation, such as a borewell, open well, and an artificial pond. Our mobile system with variable frequency drive is compatible with different solar pumping solutions, providing farmers the flexibility to pump water from any of these water resources on their farm,” Rahul Chavan, director at Vivasvan Industries OPC, told pv magazine.
One major concern with portable solar systems is the possibility of developing microcracks during transportation, especially on rough, uneven terrains of the field.
Chavan said they have used spring suspension on all four corners between the panel arrangement and the trolley platform and a rubber dampener lining between solar module frames. These act as shock absorbers to avoid damage to the panels. The PV panels use an in-house developed frame made from mild steel.
Vivasvan Industries has deployed its portable solar structure on a farm at Kharsundi in the Sangli district of Maharashtra. The PV system comprises 15 Axitec 335 Wp panels.
Chavan said they can customize the system from 1 kW up to 7 kW on a single trolley.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/20/dust-removal-for-solar-panels-via-electrostatic-cleaning/,"HIGHLIGHTS,PV MODULE CLEANER,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 20, 2023",Dust removal for solar panels via electrostatic cleaning,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the University of Jordan have proposed the use of electrostatic cleaning as an effective way to remove dust from solar panels.
Electrostatic cleaning involves the spraying of electrostatically charged mist with low-frequency high voltage onto surfaces and objects. It is commonly used for cleaning and disinfection purposes, and may involve the use of different electrically charging disinfectants, sanitizers, and cleaners.
The scientists said the glass in solar modules contains an equal number of positive and negative charges, which means it is electrically balanced. However, friction might disrupt this balance, causing the material to become electrically charged.
“The electrical charge will create an attraction force between the dust particles and the glass due to static charge causing dust accumulation over PV modules,” the researchers explained.
The academics proposed the use of an electrostatic ionizer, which uses ions to neutralize static electricity, in order to reduce the attraction between dust particles. They used an ionizer manufactured by UK specialist Exair, which could flood the PV module surface with uniform airflow across its length, loaded with static eliminator ions. The ionizer was placed on a shaft 0.2 m the shaft attached to a screw driven by an AC gear motor above the panel.
“The charged surface attracts the appropriate number of positive and negative ions to become neutral,” the researchers explained, noting that this process is able to charge the molecules of the gasses of the surrounding air, which in turn results in a shower of ions. “Stainless steel emitter points inside the Ion Bar receive 5 kVrms high voltage, via an armored and electromagnetic shielded high voltage cable. An integrated ground wire within the power cable creates a discharge path from the emitter to the bar channel.”
The Jordanian group tested the cleaning technique on a set of four 250 W polycrystalline solar modules mounted with a tilt angle of 25 degrees at the renewable energy center of Applied Science Private University in Amman. The performance was compared to that of natural cleaning and cleaning based on anti-reflective coating.
After two weeks of testing, the scientists found that the PV modules had an energy yield loss of around 5.93% with natural cleaning. They said that the coating was also about 3.8 times more economically feasible than electrostatic neutralization under the stated conditions in the study.
“However, the vanishing of the coating material after two weeks arising a recoating issue from an economic perspective compared with electrostatic neutralization where the running cost could be eliminated via developing a fixed mechanism with no moving parts,” the scientists said.
The group claims that the performance of the electrostatic cleaning technique could be further improved by enhancing its intrinsice mechanism.
“Even though nano-coating seems economic wiser than electrostatic cleaning, electrostatic cleaning has promising future for mega solar power plants in arid regions by advantage of less affecting by harsh outside conditions which require frequent coating, and the potential to develop a practical mechanism for electrostatic cleaning with less capital and running costs,” they said.
The scientists published their findings in “Electrostatic cleaning effect on the performance of PV modules in Jordan,” which was recently published in Cleaner Engineering and Technology. In March, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a lab-scale solar module cleaning system prototype that uses electrostatic repulsion to cause dust particles to detach and virtually leap off the surface of panels.
