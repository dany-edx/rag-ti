Ministers from 20 countries and delegates from across 116 member and signatory countries participated in the Assembly.
The Assembly has decided to increase the viability gap funding for solar projects in member countries from 10% of the project cost to up to 35%, depending on the capacity and needs of the countries and their respective projects.
Speaking on the occasion, Raj Kumar Singh said, “Around 80% of the global population resides in countries that depend on fossil fuel imports, totalling a staggering 6 billion people. Renewable energy sources have the potential to supply 65% of the world’s total electricity by 2030 and decarbonize 90% of the power sector by 2050.”
“The International Solar Alliance is steadfast in its commitment to Member Countries to make solar as the energy source of choice, foster environments conducive to attracting investments and ensuring ample energy availability to meet the surging global demands. Towards this, ISA through its viability gap funding (VGF) mechanism provides a grant of $150,000 or 10% of the project cost (whichever is lower), per country per project. The Assembly decided to increase the range to 35% of the project cost, depending on the capacity and needs of the countries and their respective projects.”
The Co-President of the Assembly, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, France’s Minister of State for Development, Francophonie and International Partnerships, said: “For France, the ISA is a key initiative to promote the development of clean energy and thus combat climate disruptions. It is playing its full part in this great project, with constant and growing support for our Alliance. Through the French Development Agency (AFD), we’ve financed over 1.5 billion euros worth of solar projects since 2016. France is taking action and we are determined to accelerate.”
The ISA has created a Global Solar Facility (GSF) with payment guarantee, insurance and investment fund components to catalyze solar investments in various countries across the world, starting with Africa’s underserved geographies. The GSF will mainly focus on decentralized solar solutions, rooftop solar and productive use solar. Through the GSF, the ISA aims to mitigate project risks and provide technical assistance to address regulatory gaps in the solar energy sector.
Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General of International Solar Alliance, said, “We urgently need to accelerate the build-up of solar energy, especially in developing countries and in applications that influence the daily lives of those without access to reliable energy – such as getting electricity from solar mini-grids, powering agricultural pumps, running cold storages, etc. Capacity building and regulatory change are necessary enablers towards that.”
“The ISA has so far facilitated development of 1 GW of solar projects in its member countries. It is further facilitating over 9.5 GW of solar applications in 55 developing countries, including least developed countries and small island developing states, and has already provided training to nearly 4,000 people across the developing world on ways to make a living out of supporting solar energy.”
The ISA is also working on developing STAR Centres which will be a hub of technology, knowledge, and expertise on solar energy. It is also enabling entrepreneurs in these countries who can, with help, become major suppliers of solar energy across countries and regions.
In May 2020, ISA initiated Demonstration Projects to meet the needs of LDCs and SIDS. The aim was to exhibit solar technology applications, which can be scaled up, and build the capacity of beneficiary member countries. Four projects set up with ISA’s assistance were inaugurated by RK Singh. These projects include:
The International Solar Alliance is a multilateral treaty based organization which today has 116 member countries. Before the end of the year, it expects four more countries to join, which will take its member countries to 120.
The ISA works with governments to ease solar deployment and promote solar power as a sustainable transition to a carbon-neutral future. Its mission is to unlock $1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030 while reducing technology and its financing costs. It is partnering with multilateral development banks, development financial institutions, private and public sector organisations, civil society, and other international institutions to deploy cost-effective and transformational solutions through solar energy, especially in the least developed countries and the small island developing states.

Europe is growing its solar fleet in leaps and bounds, with cumulative installed capacity though to October already matching the total installed for all of last year. According to Rystad Energy modeling, new solar capacity additions are on track to grow 30% year on year, surpassing 58 GW (DC) of new panels by the year’s end.
After briefly conceding top position to Spain last year, Germany is retaking the lead with a projected 84% annual growth this year, reaching a record high of 13.5 GW of total solar PV capacity. Meanwhile, Spain faces challenges in maintaining momentum this year, despite its record-breaking performance in 2022.
Other key markets include Poland and the Netherlands, with their growth fueled by a surge in rooftop installations. Rooftop PV is expected to account for 70% of all newly installed solar across the continent.
“Rooftop solar is driving the transformation of Europe’s renewable energy landscape, from a niche market to a powerful force in reshaping the continent’s energy mix,” said Vegard Wiik Vollset, vice president and head of EMEA renewables research at Rystad Energy.
Contrasting solar’s success story, wind energy – including onshore and offshore, both of which were previously on a robust growth path – has faced hurdles that could hinder its expansion.
Due to permitting bottlenecks and rising supply chain costs, Rystad Energy forecasts a 11% drop in onshore wind installations in 2023 compared to last year. Offshore wind capacity is expected to grow this year, but only by 2% due to project delays.
Previously, a report presenting the RepowerEU plan’s progress one year after its launch, said the European Union will add 69 GW of solar and wind capacity in 2023, representing a 17% increase year-on-year.
A separate report from Aurora Energy Research released in June said Europe is on track to install 475 GW of solar power generation capacity by 2030 – more than double the continent’s current installed capacity. This will require more than EUR 145 billion ($153.4 billion)  investment, the analysts have calculated.
“Solar power is set to become the largest source of power generation globally by 2027 and to account for 65% of worldwide renewable capacity growth in 2023,” Aurora Energy Research said in its first dedicated European Solar Market Attractiveness Report.
According to BloombergNEF, the 2023 global solar installations will grow by 56% year on year to a “record high” volume of nearly 400 GW driven by falling prices of solar modules and the rapid buildup of PV projects in China and elsewhere.
In its flagship report World Energy Outlook, released earlier this month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that this year alone renewables generation capacity additions will exceed 500 GW globally, with $1 billion per day spent on solar deployment.
Renewables are set to contribute 80% of new power capacity to 2030 in the stated policies scenario (STEPS), with solar PV alone accounting for more than half of this, according to the IEA report.
“Solar has become a major global industry and is set to transform electricity markets even in the STEPS. But there is significant scope for further growth given manufacturing plans and the technology’s competitiveness,” the IEA writes.
By the end of the decade, the world could have manufacturing capacity for more than 1 200 GW of panels per year, according to the IEA. But in the STEPS, only 500 GW is deployed globally in 2030 – less than half of the module nameplate capacity potentially available for deployment.

JinkoSolar said it has achieved a “major technological breakthrough” with its 182 mm n-type monocrystalline silicon solar cell, reaching 26.89% maximum solar conversion efficiency.
The Chinese PV module manufacturer said in a press release that the efficiency results have been independently confirmed by the National PV industry Measurement and Testing Center. pv magazine was unable to contact the National PV Industry Measurement and Testing Center to verify the claim, as its website was down.
The research and development team developed “advanced metallization enhancement technology, high energy bulk material passivation technology and high-performance light trapping passivating contact technology” to achieve the milestone, said the company.
Jin Hao, chief technology officer for JinkoSolar, said the new conversion efficiency rating has broken previous n-type monocrystalline silicon solar cell company records. He said the company will continue to invest in research and development.
