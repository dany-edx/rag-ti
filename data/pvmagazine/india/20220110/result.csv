https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/10/india-may-add-12-5-gw-of-solar-in-fy2022-23/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,UTILITY SCALE PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 10, 2022",India may add 12.5GW of solar in 2022-23,"Ratings agency ICRA expects India to add 16.1GW of renewable energy generation capacity in the next fiscal year. The analysts told pv magazine clean energy capacity additions in 2022-23 will be driven by solar, with 12.5GW coming from PV projects. Wind projects are expected to contribute 2.2GW and hybrid plants 1.4GW.
ICRA analysts attribute the strong outlook for renewables to a pipeline of more than 55GW of announced projects, close to 40GW of which are solar plants with the balance made up from wind and solar-wind hybrid facilities. The competitive energy price tariffs offered by renewables are another reason for the expected boom in new capacity.
The commitment to climate change goals announced by Narendra Modi at the recent COP26 summit has further strengthened the investment prospects for renewables, according to Gurgaon-based ICRA.
Prime Minister Modi announced India’s pledge to increase non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500GW by 2030 at the climate change summit in Glasgow. The government also wants to increase renewable energy’s share in the power generation mix to half the total this decade.
Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president and co-group head for corporate ratings at ICRA, said: “The backlog of the projects awarded by the central nodal agencies and state distribution utilities remains large with, under-development solar, wind, and hybrid capacities of more than 55GW. [Based on] this pipeline, ICRA expects the RE [renewable energy] capacity addition to increase from [the] 7.4GW reported in FY2021 [fiscal year 2020-21] to 12.5GW in FY2022, and further to 16GW in FY2023.”
The progress shown by the Solar Energy Corporation of India in signing power sale and power purchase agreements in the last six months also supports new renewables capacity additions, according to Kadam. He added, the ability of developers to secure solar modules within budget and a cost of debt funding of less than 8.5% remained important to make new clean power projects viable.
Headwinds in the execution of projects and supply chain challenges in procuring modules and wind turbine generators pose near-term risks for renewables developers. Moreover, the average price of imported, mono PERC solar modules has increased by more than 35% over the past 12 months, putting upward pressure on PV project capital costs. Notwithstanding the recent hike in GST for solar power equipment, however, the solar electricity tariffs set by developers continue to remain highly competitive, as seen in a December bid of INR2.17/kWh highlighted by the ratings agency.
ICRA has estimated India would require up to $500 billion of investment to meet the renewables capacity targets announced by the prime minister at COP26 in November and Vikram V, vice president and sector head for corporate ratings at ICRA said: “The investment requirement for achieving the non-fossil [-fuel] capacity target of 500GW by FY2030 remains large, at close to $300 billion. This apart, investments would be required in augmenting the transmission infrastructure to integrate the renewable power with the electricity grid as well as investments to create storage infrastructure. ICRA expects the investments towards transmission infrastructure and storage capabilities to be about $150-200 billion over the next 8.5 years, taking the overall investment requirement to $450-500 billion. The availability of adequate funding avenues at cost-competitive rates remains critical to achieving these capacity targets.”

The dollar notes are certified green bonds by Climate Bond Initiative and will be listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). These green bonds have a tenor of 5.25 years. 
“This is the first high-yield issuance out of the ASEAN and South Asian regions in 2022. These notes were subscribed to by investors from the US and Asia at about 40% each and the balance by EMEA-based investors. The bulk of notes was subscribed to by long-only fund managers and pension funds,” read a ReNew statement.
So far ReNew, through its subsidiaries, has raised more than US$ 3.5 billion across eight such issuances, of which seven are outstanding. The amount raised would be used by ReNew’s subsidiaries to refinance existing high-cost debt and fund capital expenditure in renewable energy assets or for other purposes.
ReNew has a large, diversified renewable energy portfolio across utility-scale wind and solar energy projects, hydro projects, and distributed solar energy projects. As of November 30, 2021, it had a total capacity of approximately 10.3 GW of renewable energy projects (including 7 GW of commissioned and 3.3 GW committed projects) across India. This comprises 50% wind (5.2 GW), 49% solar (5 GW) and 1% hydro (0.1 GW). ReNew aims to achieve close to 18 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2025.
Speaking about the amount raised, President Corporate Finance, Kailash Vaswani, said: “In line with our rapid expansion plans to accelerate India’s energy transition, this issuance goes a long way in helping us meet our robust growth objectives and reduce our cost of capital. We will continue to seek fundraising opportunities to refinance our existing debt with lower-cost fixed-rate green bonds.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/10/philippines-smc-to-start-operation-of-690mw-of-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 10, 2022",Philippines’ SMC to start operation of 690MW of batteries,"From pv magazine International
The power arm of Philippines-based brewing-to-energy conglomerate San Miguel Corporation (SMC) has said it is ready to start operation of an initial 690MW of battery storage facilities early this year. The company expects to complete 31 energy storage systems in 2021-22, with an accumulated capacity of 1GW.
SMC’s battery storage portfolio started to take shape last year when the company revealed it was nearing completion on projects across the country. It announced 31 batteries would be deployed by the end of this year, not only to improve power reliability and help frequency control, but also to make way for the integration of some 3GW of intermittent renewables capacity.
At the time, SMC president Ramon See Ang said his company would build solar plants in combination with battery storage at 10 locations throughout the Philippines. These are scheduled to go online by next year.
While there has been no update since on the progress of those solar-plus-storage facilities, a couple of big batteries owned by SMC have already been connected to the grid. Last year, German and U.S.-owned energy storage joint venture Fluence said it commissioned two 20MW/20MWh batteries out of a 470MW/470MWh energy storage portfolio it was contracted to supply and maintain for SMC Global Power. With project sites ranging in size from 20 to 60 MW, the SMC portfolio procured with Siemens and AES Corp-owned Fluence is spread across 13 sites.
Finnish tech company Wartsila announced commissioning of its first two battery storage projects for SMC Global Power in May. The projects have capacities of 20MW/20MWh and 40MW/40MWh and are part of previously announced energy storage orders for 100MW/100MWh of systems.
According to a stock exchange filing today, the battery storage fleet is intended to augment SMC’s renewable energy portfolio, “which includes the construction of solar, liquefied natural gas, and hydroelectric power plants to address the continuing need of the country for reliable and affordable power.”
While an increasing number of utilities are considering natural gas as a “bridge” to full renewables an unnecessary step, SMC Global Power, one of the Philippines’ largest power generators, appears to hold a different view. It operates the 1.2GW Ilijan Combined-Cycle Power Plant, the country’s largest natural gas facility, and is gearing up to build another 1.3GW plant, in Batangas City. SMC announced, in July, it will drop new coal projects from its expansion plans as it transitions to a low-carbon future.
At the time, the company announced it had scrapped “plans to put up three new clean-coal power plants with a capacity of 1,500MW in favor of new facilities that utilize cleaner, renewable energy sources.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/10/solar-powered-hydrogen-for-domestic-applications-via-building-integrated-transparent-platform/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 10, 2022",Solar-powered hydrogen for domestic applications via building-integrated transparent platform,"From pv magazine International
A Korean-U.S. research group has created a system to produce and store green hydrogen via transparent PV (TPV) cells and transparent photo-electrochemical (TPEC) cells that could be integrated into buildings.
“We proposed a transparent, sustainable energy platform,” the research’s corresponding author, Joondong Kim, told pv magazine. “Our proposed system benefits the levelized cost of solar hydrogen by on site production and building integration and offers affordable solar hydrogen for domestic applications.”
The system is claimed to have a high average visible transmittance of around 64% and remarkable color neutrality, which the scientists said has a close chromaticity to the light source. “To ensure its suitability in building-integration, especially for windows, the visual appearance of TPV and TPEC is a fundamental issue,” the researchers noted.
The system’s solar power generator is based on 1.47%-efficient transparent metal oxide solar cells built with n-doped zinc oxide (N:ZnO) and p-doped nickel(II) oxide (p-NiO) on a glass substrate made of indium tin oxide (ITO). These cells are able to generate a high photovoltage of 0.546V and work as a photoanode to provide a stable photocurrent density of 2.28mA/cm2 in the TPEC system.
The PEC cell was fabricated with a TPEC photoanode as the positive terminal and platinum wire as the negative terminal. “Short wavelength UV with highly-energetic photons was mostly absorbed in the photoanode, with an efficiency as high as 82%,” the academics emphasized.
A proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is linked to the TPV-TPEC module, with the latter working as a hydrogen generator and the former being used as an axial medium to convert the hydrogen to electric power. These two systems are complementary to each other and complete the closed-loop energy supply chain, which can supply power without interruption. “In the daytime, the PV can supply electric power directly to the building and produce hydrogen for energy storage,” the researchers explained. “Hydrogen fuel is an efficient energy storage method and can be used during the night time or in periods when the PV system is disabled.”
The closed-loop system was experimentally demonstrated by connecting it to a 10mW electric fan. The PV cells provide power to operate the fan and, at the same time, the TPEC/PEM electrolyzer unit. The stored hydrogen is then used by the PEMFC, to produce more electric power to move the fan. Performance profiles of the solar cells were obtained by varying light intensity from 13.6 to 105mW/cm2. “The TPV-TPEC-PEMFC system is solid to provide the constant power supply to operate the fan without any interruption,” the research team stated. “The uncertainty of the light-dependent electric power production can be resolved by the merit of the energy circulation system of [the] TPV-TPEC-PEMFC [system].”
“This is the first demonstration of a TPV-PEC-fuel cell application, which suggests the potential for a transparent energy system as a building-integrated, uninterrupted, pollution-free energy supply,” Kim told pv magazine. “The proposed system is readily available for building structures that provide niche aesthetics, including angle-dependent transmittance, see-through features, UV blocking, and on site power production.”
The system is described in the study “Transparent sustainable energy platform: Closed-loop energy chain of solar-electric-hydrogen by transparent photovoltaics, photo-electro-chemical cells and fuel system,” which was recently published in Nano Energy.  The research group includes scientists from the Multidisciplinary Core Institute for Future Energies (MCIFE) in South Korea and the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States. “Our study demonstrated storage possibilities for domestic applications such as fan operation and light control,” Kim concluded.
