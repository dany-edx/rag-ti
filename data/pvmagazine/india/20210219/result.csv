The report says U.S. institutional investors, holding $26 trillion in assets as of 2020, are increasingly prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. With the Covid-19-induced downturn in the global economy, they are looking for robust avenues for returns. India’s green transition offers opportunities to respond to both objectives.
The report recommends that President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi launch a U.S.-India Green Transition Finance Initiative, a program to mobilize private finance for India’s sustainable transition and make it the centerpiece of a new leaders-level climate change strategy.
“Foreign institutional investment can play a critical role in advancing India’s transition to a green economy,” said Alan Yu, senior fellow and director of International Climate Policy at CAP and co-author of the report. 
“Making progress on India’s green transition would have a major impact in the battle against climate change, boost economic growth through job creation, improve public health, reduce air pollution, and offer long-term positive returns on investment. The United States and India have a shared interest in mobilizing all resources to confront these challenges.”
The report recommends a range of actions, such as green-tagging tools to increase the visibility of assets for potential investors, enhanced U.S. International Development Finance Corp. catalytic finance activities in India, and new and transparent payment security mechanisms for power generators and distribution companies.
“India’s energy transition will be determined, in no small part, by the availability and accessibility of affordable capital at scale,” said Kanika Chawla, non-resident fellow at CEEW and co-author of the report. “With India presenting possibly the largest demand for international green capital, and the United States being home to some of the largest supply pools of private capital, a U.S.-India Green Transition Finance Initiative that facilitates private capital to flow into green projects between the two countries would signal the leadership of the two countries and the critical role they must play in advancing the global energy transition.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/19/iesa-partners-norways-greenstat-to-support-indias-hydrogen-mission/,"HYDROGEN,HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA,NORWAY",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021",IESA partners Norway’s Greenstat to support India’s hydrogen mission,"India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) and Greenstat Hydrogen India, a Norwegian energy organization, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding for two years to accelerate the hydrogen technology development in India. The two partners will collaborate on establishing a Norwegian Centre of Excellence on Hydrogen in India and the development of green hydrogen technologies in India.
In the Union Budget 2021, India’s government announced its plan to launch a National Hydrogen Mission. The draft mission is likely in the next two months.
For the financial year 2021-22, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has been allotted INR 25 crore for research and development (R&D) in hydrogen.
Once the draft of the mission is in place, it will be floated for public consultation. There will be five focus areas, including R&D, demand creation, industry application, eco-system creation (including policies) and bringing industry on board along with international partnerships.
In these five areas, demand creation will focus on the niche products that can be taken up and effective use of the fuel in trucks and buses. In the industrial sector, the government is looking at hydrogen as a replacement for coke in the steel industry and making use of the fuel in the fertilizer sector. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has indicated that by 2025-26, the industrial sector will be one of the major hydrogen recipients.
Debi Prasad Dash, Executive Director, India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) said hydrogen presents a potential opportunity for India to decrease reliance on oil imports and focus on alternate energy sources. In line with the industry needs, IESA launched the MIGHT (Mobility and Infrastructure with Green Hydrogen Technology) initiative in 2020 for supporting policies to enable use of green hydrogen in both stationery and mobility sector.
“We anticipate that advanced chemistry cell battery manufacturing mission and hydrogen mission together can enable India to fast-track decarbonization of grid, industrial sector, and transportation sector in the coming decade,” he added.
Sturle Pedersen, Chairman, Greenstat Hydrogen India, said, “Leading a broad representation of Norwegian cutting-edge expertise within the hydrogen sector, we are thrilled to be a part of this exciting journey together with IESA, the Indian industry, R&D institutes and the Indian government. Hydrogen is already a dominant part of the energy value chain world-wide. The challenge now is to revert the energy ecosystem back into its natural evolution. Renewable energy must replace fossil fuels, to preserve our habitat, and to preserve our mobility. Hydrogen is the natural energy carrier representing a vital part of the sustainable energy solution together with sustainable battery manufacturing.”
Since 2012, IESA has been working to help address enabling policy framework for all forms of energy storage technologies for both stationary and emobility applications. It worked to include hydrogen as part of the National Energy Storage Mission developed for the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy in 2018.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/19/pv-can-cover-almost-half-of-typical-office-buildings-electricity-demand/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021",PV can cover almost half of typical office buildings’ electricity demand,"From pv magazine International
How much of the electricity needs of an office building can be met with a photovoltaic system installed on-site? A group of researchers at the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW), in Germany, is now seeking to give an answer to this question by using its own data, coming from a PV facade and a rooftop array based on CIGS module that are installed on its building in Stuttgart.
The scientists transferred the yield data into a model and found that the electricity from the roof and facade modules can cover almost 40% of the total requirements of a standard office building, assuming that no battery storage is installed.
The researchers based their modeling on a typical five-floor administrative building. Assuming that a quarter of the entire facade and 30% of the roof area are covered with photovoltaics, the PV system should have an installed power of 131 kW and generate around 115,000 kWh of electricity per year.
“The facades alone provided 29% of the electricity consumed over a period of one year,” explained Dieter Geyer, project manager at ZSW. Around 80% of the generated solar power could be used for this purpose, the rest of the system can be fed into the power grid. “The combination of photovoltaics on the facade and on the roof even increased the self-sufficiency share to 39%,” says Geyer, adding that about 58% of the produced solar power can be used locally.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/19/high-hopes-from-pli-scheme-for-solar-manufacturing/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 19, 2021",High hopes from PLI scheme for solar manufacturing ,"The government is committed to investing INR 4500 crore in manufacturing high-efficiency solar PV modules under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, said prime minister Narendra Modi yesterday.
The prime minister was addressing a webinar for consultation towards effective implementation of Union Budget provisions in the power and renewable energy sector. 
The PLI scheme will incentivize domestic and foreign manufacturers to build gigawatt scale, vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in India. The government aims at achieving 10 GW capacity of integrated solar PV manufacturing plants in India within two years through the scheme. This is expected to drive a direct investment of around INR14,000 crore, presumably a figure which the department expects the program to attract from solar manufacturers. 
The scheme is likely to increase demand for locally produced materials like EVA sheets, solar glass, backsheets and junction boxes. “We want to see our companies become global manufacturing champions, not just to fulfil local demands” said the Prime Minister, as he hoped for a massive response to the scheme. 
The scheme was approved by the Cabinet in November last year.
“Large imports of solar PV panels pose risks in supply-chain resilience and have strategic security challenges considering the electronic (hackable) nature of the value chain. A focused PLI scheme for solar PV modules will incentivize domestic and global players to build large-scale solar PV capacity in India and help India leapfrog in capturing the global value chains for solar PV manufacturing,” according to government release.
Speaking at the webinar, the Prime Minister pointed out that renewable energy capacity has increased two-and-half times in the last six years. Solar energy capacity increased by 15 times. 
“This year’s Budget has shown unprecedented commitment towards investment in [renewable energy] infrastructure. This is evident in Mission Hydrogen, domestic manufacturing of solar cells, and massive capital infusion in the renewable Energy Sector,” he added.
Modi said, under the PM KUSUM scheme, farmers are becoming energy entrepreneurs. The goal is to create 30 GW solar capacity through small plants in the farmers’ fields. “Already, 4 GW solar capacity is installed through rooftop solar projects, 2.5 GW will be added soon. 40 GW solar power is aimed in the next one-and-a-half years through rooftop solar projects,” he added.
