Besides subscribing to the non-convertible debentures, ADB will facilitate a $2 million grant to TPDDL to partially finance the purchase and integration of a pilot battery energy storage system (BESS) with the TPDDL network. 
Tata Power Delhi Distribution will use the senior secured financing of $18.2 million to commission a new 66/11-kilovolt grid, augment and expand transformers, substations, feeder lines, and switching stations, install smart meters, and replace obsolete electrical equipment and meters.
The 10MWh BESS is South Asia’s first grid-scaled energy storage project at the distribution transformer level. It will enable electricity to be stored and delivered on demand, reducing grid instability, and providing the flexibility to integrate intermittent solar and wind energy resources. The grant to finance the BESS is provided by Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg Philanthropies’ Climate Innovation and Development Fund (CIDF) and administered by ADB. 
“Power distribution is a crucial link in the electricity supply chain, and at times one of the most vulnerable. Mainstreaming a battery energy storage system at the distribution transformer level will better integrate renewable energy sources and contribute to a more disaster-resilient power distribution system for Delhi,” said ADB’s Director General for Private Sector Operations Suzanne Gaboury. “As Asia’s Climate Bank, ADB supports India’s climate goals through innovative technologies and the catalyzing of private capital to finance green projects.” 
“The battery energy storage system plays a crucial role in building a resilient grid and paves the way for a future-ready power distribution network. We thank ADB for administering this grant for the integration of the pilot BESS with TPDDL’s network. This will enable us in ensuring a high-quality power supply for consumers and help integrate clean energy into the power supply mix,” said Praveer Sinha, CEO & managing director of Tata Power. 
In 2022, India’s Ministry of Power targeted a battery storage capacity of 4% of total electricity consumption by 2030. To reach that goal, India would need a total battery energy storage capacity of 182 GWh by 2030. ADB’s financing through CIDF for the pilot BESS will provide proof of concept and lessons learned by TPDDL to implement a planned additional 50 MWh of BESS capacity. 
Launched in September 2021, CIDF is a blended finance facility managed by ADB, established with an initial $25 million philanthropic commitment from Bloomberg Philanthropies and Goldman Sachs. The fund has the potential to unlock up to $500 million in private sector and governmental investments to support sustainable low-carbon economic development and help catalyze a clean energy transition in South and Southeast Asia.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/10/least-cost-model-for-compressed-air-energy-storage/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 10, 2023",‘Least-cost’ model for compressed air energy storage,"From pv magazine Global
A research group led by Stanford University has developed a new model to calculate the lowest-cost way to combining compressed air energy storage (CAES) in energy systems with large shares of renewable energy.
“CAES can be suitable for any energy system such as renewable energy, gas/coal turbine, fuel cells, and other systems in the future,” researcher Sarah Ashfaq told pv magazine. “It is usually considered best for medium to large-scale energy systems. The availability of suitable geographic features for the formation and locations of underground storage caverns is still considered a constraint to the rate of adoption of CAES as a bulk energy storage technology.”
The academics said their new model assesses how much CAES capacity might be needed for the deep decarbonization of power systems, while compensating for the variability of wind and solar-based power systems. They presented their findings in “Least-cost analysis of bulk energy storage for deep decarbonized power system with increased share of renewable energy,” which was recently published in Electric Power Systems Research.
They used California as a case study with different penetration levels of renewable energy. They used demand inputs from the US-Energy Information Administration (EIA) data portal, and data for wind and solar power generation from NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA–2).
“The collected data was updated with desired capacity factors and number of years,” they said. “Each technology is represented by a fixed cost and a variable cost.”
The research team did not consider restrictions on the energy sources based on societal complications such as technological acceptance
or local preferences. They calculated the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) at each hourly time step, based on the availability of generation capacity, wind and solar resources, storage resources, and demand.
The study considers four scenarios. It features a base case, with the share of renewables California reached in 2021, as well as a scenario in which wind has 50% more potential. It also looks at a case in which solar has 50% more potential, and a scenario in which both technologies have 100% more potential.
“In case of increase in the potential of both wind and solar the main node curtailment is close to the increase in solar dispatch curve, due to the availability and dispatch of abundant solar power,” said the researchers. 
The scientists found that the electricity mix in the lowest-cost system would be more or less independent from the amount of excess power generation. But they also ascertained that this mix would have a strong impact on the required CAES capacity.
“For example, in case of 100% excess wind the optimal mix of renewable sources is 68.9% wind and 31.1% solar with CAES capacity of 3.40 TWh and in case of 100% excess solar, the optimal mix is 35.6% wind and 64.4% solar with CAES capacity of 2.77 TWh,” they stated. “In case of 100% excess wind and solar, the optimal mix is 52.5% solar and 47.5% wind with 3.10TWh of CAES capacity.”
They also found that California’s estimated annual demand of 277 TWh would need a CAES capacity of 3.83TWh at a cost of $0.175/kWh. The aforementioned fourth scenario with the highest penetration of wind and solar would result in a cost reduction of 14.1%, at a cost of $0.123/kWh) and a 7.4% reduction in CAES capacity.
“CAES is very competitive and on a $/kWh basis,” Ashfaq concluded. “Pumped hydro storage) and CAES are the most cost-effective energy storage technologies, as they offer the lowest cost in $/kWh for long-term storage. For short-duration storage, however, lithium-ion performs best.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/10/dutch-city-installs-solar-footpath/,"COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 10, 2023",Dutch city installs solar footpath,"From pv magazine Global
Hungary-based Platio has developed a damage-resistant path made of solar tiles. The solar footpath, which spans 400 square meters, was recently installed in Groningen, the Netherlands, as part of the “Making City” European Union project.
“Our patented technology has been developed so no microcracks appear in the solar cell and do not affect the performance,” Helga Ruscsák, marketing manager at Platio, told pv magazine when asked about mechanical stress. “This rule is valid under intended use, i.e. if a Platio solar paver is not subjected to a pressure of more than 2 tons. Therefore it is safe to walk on it.”
The solar footpath consists of 2,544 solar pavers. It will generate 55,000 kWh of electricity a year to power Groningen’s city hall. Platio’s solar pavers are made of four monocrystalline cells with 21.5 W output and 21.8% efficiency. The open-circuit voltage is 2.69 V and the short circuit current is 10.5 A. Each cell measures 158.75 mm x 158.75 mm while the solar paver module measures 353 mm x 353 mm x 41 mm and weighs 6.5 kg. The module is covered by a 10 mm temperated opal glass and its frame is made of a recycled polymer composite. It comes with a 5-year warranty.
The Platio solar paver is suitable for pavements, terraces, driveways, and bicycle roads, among others. Vehicles weighing up to eight tons can purportedly drive on it.
“Platio solar pavers are doubly sustainable because they not only provide green energy but are made of recycled plastic,” said Philip Broeksma, council of energy from the municipality of Groningen. “And it makes double use of space: the solar footpath generates electricity, while people can simply and safely walk on it.  It is an example of how to use space in the city in a smart and sustainable way.”
The system’s performance is being monitored through an app. When it was inaugurated on March 24, it reportedly produced enough electricity to power 47 Dutch houses for one day. The EU Making City project aims to develop Positive Energy Districts (PED), demonstrating the potential of innovative solutions to tackle climate-neutral goals.
