About 42% of installations during the year were in the industrial segment, while residential, commercial, and government segments accounted for 32%, 25%, and 1%, respectively.
According to the report, cumulative rooftop solar installations reached almost 8.8 GW as of Dec. 31, 2022. Gujarat topped in the installed capacity with a 24% share of cumulative solar rooftop installations, followed by Maharashtra (14%) and Rajasthan (9%). 
“2022 was a lost opportunity for the rooftop solar market in India, affected by policy challenges restricting supply and impacting the cost of modules. Despite the hurdles, installations were almost on pace with the previous year. Strong fundamentals continued to drive installations in the commercial and industrial segments. We expect growth to resume in 2023 as pricing and supply challenges moderate,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.
The imposition of the basic customs duty (BCD) and the Approved List of Models & Manufacturers (ALMM) mandate for rooftop solar projects added to the volatility in solar module prices and supply in the market. “Installations may have been higher if project costs hadn’t surged after the BCD and if installers had clarity about grid-connected rooftop solar projects requiring ALMM-enlisted modules,” noted the report.
The fourth quarter (Oct.-Dec. period) of 2022 saw a rooftop solar addition of 483 MW, 56% of which was in the residential and 43% in the commercial and industrial segments.

With this, TPREL has completed INR 4,000 crore ($525 million) of equity fundraising from GreenForest New Energies.
In the latest round, TPREL issued 200 million compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) to GreenForest New Energies for INR 2,000 crore. 
GreenForest holds 6.06% equity in TPREL. On the conversion of the above CCPS, it will have a 9.76% to 11.43% equity stake in TPREL, subject to the equity valuation on final conversion, stated Tata Power.
The investment by BlackRock and Mubadala will fund Tata Power Renewables’ aggressive growth plans as it targets over 20 GW of renewable assets and a market-leading position in the rooftop and electric vehicle charging space across India over the next five years. 
The newly created platform will house all the renewable energy businesses of Tata Power, including utility-scale solar, wind and hybrid generation assets; solar cell and module manufacturing; engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracting; rooftop solar infrastructure; solar pumps and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

Dutch startup BirdBlocker has developed a system to prevent birds from nesting under rooftop PV arrays. It presented the solution – which reduces the risk of fire and bird droppings – at the Genera trade show this week in Madrid, Spain.
The BirdBlocker features a high-density polyethylene strip with long, interconnected needles. “The strip has needles which lie flush against the roof, making it impossible for birds to get under the solar panel,” BirdBlocker’s founder, Hans de Grooth, told pv magazine. “There is a bridge between the needles so that birds cannot pass between the needles.”
The solution comes in a standard version for pitched rooftops, in addition to another variant with ultra-long needles for solar panels mounted further away from pitched rooftops. The needles of the standard version measure 125 mm and those on the longer version measure 200 mm.
The solution attachs to module frames with stainless steel clips that birds purportedly cannot pry loose. BirdBlocker claims that the clips are adaptable to 98% of standard solar panels. It also offers a special clip for modules with box-design frames.
The company claims that the BirdBlocker is “very easy and fast to install.” The product can be installed without removing the solar panels, and the needles can be cut to the appropriate length for each rooftop. Installation does not require any screws or drills on the panels, so it does not affect panel warranties, according to BirdBlocker.
The manufacturer recommends using its solution for new rooftop installations. Retrofits are also possible, but come at a higher installation cost.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/01/new-thermal-battery-offers-fast-efficient-performance-at-low-cost/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"MARCH 1, 2023","New thermal battery offers fast, efficient performance at low cost","From pv magazine Global
Thermal energy storage systems use temperature shifts to store energy for later use, or for use at other locations. The most commonly used ways to capture energy are based on latent and sensible heat transfers.
The former heat method uses the amount of thermal energy needed for a phase change – which is a change in physical state, such as from solid to liquid, or liquid to gas – without altering the temperature of a material. This technique is associated with large energy densities. The latter is the thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a material without causing any phase transitions. A major advantage of this heat transfer method is its low cost.
Now, engineers at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, with support from the US Department of Energy, have developed a new thermal energy system that combines the best of both techniques. The Lehigh Thermal Battery consists of engineered cementitious materials and thermosiphons in a combination that enables fast, efficient thermal performance at low cost. The technology can operate with heat or electricity as the charging energy input.
The team has announced that, after three years of research and development, the Lehigh Thermal Battery is now market-ready. The process involved integrated system testing at 3, 10 and 150 kilowatt-hours thermal (kWhth) in a relevant environment.
The 150-kWhth prototype built at the Energy Research Center is a fully instrumented structure containing 22 finned thermosyphons. The 150-kWhth prototype has been tested extensively using compressed air at 480 C, producing an energy-to-energy charge/discharge efficiency of the solid media of more than 95%, uniform temperature distribution in the solid media during charging, and consistent cyclic repeatability.
The average power rates achieved during charging and discharging were 16.4 kWth and 19.8 kWth, respectively, with a very fast energy gradient of the thermal battery of 0.51 kWhth/min during the first hour of discharge.
Co-principal investigator Sudhakar Neti, professor emeritus in the Department of Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering at Lehigh, claimed that the technology is innovative on many levels.
“It is modular, designed for independent energy input/output streams during charging/discharging, which is feasible with the help of the thermosyphons, and the two-phase change process inside the thermosyphon tubes allows rapid isothermal heat transfer to/from the storage media at very high heat transfer coefficients and heat rates,” said Neti.
Carlos Romero, co-principal investigator on the project and the director of the Energy Research Center at Lehigh, said that the concrete plus thermosiphon concept is unique among heat energy storage concepts.
“The technology offers the potential for adaptation over a broad range of temperatures, and heat transfer media and operating conditions,” said Romero.
These qualities make the Lehigh Thermal Battery suitable for decarbonization opportunities in energy-intense industry sectors, the flexibilization of conventional power plants, and advancements and penetration of concentrated solar power.
“Another opportunity for the Lehigh Thermal Battery to play an important role in the decarbonization effort is the integration of thermal energy storage in a system that includes heat pumps and Organic Rankine Cycles, working with surplus renewable electricity,” said Neti.
