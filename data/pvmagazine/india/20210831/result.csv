The new modules can be widely used in utility, agriculture, industrial, and rooftop applications.
The bifacial module (model GS10-B144-GF) uses 144 half-cut monocrystalline silicon (PERC) cells and a multibusbar design. It offers power outputs ranging from 525-560W with a power conversion efficiency of 20.3-21.7%. Rear-side can provide additional power gain of up to 30%.
“Higher module conversion efficiency and lower resistance are characteristic of half-cell structure. The new circuit design with multi-busbar technology prevents current losses. Advanced glass and cell surface textured design ensure excellent performance in the low light environment and reduced hot-spot losses,” said Goldi Solar.
The bifacial mono PERC module weighs 32 kg with dimensions of 2,278×1,133×35 mm3. It can withstand a snow load of up to 5,400 Pa and 2,400 Pa wind load.
“The modules will be available by the end of Q3 FY2022. Products will be available both in India and overseas markets,” said the manufacturer, adding the panels will carry a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty.
Goldi Solar also plans for backward integration through the setting up of a multi-gigawatt solar cell manufacturing line and supporting the ecosystem through the manufacturing of raw material used in solar modules.

The inverters are based on silicon carbide (SiC) technology, which allows high power conversion efficiency and power density. 
The inverters are available in power ratings ranging from 5 kW to 15 kW, with maximum input DC voltage of 1000V. The 10 kW, 12 kW, and 15 kW inverters have three maximum power point trackers, one for each of the three PV strings that can be connected to the inverter. The MPPT range is 80-800V DC.
With triple MPPT trackers, no paralleling of PV strings happens inside the inverter and thus an excellent MPPT efficiency is achieved, according to the manufacturer.
The 15kW inverter offers an efficiency of 98.2-98.4% and a European efficiency of 97.5%. It weighs 29 kg with dimensions of 600x420x185 mm3.
Three PV strings of 15-20 panels in series can be connected to the 15kW inverter. With a maximum continuous input current of 17A per PV string, the inverter is compatible with even high-power bifacial mono-crystalline PV panels that have a maximum power point current up to 15 A.
With the maximum continuous grid current of 25 A (per phase), the inverter has excellent overload capability and can feed up to 18 kW power into the grid at a nominal grid voltage of 415 V.
For remote monitoring, both WiFi and GSM have been integrated into all the inverters. End customers can remotely monitor the solar energy generation using the company’s mobile application, Pyramid Solar, which is available for both Android and IOS versions.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/31/novel-battery-chemistry-for-zinc-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 31, 2021",Novel battery chemistry for zinc-ion batteries,"From pv magazine International
Among the many different materials and battery chemistries under investigation to fulfill our growing need for energy storage in various applications, zinc-ion has lagged behind others due to challenges in controlling side reactions that both limit reversible charging at the anode, and cause the cathode to fall apart.
Zinc-ion, however, still has the potential for good energy storage performance out of cheap, abundant materials. And at industrial level, could potentially use many of the manufacturing processes already developed for lithium-ion batteries – making them far easier than other materials to scale up. This has been enough to keep scientists interested in working on zinc-ion battery chemistry, and the latest discovery from a group led by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia (KAUST), could open up several new doorways for them.
Since a lot of these challenges stem from side reactions involving water-based electrolytes, the group worked with a very high salt concentration, limiting the number of ‘free’ water molecules available to the unwanted reactions. The group designed an electrolyte based on zinc salts mixed with a highly concentrated sodium salt, which serves to both suppress reactions with water and increase conductivity, since the mixed electrolyte dissolved more readily than the zinc-salt by itself. “The supporting salt of NaClO4 can efficiently adjust the solvation structure and electronic states of the electrolyte upon increasing the concentrations,” the group explains. “Therefore, the highly concentrated electrolyte shows the scarcity of free water molecules, low viscosity, and high ionic conductivity, which can efficiently prohibit the dissolution of the NVO cathode to enable remarkable cycling stability and high rate performance.”
One problem with such electrolytes has been finding suitable cathode materials to work with them, and that can be fabricated cost-effectively. The group worked with a sodium-vanadate material, made using a dissolution-crystallization process at room temperature, and found this showed strong performance in combination with the electrolyte. “The nanofiber morphology enhances ion diffusion, which ensures faster charge and discharge rates of the aqueous Zn-ion batteries,” said Husam Alshareef, who leads the research group at KAUST. “This combination of electrode and electrolyte potentially solves the shortcomings of conventional aqueous Zn-ion batteries.”
The battery is described in the paper Concentrated dual-cation electrolyte strategy for aqueous zinc-ion batteries, published in Energy and Environmental Science. The group notes that previous ‘water in salt’ electrolytes have often relied on toxic substances, and that it has shown that sodium alone can actually show better ionic conductivity than these, as well as lower cost and reduced toxicity. They also note that in analyzing the battery’s performance they discovered a new interphase forming at the anode, which promotes uniform, reversible deposition of the zinc ions as the battery cycles.
With further investigation, the group is confident this battery chemistry could be attractive, at least for stationary storage applications where size/weight is not a pressing concern. “The fundamental understanding and the experimental demonstrations of reversible battery chemistry using a bi-cation electrolyte strategy open a viable route to developing aqueous batteries for emerging electrochemical energy storage applications,” they conclude.
