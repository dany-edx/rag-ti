The plant shall come up BCCL’s Bhojudih Coal Washery in Purulia District of West Bengal.
The work scope includes design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing and commissioning of the plant, and operation and maintenance for five years.
The project completion period is nine months.
To be eligible, the bidder must have executed, as an EPC contractor or developer, a cumulative grid-connected solar capacity of a minimum 13 MW (AC) in the last seven financial years, including at least two projects having an individual capacity of 3 MW (AC). Such grid-connected capacity must have been in satisfactory operation for at least six months before the last date of bid submission.
Further, the bidder must have an average annual turnover of a minimum INR 47.10 crore in the last three financial years (FY 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20) and a positive net worth for the last financial year.

Tesla has come a step closer to a more comprehensive ecosystem by launching a proprietary solar inverter.
In the last years, multiple inverter companies have ventured into electric vehicle (EV) charging and expanded the power electronic ecosystem, repeatedly emphasizing the inverter’s importance at the center of the system. Tesla has gone the other way. Starting with EVs, the carmaker penetrated the residential solar market with panels and batteries but only now has brought an inverter to market.
The product – the Tesla Solar Inverter – comes in 3.8 kW and 7.6 kW versions featuring two and four maximum power point trackers (MPPTs), respectively.

The latest deal follows Total’s renewable arm acquiring half the stake in Adani Green’s 2.3 GW operational PV portfolio in India.
The investment in Adani Green Energy is another step in the strategic alliance between Adani Group and Total, a partner in Adani’s natural gas business.
“This is in line with the commitment of both Adani and Total to be leading participants in the sustainable economy of the future and help India in its quest for the development of renewable energy,” read a statement issued by Adani. 
In 2018, Total embarked on the energy partnership with Adani by investing in Adani Gas Limited, city gas distribution business, associated LNG terminal business and gas marketing business. 
During this partnership development, Total and Adani also agreed to continue this alliance into the wider sustainable energy space. Total and Adani agreed to the acquisition of a 50% stake in a 2.35 GWac portfolio of operating solar assets owned by AGEL and a 20% stake in AGEL for a global investment of US$ 2.5 billion.
Speaking on occasion, Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani said, “We are delighted to deepen our strategic alliance with Total, a global energy major, and welcome them as a significant shareholder in Adani Green Energy Limited. We have a shared vision of developing renewable power at affordable prices to enable a sustainable energy transformation in India. We look forward to working together towards delivering India’s vision for 450 GW renewable energy by 2030.”
Total SE CEO, Patrick Pouyanné said, “Our entry into AGEL is a major milestone in our strategy in the renewable energy business in India put in place by both parties, which began with our first joint venture for 2.3GW of renewable capacity. Given the size of the market, India is the right place to put into action/to deploy our energy transition strategy based on two pillars: renewables and natural gas.” 
Adani Green Energy, started in 2015 with the world’s largest single-location solar power project (648 MW) in Kamuthi, Tamil Nadu, today has over 14.6 GW of contracted renewable capacity, with an operating capacity of 3 GW and another 3 GW under construction and 8.6 GW under development. The company aims to achieve 25 GW of renewable power generation by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/18/the-case-for-combining-floating-solar-pv-with-hydroelectric-power-plants/,"FLOATING SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 18, 2021",The case for floating PV on hydroelectric facilities,"A report has concluded combining floating solar with hydroelectric power plants increases power generation from the latter by reducing evaporation. 
The Investigation on floating photovoltaic covering system in rural Indian reservoir to minimize evaporation loss paper, by R Nagavinothini of Italy’s University of Naples and independent researcher R Nagananthini, set out to estimate the power generation gains and water saving potential of floating solar on reservoirs. The study then went on to consider the further generation gains available from the associated hydropower facilities.
The authors of the paper chose the 6 MW Vaiga dam reservoir in Tamil Nadu as their test case and modeled various iterations of a 1.14 MW generation-capacity floating PV array across 30% – 11.53km2 – of the body of water.
The modeling indicated such a pontoon-based system could reduce evaporation from the reservoir by up to 42,731.56m3 per year. That would add up to 6.06 MWh more hydropower output per year, according to the paper, which was published in the International Journal of Sustainable Energy.
The floating PV system modeled would be 35% more costly than a conventional, land-based solar plant of the same scale, according to the study, but that figure would be compensated by the nearby grid infrastructure offered by the hydropower facility.
With the researchers modeling floating arrays with various tilt angles, orientation and tracking mechanisms, it was found 1,787 pontoons could host 3,574 polycrystalline silicon PV panels at a $0.82/Wp premium over the expense of a land-based solar farm.
“The additional cost of $0.82/Wp generated by the floating bed installation of the FPV [floating PV] system can be compensated [for by] the cost of buying and leveling of large hectares of land in … ground-mounted PV. Besides, FPV, coupled with HEPP [hydroelectric power plants], also eliminates the need for grid connection,” said the researchers.
The results indicated the floating PV system would also eliminate 44,734.62 tons of CO2 emissions.
