The Summit was organized by Solar Association (with Kamal Marwah as president for Delhi NCR) in association with inverter manufacturer Solis. International Solar Alliance advisor KS Popli was also a chief guest at the event.
Jagdale told the solar PV industry stakeholders gathering that the nation has already reached 100 GW of purely renewable energy capacity, which is mostly wind and solar. And if hydro is added, the capacity is almost close to 150 GW. The Indian RE capacity grew at a compound annual growth rate of 16-17% over seven years from 2014 onwards. If the nation maintains this annual growth rate, it shall reach the 450 GW target.
The ministry, including those in policy-making, are doing their best to create a conducive environment to attract investments in the renewable energy sector of India. “With the stakeholder consultation, which we believe is the right way to go forward, we all will be able to bring in more and more innovative ideas to bring the kind of support system that is required to facilitate and mitigate the risk around the RE investments in India,” said Jagdale. 
India is gearing to ramp up solar equipment manufacturing to meet the demand that accompanies the solar power capacity expansion. 
“The PLI Scheme response for setting up close to 55 GW solar capacity gives us the confidence that India too can become a leader in the global solar equipment supply chain,” said Jagdale.
The Summit saw Solis, a leading inverter supplier for the Indian rooftop solar market, launch its updated SolisCloud and the Solis off-grid hybrid inverter. The SolisCloud offers all the functions of the Solis Home/Pro app that lets plant owners remotely monitor their PV plant and review real-time generation, while adding fresh new functions for organization management, IV curve scanning, dispersion rate analysis, warranty inquiry, etc. All of this on an all-new interface that is both user-friendly and easy to understand. 
The Solis off-grid hybrid inverter will be available in four versions of 4-5kW, with a 48V battery provided in the standard version. With an ability to be completely off-grid as well as on-grid while using grid power only as a backup, the hybrid inverters will fill a key market need for a quality product in the emerging segment. 
Compatible with both lead-acid and lithium batteries, these inverters can handle surge current between 60A to 80A depending on the model, and surge capacity between 8kVA and 10kVA.

Justin Lemmon: We have three primary business lines. One is first-life battery packs, where we make batteries with new cells. Two, second-life battery packs, where we take used cells and then refurbish them into new batteries. Then our third line is for the batteries that have no useful life left in them. There we recycle the batteries so that all those battery materials and chemicals can then be reused into new cells going forward. 
We are essentially trying to create a circular loop for the battery supply chain wherein we do everything except for the cells.
Currently, we operate two co-located factories of 200 MWh for manufacturing Lithium-ion batteries, and 300 MWh for recycling the batteries. We plan a 3 GWh integrated lithium-ion factory for the next phase of our expansion as we see tremendous growth on all our business lines, not only in India but from our customers abroad as well. Out of this 3 GWh, 1 GWh will be allocated to manufacturing of first-life and second-life batteries, and 2 GWh to recycling. With several locations being considered, it will be India’s single largest, single-location Li-ion battery manufacturing and recycling factory. In addition, we will use our facilities in India as the blueprint for our US facility in 2022.
What’s the business and consumer case for second-life batteries? 
One obstacle to electrification, particularly in developing economies, is cost. The second thing is very complex supply chains as far as battery materials are concerned. The supply chain adds economic and strategic cost due to the importance of the raw materials that are only available and refined in a few places globally. So, if you look at our technology, we’re trying to solve both of those challenges. 
Essentially, we are lowering the cost of the battery. Most of the batteries can last much, much longer than their anticipated life. Let’s say the battery in a four-wheeler EV, or even a stationary application, lasts for 8 to 10 years in its first life. At that point, the battery can either be re-used or recycled. We can take that battery [at the end of life] after its first application, test the battery to meet our safety, performance, and warranty requirements, and move it to a new [low-power] application wherein it could last for at least another three years. That obviously provides a power solution but at a much lower cost. 
Whatever is coming in, whether from a vehicle or a stationary application, we’re able to test it and determine its best application. One fortunate thing going for India is that it has essentially the largest low-power mobility market in the world, from a two-wheeler and three-wheeler combination standpoint. And it will grow significantly over the coming years. That is unlike any other market in the world outside of maybe China. So, if you compare that to the US, it has lots of [electric] cars [on the road], but not much of a low-power [mobility] market. 
It’s not only the low-power mobility applications that present huge gigawatt-hour markets in India. Most of the stationary side applications, whether the residential storage, mini-grid, or other power backup solutions, are also low-power applications.
From the performance standpoint [of second-life batteries], we have been doing second-life batteries for almost three years. At this point, on the mobility side, we have collected almost 2,000,000 miles of operational performance data from these batteries and that’s so that we can continue to test the performance of a particular cell and module in that application and refine [our process] to find the best solution.
We are seeing that at least 50% – 60% of the batteries coming out of EVs or stationary applications like mobile towers are still usable for different applications—say, in a low-power application for at least another three years. And that creates a market dynamic that doesn’t exist in other geographies.
The idea is to create a battery that meets all the performance requirements for a particular application, lasts at least three years, but costs 30% less than a new battery. And that’s a real game-changer. If we can solve for cost, developing countries stand to gain significantly more from battery power than developed countries.

What all battery chemistries will your facility be equipped to recycle? What recycling method will it use? 
On the material side, we’re solving the supply challenge through recycling. As I mentioned before, our recycling technology can recover all of the materials in a battery, both on the cathode and the anode side. From a design standpoint, we recycle every chemistry, every form factor. If you have good enough recycling technology you can recycle the materials in both the cathode and the anode. This capability enables you to produce all the materials and the chemicals in a battery composition that can be then sold back into the battery cell supply chain. 
Talking about the recycling process, think about it in two building blocks. One is mechanical separation. Here, essentially the used battery gets shredded. And then the electrode material is separated from the rest of the materials such as steel and plastics. The electrode material is considered black mass, and that’s where all the cobalt, lithium, manganese, graphite, and other valuable battery chemicals reside. 
The next phase of our recycling process is hydrometallurgy. It involves a series of steps, where we use a low-power chemical process at almost room temperature. 
The process is capable of 95% yield. And then on the output side, the composition is individually separated chemicals like cobalt, lithium, nickel, manganese, and graphite, which are all battery grade. 
In India, lithium ferro phosphate (LFP) batteries are predominantly used. What will be your preferences in recycling? 
There’s going to be a lot of LFP batteries coming through the pipeline, but I think the issue is just that it’s not super valuable at this stage—and so, people haven’t focused on it too much at all. At this point, there’s tons of additional volume where you have nickel chemistries and that will be the high focus area for the foreseeable future. We do recycle LFP batteries and conduct continuous R&D to continually improve the recovery process since they will be an increasing source of feedstock.
Do you intend to supply the recovered chemicals/materials to other battery manufacturers too? 
We already sell material to battery manufacturers and the volumes will only increase over time. Our goal is to become the largest producer of battery materials in India and other major global geographies drawing on our capability and capacity to recycle. India lacks many of the key materials required for battery manufacturing. So, the best way in the near term for India is to generate raw materials through recycling. 
The battery chemistries are still evolving. Does that mean uncertainty in terms of securing the entire supply chain for raw materials?
Until there’s a major leap in battery chemistry, which is probably five to seven years away, you’re going to need lithium, nickel, cobalt, and also graphite for sure. India only has graphite. All the mobility applications are at this point mostly high nickel content. 
While the manufacturers are continuing to lower the percentage of cobalt in the cells, it’s going to be hard to get away from it altogether as you have to have cobalt from a safety standpoint for high-energy-dense applications. LFP is, however, showing a lot of promise for certain ranges/energy density due to innovation and will be introduced in more applications. Lastly, as for graphite, India does have graphite but the challenge is it doesn’t have a refining capability for graphite. For graphite to be used in a battery, it has to be super high purity (99.9% and above). And the most important, and also the most difficult part is it has to be shaped, spheronized, and coated to make it suitable for battery manufacturing. That refining process right now exists pretty much only in China. So, in addition to producing battery raw materials through recycling, there is an opportunity for India in terms of adding that refining capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/12/solar-and-wind-power-procurement-options-for-commercial-and-industrial-consumers/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",Solar and wind power procurement options for commercial and industrial consumers,"For commercial and industrial (C&I) businesses, electricity consumption accounts for 30%–40% of operational expenditures. Solar power prices have dropped dramatically over the years, so it makes sense for businesses to go solar to save money and stay afloat in these difficult times. Solar energy would significantly lower the running expenses of businesses. The last several months have witnessed a surge in demand for rooftop solar systems from the C&I sector. These projects can assist firms in saving enough money to stay afloat while also generating revenue. 
According to a recent study by Mercom India, C&I customers accounted for almost 96 percent of rooftop installations in the third quarter of 2021. The country’s whole commercial section has installed 1.9 GW of projects, while the industrial sector has added 1.5 GW. The rooftop solar systems help meet 20% to 50% of the electricity demands of the facilities they are installed on, while acquiring power through the open access route (off-site solar plants) may help to meet up to 70% of the consumer’s electricity needs.
Solar rooftop is the most cost-effective and environment-friendly energy source for C&I customers. Consumers in the C&I sectors are now much more open to rooftop solar projects as a way to save money on electricity, and agreements are closing considerably faster. They actively negotiate the pricing and other commercial components of the projects.  
C&I users, sometimes known as corporations, account for 64% of global power usage. Electricity accounts for a significant portion of running costs for both industrial and commercial customers, such as production units, data centers, and shopping malls. These customers are continuously on the lookout for methods to cut their huge power bills. 
A company’s various sustainability objectives would influence its various electricity buying alternatives available:
DISCOMs (electricity distribution companies). This is the most common and conventional way. The DISCOMs serve as a link between the generator and the end-users. Due to their broad reach and backing from local legislation, DISCOMs are the provider of last resort, and their pricing may not be the most competitive.
Open access. Consumers can use the DISCOMs’ transmission and distribution infrastructure to obtain power from an off-site producing facility. The DISCOM provides non-discriminatory access to its infrastructure under this arrangement. Charges and regulations apply to the usage of power in this situation. This model is divided into two sections:
• Wholesale market. The wholesale market operates on a market platform that brings together many buyers and sellers to purchase and sell energy at market-determined prices depending on demand and supply. However, most of the agreements made in this market are just for a limited period.
• Bilateral market. In contrast to the wholesale market, the buyer and seller might agree to a mid-term to a long-term contract on a mutually agreed basis in the bilateral market.
The notion of power purchase through an off-site producing facility was first introduced in India in 2003 when Section 2 (42) of the Electricity Act 2003 was amended to include “Open Access.” The Open Access market has since been opened up by a succession of regulatory directives and the creation of the exchange market. Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) was created under the National Action Plan for Climate Change to reflect India’s commitment to combating climate change (NAPCC). DISCOMs and corporations buying electricity from outside the DISCOM’s network (through open access to behind-the-meter captive plants) were required to use as much renewable energy as possible.
With the emergence of the Open Access market, wind power facilities began to become cost-competitive with conventional plants. Solar rates were substantially higher, and they were unable to draw considerable attention on their own. To make solar projects bankable, the bilateral market created an exchange-tradable Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) method to recuperate the cost disparity. Due to the significant cost disparity and inadequate RPO execution, the REC market died. 
Solar, like wind, has evolved into a more viable bilateral arrangement business model as prices have decreased and favorable legislation has emerged. Due to significant technical advancements, the solar industry has overtaken wind and has emerged as the favored option.
In the open-access market, a new trend is emerging in the shape of an exchange-based business model, similar to what is seen in developed markets. The exchange’s market-clearing fees are more appealing than those found in competitive bids and yet lower than the average pooled purchase cost (APPC). In India, the market-clearing price in the green term ahead market (GTAM) is INR 0.30-0.40/kWh more than in the day-ahead market (DAM).
During the early stages of the open-access market’s growth, the debt financing environment was comparable to that of the DISCOM power purchase agreement. Because the regulatory environment is continuously changing, tapping into this sector necessitates a thorough grasp of the industry. The fact that private-sector specialist Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have subject expertise and stronger monitoring mechanisms in place, is the primary reason for their success in the open access category. As the industry matures, more bank engagement, as well as the advent of new financial products, will boost debt financing in this area even further.
The expansion of the Open Access renewable market has been stifled to date due to persistent regulatory uncertainty, the declining financial condition of DISCOMs and their reliance on compact secondary substation (CSS), and variable banking arrangements laws. These developments can be achieved in the future. Because of the hostile stance taken by state-level DISCOMs, the open-access sector is still in its infancy. The proposed amendments to the Electricity Act currently include some improvements targeted at transforming the struggling distribution industry. It would also usher in the necessary reorganization to promote the open access market.

Oversizing renewable capacity and adding long-term storage are not the only ways to match renewable generation with electricity demand on a seasonal basis, according to a recent study by two researchers at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Their model showed that reducing average building energy usage by about 60% would be key to achieving the least-cost 100% renewable grid with building electrification. The cost-optimal amount of building energy savings ranged from 52% to 68% across five selected climate zones in the United States.
For each climate zone, the model also found the cost-optimal levels of renewable capacity, allowing for oversizing, as well as long-term storage capacity and battery capacity. The model also chose an optimal mix of solar and wind generation, based on solar costs of $1,900 to $2,500 per kilowatt, wind power costs of $1,400 to $1,900 per kilowatt, and transmission costs.
Optimal oversizing of renewable capacity to handle year-round energy needs would be 3.2 times annual electricity demand in a climate zone stretching from Kansas to New York, the model showed. Solar in this case would contribute 15% of total renewable capacity with wind contributing 85%. Oversizing renewable capacity is associated with curtailment during mild seasons.
In a climate zone from Texas to Florida, optimal oversizing of solar would be 1.4 times annual demand, with solar providing all renewable capacity.
The study modeled long-term storage as being hydrogen storage in caverns, and using fuel cells to convert the hydrogen back to electricity. It used a capital cost of $161/kWh capacity. Optimal long-term storage capacity in each climate zone, measured in kilowatt-hours, ranged from 1 to 5 times annual average daily kWh consumption.
The authors said that most long-duration storage technologies “are either geologically constrained or still underdeveloped.”
Costs of a building’s energy efficiency improvements were based on case study data points found through a literature search. The authors reported those results as being “robust:” if the actual costs were 50% lower or higher, then changes in the optimal amount of energy efficiency would be within 5% of the reported results. Battery storage was modeled based on a capital cost of $380/kWh. Optimal battery storage capacity in each climate zone, measured in kilowatt-hours, ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 times annual average daily consumption.
The study also assessed the technical potential of buildings’ load flexibility, such as flexible air conditioning control, and building-sited thermal storage either in ice or in high-temperature ceramic brick. Load flexibility associated with such measures had the technical potential of reducing daily storage requirements by anywhere from 37% to 81%.
The authors said that many U.S. states, cities, and municipalities are developing plans to shift to 100% renewable energy.
The study, titled “Optimal strategies for a cost-effective and reliable 100% renewable electric grid,” was conducted by Sammy Houssainy and William Livingood, both with NREL.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/12/us-commerce-department-throws-out-anti-dumping-petitions/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 12, 2021",US Commerce Department throws out anti-dumping petitions,"From pv magazine International
The U.S. Department of Commerce tossed out a request by an anonymous group of solar companies that sought what could have been crippling tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The dismissal is a win for the Solar Energy Industries Association, which vigorously opposed the request by American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC) for anti-dumping and anti-circumvention (AD-CVD) tariffs. In a statement, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper called the decision to reject the petitions a “major victory for America’s 231,000 solar workers.”
She said the Commerce Department’s decision “provides a rush of certainty for companies to keep their investments moving, hire more workers and deploy more clean energy. This is a critical time for climate progress, and we cannot afford to go backwards at a time when we need to be deploying more clean energy than ever.”
A-SMACC filed a series of petitions in mid August seeking a Commerce Department investigation into its allegations that module imports from the three countries represented an attempt by the companies to skirt existing U.S. rules against dumping.
In an email to pv magazine, Timothy Brightbill, attorney for A-SMACC, said the group was reviewing the Commerce Department decision and offered no further comment.
In a November 10 decision, Abdelali Elouaradia, director of the Commerce Department’s AD-CVD office, said that A-SMACC’s insistence to keep the names of its member companies from the public would “prevent Commerce from obtaining and considering” information related to an inquiry.
Elouaradia wrote that “not disclosing A-SMACC members’ names publicly hampers interested parties from fully commenting on the requests for circumvention inquiries and may hamper them from commenting on certain issues that could arise if Commerce were to initiate circumvention inquiries.”
The letter gave A-SMACC until November 12 to publicly identify its members. Failing that, one or more of the member companies could file a separate petition, thus identifying themselves.
The Energy Information Administration’s 2020 Annual Solar Photovoltaic Module Shipments Report, released on July 30, said that solar PV imports to the U.S. totaled just under 19.3 million peak kilowatts, and exports totaled 376,483 peak kilowatts.
The EIA report listed Vietnam as the top source of PV imports to the U.S. at 8.1 million peak kilowatts. South Korea and Thailand combined were second at 4.4 million peak kilowatts, and Malaysia was third at 3.2 million peak kilowatts. The report lumped together imports from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, which totaled less than 950,000 peak kilowatts.
U.S. solar panel imports fell 27% during the third quarter, the largest single-quarter drop since 2018, according to research firm Panjiva, with analysis provided by by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
In addition to being down compared to the second quarter, total module shipments were also down 11%, compared to the same period in 2020, according to S&P. Trade tensions between Washington, D.C. and Beijing contributed to the double-digit declines.
The original AD and CVD investigations on imports of crystalline silicon PV cells were launched in November 2011. The U.S. International Trade Commission separately determined that U.S. producers were being materially hurt by the imports, and the Commerce Department in December 2012 imposed import tariffs. In 2019, the Department extended both import tariff orders.
The current antidumping China-wide rate is 238.95%. Certain Canadian Solar companies and certain JinkoSolar companies received 95.50% AD rates in the last completed review. Certain Trina Solar companies received a 92.52% AD rate, also in the last completed review. The countervailing duty “all others” rate is 15.24%, although certain Canadian Solar, Trina Solar, and Jinko Solar companies received a 11.97% CVD rate in the last completed review.
In their petition, the U.S. companies complain that after AD/CVD duties were imposed on Chinese-origin solar cells, Chinese integrated producers started building cell and module assembly plants across Southeast Asia, while continuing “to rely heavily” on Chinese labor, raw materials, and inputs.
