“With a deteriorating market environment in Europe, continuing with full-scale European solar manufacturing is not sustainable for the time being,” the company said in a statement. “Part of the plan would unfortunately be the closure of one of Europe’s largest operational solar module production sites in Freiberg, Germany, as early as beginning of April 2024, affecting approximately 500 people.”
The company said that it will make a final decision by the end of February, leaving the door open to rethink its plan if “sufficient measures to create a level playing field in Europe, such as a resilience-reward scheme,” are put into place.
Meyer Burger said that cell production at its factory in Talheim, Germany, will support module production at its 2 GW factory currently under construction in the United States.
“The R&D sites in Switzerland and Germany would not be affected by these measures and continue to develop and produce technology and equipment to support Meyer Burger’s business outside Europe,” it said.
“In the US, we can take full advantage of our leading technology position, resulting in substantial interest by partners and supported by favorable industry policies,” said Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt. “The expansion of the U.S. business is currently proceeding as planned with the ramp-up of our solar module production site in Goodyear, expected to start in the second quarter of 2024.”
By combining US module and cell manufacturing, Meyer Burger will benefit from the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit 45X system, which is a component of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Prior to this announcement, Meyer Burger was targeting around 3 GW of new annual production capacity in Germany by the end of 2024, including 1.4 GW of module production capacity in Freiberg. It also currently plans to build a 3.5 GW solar cell and module factory at an unspecified location in Spain.

The mismatch of energy supply and demand, depicted in Fig. 1, outlines the challenges ahead for energy generation and demand. Crucial changes in the way we generate and consume energy are inevitable.
Source: https://life.llnl.gov/why_life/index.php
For a sustainable future, one must decide on energy resources following the criterion of naturally replenishable, least waste generation, good energy efficiency, and eco-clean technology with the least effect on the environment towards climate change.
The prime renewable energy technologies are solar cells, offshore and onshore wind turbines, solar power plants, hydroelectric plants, tidal power, and geothermal plants. The water, wind, and solar energy-based renewable energy systems are also known as wind-water-solar (WWS) technologies. Retrieval of most renewable energy sources is possible within human time scales.
Except for tidal and geothermal plants, all others are derived directly or indirectly from solar energy. Out of these technologies, the hydroelectric system is the most efficient (Energy efficiency: 90-95%). Wind turbines and solar cells have energy efficiency of 30-50% and 15-25%, respectively.
Nuclear energy and biomass are other renewable energy-generation technologies. However, they are not considered clean. Nuclear power plants may contribute significantly to energy generation. However, the pollution from mining and refining nuclear resources, radioactive waste, and the risk of radioactive accidents limit its applications.
In short, we must choose a technology that can produce enough sustainable energy without harming the environment. The physical mechanisms of these technologies are based on well-established concepts and provide a basis for evaluating potential energy sources and energy-use technologies. A quantitative assessment based on such knowledge will enable us to identify what is impractical or impossible.
Renewable energy technologies are categorized based on the continuity of energy availability. River-based hydropower and geothermal plants are considered continuous. Stored hydropower plants are in the available on-demand category.
On the other hand, solar energy and wind turbine electric technologies are termed stochastic systems due to their intermittent nature. Solar and wind plants only produce electricity while the sun shines and there is a breeze, respectively. The problems associated with the intermittent electricity generation from these resources pose challenges, but viable solutions are already in practice.
Intermittent renewable electricity sources are not compatible with the conventional operation of the electric grid. To address this issue, an approach involving a combination of solar and wind energy systems has the potential to stabilize the grid operation. We may realize it effectively by combining solar and wind energy from different locations. Combining renewable energy distant facilities is a practical solution to compensate for the power deficit intermittently generated at a particular location. For example, wind turbines from coastal waters may help compensate for the spikes in electricity demand at far-away locations.
Alternatively, the stability of the power grid is achievable with the help of electricity storage technology involving batteries. The development of efficient energy storage systems and the decline in the cost of energy storage devices enhance the potential of this approach for stabilizing renewable electric grid operation.
Today, the biggest question related to the transition from the conventional practice of electricity generation to 100% eco-clean renewable energy resources is, can we maintain the electricity grid stable every minute of every day? The answer is clearly YES, and it is practical.
According to a 2018 report by the International Renewable Energy Association (IREA), more than ten countries generate 90-100% of electricity for their usage from renewable resources. Albania, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Iceland, Namibia, Nepal, Norway, Paraguay, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo produced 97.5 to 100% of all their electricity from renewable resources. For most of these countries, the dominant renewable energy source is hydropower.
The viability of electric grid operation with 100% WWS-energy resources is studied, and its worldwide stability is achievable. The transition from traditional electricity generation practices also involves efficient energy usage to maximize sustainability.
Examples of efficient energy-usage practices are switching to low-power operating devices, the realization of insulating buildings, electrification of mobility, encouraging responsible use of electricity to minimize losses, etc.
In addition to reduced environmental impacts, the transition to 100% WWS-energy resources offers incentives like reduced energy needs, better energy-access equality, and fewer pollution-related diseases.
According to a recent estimate, in the USA, a 100% WWS-renewable energy transition by 2050 would reduce energy needs by 57%, energy costs by 63%, and energy plus health plus climate costs by 86% compared with a business-as-usual scenario.
The scenario of transition from traditional energy resources to renewable energy for electricity generation is quite encouraging. In India, renewable energy installation has increased 1.48 times to 172 GW in the last five years (2018-2023). Globally, India ranks fourth in installed renewable energy capacity, as reported in Renewable Energy Statistics 2023, released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
All-inclusive, the world is heading towards significant changes in energy-generating techniques and energy usage. This transition from traditional fossil fuel to renewable energy-based electricity generation practices is practical and achievable. To live in a better world, we must adopt a 100% transition to WWS-energy resources as rapidly as possible.

The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is the first for Amazon and is producing hydrogen to fuel more than 225 hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklift trucks at the site. The hydrogen will be compressed on site and will be stored in a gaseous hydrogen storage tank. Plug Power has collaborated with Amazon to deploy more than 17,000 fuel cells to replace batteries in forklifts in more than 80 fulfilment centers in North America. “For most of these locations, hydrogen to power the forklifts is produced elsewhere, liquified, and delivered by trucks to an on-site storage and dispensing system,” said Plug Power.
Torrent Power will set up a 100 ktpa green hydrogen/green ammonia production facility in Banaskantha/Dahej district of the Indian state of Gujarat with a proposed investment of INR 7,200 crore ($866.4 million).
Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL) from Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) is developing end-to-end solutions to produce globally competitive green hydrogen and its associated sustainable derivatives. Its first project of 1 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) green hydrogen is being implemented in phases in Gujarat. The initial phase is expected to start production by FY2027. Depending on the market conditions, ANIL aims to increase capacity to up to 3 MMTPA of green hydrogen in the next ten years, with an investment of about $50 billion.
The US government has announced $623 million in grants to build electric-vehicle (EV) charging networks and hydrogen fueling infrastructure in urban and rural communities across the United States. In particular, it will allocate $70 million to build up to five hydrogen fueling stations for medium- and heavy-duty freight trucks in Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio. “The project will help create a hydrogen corridor from southern California to Texas,” said the US Department of Transportation. 
Hexagon Purus has raised approximately NOK 1 billion ($95.7 million) from strategic investors Mitsui and Hy24. “The proceeds will support Hexagon Purus’s growth strategy, including its ongoing global capacity expansion program,” said the Norwegian company. The five new production facilities are in the US state of Maryland, the Canadian province of British Columbia, Germany, and China. In addition, the company plans to open a new site in Dallas, Texas, in 2024.
H2 Energy Europe has secured environmental approval for a large-scale green hydrogen production facility in Esbjerg, Denmark. “This achievement marks a significant milestone for the project, bringing it closer to a Final Investment Decision (FID),” said the Zürich-based company, explaining that the pipeline is set for completion by 2028. According to Jesper Frost Rasmussen, the mayor of Esbjerg municipality, the development sends a message to green energy companies, demonstrating that private investors can secure approvals for their projects and are prepared to start construction of large-scale hydrogen facilities. The facility will produce surplus heat, which has the potential to supply the majority of households in Esbjerg with district heating.
ArcelorMittal Bremen and energy service provider EWE have signed a letter of intent to jointly develop hydrogen production projects for green steel manufacturing. In April 2023, ArcelorMittal Bremen, EWE, and a subsidiary of EWE, SWB, started working on a 10 MW hydrogen production plant in Bremen, Germany, which is due to go into operation this year. “We want to use hydrogen instead of coal as a chemical reducing agent and thus further reduce CO2 emissions towards net zero,” said Frank Hohlweg, chief operating officer for ArcelorMittal Bremen. “Until green hydrogen is available in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices, we are planning to use natural gas in the transition phase.”
The German state of Saxony and the Czech Republic have signed a letter of intent to cooperate on the development of a hydrogen infrastructure and the use of hydrogen. “The plans include the establishment of a cross-border hydrogen network and the promotion of cooperation and exchange between German and Czech research institutions and companies,” said the government of Saxony. The two countries have agreed to convert existing natural gas pipelines to hydrogen. “This should ensure the supply of large quantities of hydrogen from Eastern and Southern Europe at low cost by 2029, if possible.” Poland, as an important trading partner, is likely to engage in new hydrogen projects with Germany, given the Polish government’s new green approach, said Saxony Economics and Transport Minister Martin Dulig.
The Ukrainian government has presented its 2050 Hydrogen Strategy, saying that the move brings the country closer to European energy transition goals. The document includes pilot ideas for the production of renewable hydrogen. “The project was prepared by the experts of the Reform Support Office under the Ministry of Energy with the assistance of the Reform Architecture Fund in Ukraine (ARU Fund), which is financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),” said the Ukrainian government.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/17/red-sea-tensions-set-to-drive-up-solar-module-prices/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,WORLD",,"JANUARY 17, 2024",Red Sea tensions set to drive up solar module prices,"From pv magazine Germany
The prices of solar modules in all technological classes were lowered slightly again at the end of 2023. This is probably the last time this will happen over the long term and only affects in-stock items already in Europe.
PV modules that first have to be shipped or are still traveling by sea are already being offered by many suppliers at prices that are between €0.01 ($0.01)/W and €0.02/W higher. The reason is ongoing tensions in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Houthi militants have been attacking merchant ships there for weeks, preventing them from entering the Red Sea and transiting through the Suez Canal. Many shipping companies will avoid the region – the key trade route between Europe and Asia – until the conflict, which is related to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, is resolved.
The alternative route circles the southern tip of Africa and is about 6,000 kilometers longer. The costs of transporting a container from China to Rotterdam have already almost tripled. The fact that module prices have not risen further is only due to the fact that demand remains somewhat contained at the moment.
In Germany and central and northern Europe, lower demand is mainly due to the ongoing cold wave and the uncertain political situation in some countries. In Poland, for example, the newly elected government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk has not yet become operational due to continuous interruptions and protests by members and supporters of the old government. 
If we look back at the forecasts for 2023, expectations for a drop in PV component prices starting in the second half of the year have been fulfilled. In the case of modules, the price decline has been even faster and more severe than even experts could have imagined. Thanks to the fall in the costs of PV installations, high installation figures were also achieved in the second half, especially in the small installations sector in Germany, although demand had decreased significantly compared to the previous year.
At least in the first three quarters, the backlog that still existed for many installers was cleared. Overall, construction of new PV capacity in Germany increased by almost 100%, from 7.5 GW to more than 14 GW.
Meanwhile, the long-awaited reduction in bureaucracy announced by German politicians, especially for the construction of larger PV parks, has not yet materialized, which has somewhat slowed down new construction in the commercial and utility sectors. The rapid drop in module prices has also caused a wait-and-see attitude, and the completion of some projects has been postponed to the future. There is currently little talk of a bottleneck in the installation market, but old problems could resurface at the end of the year, as soon as the market recovers.
Many offers from last year currently have to be adjusted downwards, as PV components have become cheaper and competition has intensified. Even for small- and medium-sized complete installations, not all excessively high prices should be accepted uncritically and without negotiating the price.
The improvements in favor of an accelerated expansion of renewable energies that the ruling coalition government has long expected in Germany are summarized in the so-called “Solarpaket 1,” which should have been approved at the end of 2023. However, it was postponed until the current year due to the budget debate, with the exception of three new regulations that mainly affect wind energy.
If the amendments to the law as presented are approved at the end of January, capacity will increase. The regulations provide for the granting of the right to lay cables (landowners must grant operators of renewable energy systems a right of way if necessary to be able to lay a connection cable from the system to the connection point to the network), priority will be given to the construction of ground-mounted systems in disadvantaged areas, so that less high-quality arable land has to be used. The category “special solar installations” will include floating PV, photovoltaics on wasteland sites, parking lots, agricultural photovoltaics. Repowering for self-consumption on rooftops will be allowed beyond technical defects or damage to the modules.
With component prices currently at historic lows, this opens up considerable additional sales potential for suppliers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/17/topcon-solar-module-production-costs-now-at-0-16-w-in-china-says-etip-pv/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 17, 2024","TOPCon solar module production costs now at $0.16/W in China, says ETIP PV","The European Technology and Innovation Platform for Photovoltaics (ETIP PV) has analyzed solar module production costs for China, India, the European Union, and the United States, and has found that production in China could currently lead to manufacturing costs ranging from $0.160/W to $0.198/W, depending on the panel technology.
The organization’s experts considered the cost of ownership (CoO) for the production of TOPCon, heterojunction (HJT) and tunnel back contact (TBC) modules. Its assumptions were based on the idea of module manufacturing at a 10 GW integrated PV factory.
“For different PV technologies, we see that there is little difference in the cost of ownership from one technology to another (up to 8,4% between HJT and passivated emitter and rear contact, or PERC), and can largely be explained by different raw materials requirements, notably silver, and different cell production processes for innovative technologies,” the analysts said in their white paper, “PV Manufacturing in Europe: Ensuring resilience through industrial policy.”
For the TOPCon technology, production prices in China might currently range between $0.160/W to $0.189/W. In Europe, prices are likely between $0.243/W and $0.300/W. India and the United States likely have production costs of $0.281/W and $0.195/W, respectively.
According to the report, Chinese manufacturers could currently produce heterojunction panels for between $0.173/W to $0.198/W. The price range for potential European module makers is indicated at between $0.250/W and $0.305/W. Indian and US producers, meanwhile, should achieve prices of $0.209/W and $0.290/W, respectively.
As for TBC technology, ETIP PV said Chinese companies could now produce panels for between $0.162/W and $0.190/W, with the European manufacturers being able to achieve a price range of $0.245/W to $0.303/W. Indian and US manufacturers could likely produce for $0.197/W and $0.284/W, respectively.
Cost variation
The researchers said that price differences between the analyzed regions mainly depend on material and labor costs, as well as equipment and building depreciation costs.
“Material cost differences can represent up to 30% premium, which results from shipment, economies of scale and import taxes in certain countries,” they said. “Labor cost can vary by a factor of eight, while the electricity costs in Europe or the USA can be up to five times higher compared to China.”
They also said that production equipment costs could be 40% higher for Western companies, as these include import duties. “Building costs for a manufacturing plant are around two times higher in Western markets compared to China,” they said.
ETIP PV also provided a summary in its report of all incentive schemes for solar manufacturing in the analyzed regions.
