The company said it bagged the projects within the period starting from April. The installations include ground-mount PV arrays and rooftop solar plants for corporate self-consumption. 
“All these projects are for captive use of the clients and, thus, will cut down their dependence upon the grid and are expected to reduce emissions approximately to the tune of 21,903 metric tonnes (Mt) CO2 annually,” said Gensol.
The projects are set for commissioning within the next six months, said Gensol.
Gensol Engineering Ltd. was incorporated in 2012 is a part of the Gensol group of companies. It offers EPC and solar advisory services. Collectively, Gensol has installed more than 350 MW of ground-mount and rooftop solar capacity so far. It provides consulting services in Kenya, Ukraine, Oman, Gabon, Sierra Leone, Nepal, Afghanistan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Chad.

In one of the highlights of this week’s Smarter E in Munich, Chinese PV inverter manufacturer Solis has taken the wraps off its new off-grid inverter. Designed for areas without power grids or areas with frequent power outages, the S5-EO1P(4-5)K-48 series boasts a peak efficiency of 96.7% and features an AC charger and a built-in MPPT solar charge controller.
“S5-EO1P(4-5)K-48 was first launched in some markets with no power grid or unstable power grid, such as Myanmar, Pakistan, South Africa, and Spain,” the company told pv magazine.  “However, the product will be released and available for any market where there is significant demand.”
The system supports the parallel operation of up to 10 units, to expand capacity up to 50 kW. Depending on the system configuration, the PV inverter comes with a rated output power of 4 kW or 5 kW, and a surge capacity of 8 kVA or 10 kVA.
Based on the application, the system is also configurable in terms of AC and solar input. It has a maximum PV input voltage of up to 500 V, maximum solar charge current of 100 A, and maximum AC charge current of up to 80 A.
With one MPPT channel and maximum two string inputs, the MPPT voltage ranges from 90 V to 480 V.
The device, which also features IP21 enclosures, measures 335 x 450 x 160 mm and weighs in at 14 kg. Its operating ambient temperature ranges from -10 to 60 degrees Celsius.
According to Solis, the inverter can work with or without batteries and it is compatible with all top-tier brands of lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries. Also, S5-EO1P(4-5)K-48 is compatible both with the grid or generators as a backup power source.
The manufacturer provides a standard two-year warranty for its off-grid PV inverter series, as well as online technical support and services of local technical teams in key countries and regions around the world.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/11/vertical-pv-system-for-green-rooftops/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ROOFTOP SOLAR,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 11, 2022",Vertical PV system for green rooftops,"From pv magazine Global
“Our system is specially designed for green roofs in areas where there are strict height limitations to the buildings or where there are limitations to the visual appearance on the roof structure,” CEO  Trygve Mongstad told pv magazine.
The system is based on heterojunction solar cell technology with an efficiency of 22% and a bifaciality of up to 90%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.26 C.
“The mini modules are from our suppliers, we cannot disclose details at the moment, but we are working with suppliers both in Europe and Asia,” said Mongstad. “Currently, we are doing assembly at locations in Norway and Spain, and the units for our pilot installations so far are 100% manufactured in Europe, including the solar panels.” 
Called HM–1 QUATTRO–220S, the system creates a 10 cm distance from the rooftop to the lower edge of the solar panels, which will be suitable for the bulk of green roofs with sedum plants.
“The product is also easy to retrofit on existing green roofs, where there is a total of tens of millions of square meters available, especially in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, but also in Scandinavia and other European countries,” said Mongstad.
The units consist of a mounting system and solar panels in a single pre-assembled piece, which the manufacturer said makes them very fast to mount. The geometry with low-building vertical panels has no or very low need for fastening or ballast, which further simplifies the mounting job. Each unit measures 1,600 mm x 1,510 mm x 350 mm and weighs 24.5 kg. It also features an IP68 enclosure rating and 3.2 mm double-tempered glass.
“The mounting systems are made of aluminum and provide support for each panel, while also tying together the installation as a whole for better wind load performance,” Mongstad said. 
The system is sold with a 12-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty.
“The great benefit for the customer will be that our warranty also includes the mounting system, not only the solar panel,” said Mongstad. “The building owners and building planners we talk to especially appreciate the accessibility to the rooftop for maintenance after mounting, as it is easy to walk around in the installation and move single or multiple units if local maintenance of the roofing membrane below is needed. This comes in addition to the valuable energy production profile, as well as other benefits such as a low roof load of 10 kg/m2.”
The company wants to sell its systems in Europe in 2022 and 2023, with a focus on Scandinavia and northern Europe.
The new product will be on display at booth A4.254 at the Smarter E trade show.
