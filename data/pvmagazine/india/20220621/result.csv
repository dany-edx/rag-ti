Microsoft has ambitious climate goals. The tech firm is committed to being carbon negative by 2030, and by 2050 it plans to have removed all the emissions it has generated since its founding in 1975. To achieve the 2030 goal, the company plans to match 100% of its energy consumption with zero carbon energy purchases. In 2021, Microsoft signed new power purchase agreements (PPA) for 5.8 GW of renewable energy in ten countries, bringing its total to 8 GW procured through PPAs or long-term contracts.
Recently announced is the signing of a long-term renewable energy agreement with Amplus Solar to purchase power from a 100 MW solar project currently being developed in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The deal is part of Microsoft’s plan to source all its electricity to power its operations from renewable sources by 2025, including its data centers, buildings and campuses. The purchased power will likely offset that used by Microsoft Malaysia.
“Today’s announcement builds on our long-standing partnership that now extends into sustainable business transformation,” said K Raman, managing director of Microsoft Malaysia. “This strategic partnership will not only contribute to our own sustainability goals, but it also presents us the opportunity to apply the latest digital technology to support Petronas’ transition to a more sustainable future.”
Amplus is a member of the Petronas Group (Petroliam Nasional Berhad) based in Malaysia. It will work with Microsoft to develop an intelligent platform powered by data and artificial intelligence (AI) to support Petronas’ efforts to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Amplus Solar currently owns and manages a portfolio of 1 GWp+  of operational and under construction distributed solar assets comprising 400+ projects spread over across 24 states in India.
In its 2021 Environmental Sustainability Report, Microsoft noted that business revenue increased by 20% while reducing operational emissions by approximately 17% as a result of the company’s renewable energy purchasing. However, its Scope 3 emissions (comprising the company’s entire value chain) increased in 2021 by about 23% due to the carbon emitted from the generation of electricity needed to power its consumer devices as well as in the production of concrete and steel used in construction. The report points out that during the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a spike in the use of its Xbox and Surface devices, which combined accounted for nearly 30% of its Scope 3 emissions. The company notes that it has programs in place to lower these emissions including investing in carbon removal offsets.
Last month AES and Microsoft announced that the companies had entered into a 20-year agreement under which AES will provide renewable energy to power Microsoft’s California data centers, with AES partially matching the load of Microsoft’s California Data Centers with electricity generated from a portfolio of 110 MW of solar projects and 55 MW/220MWh storage projects, all set to be constructed in California. Four of Microsoft’s data centers are Zero Waste certified, with new certifications announced for data centers in Texas and Washington.

(DVC), has started accepting bids to set up 30 MWac of grid-connected floating solar capacity on raw water reservoirs for DVC thermal power plants.
The capacity will be built at DVC thermal power stations in Jharkhand (6 MW at Koderma) and West Bengal (14 MW at Mejia and 10 MW at Raghunathpur). However, the cumulative amount of 30 MW will be awarded to a single contractor.
The cells and modules for the PV plants must be sourced from manufacturers on the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), which is published by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
The prospective contractor will handle design, engineering, supply, construction, testing, and commissioning. It will also provide comprehensive operation and maintenance services for 10 years after successfully commissioning the plant.

The High Court of Justice of the Spanish region of Extremadura has ruled that land was illegally expropriated to host the nation’s largest operational PV plant, the 500 MW Nuñez de Balboa solar plant in Usagre, near Badajoz. The solar park’s owner, Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, now must dismantle 60% of the facility.
The owner of the property is Natura Manager, which owns 525 hectares of the 854 hectares occupied by the solar park.
“The ruling indicates that the land cannot be expropriated, as it was already leased for a period of 25 years,” the court said. “The request for expropriation lacked cause or justification to deprive the right of property.”
The court added that the company always had the legal title to build the plant, without the need for expropriation.
“And despite this, it carried out all the actions that depended on its will to get the expropriation procedure started, when not there was no justifiable reason for it,” it ruled, noting that it also recognizes the right “to the reinstatement of the farms free of the photovoltaic plant, with all its facilities.”
An Iberdrola spokesperson told pv magazine that the company will file an appeal with the Supreme Court of Spain. It claims that the dispute only involves one of the three owners of the project site.
“Around 50% of this land is owned by two tenants who have not raised any claim at any time and who maintain and respond to the contract signed at the time, initially, by the three owners,” the company said. “The expropriation procedure … followed the legally established procedures and respected all existing rights and guarantees.”
Iberdrola added that the plant was built under a valid and legitimate title, so it does not believe that it should be dismantled. “The facility has all the permits to produce energy and will continue to function normally,” it said.
The Nuñez de Balboa has been generating solar electricity since April 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/21/ev-battery-can-reach-98-charge-in-less-than-10-minutes/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 21, 2022",EV battery can reach 98% charge in less than 10 minutes,"From pv magazine Global
California-based Enovix said that it has demonstrated the ability of electric vehicle battery cells to charge from 0% to 80% capacity in as little as 5.2 minutes, and above 98% charge capacity in less than 10 minutes.
The cells also surpass 1,000 cycles, while retaining 93% of their capacity. These achievements have shattered the US Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) goal of achieving 80% charge in 15 minutes.
Other goals for USABC at the cell level include a usable energy density of 550 Wh/L, a survival temperature range of -40 C to 66 C, and a cost of $75/kWh at an annual output volume of 250,000 units. A full set of USABC targets can be found here.
The company demonstrated the fast-charge ability in its 0.27 Ah EV cells in its silicon lithium-ion batteries, which it said contain a novel 3D architecture and constraint system. The cells contain a 100% active silicon anode. Enovix said the material has long been heralded as an important technology in the next generation of battery anodes.
Silicon anodes can theoretically store more than twice as much lithium than the graphite anode that is used in nearly all Li-ion batteries today (1,800 mAh/cubic centimeter vs. 800 mAh/cubic centimeter).
“Fast charge capability can accelerate mass adoption of EVs and we’ve been able to demonstrate a level of performance that meets and exceeds many OEM roadmaps,” said Harrold Rust, co-founder, CEO and president of Enovix. “EV manufacturers are in pursuit of batteries that support longer range, while the public and private sectors work to increase EV driver access to fast chargers. We’re proud to support these goals to help electrify the automotive industry and demonstrate our batteries are an exciting option to power long-range, fast-charging EVs.”
“Our unique architecture enables a battery that not only charges in less than 10 minutes, but also maintains high cycle life,” said Ashok Lahiri, the CTO of Enovix. “We can improve battery performance today using the same chemistries, but more importantly, we can accelerate the industry’s roadmap.”
Lahiri spoke this week at the 12th International Advanced Automotive Battery Conference (AABC) Europe in Mainz, Germany. His presentation on silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries for EV applications will provide an update on the company’s EV program. The slide deck can be found here.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/21/servotech-tests-solar-monitoring-device-along-with-pv-port-in-germany/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MONITORING AND CONTROL,OFF-GRID SOLAR,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 21, 2022",Servotech tests solar monitoring device along with PV Port in Germany,"Servotech Power Systems has developed a first-of-its-kind solar performance monitoring and controlling device in association with the German Development Agency, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ). This device, dubbed ComPort, has been successfully tested along with the portable solar system PV Port at the EUREF Campus in Berlin, Germany.
ComPort can be integrated into any domestic off-grid/hybrid solar system to turn it into a smart solar system. Specifically built to make users more aware of how well their solar systems are working, this mobile app-controlled device can make available several system insights to their fingertips. The impetus for this innovation comes from various researches that point in the direction of most solar systems turning out to be underperforming.
The Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled ComPort’s intelligent app helps identify defects, issue notifications, diagnose issues, and suggest operation and maintenance (O&M) tasks. Any anomalies or underperformance are recognized proactively with constant monitoring. Thus, ComPort considerably helps lower the chances of a system malfunctioning.
The device can monitor, control, and report input/output voltage, battery charge/discharge, and solar power generation. The app also keeps track of previous results to enable comparison.
The device is developed on the do-it-yourself (DIY) concept and can be easily installed into any domestic solar system. It also offers data interfaces for third-party O&M companies to combine and analyze data.
Servotech developed the PV Port and the Comport under a bilateral Indo-German program implemented by the GIZ. It will contribute to the broader implementation of solar in India and Germany, especially for the urban PV.
