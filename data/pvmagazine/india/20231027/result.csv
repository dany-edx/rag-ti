The project included the establishment of the 400/230 kV, 1000 MVA Karur Pooling Station and an associated transmission line spanning 8.51 circuit kilometers in Tamil Nadu.
“With a transformation capacity of 1,000 MVA, this project will facilitate the evacuation of power from renewable sources in the Karur/Tiruppur Wind Energy Zone. Additionally, it will strengthen the Southern regional grid and support the integration of renewable energy sources on a large scale,” stated AESL.
The Karur/Tiruppur Wind Energy Zone is a key wind corridor in Tamil Nadu, with significant capacities in wind energy and several under-construction wind farms. AESL was awarded this project to ensure the smooth evacuation of up to 2.5 GW of green power produced in the region. This project will provide industrial, commercial, and residential consumers with enhanced access to reliable and clean energy.
AESL secured this project on a build-own-operate-maintain basis through the tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) route in December 2021.
“Despite numerous challenges, AESL executed this project in a fast-track mode, taking into consideration the topological challenges while minimizing ecological impact. Several innovative approaches were employed during the execution, including the use of high-boom RMC machines for concreting work, high-boom lifts and cranes for tower erections, and the implementation of advanced cybersecurity endpoint solutions through the latest SCADA system. The project also involved round-the-clock work in multiple shifts, allowing for enhanced progress. AESL’s execution prowess was displayed through the erection of two 48-MT towers in under 24 hours each, significantly surpassing the usual rate of 5-6 MT/day,” stated AESL.
“Furthermore, AESL successfully completed critical tasks such as the shutdown of the 400 kV D/C Pugalur-Pugalur (HVDC) line and the erection of tower structures under the constraints of the existing transmission line.”

This project is India’s first floating solar installation within a steel power.
The project utilized 19,936 ‘made in India’ Hydrelio aiR 1440 floats, which were carefully installed on the industrial water body. To maximize energy production, Jinergy PV panels were installed in a 4-row configuration with pure south tilt.
The plant comprises two segments, each with an array island capacity of 5.44 MWp, resulting in a cumulative capacity of 10.765 MWp.
The Hydrelio aiR 1440 floats were designed to withstand maximum wind speed as per IS 875 Part III, a crucial factor given the project’s location.
“The Tata Steel Jamshedpur project presented unique challenges right from the start. It is an industrial water body in which the floating solar plant is to be installed, Sub-bottom soil is a sludge accumulation which is a difficult condition for conventional anchoring methods. The expert team at Ciel & Terre India overcame this obstacle with innovative unique Dead Weight Anchoring,” stated Ciel & Terre India.
“Enormous concrete blocks were prepared and deployed in the water to provide stability for the floats, ensuring they remained stationary even in the presence of strong winds and waves. Material selection for such industrial areas with contaminated water is a key factor to withhold the entire system for the next 25 years.”
The project covers a total area of 42 acres, with over 19 acres dedicated to float placement. This installation equates to nearly 45% coverage of the water body, demonstrating efficient space utilization.
Ciel & Terre India already has a portfolio of 260 MWp projects, with a footprint stretching across multiple states, including Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/27/spda-rebrands-to-represent-entire-energy-transition-spectrum/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 27, 2023",SPDA rebrands to represent entire energy transition spectrum,"The Solar Power Developers Association (SPDA), a ten-year-old industry body committed to promoting the renewable energy space, has rebranded itself as Sustainable Projects Developers Association (SPDA). The new brand identity reflects the association’s transition from representing pure-play renewable energy developers to that representing end-to-end solution providers across the decarbonization spectrum.
SPDA [Sustainable Projects Developers Association] has more than 40 member companies across solar, wind, hybrid, battery energy storage systems, green hydrogen, and green ammonia sectors. These member companies include leading RE players. Most of the members are also developing an active pipeline of green hydrogen and green ammonia projects in India. 
Shekhar Dutt, director general of SPDA, and former governor of Chhattisgarh, said, “SPDA aims to provide a neutral platform and become the voice of the companies engaged in energy transition in the country. This new identity will also enable SPDA to expand its global outreach especially in countries where urgent transition towards clean energy is becoming the new mantra for Governments. SPDA will promote offerings across the spectrum that support decarbonization within the context of the future of energy.” 
SPDA has already been leading the representation of emerging decarbonization solutions like green hydrogen and its derivatives, wind, solar, hybrid solutions, energy storage including pumped storage and batteries, carbon markets, solar module manufacturing and electrolyzer manufacturing. Its inputs/suggestions were well received by the government to come up with rules amendments/revisions such as ALMM exemption for projects to be commissioned up to March 31, 2024, commissioning extension for solar projects in bidding guidelines, ISTS charges waiver for green hydrogen and green ammonia, waiver of environmental clearance for green hydrogen and green ammonia, among a host of other key developments. 
The Association looks to deepen further its engagement with policy advocacy, discussions, and consensus building on issues related to the energy transition.
Vineet Mittal, president of SPDA and chairman of Avaada Group, commented, “Round-the-clock renewables, green hydrogen, and its derivatives have emerged as potent alternatives to fossil fuels for advancing accelerated decarbonization across the sectors and geographies. India with its vast potential of renewable energy and skilled manpower is poised to play an important role in fulfilling global demand for green hydrogen and its derivatives.”
“SPDA’s primary goal is to widen the outreach of Indian developers, and represent their interests both in India and abroad in countries where there is demand for green fuels buoyed by their decarbonization targets. In its pursuit, SPDA will leverage its networking capabilities coupled with research-backed representations for effective and transformational policy advocacy.”
Sandeep Kashyap, COO-Ammonia, Acme Group, said, “The new identity not only signifies a commitment to bolstering India’s energy security but also to positioning the nation as a global hub for green energy innovation. We eagerly anticipate working towards our shared mission for a sustainable future.”
Ranjit Gupta, CEO of Ocior Energy, commented “Energy transition stands at the core of climate action and sustainable economic progress. In an ever-evolving sector, the role of SPDA in shaping green energy discussions cannot be overstated. With our commitment to a greener world, we applaud SPDA for its new direction and look forward to fruitful collaboration.”
At the unveiling of the new brand identity, the SPDA member discussed various issues facing the green hydrogen and derivatives market. They highlighted the need for hydrogen and derivative purchase obligations on sectors like fertilizers, transport, and oil refineries to create a domestic market for these products. The members said that similar to the feed-in-tariff (FIT) regime for wind and solar projects in some countries, there can be a fixed pricing mechanism for the offtake of green hydrogen and derivatives from producers. 
Currently, fertilizer industry imports about 2-2.5 million tons of grey ammonia per year. The first target is to replace all the import contracts with domestic green contracts. 
The members said electrolyzer forms a small portion of the overall project costs. While the government provides a subsidy for domestic electrolyzer manufacturing, it also needs to look at supporting states in enhancing their transmission infrastructure substantially. 
Storage is going to be the most critical component in meeting the market demand. Unfortunately, lithium-based battery energy storage and pumped hydro storage are the only techno-commercially feasible options available. And with lithium battery energy storage, there are geopolitical, technical, and other issues.
Pumped hydro storage offers a huge advantage and higher returns than with lithium battery storage. However, only a few players are developing pumped storage projects, and that too for their own consumption. The SPDA members stated they are pushing the government to look at the possibility of development of pumped storage capacities by some private-sector players, just as in the case of the Bhadla solar park, which offers a plug-n-play facility to green hydrogen and derivative producers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/27/usa-peak-energy-to-set-up-domestic-market-for-sodium-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,SODIUM-ION BATERIES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"OCTOBER 27, 2023",USA: Peak Energy to set up domestic market for sodium-ion batteries,"From pv magazine USA
Peak Energy has set out to use cheaper and more abundant raw materials to design sodium-ion battery energy storage systems (BESS). While a sodium-ion BESS is 30% less energy dense than those made from lithium-ion chemistries, they are also about 20% to 40% cheaper, says Landon Mossburg, who co-owns Peak Energy with Cameron Dales.
The United States has 19% of the world’s soda ash, from which sodium is derived. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, six companies in Wyoming and California comprise the US soda ash industry. which is the largest in the world.
Peak Energy sees the ability to scale as another bottleneck. To overcome this challenge, the company is leveraging partnerships with international and domestic sodium cell manufacturers to introduce this technology to the United States, while generating enough income to establish a local engineering site and gigafactory.
“We’ll do this in three phases,” Mossburg said.
Currently ongoing, the first phase involves importing the sodium-ion battery cells from manufacturers based in Asia, Europe and North America while producing packs in the United States. The company plans to launch small-scale demonstration systems early next year with an expected energy capacity and duration of 3 MWh.
“When stacked together, they can create a larger scale utility system,” Mossburg said.
The company will scale these systems to several 100 MWh commercial projects throughout 2026.
Peak Energy is currently testing cells from potential partners to decipher the best technology for US markets. However, Dales suggests their systems will likely consist of a hard carbon anode and a layered oxide, Prussian white or polyanion cathode.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/27/eu-solar-lobby-urges-ban-on-forced-labor-in-solar-products/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,WORLD",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 27, 2023",EU solar lobby urges ban on forced labor in solar products,"The European Commission should develop and implement a legislative package to “enhance the competitiveness” of the continent’s solar manufacturing sector, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) said in a press release this week.
The leading European PV lobby group said that this should include a “ban” on solar products made from “forced labor.”
The ESMC claims to have made the comments in response to the European Commission recently adopting a legislative package that addresses significant challenges in the wind power industry. These issues include insufficient and uncertain demand, slow and complex permits, lack of access to raw materials, the commission explained in a press release. The package includes an initiative set up to expedite projects, auction support and facilitated access to EU financing.
The Brussels-based organization is calling for a three-pronged package to “safeguard” the solar PV manufacturing industry from “existential challenges.” This is caused by “external supply pressures” and the need to meet European manufacturing targets, it said.
The package should also include “emergency measures” to prevent module producers from going bankrupt. This is because some major PV module producers are contemplating “decisive decisions” by the middle of November about the closure of production facilities or relocating their manufacturing to other regions, said the ESMC.
The first measure aims to safeguard the “off-take” of European-produced PV projects. The legislation would reserve a portion of the market for domestic products, with the ESMC estimating the target could start at 10% by 2025. The figure would be ramped up to a goal, for example, 40% or 40 GW of PV manufacturing capacity by 2040.
The second prong would ensure European supply chain “resilience”. The legislative mechanism would be established through yearly benchmarks and “mandatory” guidelines.
The final piece of the package would be the “ban” of solar PV products made with forced labor. “Leverage the existing Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity List to prohibit PV products produced with forced labour in the EU market,” the ESMC said.
“The ongoing legislative proposal in the EU goes in the right direction but even once adopted the implementation could take at least 18 months – we cannot tolerate forced labor in the EU market, and this should be prohibited without any delay.”
The US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) went into effect in June 2022. It prohibits imports of goods into the United States that has been manufactured with forced labor in China, especially from the Xinjiang region, the US Department of Homeland Security said on its website. Xinjiang is home to 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, which is an essential material in conventional solar modules.
In 2022, the EU Commission proposed a ban on products made with forced labor in the EU market. The commission estimates 27.6 million people are involved in forced labour across the globe. In September, the European Parliament Market and Trade Committee said it would continue working on this proposed legislation.
If it is proven that a company has used forced labor, all import and export of their related goods would be halted at the EU’s borders and companies would also have to withdraw goods that have already reached the EU market, the press release said. These items would then be “donated, recycled or destroyed.”
