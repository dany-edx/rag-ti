Ltd (MSEDCL) has issued a tender to procure a cumulative 445 MW (AC) of solar power from decentralized, grid-connected PV projects to be developed under component-A of the PM Kusum Scheme in the Indian State of Maharashtra.
The MSEDCL shall enter into a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders.
The bidders selected by MSEDCL shall set up solar power projects in sizes of minimum 0.5MW to maximum 2MW capacity. Their scope of work includes design, finance, procurement of land, engineering, procurement, construction, metering, and operation and maintenance of the solar plant.
“The solar power project under the scheme would be implemented primarily on barren/uncultivable land. Agricultural land is also permitted under the scheme provided that solar plants are installed in a stilt fashion (i.e. raised structure for installation of solar panels) and with adequate spacing between panel rows for ensuring that farming activity is not affected. In case of cultivable land with solar plants, the same may be installed on stilts, so that the farmers continue to cultivate the land, apart from getting the benefit of lease rent,” as per the tender document. 
The solar power project will be preferably installed within a five km radius of the sub-stations to avoid the high cost of sub-transmission lines and to reduce transmission losses.
Projects under construction and not having any PPA with existing buyers shall also be eligible to participate in the tender.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/18/power-ministry-notifies-green-hydrogen-policy/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 18, 2022",Power ministry notifies green hydrogen policy,"India has unveiled its green hydrogen policy as a step forward towards meeting the objectives of the National Hydrogen Mission launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year. 
The National Hydrogen Mission aims to make India a green hydrogen hub, enabling the nation to meet its climate targets while reducing its fossil fuel import bills. It targets the production of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 and the related development of renewable energy capacity.
Hydrogen plays a critical role in the Indian economy, with roughly 6 million tons of hydrogen consumed annually, primarily in ammonia and methanol production and for use in refineries. A report from The Energy and Resources Institute estimates that demand for hydrogen could grow to as much as 28 million tons by 2050. 
Virtually, all the hydrogen consumed in India today is grey (hydrogen produced using fossil fuels), the production of which emits roughly 9 tons of CO2 per ton of hydrogen. Therefore, enabling cost-effective domestic production of green hydrogen (utilizing renewable electricity) is critical for India to reduce the carbon intensity of heavy industry and help achieve its energy security and emissions targets.
With hydrogen and ammonia envisaged as the future fuels, the government is determined to facilitate their production using renewable sources of electricity instead of fossil fuels/fossil fuel-based feedstocks.
The policy is designed to promote the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia by easing the process of RE purchase, storage, and transmission for the manufacturers. 
Green hydrogen/ammonia manufacturers can purchase renewable power from the power exchange or set up renewable energy capacity themselves or through any other, developer, anywhere; for such plants, open access will be granted within 15 days of receipt of application. They can bank their unconsumed renewable power, for up to 30 days, with the distribution company and take it back when required.
Distribution licensees can also procure and supply renewable energy to the manufacturers of green hydrogen/green ammonia in their States at concessional prices which will only include the cost of procurement, wheeling charges, and a small margin as determined by the State Commission.
Further, green hydrogen and green ammonia manufacturers shall be allowed a 25-year waiver of inter-state transmission charges for the projects commissioned before June 30, 2025. ISTS connectivity for the renewable energy capacity set up to manufacture green hydrogen/green ammonia shall be granted on priority.
The hydrogen/ammonia manufacturer and the distribution licensee shall be eligible for the incentive benefit of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for the consumption of renewable power.
Among other measures, the ministry of new and renewable energy shall set up a single portal to carry out all the activities including statutory clearances in a time-bound manner.
Green hydrogen and green ammonia manufacturers shall be allowed to set up bunkers near Ports for storage of green ammonia for export/use by shipping. The land for the storage for this purpose shall be provided by the respective Port Authorities at applicable charges.
To further encourage the usage of green hydrogen by industries, the fuel has been included under the RPO regulations.

German football club SC Freiburg has announced that a 2.4MW rooftop solar array is currently under construction on the roof of its Europa-Park stadium.
Swiss solar manufacturer Meyer Burger Technology has provided its heterojunction panels for the project, which is claimed to be the world’s largest PV system built on a stadium roof to date.
The project was selected in a tender for commercial PV projects recently held by the German federal network agency and will be developed by Badenova Wärmeplus, SC Freiburg’s energy and environmental partner.
Around 6,000 high-performance solar modules from Meyer Burger will be installed on a 15,000m2 roof area. Badenova Wärmeplus is investing around €2.3 million in the system, which it will operate over a 20-year period.
“In order to meet the high sustainability standards of the city of Freiburg and the sports club, as well as our own standards, we consciously rely on high-performance modules that are manufactured in Germany,” said Badenova board member Heinz-Werner Hölscher.
“This clearly puts us in the photovoltaic Champions League,” says Moritz Borgmann, chief commercial officer at Meyer Burger. “Solar energy offers a lot of potential to reduce emissions using already built-up areas, to become climate-neutral and to give climate protection more drive with a forward-looking technology – not only for soccer clubs.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/18/new-pv-module-recycling-tech-from-france/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RECYCLING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIE BEYER,"FEBRUARY 18, 2022",New PV module recycling tech from France,"From pv magazine Global
Grenoble-based company Rosi Solar has developed a novel solution for recycling and reusing raw materials from the photovoltaic industry.
In particular, the start-up has set up a thermal and chemical separation process to recover ultra-pure silicon and other metals lost during the production of photovoltaic cells and at the end of the life of solar panels.
Rosi Solar was launched in 2017 and, since then, it has attracted the interest of many companies and institutions that now support it: French environment and energy agency Ademe, the French national investment bank BPIFrance, French environmental services provider Veolia, and European Union programs in particular.
The company’s technology is based on a pyrolysis process that makes it possible to isolate the different metals from the cells. Pyrolysis is generally used for temperature decomposition of organic material in the absence of oxygen. This process is known to provide excellent rate capability and high cycling stability. It is used in the chemical industry to produce ethylene, carbon and chemicals from petroleum, coal and even wood, in addition to producing coke from coal.

“Silver represents less than 0.1% of the components of a solar module but it constitutes a big portion of its value,” Yun Luo, co-founder and president of Rosi Solar told pv magazine, noting that the same concept applies, to a lesser extent, to silicon, copper or even glass when it is of superior quality, or rather, high purity. “Our innovative process separates the metals and cells in a way that retains the purity of the material,” she stated.
Rosi Solar has not worked only on the development of a mild thermal and chemical treatment allowing the extraction of high-value metals and materials but also on the process, now patented, for the reintegration of silicon into different industries. Supported by Ademe for the proof of concept, the company utilized the results of its own research to carry out the purification of silicon, “in particular, from those of our first project, focused on the quality of the silicon recovered from the scrap resulting from the cutting of the wafers,” explained Luo. In 2019, the second extraction project was carried out in collaboration with Veolia for the proof of concept, and with Ademe for the co-financing of the industrial prototype. Rosi Solar’s customers are all potential users of these materials, particularly in the chemical industry.
After several years of research and partnerships the company is now moving to the industrial deployment of its low-environmental impact recycling solution. With national players and, often, within European initiatives, it aims to promote its technologies for the purification of silicon and silver from used PV cells so as to create a market around the recovery of high-purity materials in the solar industry.
In France, its breakthrough technology, associated with the logistics and pre-processing services of Envie 2E Aquitaine, was selected by Sorem in July 2021 in a call for tenders to upgrade end-of-life photovoltaic (PV) modules. In its new plant at La Mure in Isère, the company will process laminates without glass, to extract silicon and metals. “This is our first major commercial contract,” said Luo, adding that the construction of the site began in July 2021, for commissioning planned by the fourth quarter of 2022. Eventually, the plant could recycle around 3,000 tons of solar panels per year, which corresponds to about three tons of silver and 90 tons of silicon.
In Germany, Rosi Solar is participating in the ReProSolar project led by a Veolia subsidiary in Germany, with the participation of Flaxres, Evonik, Technalia, and the French National Center for Scientific Research, which aims to separate, for the first time, all the components of PV modules in order to demonstrate the challenge of high value-added recycling of solar panels on an industrial scale. The EU is notably supporting the project with a contribution of €4.8 million via EIT Rawmaterials, which aims to significantly enhance innovation in the raw materials sector by sharing knowledge, information and expertise.
“We are at the beginning of a tsunami with regard to the PV module recycling market,” explained Luo, who foresees growth.
