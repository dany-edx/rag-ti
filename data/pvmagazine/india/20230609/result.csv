APGENCO is developing the PSP at Sileru, Alluri Sitharama Raju district.
The speedy approval shows the government’s resolve to ensure the fast commissioning of pumped storage projects (PSPs), accelerating the growth of renewable energy capacity in India. 
India targets 500 GW installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by the year 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. PSPs will help integrate intermittent renewable energy with the grid. These will enable the supply of dispatchable RE power and help meet the grid’s peaking requirement.
Considering PSPs’ role in meeting RE ambitions, India plans to commission 39 hydro PSPs of 47 GW by the year 2029-30.
India has a potential for about 119 GW of PSPs (comprising 109 PSPs). Out of this, eight projects (4.7 GW) are under operation and four projects (2.8 GW) under construction. Further, CEA has consented to two projects (2.3 GW), and construction of these projects is slated to start shortly.
In addition, 33 projects (42 GW) are under survey and investigation to prepare detailed project reports. Of these 33 projects, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has already given the Terms of Reference to 22 projects.
To expedite hydro PSPs, the CEA recently revamped the DPR approval process for these projects. It has established a Single Window Clearance Cell for this purpose. The Central Water Commission (CWC) has nominated nodal officers for fast-tracking the clearance of design aspects. It has also designated more groups for examination of design aspects of DPRs to further fast-track the approvals. 
The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has also nominated nodal officers for fast-tracking the clearance of geological aspects of DPRs, and the CEA has requested GSI to involve their subordinate and field offices in states to further fast-track the approvals.
The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has agreed to appraise off-stream closed-loop PSPs with specific Terms of Reference. It has also notified to appraise PSPs on existing reservoirs under the B2 category (wherein no environmental impact assessment is required), subject to certain conditions. 
These considerations are expected to significantly reduce the time to get these PSPs’ environment clearance.
The CEA has also published revised Guidelines for Formulation and Concurrence of DPR of PSPs. Under the revised guidelines, the DPR concurrence timeline for the following PSPs has been reduced from 90 days to 50 days:
The timeline for DPR concurrence of other PSPs has been reduced from 125 days to 90 days.

The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) announced it received two bids from ACWA Power and Masdar for the tender it launched in September 2022 for the 1,800 MW 6th phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park.
The utility said Masdar submitted the lowest bid of $0.0162154/kWh. “DEWA has broken its own record and achieved the lowest price for PV solar power projects based on the IPP model in Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park,” said DEWA CEO Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer.
DEWA said it will announce the preferred bidder in the third quarter of this year. It expects the 6th phase of the giant project to begin commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2024.
DEWA had selected 23 bidders in the initial phase of the tender.
The 5th phase of the 5 GW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park has a capacity of 900 MW and is currently under construction.
As of the end of October 2022, the facility reached an operational PV capacity of 1.83 GW – including the 13 MW first phase, the 200 MW second stage, and the 800 MW third phase, plus sections of the fourth and fifth slices of the project, which are still under development.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/09/china-solar-module-prices-dive/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JUNE 9, 2023",China solar module prices dive,"From pv magazine Global
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), OPIS’ benchmark assessment for modules from China, declined for a second week running to $0.198 per W as dramatic downslides in the country’s upstream segments pushed module prices to their lowest level in almost three years, according to OPIS data.
This 7.48% plummet – the largest percentage drop so far this year – takes CMM below the psychologically significant level of $0.2/W.
Multiple market players pinned the slump on growing polysilicon capacity in China and how China-made polysilicon is essentially back at what one source calls a “reasonable price.” The latter, which OPIS assesses as China Mono Grade, continued its inexorable march downwards to 107.5 CNY ($15.10)/kg.

China module prices are dropping rapidly, with opening bids for some recent domestic projects all lower than CNY1.5/W, noted multiple sources. Downstream demand is huge, with 48.31 GW installed in the first four months of this year. Yet module shipments are still lower than expected as prospective buyers, expecting further price drops, delay their purchases, sources also concurred. Buyers will wait as long as their project allows them to do so, explained one veteran market observer, adding that he did not expect falling module prices to level off.
OPIS expects significant price volatility ahead as buyers and sellers alike adopt a wait-and-see approach to the China module market’s direction. Pent-up demand from what one source calls “all-time high” procurement, with China’s National Energy Administration approving a third batch of Gigawatt-base power projects, means falling prices could find a floor.
According to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, the country is set to install up to 120 GW of solar power in 2023. But manufacturers should have big module inventories accumulating, noted another source, which if unleashed on the market may suggest more downslides on the horizon.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/09/hhv-builds-directional-solidification-furnace-for-solar-pv-industry/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SILICON SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,KARNATAKA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 9, 2023",HHV builds directional solidification furnace for solar PV industry,"Bengaluru-based Hind High Vacuum (HHV) has introduced a directional solidification (DSS) furnace for silicon growth in the solar PV industry. It designed and built the furnace to international standards based on its expertise in industrial furnace manufacturing and long experience in manufacturing and supplying vacuum furnaces.
“The furnace is meant for the production as well as R&D on polycrystalline silicon ingots. This product is suitable for all the poly-C-Si solar cell manufacturers that want a backward integration in their PV production value chain and want to begin their own ingot/wafer production facility.  Simultaneously, the existing ingot makers can make use of this latest equipment for improving the growth process and quality of ingots. The poly c-Si cell manufacturing industry and academia having R&D setup on improving production technology, not only from India but other parts of the globe also who want to stay away from Chinese products, will be able to get the benefits of having this system available from India,” Nagarjun Sakhamuri, managing director of HHV, told pv magazine.
The company said the furnace can produce high-quality ingots suitable for processing high-efficiency polycrystalline solar cells. 
“The unique production mechanism can enhance the properties of the standard and mono-like/quasi-mono cells produced out of the wafers wire-sawed from these ingots to increase the performance of the solar cells further,” stated HHV. 
The furnace produces polycrystalline silicon ingots, which undergo minimum loss while producing wafers. This higher yield also contributes to lowering the cost of solar wafers and cells.       
HHV’s DSS furnace also considers the possibility of any accidental breakage of the silica crucible, a critical component of the furnace. Breakage of this part can lead to lengthy downtimes and costs to repair. Several safety functions are incorporated to protect the furnace against overpressure and malfunctioning.
Academia and research institutions can pursue research activities on mc-Si/ mono-like Si with furnaces and technology like this. 
Prof. P. Ramasamy, Dean (Research), SSN College of Engineering, Chennai, said, “The furnace will contribute to studies in improving the quality of silicon grown and the efficiency of the equipment. This will help us make these material processes more competitive and attractive to renewable energy power producers.”
Sakhamuri added, “As India is rapidly increasing its footprint into PV installations, these furnaces will help India become self-reliant in making its own wafers and satisfy the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ [self-reliant India] initiative of the Govt. of India. This also helps produce solar cells at a lower cost, and solar modules made out of these will become more economical than the prevailing mono-C-Si modules. The DSS furnace is built to international standards with state-of-the-art PLCs, automatic controls and processing, and mandatory safety features and interlocks.”
HHV is a thin-film and vacuum technology company with over 55 years of expertise in designing and manufacturing high-vacuum equipment for research and industrial applications. HHV’s products are integral to multiple sectors, including aerospace, automotive, and defense.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/09/green-hydrogen-a-key-enabler-for-a-sustainable-future/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTROLYZER,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AFRICA,INDIA,WORLD",,"JUNE 9, 2023",Green hydrogen: A key enabler for a sustainable future,"Hydrogen has emerged as one of the most promising solutions to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in pursuit of global climate targets. Not just any hydrogen, specifically green hydrogen, produced from renewable energy sources. This revolutionary form of energy holds the potential to transform multiple sectors and act as a crucial tipping point in our journey toward a sustainable future.
A recent report by SYSTEMIQ and the University of Exeter shed light on the essential tipping points required to accelerate the global transition to a net-zero economy. Green hydrogen was identified as a critical element in various sectors, such as fertilizer and steel production. Its widespread adoption can have far-reaching positive impacts on these industries, significantly reducing emissions.
The G7 members launched the Hydrogen Action Pact (HAP) last year, recognizing the importance of green hydrogen. The primary objective of this pact is to strengthen collective efforts in advancing hydrogen and its derivatives. One of the critical action items agreed upon is the acceleration of low-carbon and renewable energy-sourced hydrogen, with a specific emphasis on the hard-to-abate sectors.
The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is exclusively interested in renewable energy-sourced hydrogen, which aligns with its mission to promote sustainable solar energy solutions.
The Global Hydrogen Review 2022 report by The International Energy Agency states that the global demand for hydrogen reached a staggering 94 million tons per annum in 2021, and it continues to grow at a steady rate of 5%.
However, green hydrogen accounts for less than 1% of global hydrogen production.
Despite this disparity, the declining costs of renewable electricity and electrolyzers indicate that the green hydrogen sector is on the verge of becoming a viable investment opportunity. A remarkable 43 countries have announced roadmaps and strategies to embrace a green hydrogen economy, further highlighting its immense potential, as per ISA’s Blueprint for Ecosystem Readiness Assessment for Green Hydrogen 2022. ISA report specifically on Africa has also shown tremendous potential for Green Hydrogen in the continent.
The emerging green hydrogen technology faces several challenges that must be addressed for widespread adoption. These challenges include a shortage of specialized human resources, high operational costs, limited sector knowledge, underdeveloped infrastructure and pipelines, the absence of dedicated policies, and limited access to affordable financing.
To overcome these obstacles, targeted interventions such as increased investment, government support, engineering development, and skilled workforce training are essential to facilitate a smooth transition toward a green hydrogen economy.
ISA has taken a proactive approach in line with the global momentum for green hydrogen as a viable energy transition vector.
With a membership exceeding a hundred countries, ISA has launched the dedicated ‘Solar for Green Hydrogen’ programme. This initiative aims to support Member Countries by providing comprehensive analytics on the potential deployment of green hydrogen across various end-use sectors. The programme also encompasses ecosystem development, including establishing appropriate standards and certifications to attract investments and foster the creation of domestic and cross-border hydrogen value chains.
The Solar for Green Hydrogen programme represents an important step towards realizing the full potential of green hydrogen. By leveraging the power of solar energy and its derivative applications, ISA is poised to play a significant role in driving the energy transition and fostering sustainable development. The programme’s comprehensive approach, from capacity building to investment facilitation, underscores the commitment to accelerate the deployment of green hydrogen worldwide.
Further, ISA and G20 2023 India Presidency are partnering to facilitate the scaling of green hydrogen uptake to promote clean energy transition in the G20 and beyond. This will include the creation of a Centre of Excellence platform that will support the production, utilization, and trade of green hydrogen, besides providing a platform for knowledge sharing, supporting the start-up ecosystem, and building competency in the green hydrogen value chain.
As we stand at a crucial juncture in our fight against climate change, the rise of green hydrogen offers a glimmer of hope. With its ability to decarbonize critical sectors and provide clean energy solutions, green hydrogen has the potential to reshape our future. Governments, businesses, and international organizations must join hands to overcome the challenges and fully embrace this game-changing technology. Doing so can pave the way for a sustainable and resilient world driven by the power of green hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/09/global-pv-manufacturing-capacity-to-reach-1-tw-by-2024/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 9, 2023",Global PV manufacturing capacity to reach 1 TW by 2024,"From pv magazine Global
Global solar PV manufacturing capacity is set to nearly double next year, reaching almost 1 TW, according to the IEA. This expansion would be sufficient to meet the agency’s annual net zero demand for 2050, which anticipates PV deployment of nearly 650 GW in 2030 and almost 310 GW in 2024. However, the industry is grappling with the challenge of oversupply.
In 2022, global PV manufacturing capacity increased by more than 70% to nearly 450 GW, with China accounting for more than 95% of new additions across the supply chain. In 2023 and 2024, global PV manufacturing capacity is expected to double, with China again accounting for more than 90% of the increase.
Chinese manufacturers are investing in expanding wafer, cell, and module manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Additionally, manufacturing plants are expected to be deployed in India and the United States due to new industrial policies introduced last year.
India’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have led to a surge in new solar manufacturing projects. Between November 2022 and May 2023, more than 120% of such projects were announced, potentially creating national supply chains with more than 20 GW of capacity in each region.
In Europe, new manufacturing capacity accounts for just 14% of the announced projects since August 2022. The EU Green Deal Industrial Plan and the Net-Zero Industry Act aim for Europe to produce 40% of its PV targets by 2030, but specific incentives are not currently included. High prices of industrial energy have also increased the cost of manufacturing solar PV equipment in EU countries.
“Without a manufacturing policy or domestic content premiums, solar PV manufacturing in the European Union is less competitive than in India or the United States,” said the IEA.
In Europe, less than 1% of manufacturing capacity is dedicated to new cells, while ingots and wafers account for 9%, and polysilicon production is at only 6%. Integrated manufacturing facilities produce three or more components, but nearly 80% of their announced capacity excludes dedicated polysilicon production. Additionally, the capacity of new module assembly plants, which is almost 30 GW, does not align with the announced capacity for other components, particularly cells and polysilicon. As a result, these new plants will still need to import cells and other components from China.
The combined new solar PV manufacturing announcements in India, the United States, and Europe amount to 30 GW for polysilicon and 100 GW for module assembly.
