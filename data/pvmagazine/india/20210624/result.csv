The challenges include an upward revision of open access charges, denial of open access approvals, and tightening energy banking norms. Further, as solar and wind tariffs become competitive, states have either wholly withdrawn or reduced the concessions/incentives on open access charges.
Open access allows large power consumers such as those in the commercial and industrial sector to buy cheaper power from the open market in place of the grid electricity.
Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head-Corporate ratings, ICRA, said, “The overall open access charges for third-party based IPPs vary widely across the key states, ranging between INR 2-5 per unit. [These] have shown an increasing trend over the period, given the limited progress in tariff rationalization for the grid tariffs set by the SERCs for the state-owned distribution utilities (discoms).” 
Discoms escalate charges in a bid to deter their cross-subsidizing/high tariff paying commercial & industrial (C&I) customers from switching to open access; cross-subsidies are higher charges levied in a State on industrial consumers to lower tariffs for other consumers.
The regulatory headwinds pose a medium-term risk to the renewable capacity addition in the open-access segment, but the demand for such power purchase agreement (PPAs) with commercial and industrial (C&I) customers is favorable, according to Kadam. 
“The demand….is supported by tariff attractiveness, given the extent of discount offered in such PPAs against the applicable grid tariffs as well as growing voluntary sustainability initiatives of corporate customers, as seen recently,” he added. 
Vikram V, Vice President & Sector Head – Corporate Ratings, ICRA, added, “The credit profile of renewable projects in the open-access segment remains supported by a mix of factors such as relatively better tariff expectations by about INR 1.0 – 1.5 per unit against the tariff discovered in the utility segment and their ability to ensure tariff competitiveness for the C&I customers. Further, the presence of diverse and credit-worthy C&I customers remains another supporting factor for the credit profile of most open access-based IPPs in the ICRA-rated portfolio”.
As per ICRA, the tariff competitiveness for captive group projects is relatively superior due to the non-applicability of cross-subsidy surcharge and additional surcharge (except in Maharashtra) as against third-party sale under open access. However, policy clarity on the proposed amendments in the eligibility criterion concerning the ownership/equity structure for captive group projects is still awaited, and thus, the same remains monitorable.

The unit is being planned under the Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which aims to drive deployment of every stage of the solar supply chain, from polysilicon to module manufacturing.
A spokesperson for the company told pv magazine it is exploring manufacturing opportunities for its ‘direct wafer’ production process in India and the business said it is also seeking module partners.
“The Indian government has made domestic solar manufacturing a priority and our technology is particularly well suited for the Indian market,” said the 1366 spokesperson. “Direct wafer manufacturing can immediately deliver the lowest cost of electricity in a single-junction device for India’s utility market, and it underpins an economically feasible, high-efficiency, tandem product for global leadership.”

The direct wafer process is a kerfless wafer technique, meaning it does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers, a time-consuming process that wastes material as silicon dust. Instead, 1366’s technology forms wafers directly, using molten silicon. The company claims its direct wafer process offers the world’s lowest wafer production cost, translating into cell and module competitiveness.
The direct wafer approach has long held big hopes for the industry and the company operates a demonstration facility in Bedford, Massachusetts, where most of its technological developments were achieved. One such was a 20.3% cell efficiency level recorded in August 2017 in a Q Cells Q.antum cell which incorporated passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) technology and 1366 wafers. That record, 1366 Tech said at the time, was achieved on a pilot line using standard processes seen in mass production.
This copy was amended on 24/06/21 to reflect 1366 Technologies is planning a wafer and cell facility, rather than just wafers, and that it is seeking solar module, rather than cell partners.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/24/new-microinverter-from-the-us/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 24, 2021",New microinverter from the US,"From pv magazine International
US storage system manufacturer Yotta Energy has unveiled a new dual-power micro-inverter for applications in rooftop PV.
The device, which the manufacturer describes as an ideal solution for commercial rooftop PV systems linked to between 500 kWh and 1 MWh of storage, can be used without a battery or together with the manufacturer’s SolarLEAF energy storage technology, which can also be mounted under rooftop solar modules.
“The Yotta Dual-Power Inverter (DPI) is designed to work with solar PV installations today,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “A building owner then has the option to install Yotta’s commercial energy storage solution at a later date.”
The micro-inverter incorporates rapid shutdown and is able to operate at completely low voltage. It is available as a single-phase device (208 V) and three-phase one (240 V) and can be used with modules with a 60 and 72-cell design and a power output of up to 500 W. Each micro-inverter can accommodate up to four PV modules with an output of 440W each.
The inverter measures 281 x 231 x 41.3 mm, weighs 4.5 kg, and has a cooling system based on natural convection. It has a peak efficiency of 96.5% and a nominal maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency of 99.5%. The MPPT voltage range is between 22 and 48 V and the maximum input voltage 60 V. Maximum continuous output power for the three-phase device is 1.2 kW and 1.1 kW for the single-phase product.
The product comes with a 10-year warranty that is extendable to 25 years, the manufacturer stated.
The inverters are manufactured in Taiwan for Yotta Energy with a strategic original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partnership with Seattle-based micro-inverter technology company APsystems. “Yotta Energy can currently supply 10 MW of inverters for the growing commercial and industrial (C&I) market,” the spokesperson explained. “Production will be increased in 2022.”
The new product is currently sold directly to customers in the US market. The manufacturer is actively looking to expand into international markets, including Europe, by Q1 2022.
