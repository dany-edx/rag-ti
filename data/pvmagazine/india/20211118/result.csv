The PV plant was installed on Yachio India’s factory at Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, on a power purchase agreement (PPA) basis with Cleantech Solar Energy (India) Pvt. Ltd as the developer.

The project uses 1,894 Renewsys modules rated 330Wp each and five Solis inverters (four 100 kW and one 80 kW). The solar plant is expected to produce approximately 92 lakh units of solar electricity per annum and replace approximately 565 MT of greenhouse emissions. The payback period is estimated to be within four years.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/18/azure-power-signs-600-mw-solar-ppa-with-seci/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 18, 2021",Azure Power lands 600 MW solar contract from SECI,"New Delhi-based renewable power producer Azure Power has announced it has closed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for the electricity to be generated by 600 MW of the 4 GW of solar generation capacity Azure secured in a manufacturing-linked project tender.
Under the terms of the 600 MW deal, Azure will receive INR2.54/kWh from the state-owned Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) over a 25-year period.
The grid-connected solar projects concerned will be built in Rajasthan, the state which boasts India’s highest level of solar radiation. Grid connection has been approved and the land is under acquisition with the projects set to be commissioned by December 2023.
Azure had secured an initial 2 GW of solar capacity in the SECI tender by committing to establish new solar cell and module production lines able to produce 500 MW per year of solar products. The developer was then granted a further 2 GW of solar project capacity under what has been termed a ‘green shoe‘ arrangement, in reference to the stock market practice of having the option of selling extra stock at a company float to exploit unexpected demand.
pv magazine has previously reported SECI would guarantee a purchase price of INR2.92/kWh for the solar capacity awarded and it is not clear why the tariff has fallen in the 600 MW power purchase contract which Azure has announced.
Ranjit Gupta, managing director and CEO of Azure Power welcomed the power purchase deal, saying: “This is a significant milestone, given the long wait. With things now falling into place, we are on our way to see our 4 GW pipeline turn into contracted capacity and help us realize significant value accretion for our stakeholders. We understand SECI is progressing to tie up power sale agreements (PSAs) for further capacity in the tender and we expect to sign PPAs when the corresponding PSAs are in place.”
Azure recently announced it had received the letter of award from SECI for its first, 150 MW, grid-connected, solar and wind hybrid power project. That facility will benefit from a 25-year PPA at a fixed tariff of INR2.35/kWh. The hybrid plant – which will feature 100 MW of solar capacity and 50 MW of wind turbines – is part of a 1,200 MW mixed technology tender carried out by SECI. The project will have to be commissioned within 18 months of signing the power supply agreement.

Scientists at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom are developing a water-repelling, anti-soiling coating for PV modules that could considerably reduce the frequency of expensive cleaning cycles.
The researchers said that polymer-based hydrophobic anti-soiling coatings have already been tested in solar modules. They said they only work in principle, as they cannot withstand constant exposure to environmental stress or to abrasion damage caused by regular cleaning.
The new solution consists of a thin abrasion-resistant inorganic coating fabricated via chemical vapour deposition (CVD), the research team said.
“The coating will be designed to ensure it is capable of being applied at an industrial scale using a chemical process that is compatible with glass manufacturing,” the team explained, without providing any additional technical details.
The U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) is providing the project with £1.2 million ($1.6 million) of funding. It is being developed in collaboration with University College London and the support of industrial partners such as U.K.-based PV drone specialist Above Surveying,Japanese glass manufacturer NSG Group, and Solar Farm Cleaning Ltd.
Several modules in production already include anti-reflective coatings to boost output. Dutch materials supplier DSM is in the process of launching a coating to be applied retroactively to older modules. Anti-soiling coatings are also gaining ground commercially, as project developers learn how to boost project output while keeping operations and maintenance costs to a minimum.

U.K.-based market observer IHS Markit expects that the current supply chain issues in the PV industry will keep solar module prices high until at least 2023.
“Costs will resume their downward trend from 2023 once the polysilicon capacity levels up with other nodes of the module supply chain and power restrictions ease up in China for other key module materials like polymers and solar glass,” the analyst said in a statement. “Increased module efficiencies projected on module technology roadmaps i.e., passivated contact cells (TOPCon) or Heterojunction (HJT) will also contribute to lower ($/W) production costs from 2023 onwards.”
Despite this difficult cost environment, global solar PV installations are predicted to increase by about 20% in 2022 to reach a record annual capacity of over 200 GW for the first time.
According to the IHS Markit, PV systems costs increased by 4% year-on-year globally, which is having a significant impact only on the utility scale segment, with many projects being halted or delayed across the entire planet. It expects that the current high costs of freight and shipping delays will continue well into 2022, which would particularly impact the economics of international projects.
“There is significant appetite across global markets to invest in and develop solar installations, but the supply chain is just not ready to meet this level of demand, it needs time to adjust,” said IHS Markit analyst, Edurne Zoco. We have seen this most clearly in the polysilicon market, which will continue to be a bottleneck for solar PV growth into 2022, until planned new capacity is ramped up from 2023 onwards.”
The picture for solar distributed generation, by contrast, seems brighter, as large volumes are currently being deployed as an answer to skyrocketing electricity prices across big economies such as China, India, the United States, and Europe. “The strong growth of the distributed generation i.e., residential, commercial and industrial (C&I) sector has been one of the success stories of solar PV in 2021—boosted by the fuel crisis and surging electricity prices, particularly in markets across Europe,” said IHS Markit research manager, Josefin Berg.
