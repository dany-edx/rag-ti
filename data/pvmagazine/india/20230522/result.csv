With its fast-growing economy and rapidly increasing urbanization, India is facing significant challenges in terms of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. EVs can help mitigate these challenges by reducing emissions and improving air quality. PPPs can facilitate the development of EV infrastructure, promote EV adoption, and drive innovation and technology development in the sector.
PPPs can play a vital role in developing EV infrastructure in India, including charging stations, by leveraging the strengths of both the public and private sectors. The private sector can provide financing and technical expertise, while the public sector can provide regulatory and policy support to ensure that the infrastructure is deployed efficiently and effectively. In 2020, the Indian government announced a partnership with private companies to set up thousands of EV charging stations across the country, with the private sector providing financing and technical expertise, while the public sector provided regulatory and policy support.
PPPs can also help address the financing gap for EV adoption in India. The high upfront cost of purchasing an EV is a significant barrier for many consumers. However, PPPs can help provide financing options such as low-interest loans and lease programs to make EVs more affordable. In 2015, the Indian government launched the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme, which provides financial incentives to consumers for purchasing EVs and subsidies for charging infrastructure development. Approximately 278,000 xEVs received a total of approximately INR 343 crores of incentives during the first phase of the scheme.
PPPs can also drive innovation and technology development in the EV sector in India. By bringing together the private sector’s expertise and the public sector’s policy support, PPPs can support the development of new technologies and solutions to improve the performance, efficiency, and affordability of EVs. For example, advanced features such as remote monitoring, digital payment systems, and real-time information on charging status can be implemented. In 2019, the Indian government partnered with private companies to launch a pilot project for battery swapping technology, which allows EV users to exchange their depleted batteries for fully charged ones at designated swapping stations. This technology could potentially address the issue of long charging times for EVs and promote EV adoption.
To fully realize the potential of PPPs in driving sustainable transportation in India, there is a need for strong policy support, effective regulatory frameworks, and transparent governance mechanisms. PPPs should be designed to ensure that both the public and private sectors are aligned in terms of objectives, incentives, and risk-sharing arrangements. In addition, there should be clear guidelines for assessing the social and environmental impacts of PPP projects and mechanisms for public participation and accountability.
PPPs can play a critical role in driving sustainable transportation in India, particularly in the EV sector. By leveraging the strengths of both the public and private sectors, PPPs can facilitate the development of EV infrastructure, promote EV adoption, and drive innovation and technology development in the sector. With strong policy support and effective regulatory frameworks, PPPs can help India achieve its ambitious target of having almost 8 crore EV sales by 2030, and contribute to the country’s efforts to mitigate air pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The company has put the cumulative value of these projects under INR 2,500 to 5,000 crore category. 
In Saudi Arabia, L&T has secured two orders to establish 380 kV overhead power transmission lines connecting prominent cities situated on the Red Sea coast. These systems will strengthen projects that involve 400 km of transmission lines to meet the growing demand in these industrial and tourism hubs. 
Another order has been secured to design, supply, and construct a 380 kV substation in the central region of Saudi Arabia. The substation will be a crucial element to evacuate renewable capacity as part of Saudi Arabia’s diversification to non-fossil fuel sources in their electricity mix.
Further, in the domestic market, the business continued its winning streak in the Revamped Reforms Based and Results-Linked Distribution Sector (RDSS) Scheme projects with fresh orders from a prominent Gujarat electricity distribution company. The scope of work involves the modernization and development of distribution infrastructure in three districts of Gujarat’s southern region.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/22/novel-approach-to-pv-battery-electrolyzer-fuel-cell-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GREEN HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 22, 2023",Novel approach to PV-battery-electrolyzer-fuel cell systems,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands have developed a new methodology for the design and component sizing of off-grid, residential PV–battery–electrolyzer–fuel cell systems that use the generated hydrogen for long-term energy storage and the battery for short-term storage.
They claim the system may be a suitable solution in rural areas where transmission and distribution networks are difficult to access.
“The proposed approach adopts a load sizing factor as the key input parameter, it determines the extent to which the load demand in winter times is supplied by hydrogen to meet the seasonal imbalance,” the researchers stated, noting that the energy system is intended at serving an energy community consisting of several buildings. “In addition, a rule for selecting a proper load sizing factor to achieve the defined objectives, such as self-sufficiency.”
In the proposed system configuration, the electrolyzer is mostly utilized through surplus PV power in summer times to produce hydrogen, which is then delivered to a compressor, stored in tanks, and used for electricity production via the fuel cells in winter. Not all the surplus solar power, however, should be used to produce hydrogen, as this would increase the project’s Capex.
The innovative part of the system, the research group explained, consists of the fact that it divides load demand in winter times into two parts, of which one is met by PV and battery storage, while the other one is met by hydrogen when PV generation is not available and the state of charge of the battery is below 40%.
“The PV sizing follows the approach in that annual PV generation equals annual load demand,” the academics emphasized, adding that the battery size will be strictly dependent on the days of autonomy of the energy system and the project location. “The required PV generation for producing hydrogen is determined by both the efficiency of the electrolyzer and the fuel cell.”
The Dutch group said the system should be sized in a way that loss of load probability (LLP), which it defined as the ratio between the load demand that cannot be met by the energy system in a year divided by the total annual load demand, is always equal to zero. “The lower the LLP is, the more stable and reliable the energy system is,” it further explained.
The academics conducted a series of simulations and found the system can achieve a levelized cost of energy that is still higher than the energy price in the Netherlands, although it also found that the integration of the electrolyzer and the fuel cells with the solar-plus-storage installation is able to increase the reliability and security of the energy supply.
“However, as technology advances, the costs associated with hydrogen storage tanks and electrolyzers are expected to decrease, thereby increasing the affordability of this type of energy system,” they stressed. “In addition, the efficiencies of electrolyzers and fuel cells will also improve at the same time, which will also increase the system’s overall efficiency.”
Looking forward, the scientists said they want to investigate other cheaper options than the tank for hydrogen storage and reduce the system costs. “In future work, it is worth investigating the use of heat to meet the heat demand of the end-users to help them save heat costs as well,” they concluded.
They introduced the new methodology in “An approach for sizing a PV–battery–electrolyzer–fuel cell energy system: A case study at a field lab,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.
