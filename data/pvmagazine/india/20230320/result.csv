Coal capacity amounted to less than 1 GW (5%), 78% less than the addition in 2021. The strong growth in renewables sets the stage for the country to assume climate leadership in the run-up to the G20 summit this year, says a new analysis from global energy think tank Ember.
The analysis from Ember tracks the monthly progress of Indian states and union territories against 2022 renewable energy targets, using data from India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
Rajasthan and Gujarat emerged as the top two states with the most renewable electricity capacity additions in 2022, led especially by solar. The two states added 8.6 GW of solar. 
Rajasthan accounted for 43% (6.7 GW) of India’s total solar and wind capacity deployments in 2022 (15.7 GW). “This was the largest ever annual combined solar and wind capacity addition at the state level in India’s history,” stated Ember.

Gujarat installed 3.1 GW of solar and wind in 2022, about half of Rajasthan’s installations. The analysis also reveals that Gujarat now has 18.5 GW of clean electricity capacity, surpassing its planned target for the year.
Ember projects that the growth in renewable generation capacity will continue to be concentrated in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Rajasthan and Gujarat aim to reach 90 GW and 61 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, respectively. To achieve these targets, Rajasthan must deploy about 8.6 GW and Gujarat 5.4 GW of renewable capacity annually for the next eight years. 
If these 2030 targets are realized, renewable capacity in the two states will account for one-third of India’s total renewable capacity target of 450 GW by 2030, most of which is solar and wind.
“India, especially the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, have demonstrated to the world that rapid deployment of solar and wind is not only possible but also already happening. As the country presides over the G20 presidency this year, India is well-positioned to take climate leadership as a prime example of the possibilities of enabling clean power generation by unleashing solar and wind power,” said Ember’s Asia data analyst, Uni Lee.

Off-grid and edge-of-grid power systems have increased in prevalence and complexity over the past several decades as the cost of solar PV, and now energy storage, has dropped substantially. With the maturation of the off-grid and edge-of-grid power market, investors have also become more savvy. Thus, it is critical to understand how to plan a project that meets the needs of the asset owner, the end users and all other stakeholders. While the type of analysis typically focuses primarily on project economics, it is important to consider social, behavioral and environmental factors as well.
A report developed by IEA PVPS Task 18, aims to provide guidance to stakeholders who are involved in the design and development of off-grid photovoltaic (PV) projects by providing a comprehensive guide to feasibility studies. It is intended to be used as a reference tool during the early stages of planning and decision-making processes for such projects.
All feasibility studies are different; every project develops in a unique context that consists of different locations, stakeholders, site conditions, aims, constraints, and opportunities. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of well-meaning but poorly considered projects that have partially or wholly failed to deliver on their promise and/or potential. The reasons for these failures are many and varied but, in many cases, can be attributed to mistakes and misunderstandings in the initial feasibility phase of the project.
According to the Task 18 report, the key steps involved in conducting a feasibility study are:
· Identification of project objectives: This section provides guidance on how to engage with project stakeholders to ascertain the desirable outcomes of the project. These outcomes may be financial, social and/or environmental.
· Site Selection and Resource Assessment: This section provides guidance on how to select a suitable site for an off-grid PV project and how to assess its solar resource potential. It highlights the importance of accurate weather data and solar radiation measurements, and provides guidance on how to conduct on-site measurements.
· System Design: This section provides guidance on how to design an off-grid PV system that meets the project’s objectives and site constraints. It covers key design considerations such as system sizing, component selection, and system reliability.
· Financial Analysis: This section provides guidance on how to conduct a financial analysis of an off-grid PV project, including cost-benefit analysis, cash flow analysis, and project financing options.
A case study is presented in the report from a remote indigenous-owned and operated cattle station located 10 km from the grid in Australia’s Northern Territory (NT). This cattle station is powered by a diesel generation system. The client in this case study required a feasibility assessment to decide whether to continue powering the site business as usual (BAU), connect to the grid, or upgrade the power system to a PV / BESS / Diesel Hybrid. Furthermore, if the feasibility study indicates it is beneficial to install a standalone hybrid power station, the Client will need to know how different system designs (i.e. smaller vs. larger systems) will impact the economic, social and environmental project outcomes.
The client wishes to:
· Maximise financial returns
· Improve power system reliability
· Minimise operational cost volatility
· Improve environmental sustainability
Using these design criteria, the case study seeks to understand whether the client should remain BAU, connect to the grid or develop a PV / BESS / Diesel Hybrid system. The case study goes on to develop a full load and supply profile analysis and assigns the appropriate capital expenditure (Capex) and operational expenditure (Opex) to each option.
The output metrics can then be viewed in various ways in order to demonstrate to the client the trade-offs that can be made between the identified design criteria. The feasibility study (and thus the case study) utilize contour (aka topological) graphs for multivariant analysis. For example, if the client wished to optimize based on Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) by varying the BESS size and the PV System size, the following graph demonstrates these relationships.

Where the black-dotted contour lines represent negative NPV, the black-solid contour lines represent positive NPV and the red contour lines represent IRR. Given this multivariant analysis, the optimization can be placed where NPV and IRR are greatest and this is shown using the blue dot.
The above optimization is purely financial, however, if the client wished to view an environmental metric as the Renewable Energy Fraction (REF) which represents the amount of energy supplied from a renewable source as a percentage of total energy supply, versus a financial metric such as NPV, the following contour graph could be used.

It can be seen that selecting a different optimization criterion will change the desired BESS and Solar PV system sizes.
The IEA PVPS Task 18 report shows how stakeholder engagement and multivariant, multi-criteria optimization can be used to find the best outcomes for the project. Overall, the report provides a comprehensive guide to conducting feasibility studies for off-grid PV projects, providing stakeholders with the tools and information necessary to make informed decisions throughout the planning and development process.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/20/common-misconceptions-about-residential-pv/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,AFRICA,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 20, 2023",Common misconceptions about residential PV,"From pv magazine Global
Household demand for rooftop PV systems and residential batteries continues to grow. In order to meet the expectations of homeowners, Verbraucherzentrale NRW – a German consumer association – is trying to clarify false expectations about PV installations that could disappoint prosumers.
“It is important to be aware of the personal goals of using photovoltaics and then to find out more. In this way, disappointments can be avoided and solar power can be used really efficiently,” said Sören Demandt, a digital energy transition analyst for Verbraucherzentrale NRW.
The first misconception is to promise people that they can become self-sufficient with PV systems and storage systems. This is not true, because PV systems and home storage solutions can only cover a certain proportion of annual electricity supplies for households.
The degree of self-sufficiency that can be achieved is between 25% and 90%, depending on the level of power consumption and whether storage has been installed. Especially in the winter months, the amount of solar power that can be generated is far from sufficient, so grid power has to be purchased, said Demandt. Complete self-sufficiency can only be achieved with additional seasonal storage, such as hydrogen.
“However, that is technically complex and hardly makes economic sense for a residential unit,” said Demandt.
Another misconception relates to the belief that a PV system is only worthwhile in combination with a battery. Some homeowners seem to believe that feeding solar power into the grid is not a financially attractive option.
“A photovoltaic system is financially worthwhile, even without storage,” said Demandt. “If installing a battery in addition to the photovoltaic system is doable, it depends on a number of factors – mainly, a home’s consumption profile and electricity costs.”
Homeowners should therefore check their self-consumption levels without storage. They can compare higher self-consumption levels through battery storage with actual electricity costs.
Verbraucherzentrale NRW also rejects the idea that south-facing rooftops are always better for PV systems than east-west-facing rooftops. It’s not just about generating as much solar power as possible, but generating electricity when it is needed. The annual yield of a PV system on an east-west roof is only around 80% compared to a south-facing roof. However, the yield from solar systems on east-west roofs can be spread over the course of an entire day, as the systems still get a significant amount of sun in the morning and evening.
Many people who do not have rooftops for PV installations often consider investments in plug-in solar devices. These can be attached to balconies or set up in gardens. However, if tenants hope to be able to power household appliances such as coffee machines, they may be disappointed.
“These panels are particularly suitable for covering the baseload in the household,” explained Demandt. “The electricity is used directly – for example, for a telephone, an internet router, or an alarm clock radio.”
If more power is needed, it will be provided by the grid. This is the case, for example, with a coffee machine that briefly requires around 2,000 W to heat up water. Balcony PV modules alone could not achieve this, according to Verbraucherzentrale NRW.
