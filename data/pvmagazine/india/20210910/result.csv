https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/10/hydromet-to-set-up-lithium-ion-battery-recycling-plant-in-gujarat/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RECYCLING,SUSTAINABILITY,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",Hydromet to set up lithium-ion battery recycling plant in Gujarat ,"Navin Mittal, founder and chief executive officer of Hydromet Technology Solutions, has told pv magazine their company is going to set up a 1,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) lithium-ion battery recycling plant in the Indian State of Gujarat.  
The Gujarat-based extractive metallurgy technology solutions provider has already received approval from the Pollution Control Board for the plant. It plans two more such facilities, one in some other Indian state and the other overseas. The combined capacity in the three planned operations (including the Gujarat plant) will be 10,000 TPA. 
The Gujarat plant will be based on patented Hy-BREC technology developed by Hydromet to recover all valuable metals present in lithium-ion batteries. The company claims its process is zero-waste, generic, and adaptable. Different forms of lithium-ion batteries like lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NMC), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA), and lithium manganese oxide (LMO)—excluding those based on ferrous chemistry—can be processed using this technology. 
The plant will recover metals using spent Li-ion batteries from mobile phones, laptops, and other sources including electric vehicle (EV) batteries and expects the EV batteries to dominate the raw material mix in the next five years. 
Speaking to pv magazine, Dr Lakshmi Vaideeswaran, corporate strategy and planning at Hydromet, said, “Ours will be a zero-waste plant with an aim of 100% circularity. The process developed by us can recover any metal present in the batteries as well as the carbon which is also saleable. Currently, our process is unique in the sense that it is not restricted to batteries of any specific application or chemistry (barring lithium ferro phosphate).” 
“From an engineering point of view, the Gujarat plant will have a modular design to allow for ramp-up in the capacity as the volumes increase. The recycling process is going to be generic, though the focus is on hydrometallurgy. The Gujarat plant is likely to become operational within one year. The material recovered from lithium batteries will be battery-grade with high purity.”  
Dr Vaideeswaran said the plant will be spread across 28,000 sq feet. The company has also developed other technologies and filed patents for the manufacture of precipitated silica from rice husk ash and the method to extract vanadium from vanadium-bearing slags. Hydromet plans to set up a multipurpose plant for technology scale-up and commercialization to fast-track its go-to-market efforts.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/10/renew-power-commissions-250-mw-solar-project-in-rajasthan/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",ReNew Power commissions 250 MW solar project in Rajasthan,"Indian developer ReNew Power has announced the commissioning of 250 MW solar power generation capacity in the Indian State of Rajasthan. The capacity is part of a 300 MW Interstate Transmission System (ISTS) connected PV project won by ReNew Power in tranche 3 of the competitive auction conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). 
ReNew Power expects the remaining 50 MW capacity to be commissioned by the end of this month.
The solar project is located in the Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan and benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with SECI. It shall supply clean electricity to the state of Bihar at a tariff of INR 2.55/kWh (US$ 0.035). The project is also expected to provide direct employment to around 600 people.
For the project, Renew Power has installed monocrystalline modules with fixed tilt and string inverters to enhance the project efficiency. ReNew will also be using robotic module cleaning at this site to help conserve water in the desert state of Rajasthan.
Speaking about the commissioning, founder, chairman and CEO of ReNew Power, Sumant Sinha said the Renew Power team was able to commission this project within the budget as well as within the stipulated time despite Covid-related challenges.
“With this commissioning, ReNew Power continues to contribute significantly to India’s growing renewable energy capacity in line with the country’s ambitious targets of achieving a capacity of 450 GW by 2030. This is the first project to be commissioned after ReNew started trading on NASDAQ (RNW) and is another step towards ReNew achieving close to 18 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2025,” he added.
ReNew is India’s leading renewable energy independent power producer (IPP) that develops, builds, owns, and operates utility-scale wind and solar energy projects and distributed solar energy projects. Its parent holding company ReNew Energy Global, listed on NASDAQ in August 2021, trades under the ticker “RNW”. As of August 31, 2021, ReNew Power has 10.2 GW of the project portfolio, comprising 5.8 GW of operational wind, solar and hydro energy projects in India and the rest under construction or in the pipeline.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/10/impact-of-the-increasing-solar-panel-prices/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",Impact of the increasing solar panel prices,"India aims to develop the world’s largest clean energy program by 2022, with 175 GW of renewable energy capacity including 100 GW of solar power. By 2030, the country’s power demand will be 817 GW, with more than half of that coming from clean energy and 280 GW coming from solar energy alone.
One of the key selling features that have helped solar power become the world’s fastest-growing energy source is cost reduction, which has just encountered a snag due to recent increases in solar module pricing. Solar module prices have increased by 18% since the beginning of 2021, after plummeting by 90% over the previous decade.
The value of projects awarded in the last six to nine months will be impacted by a rise in solar photovoltaic (PV) module prices. The government intends to impose a 40% basic customs duty (BCD) on solar modules and a 25% BCD on solar cells beginning April 1, 2022. This is one of the first stages toward the capacity secured by developers through the procurement process over the last six to nine months at rates ranging mostly between INR 2.00 and 2.25 per unit (kWh), with units scheduled to be commissioned over the following 12 to 15 months.
The price increase is mostly due to a significant increase in the price of polysilicon, a vital input for cell and module manufacturing. Metal prices have recently increased, putting increasing pressure on the overall capital cost of solar generating installations. Chinese module manufacturers have recently hiked their costs by more than a fifth and begun cancelling contracts to provide equipment.
For the majority of solar power projects in India, imports are heavily reliant on PV modules. Therefore if the price of PV modules continues to rise, it will be a near-term headwind. It has a significant influence on solar projects in two ways: it delays them past their deadlines and slows the uptake of solar power, precisely as numerous major economies have begun to recognize the role of solar power in reducing climate change.
PV module components account for roughly 50-55% of the total project cost. Therefore a sustained increase in module prices of about 4-5% per watt will have a 12-14 basis point impact on project developers’ debt service coverage criteria. The tariff increase needed to counterbalance such a module price rise is expected to be around 20-22 paise per unit. The impact on the imported PV modules is expected to raise the overall bid tariff for the upcoming auctions by around 55-60 paise/unit. After accounting for the dual impact, the solar bid tariff is projected to remain below INR 3/unit.
As the notification for cells and modules takes effect in April 2022, both the module price behaviour and the fulfillment of supply contracts by Chinese module Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs) will continue to be important factors for solar power providers. The considerable ambiguity surrounding the deadlines for the inclusion of Chinese module providers on the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) may have an impact on the solar power sector’s incremental bidding activity.
The cost of solar panels has risen, and investment returns may suffer as a result. This sharp surge in prices has alarmed developers who have won projects that are yet to be commissioned, as 85-90% of solar modules used in India are imported from China.
Modules account for a huge percent of the project’s total cost, and since independent power providers (IPPs) have lower margins in the Indian solar energy sector, even a small increase in module pricing will put them under more strain. For projects that have already signed a power purchase agreement (PPA), the increase in module costs has an influence on the Internal Rate of Return (IRR). Unless the customer is willing to pay a higher electricity tariff, large-scale projects that are yet to negotiate price agreements (PPAs) with utilities may be delayed.
The polysilicon shortfall is expected to last at least through the first half of 2022. Other raw material prices, such as silver and glass, are also on the rise, so it will affect the entire ecosystem.
The viability of all the projects will be a major concern. 50% of projects will be able to keep themselves viable depending on the number of days they get to work after the delivery of panels. Large project developers are finding it difficult to maintain their projects profitable after buying panels in the final phase of development, i.e. 10-12 months after signing the PPA. The significant rise in steel prices, as well as the uncertainty surrounding safeguard duty, have contributed to their misery.
The recently established Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme would improve solar panel availability in India, stabilizing project costs in the future. DISCOMs are experiencing financial difficulties, and tariff changes are sporadic and insufficient. As a result, most private players cannot rely on power markets alone to stay profitable. They have to rely on repeated injections of liquidity through schemes like UDAY (Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana) and entities like Power Finance Corporation Ltd (PFC). Because it’s impossible to forecast where the next subsidy will come from, scale and sprawl develop.
Large corporations integrate vertically to ensure that they are one of the beneficiaries of any subsidies that are implemented. The unpredictability of knowing where the next subsidy will come from leads to scale and sprawl. Large companies integrate vertically to make sure that wherever the subsidies kick in, they are one of the beneficiaries. As long as some arm of the Indian state is paying or injecting liquidity, solar companies can use it to keep the rest of the power business afloat.
