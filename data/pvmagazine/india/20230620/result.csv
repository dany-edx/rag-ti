The government of Bangladesh has implemented measures to help domestic IPPs to increase their share of the renewable energy market.
The new rules allow Bangladesh’s IPPs to hold a 100% stake in companies owning renewable energy projects, removing the previous 80% limit that required a foreign investor for the remaining percentage.
Under the previous rules, domestic IPPs were also allowed to submit projects through international consortia and to take a 51% share in them, while foreign developers were limited to a maximum share of 20%.
“These new rules will bring more entrepreneurs in renewable energy business at the time when Bangladesh is reeling under severe power crisis that seriously hampered industrial production and brought misery in people’s life due to prolonged load shedding,” said a government spokesperson.
The decision has been submitted to the IPP cell of Bangladesh Power Development Board for necessary changes in bidding criteria.
“We have sent our decision to the IPP cell of Bangladesh Power Development Board for necessary changes in bidding criteria to facilitate the generation of renewable energy,” said Nirod Chandra Mondal, a joint secretary at the Ministry of Power.
However, Imran Chowdhury, the head of business development-Bangladesh for Total Eren, expressed concerns about the execution of projects without experienced operating partners as shareholders.
“The changes in the qualification criteria may help mainly the local sponsor to pass the qualification criteria easily, but a key concern can be how they can execute the project smoothly without having any experienced operating partner in the project as shareholder,” said Chowdhury.

Thus, these currencies clearly have a major impact on how trade is conducted across borders globally, including on the African continent. By the same token, it is important to note that a foreign currency shortage occurs when the demand for the currency exceeds the available supply at the prevailing exchange rate.
“Soberingly enough, over the last year, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have experienced shortages of US dollars. Every African country has felt the impact – however the problem seems to be more severe in economies such as Kenya, Tanzania, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Ghana, and Zambia that rely on the US currency to pay off their foreign debts and fund critical imports of goods and services” says Gerald Ndosi.
Against this backdrop, the shortage of the US dollar in key economies in SSA has meant liquidity challenges that can impact trade finance and affect the overall pace of economic activities in the region, catalysed by a few key factors.
Firstly, commodity dependence can affect the volume of dollars available in African markets, as many countries in SSA heavily rely on commodity exports, such as crude oil, minerals, and agricultural products. Fluctuations in commodity prices, which are often denominated in US dollars, can lead to revenue volatility, and affect the availability of US dollars in the local markets.
Secondly, limited export diversification means that the concentration of exports in a few commodities or markets can limit foreign exchange earnings in US dollars. The lack of export diversification makes economies vulnerable to external shocks and reduces the inflow of US dollars, affecting liquidity in the local markets.
Thirdly, high import dependence, which implies that sub-Saharan African countries often rely on imports for various goods and services – including essentials like food and fuel, can translate to a shortage of dollars as well. The need to pay for imports in US dollars puts pressure on their demand, especially when local currencies depreciate, or foreign exchange reserves are insufficient. Economic sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia, including restrictions on its energy sector has contributed for the bulk of global oil price hikes over the last year, thus fuelling pressure on oil importing countries to source more dollars for import bill settlement.
Fourthly, capital outflows and debt servicing burdens can translate into a dollar drain, with SSA having experienced an exodus of capital due to factors like global economic conditions, changes in investor sentiment, and policy uncertainties, the servicing external debt obligations in US dollars can further strain dollar liquidity in the region.
Finally, limited access to international financial markets can compound the problem, as it means that some countries in SSA face challenges in accessing international financial markets and raising funds in US dollars. Limited access to international capital markets restricts their ability to address dollar liquidity shortages through external borrowing.
Addressing these pressing challenges arising from the prevailing US dollar shortage and ensuring sustainable trade finance requires a mixed approach, putting into play multiple strategies such as:
By adopting these measures and pursuing a comprehensive strategy, sub-Saharan African countries can work towards overcoming US dollar liquidity challenges, promoting trade finance, and fostering sustainable economic growth in the region.
Thus, despite the challenges posed by US dollar liquidity constraints, there are promising avenues auguring well for the future of trade finance in Africa.
Indeed, through currency diversification, regional integration, and collaborative efforts, suitably synergised by technological innovations, African countries can navigate the challenges and seize opportunities to promote trade, economic growth, and financial stability within the continent.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/20/japans-vast-wind-and-solar-resources/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"JUNE 20, 2023",Japan’s vast wind and solar resources,"From pv magazine Global
By far the fastest energy change in history is underway. Solar and wind generators comprise three quarters of global electricity generation capacity additions (Figure 1). This is compelling market-based evidence that solar and wind are cheaper than fossil fuel generation. Solar has been the leading technology since 2016 and may reach 60% of new generation capacity in 2023.

Japan could produce all of its electricity from wind and solar for $86/110 MWh, which is competitive with current market prices. This includes the cost of transmission and storage needed to balance 100% renewable electricity. Japan could set an example for the world.
Most Japanese emissions could be eliminated well before 2050 through the generation of zero-emission electricity from solar and wind, coupled with the electrification of transport, heating and industry. To achieve this, Japan’s current electricity consumption will need to double.
Japan has enormous and high quality offshore wind resources. Japan could generate about 50 times more electricity than current consumption using offshore wind sourced from its exclusive economic zone. This means that Japan can be very choosy about where it locates offshore wind farms, to harvest the highest wind speeds and minimize cost and environmental impact.
Japan’s solar potential is also large. It has the potential to produce four times its current consumption from solar panels located on rooftops, floating on inland water bodies and deployed in conjunction with agriculture. Japan’s population of 125 million is forecast to decline by 18% to 102 million by 2050, which could free up 18%, or 8000 km2 of its current agricultural land. This land alone would be enough to provide all of Japan’s energy requirements from solar energy.
Large-scale electrical energy storage to support solar and wind is a solved problem in the form of batteries (for storage of seconds to hours) and Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (for overnight and longer periods). ANU’s global pumped hydro atlas shows 2,400 good sites in Japan with a combined storage potential of 53 TWh. Only a few dozen sites are required to support a 100% renewable energy system.

Japan used to be a global renewable energy leader. Sadly, Japan is now lagging well behind pathfinder countries in terms of annual per capita deployment of new renewable energy. Netherlands, Sweden, Australia and Finland are installing solar and wind five times faster (per capita) than Japan, and China, Spain Germany and the USA are installing solar and wind twice as fast.
The Japanese government’s Clean Energy Strategy Interim Report lacks clear recognition of the crucial role of solar and wind in global decarbonization and, instead, it promotes nuclear energy, imported hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). This is unlikely to be a good choice.
Global nuclear capacity has been static at about 400 GW since 2010. In 2022 the solar deployment rate was 200 Gigawatts, and it is rapidly growing every year. This is compelling evidence that nuclear is uncompetitive with solar.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has achieved zero commercial success in the electricity industry. Solar PV and wind already have a compelling economic advantage over fossil fuel generation without CCS, as shown by their dominance of new power station deployment. Electricity from fossil-fuelled power stations will become even less competitive if they are equipped with CCS because of large capital cost and the parasitic energy costs of CCS.
Importation of clean hydrogen for energy production (for example from Australia) is expensive because about three-quarters of the energy is lost in compression, shipping, storage and conversion which triples the effective energy cost. It’s cheaper for Japan to produce its own electricity from wind and solar than to import clean hydrogen.
About 10 million electric cars were sold in 2023, compared with 20,000 hydrogen-powered vehicles. Japan’s export car industry is at risk due to a lack of focus on developing competitive models for the booming electric vehicle market.
Pathfinder countries in northern Europe and Australia are showing that it is straightforward to largely decarbonize the electricity system via solar and wind. Japan will need to step up its pace of deployment of wind and solar tenfold to decarbonize by mid-century.
With the right policies, Japan can look forward to a sustainable future in which it no longer imports oil, coal, gas or uranium. Unlimited energy can come from rooftop solar panels, solar farms and offshore wind turbines. This provides a high degree of energy independence and resilience in the face of a pandemic, war or trade disruption.
Key elements needed for industrial precursor chemicals, ammonia, plastics, synthetic jet fuel and many other materials are hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sodium, chlorine and nitrogen. These are available everywhere from seawater and air. Japan’s chemical industry can be substantially self-sufficient, with driving energy coming from indigenous wind and solar.
Most buildings can have their own solar panels, energy storage, electric space and water heating, and electric vehicles. This eliminates greenhouse emissions, car exhausts, smog, oil spills, coal plant exhausts, ash dumps, nuclear accidents, and nuclear waste disposal. Japan can lock in cheap, clean, and highly reliable perpetual energy.
The old certainties of fossils are rapidly fading. The world is moving to solar and wind at a similar speed to digital photography’s displacement of film cameras. Hopefully, Japan does not have its very own Kodak moment.

These can also efficiently collect off-peak sunshine.
These trees will be an integral part of solar cities planned across the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The Uttar Pradesh government proposes to develop 20 cities of the State as ‘Solar Cities’ with emphasis on solar rooftops and other allied off-grid solar installations. 
Cities selected are Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Agra, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bareilly, Aligarh, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Gorakhpur, Noida, Firozabad, Jhansi, Muzaffarnagar, Mathura, Ayodhya, Azamgarh, and Mirzapur. 
The solar cities will host 1 kW solar trees with LED street lighting systems and 2.5 kW solar trees for illumination of gardens and parks. The Uttar Pradesh New & Renewable Energy Development Agency (UPNEDA) has issued a tender to supply and install these systems for 16 of the proposed solar cities. 
While solar trees are not a new phenomenon globally, Guinness World Records has confirmed the world’s largest solar tree has been installed in India at the Centre of Excellence for Farm Machinery, Ludhiana, in Punjab. The tree, with 309.83m2 of solar panel surface, was constructed by the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, part of the government’s Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.
The structure has a generation capacity of 53.6kWp and can generate an estimated 160-200kWh per day.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/20/australia-commissions-first-big-battery-at-a-former-coal-site/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 20, 2023",Australia commissions first big battery at a former coal site,"From pv magazine Australia
One of Australia’s most historic coal hubs, Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, has today seen the commissioning of the nation’s first big battery to go into operations within a former coal site. The 150 MW/150 MWh battery was jointly funded and developed by French energy giant Engie and Eku Energy, the battery storage platform of Macquarie Group.
The Hazelwood battery is believed to be Australia’s largest privately funded utility-scale battery to date.

The commissioning of the Hazelwood battery brings Australia to its first gigawatt of installed battery storage, Energy Synapse founder Marija Petkovic recently pointed out.
Hazelwood’s battery facility has been supplied, and will be operated and maintained, by US-headquartered firm Fluence. The project is the first to use Fluence’s Gridstack battery system, which the company says is built for the “most demanding applications” including flexible peaking capacity, and frequency regulation. The facility incorporates 342 modular Fluence Cubes.

While the battery currently only has one hour of duration, it is believed the project will eventually grow – following a broader trend in Australia towards supersized batteries. “With [the battery’s] access to transmission and available space at site, Hazelwood is the perfect location for an asset that can grow in depth and duration, increasing the hosting capacity for renewables,” Engie’s Australian CEO, Rik De Buyserie, said. 
The Hazelwood site is reported to have access to 1.6 GW of dormant transmission capacity.
The coal-fired Hazelwood Power Station was built in the 1960s and closed in 2017, giving just five months notice before its retirement. Power prices in Victoria soared as a consequence, and the debacle led to state governments to impose much stricter rules around notice periods of generation retirements.
While Hazelwood is the first coal-site battery to come into operation, it belongs within a much larger movement. Coal plants are ideal sites for big batteries thanks to their grid connection and existing infrastructure, and there are a huge number of retired and retiring coal plants today which either have big batteries in construction or planning. 
In the Latrobe Valley alone, AGL is constructing a 200 MW/800 MWh battery at its Loy Yang power station. Meanwhile, EnergyAustralia is planing 350 MW/1.4 GWh big battery at Yallourn coal-fired power station, set to retire by mid-2028.
“The Latrobe Valley has been the home of Victoria’s energy generation for decades and new investment in technologies like energy storage this will help solidify its role in our renewable energy future,” Victoria’s Minister for Energy and Resources, Lily D’Ambrosio, said.
She opened the Hazelwood battery on Wednesday, saying the project plays a key role in achieving Victoria’s energy storage targets of at least 2.6 GW of storage capacity by 2030 and at least 6.3 GW by 2035.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/20/solar-awning-for-recreational-vehicles/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 20, 2023",Solar awning for recreational vehicles,"From pv magazine USA
There are a lot of solar options for recreational vehicles, from parking canopies to mountable solar panels and portable solar kits. The latest innovation comes from Eco-dynamic Tech, an Illinois-based company that is introducing a roll-out solar awning for recreational vehicles (RVs).
The awning, called Artpiece for RV, is a 1000 W array that extends from the side of the vehicle, providing a shaded patio space below while generating electricity from the sun above.
Eco-dynamic offers a few different customizable colorways for the awning, with unique designs that the company said are highly resistant to fading.
“Solar product should not just be a practical equipment, it can also be a shining piece of art,” said Michael Soon, vice president of business development, Eco-dynamic Tech.
Flexible heterojunction (HJT) cells are used as the powerhouse of the awning. HJT cells are being increasingly evaluated for their flexibility and high levels of bifaciality, meaning that both sides of the panel collect light and produce electricity, taking advantage of reflected light from below.
The HJT solar array offers 1040 W peak power, a 108.3 V operating voltage, and a 9.6 A operating current. The array can be completely retracted and rolled 360 degrees for storage. Colorways include “Apple Green,” “Peacock Blue,” and “Narcissus Purple.”
The company reports that with under eight hours of sunlight, the awning can power major RV appliances. For example, Eco-Dynamic Tech says it can power a 300 W air conditioner for 26.6 hours, a 100 W refrigerator for 53 hours, a typical laptop for 36.3 hours, and even a 2800 W oven for nearly three hours.
The company recommends having a battery bank on board to store the awning’s clean energy production. It should be compatible with output specifications of the awning, which the company can help troubleshoot.
The structure is made from 6061 aluminum profile brackets, which are known for stability and resistance to corrosion. An electric motor that extends and retracts it in about 60 seconds, and LED lights are integrated on the awning. It also comes with a radio-controlled remote control that can operate the electric motor from over 100 feet away, the company reports.
Eco-dynamic recommends measuring your RV side surface area where the awning is planned to be installed to right-size it to your RV. A typical Artpiece for RV awning measures 144.2 inches by 96.5 inches, though other sizes are available. Currently, the company recommends that a professional partner installs the structure, and it will ship the product to an approved installer for the service. Shipments of product are expected in late 2023, said Eco-dynamic.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/20/spotlight-on-topcon-pi-berlin-shares-concerns-about-degradation/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 20, 2023",Spotlight on TOPCon: PI Berlin shares concerns about degradation,"From pv magazine Global
TOPCon technology has gained a strong foothold in the PV market and is projected to account for more than 75% of n-type capacity by 2023, according to Edurne Zoco of S&P Global Commodity Insights.
Chinese manufacturers have made significant investments in this cell technology, and investors, independent power producers (IPPs), and funds are already becoming familiar with its potential. One contributing factor to TOPCon‘s success story is its price, which has decreased to just around €0.01 ($0.01)/W more than PERC’s over the past two years.
TOPCon outperforms PERC in various “tangible” indicators, including bifaciality coefficient, efficiency, temperature coefficients, and annual degradation. Consequently, financial models based on TOPCon show a more attractive return on investment compared to PERC. Asier Ukar, director of the Spanish headquarters of PI Berlin, says this often serves as the primary driver for choosing TOPCon technology.
However, Ukar notes the importance of not solely relying on data from datasheets but also conducting a thorough and transparent analysis of the technology’s long-term behavior, specifically in relation to degradation mechanisms. According to Ukar, it is crucial to identify and address potential risks associated with TOPCon technology early on.
One particular risk identified by PI Berlin is related to the presence of aluminum at the cell-to-cell contacts, which are located at the front of the cell where moisture accumulates. Damp-heat testing and subsequent electroluminescence testing can detect this issue. TOPCon cells are more sensitive to water vapor, so it is recommended to use polyolefin elastomer (POE) on the front side for glass-glass modules, while POE on both sides is preferred for glass-backsheet modules.
Another risk arises from the pressure to reduce the amount of silver in TOPCon cells’ busbars, leading to thinner busbars and a less robust grip on the cell. This can result in mechanical damage to the printing and finger interruptions or breaks, leading to decreased performance due to increased effective series resistance. Electroluminescence tests can detect these issues.
TOPCon technology also faces degradation challenges similar to those of PERC technology, such as polarization-induced degradation (PID-p). The front side of TOPCon cells, which has a structure similar to the back side of PERC, can be affected by this phenomenon.
Furthermore, the aluminum oxide passivation layers in TOPCon cells are prone to UV degradation. While PERC technology is not significantly affected due to the aluminum being on the back side, TOPCon is more susceptible because the aluminum oxide passivation layers are located on the light-exposed front side.
Ukar notes the need for adjustments in quality control during TOPCon fabrication, including sample size and specific tests in the laboratory, to address the risks inherent to TOPCon technology. Extended duration tests, such as Damp Heat, Thermal Cycling, or Humidity Freeze, are crucial for assessing the long-term reliability of modules beyond the standard data specified in the datasheet.
Within the bill of materials (BOM) for TOPCon modules, the encapsulant is a key component. An inadequate or low-quality encapsulant can nullify the benefits of TOPCon compared to PERC. The 2023 scorecard by PVEL, which includes the PID192h test, demonstrates substantial variations in extended durability results among different BOMs, even within the same manufacturer.
Ukar notes that some manufacturers relax the acceptance and rejection criteria for TOPCon compared to PERC to minimize yield loss and maintain productivity. However, it is crucial to identify and address these risks early on and with transparency from the industry to fully exploit the benefits of TOPCon.
Despite the associated risks, properly manufactured TOPCon modules outperform PERC and exhibit minimal degradation phenomena.
