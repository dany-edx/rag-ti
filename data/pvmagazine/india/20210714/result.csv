As of May 2021, we have 95.6 gigawatts (GW) of installed renewable energy capacity, almost half of which (41 GW) is solar energy. Raising its renewable energy ambitions further, India has created an ecosystem to support solar product manufacturing alongside storage to enable accelerated integration of renewable energy into the grid.
To boost domestic manufacturing, the Indian government initiated various policy measures such as the National Solar Mission in 2010 and the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS) in 2012. To lend further assistance to the stressed sector, the government then introduced measures such as the Domestic Content Requirement (DCR) in 2014 and the Safeguard Duty (SGD) in 2018 to dampen the influx of cheap imports. 
In late 2019, Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) issued a landmark project development tender for 12 GW of solar generation capacity and within that a tied contract for 3 GW of domestic module manufacturing capacity, to provide a boost to domestic production by linking it with a big solar tender. 
In April 2021, the government approved the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the solar PV manufacturing sector, with INR 4500 crore (US$603 million) allocated by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) for investment in high-efficiency solar PV modules. In a further move to make domestic solar manufacturing competitive, the Ministry of Finance has provided long-term policy certainty by issuing an order to impose 40% and 25% Basic Custom Duty (BCD) from April 1, 2022 on the import of solar modules and solar cells, respectively.
Renewable energy is deflationary, with costs for setting up solar PV projects dropping by more than 80% in India between 2010 and 2020. The government has set huge targets for renewable energy capacity in the next decade, which now need to be matched by solar supply chain manufacturing capacity.
The government has provided clear incentives in the form of capital support, tax incentives, imposition of tariff barriers, etc. to boost domestic manufacturing of solar products. While these initiatives are working – the share of domestic modules installed in total in India increased from 15% to 35% in the last three years – the industry remains heavily reliant on imported modules from China and other countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
Prime Minister Modi aims to make India a self-reliant economy and has ratcheted up calls to boost local manufacturing and reduce India’s reliance on imports. With new fiscal and policy measures announced by the government, it’s now time for solar manufacturers to ramp up capacity and set up large GW-based manufacturing units in India, driving local investment and employment while improving self-reliance. Since 2015, India has on average imported solar cells and modules worth Rs17,600 crore (US$2.6 billion) annually. Moving into module and cell manufacturing with completely integrated facilities would put solar developers at an advantage against currency fluctuation and supply chain disruptions.
Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, has just announced an INR 75,000 crore (US$10 billion) investment plan into clean energy in India, which includes plans to develop gigafactories to develop and manufacture solar modules, batteries, fuel cells, and more. If successful, this will help strengthen India’s input value chain and help protect the country from the vagaries of price volatility internationally. 
Last year, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the global economy and countries restricted movement across borders, development of new renewable energy capacity came to a halt. While the situation improved towards the middle of the last year and imports resumed, India again saw some restrictions internally in material imports as we faced a devastating second wave in the months of April and May. Given India’s current heavy reliance on imported inputs, becoming self-reliant and boosting production across the value chain will play an important role in achieving our renewable energy target and driving sustainable economic growth. 
The expansion of domestic solar will create millions of jobs and incomes. It is already increasing the share value of renewable energy companies in India. Solar panel glass manufacturer Borosil Renewables has increased production significantly in the last 2-3 years and has seen enhanced investor interest and share appreciation. The company has big plans for expansion based on India becoming a manufacturing hub for leading-edge solar glass production. 
Through various initiatives and schemes, the Indian government has created a conducive environment for industry stakeholders to expand domestic manufacturing. Industry must now respond positively to these signals by setting up large-capacity solar manufacturing in India that not only meets domestic requirements but increases exports to other countries as well.
While China is currently the world leader in solar manufacturing, India has huge domestic potential that should be fully exploited, and in doing so, providing a leading example of transition for neighboring countries. Although there will be an initial plateauing of the solar deflation, these will again trend downwards medium term as economies of scale pick up and technology innovation accelerates.
India should also seize this opportunity to manufacture emerging technologies such as monocrystalline (mono-Si), bifacial and half-cut cells, micro-inverters, and tracking equipment, all of which promise further solar efficiency gains over the coming years.
India has set an ambitious target to achieve 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Solar manufacturers should fast track the expansion of domestic production as well as backward integration plans. There is robust demand and increased government support for manufacturing self-reliance. An aggressive manufacturing scale-up would cater to domestic demand and open up opportunities for new technologies like green ammonia and hydrogen while opening new avenues of exports, especially after the COVID-19 supply chain shock that forced nations to start looking at alternatives to imports.

(GHIAL) has announced the commissioning of a second 5 MW solar power plant within the airport land in the Indian State of Telangana. With this, its total solar power capacity has now increased to 10 MW. In 2015, GMR Hyderabad International Airport had commissioned a 5 MW solar plant for its captive consumption.
The aggregate 10 MW capacity in the airport is spread over an area of 45 acres, employing more than 30,000 solar panels. Both the 5 MW solar plants use advanced ABB central inverters and polycrystalline PV panels.
With the latest addition of 5 MW capacity, GHIAL will be able to reduce the power dependency on the Telangana State Electricity Board by 12 million units per year, thereby saving around INR 90 lakh per month. Further, 50% of the energy requirements of Hyderabad Airport can be met through solar power.

The facility was inaugurated by Subhash Desai, Minister of Industries and Mining, Maharashtra.
“Maharashtra has been in the forefront of EV development. Under our draft Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy 2021, we aim to bring at least 1,46,000 new battery-operated electric vehicles on state roads by 2025, estimated to comprise about 10% of all new vehicle registrations by that time. We support our very own local start-ups like Magenta to drive the adoption of EV in the state and the country and soon globally,” said the minister.
The first-of-its-kind Magenta public charging station will be functional round the clock with 21 AC/DC chargers for 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, and 4-wheelers. 
The station has four DC chargers of 15-50 kW capacity and 17 AC chargers of 3.5-7.5 kW. The fast DC chargers can charge a vehicle in 45 minutes. Further, a parking bay has been developed to allow overnight charging of EVs via a slow AC charger. 
The chargers can be operated through the ChargeGrid App. The app allows online remote monitoring and includes an automated payment gateway, thereby eliminating the need to have a station marshal monitor, maintain, and operate the chargers at the location. The chargers are powered by a combined 40 kW rooftop solar plant.
“The setting up of this public EV charging station in Mumbai is a revolutionary move to support the government initiative of setting up 400,000 charging stations to meet the requirement for two million electric vehicles (EV) that could potentially ply on its roads by 2026,” read a Magenta statement. 
“Currently, as per EV industry body Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles, there are 1,800 charging stations in India as of March 2021 for approximately 16,200 electric cars, including the fleet segment.” 
Magenta had recently raised INR 120-crore funding from American philanthropist Kiran Patel. It intends to pump in INR 30 crore to build its charger development and manufacturing unit for India and for exports. This integrated charging plus development plus manufacturing unit will cater to the development and production of the AC chargers along with the streetlamp chargers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/14/solar-module-cooling-techniques-for-the-desert/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 14, 2021",Solar module cooling techniques for the desert,"From pv magazine International
A group of scientists from the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, in Saudi Arabia, has assessed the performance of several cooling techniques in solar PV systems subject to the country’s harsh environmental conditions.
The researchers’ analysis embraced passive cooling systems based on a heat sink or a heat sink embedded into phase change materials (PCMs), as well as active cooling relying on micro-flat heat pipes, either immersed or not immersed in an immersion fluid.
The passive technologies were assessed under two different configurations: an 11%-efficient polycrystalline solar module with a power output of 15 W, equipped with six aluminum heat sinks on the back panel; and the same panel equipped with heat sinks placed into a highly thermally conductive aluminum container filled with TPM350, which is a phase change material offering a high thermal conductivity and melting at 50 degrees Celsius. In all configurations, the solar panels were tilted at 25 degrees and south-oriented. Measurements took into account output power, the surface temperature of the modules, and power conversion efficiency.
Active cooling was considered in two forms: a system consisting of a row of four heat pipes cooled by flowing water and place onto the back of the panel; and another one consisting of four heat pipes immersed in a box of liquid, as liquid bulk, integrated with the back of the solar panel. “This technology is interesting for cooling purposes because it uses buoyancy flow of liquid and evaporative cooling in the heat pipes, as a means of transferring thermal energy,” the scientists explained, referring to the second system and noting that three different liquids, such as engine oil, ethylene glycol, and regular water, were tested.
The two passive techniques were found not to be performant enough to ensure proper cooling. That technique with the simple heat sinks was able to lower the module operating temperature by 10 degrees Celsius, on average; and that based on the PCM was able to guarantee sufficient cooling only for the first two hours. “When melting was completed, the PCM became ineffective, allowing the panel temperature to rise sharply, becoming greater than that of the uncooled panel due to the thermal resistance of the PCM,” the Saudi group stated, adding that a PCM with a higher melting point should be utilized.
As for the active system, the most effective was that based on four heat pipes immersed in water, which was able to reduce the panel temperature by up to 53%; followed by those immersed in ethylene glycol, which results in a 48% reduction; and those immersed in engine oil, which lowered the module temperature by 25%. The lowest percentage – 21% – was obtained by the row of four heat pipes cooled by flowing water. “Lower panel temperatures and higher open-circuit voltages at the solar panel terminals were found if the panel was actively cooled using heat pipes immersed in regular water,” the academics emphasized. “In this configuration, the voltage increment was 13%, relatively compared to the uncooled panel configuration.”
The findings of the research can be found in the paper Innovative technique for achieving uniform temperatures across solar panels using heat pipes and liquid immersion cooling in the harsh climate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, published in Alexandria Engineering Journal.
