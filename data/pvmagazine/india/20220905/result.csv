Fixed-tilt systems occupy the remaining 87% share. The Indian market has only seen increased solar tracker adoption in recent years, with China’s Arctech emerging as a leading supplier.  
Arctech has provided 3.5 GW of solar trackers to the Indian market since starting operations there in 2015. It recently opened a 3 GW factory in India through a joint venture, Jash Energy, as it looks to bring down the prices of its trackers and increase adoption among customers in India. 
“Local supply and local manufacturing make more sense, given the high costs of logistics and longer lead times in supply chain in the recent years hit by Covid pandemic. Our top priority is to bring down the prices of our trackers for India customers and thus enable a lower cost of electricity in the nation,” Gail Chen, the director and CEO of Jash Energy, told pv magazine.
In the beginning, the India facility will locally source 70% to 80% of the raw materials for the trackers, said Chen, who is also the general manager of East Asia and India at Arctech. The plan is to entirely localize in the future. 
“Arctech always sees India as our second home base after China. We started our operations in India in 2015 and have shipped 3.5 GW since then,” said Chen. “In years 2017 and 2018, the market was very quiet for trackers, but we made a grand comeback in 2019 by signing a 1.7 GW order in India. The increasing use of bifacial modules and decline in the prices of modules made more sense to use trackers now.”   
The Jash Energy factory spans more than 16 acres in Mundra, Gujarat. It is modeled after Arctech’s existing Chinese manufacturing base, with automated production lines.
“By having this local production plant, we can guarantee a shorter delivery timeline, quicker response to needs, and most of all, a more competitive pricing strategy. We believe the JV factory will bring more benefits to our customers,” said Chen.
Shail Shah, the director of Jash Energy, said pandemic disruptions have been a key challenge. 
“As a result, the costs of steel, cement, and other materials drastically increased. Hence, completing the project on time and without cost overrun was the biggest challenge that we faced. I am glad we finally overcome it with the set-up of the JV factory,” said Shah.

The developer will build this plant at Bhungar site in Mahuva, at Bhavnagar, Gujarat, under the Gujarat hybrid power policy 2018.
The project is set for commissioning in March 2023. The company has achieved financial closure of INR 132 crore from the State Bank of India for the project.
KPI has also arranged long-term power purchase agreements to sell power generated from the hybrid power project upon commissioning.
KPI Green supplies power as an independent power producer (IPP) and captive power producer (CPP) under the Solarism brand. It has commissioned over 165 MW of solar capacity till June 30, 2023. The company targets 1 GW capacity by 2025, with 750 MW as a captive power producer and 250 MW as an independent power producer.

The all-in-one systems come in 1,100 VA and 2,100 VA ratings, with operating voltages of 12.8 V and 25.6 V, respectively. 
The system’s built-in lithium (LFP) battery can be charged with solar as well as grid electricity. 
“Since this is a hybrid version, it will auto-select solar power source first for battery charging and support load during the daytime, which reduces the power consumption for battery charging and saves the electricity cost for our users,” said the company. “This inverter also has an inbuilt battery management system that helps to keep every cell in healthy condition and enhances the life of LFP batteries.” 
Lakshmi Narayana Pacha, the CMO of Mecwin India, noted that tubular [lead-acid] batteries are widely used in India for inverter applications.
“These batteries are unsafedue to acid spillage and require frequent maintenance and large space,” said Pacha. “[In comparison], our Mecwin Li Power Lite series is wall-mountable, zero maintenance, and highly safe with inbuilt BMS.”
The system supports AC loads like computers, lights, fans, TVs, routers, and printers. It is recommended for individual homes, farmhouses, retail shops, restaurants, and internet cafes.
The 1,100 VA model supports an 880 W load and provides two hours of power backup at full load and four-hour backup at 50% load. The 2,100 VA model supports a 1,680 W load and can give power backup for two hours at full load and four hours at 50% load. 
Three 330 Wp panels can be connected to the 1,100 VA system, whereas the 2,100 VA system can take a maximum of six panels of 330 W each.  The 1,100 VA system uses a 12.8V, 86 Ah LiFePo4 battery with a storage capacity of 1.1 kWh. The 2100 VA system uses a 25.6V, 86Ah LiFePo4 battery with a storage capacity of 2.2 kWh. The 1,100 VA system measures 455x530x235 mm and weighs 23 kg.

H2X Global said its new 5 kW fuel cell generator, which uses hydrogen to generate electricity with zero emissions, has been sold to the Plumbing Industry Climate Action Centre (PICAC) for use at its Hydrogen Centre of Excellence in Queensland, Australia.
The Power H2 unit, which is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell and comes equipped with a small hydrogen storage tank, will be installed at the PICAC facility. The center, which is due to open in October, will serve as Australia’s first dedicated hydrogen training facility.
H2X Global CEO Brendan Norman said the sale of the demonstration model marked a turning point for the use of renewable energy in emergency and off-grid power supply.
“We have developed a range of fuel cell generators delivering differing power outputs to be the alternative to fossil-fuel generators in the energy transition to zero emissions,” he said. “The generator is a turnkey hydrogen power solution with a zero-emissions operation.”
Norman said the hydrogen fuel cell gensets, which will be available in sizes ranging from 2 kW to 100 kW capacity, are ideal as a backup power systems for hospitals and businesses.
“The H2X generators are ideally suited to replace standard petrol or diesel generators, allowing you to switch to an emission-free hydrogen fuel cell operation,” he said.
The sale of the demonstration model was overseen by Sydney-based company Pure Hydrogen, which owns a 23% stake in H2X Global.
“This power generation unit has at its heart, a hydrogen fuel cell and a powertrain that have been developed over several years,” said Pure Hydrogen Managing Director Scott Brown. “This technology is at the forefront of the hydrogen revolution, and it is great to see it being implemented commercially.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/05/the-economics-of-perovskite-solar-manufacturing/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,INDIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2022",The economics of perovskite solar manufacturing,"From pv magazine Global
After quickly demonstrating potential for high-efficiency solar energy using lower cost materials and lower energy in fabrication compared to today’s silicon PV technology, perovskites are well on their way to commercialization. Many different possibilities exist as to the form these commercial products could take, and the materials they could contain. And it’s likely that more than one option could prove commercially viable.
Scientists led by the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland designed one possible process for the production of single-junction perovskite modules. They modeled all of the associated costs for manufacturing and installation of modules produced on a 100 MW production line based on their processes.
They described the production line and modeling in full in “Design and Cost Analysis of 100 MW Perovskite Solar Panel Manufacturing Process in Different Locations,” published in ACS Energy Letters. The group compared various material and processing options and found that a tin-oxide electron transport layer coupled with silver paste electrode would yield the lowest production cost and energy consumption, of the options compared in the study.
The group also calculated the minimum sustainable price, levelized cost of energy, and energy payback time for various locations. On the manufacturing side, they noted significant regional differences in the cost of processing glass, while their energy cost and payback calculations were largely affected by different land, labor and energy costs between regions, as well as climate conditions for installation.
The model predicts that a 100 MW perovskite production would require approximately 5.6 kWh of electricity per square meter of module. Based on installation in sunny locations such as Spain or Egypt, it could achieve an LCOE between $0.03/kWh and $0.04/kWh, reaching energy payback in a little over six months.
