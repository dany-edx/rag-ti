https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/21/india-offers-the-least-lcoe-for-rooftop-solar-and-third-largest-generation-potential/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA,WORLD",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 21, 2021","India offers lowest LCOE for rooftop PV, third-best generation potential","A global study finds India to be the most cost-effective country for rooftop solar energy generation, ahead of China, the UK, and the USA. The cost of the maximum PV electricity generation (LCOE) from a given rooftop area in India is the lowest at US$66/MWh, according to the study which is based on data available as of 2018. After India, China (at US$68/MWh) has the lowest cost for attaining the potential energy. The USA ($238/MWh) and the UK ($251/MWh) are among some of the costliest countries.
Even though the LCOE difference between India and China is minimal, rooftop solar PV technology rollout becomes more favorable in India than in China due to greater solar endowment and high yield factor. The average cost of obtaining solar rooftop potential in India would vary between $60 and $85 per megawatt-hour, with the costs being the lowest in Gujarat and Rajasthan, as per the study.
This first-of-its-kind study to assess global energy generation from rooftop solar PV systems has been co-authored by Priyadarshi Shukla, professor at Ahmedabad University and director of its Global Centre for Environment and Energy, Shivika Mittal from Imperial College London, and James Glynn from Columbia University. The team was led by Siddharth Joshi, researcher at MaREI, the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine in University College Cork. Joshi was supported by his colleagues, Professor Brian Ó Gallachóir and Professor Paul Holloway.  
The study also found a global rooftop solar energy generation potential of 27 petawatt-hour per year. Nearly 20% (5 PWh/year) of the global potential is located within the areas with a high population density (>1500 people/km2) due to a corresponding increase in the building stock, with 55% (15 PWh/year) of the potential being dispersed within the low-density areas within the low-density areas (<500 people/km2).  
Among the countries, China (4.3 PWh/year), USA (4.2 PWh/year) and India (1.7 PWh/year) have the highest solar energy generation potential.
In India, Maharashtra (181 terawatt-hour per year) and Uttar Pradesh (168.07 terawatt-hour per year) have the highest solar rooftop potential. 
“Solar energy is generated during daytime coinciding with the time when electricity demand is at its peak. India’s solar rooftop potential of 1.7 petawatt-hour per year is very significant. We would be able to match India’s current electricity demand of 1.3 petawatt-hour per annum if we install efficient solar panels on 40% of the country’s available rooftop area,” said Professor Shukla. 
The researchers employed a modeling framework to assess the electricity generation potential of rooftop solar PV systems globally and its associated costs. The authors mapped 130 million km2 of global land surface area to identify 0.2 million km2 of rooftop area using a machine learning algorithm. This rooftop area was then analyzed to document the global electricity generation potential of rooftop solar PV. 
“For the first time, we can analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of global rooftop photovoltaics with improved accuracy using a combination of big data, machine learning, and GIS. This study can aid in improved representation of RTSPVs in global energy systems,” said Joshi of UCC.
The energy generation potential of rooftop solar panels exceeded the global yearly aggregated energy consumption in 2018. However, its future potential will depend on the development and cost of storage solutions for the generated energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/21/enabling-the-transition-to-electric-mobility/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,EV BATTERIES,EV CHARGERS,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,INDIA",,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",Enabling the transition to electric mobility,"Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is gaining traction across the country and is increasingly becoming the preferred choice for consumers. India recorded total sales of 1,56,741 EVs in the first eight months of 2021, i.e. 130 per cent of the total vehicles sold in the whole of 2020. 
EVs have fared better than internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts on a range of policy goals, including enhanced energy security, reduced reliance on crude oil, better air quality, and lower greenhouse gas emission. Consequently, 20 states have announced EV policies, set targets for various vehicle segments and charging infrastructure, and provided an array of benefits including incentives based on battery size, waiver of registration fees, road taxes, etc.
With various positive developments, the economics of EVs have improved significantly. As per KPMG analysis, in India, parity in the total cost of ownership (TCO) already exists in the two-wheeler (2W) vehicle segment, signaling improved affordability for this category of EVs. The current incentives offered by states and incentives under faster adoption and manufacturing of hybrid and electric vehicles (FAME)-II scheme make even upfront cost parity of E2W vis-à-vis ICE. These incentives have spurred the sales for E2W, where E2W sales reached 1 per cent of the total 2W market in FY22. 
For E3W, there is TCO parity with the FAME-II purchase incentives. However, as the battery costs decline to below US$140 per kWh, the E3W parity will be achieved without any purchase incentives. E3W has fared better than E2W with a 40 per cent penetration level in the 3W segment. For cars, the parity is linked to usage, and for the usage of more than 100 km per day (or ~30,000 km per annum) parity can be achieved. 
In addition, the Government of India (GoI) is also focused on converting the fleet of state-run transport undertaking’s buses into electric buses, for which, it has allocated around INR3,500 crore in the FAME-II scheme. Advancements in battery technologies and auto component manufacturing are expected to further reduce the costs and support the upward march towards the electric future.
To support the advancement in battery technologies, during May 2021, GoI extended the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the advanced chemistry cell (ACC) battery manufacturing with an allocation of INR18,100 crore. The scheme is aimed at promoting (a) the establishment of battery giga-factories in India, (b) research and development in battery technologies, and (c) bringing scale to production and transform sectors, including mobility. Battery occupies a significant portion of the cost of an EV, and a reduction in its costs will enhance the affordability of EVs.
Today, India entirely imports its requirement for ACC batteries. Hence, the scheme will go a long way in reducing India’s import dependency on this upcoming technology choice and the impending energy security concerns. The scheme aims to achieve a manufacturing capacity of 50 GWh in the next five years.
As per the guidelines, a single beneficiary can develop a maximum of 20 GWh of capacity, with a minimum capacity of 5GWh. The selected manufacturers have to ensure a minimum 60 per cent domestic value addition within five years at a project level. 
The scheme is open to both domestic and international players and can be instrumental in bringing best-in-class technology choices to the country. The scheme is technology agnostic wherein technologies with higher energy density and cycle life will be preferred, thus laying focus on newer and niche cell technologies.
Along with the ACC battery PLI scheme, GoI in September 2021, announced PLI for auto, auto components, and drone industries. Originally envisaged to be an INR57,000 crore scheme, the revised INR26,000 crore aims to promote investments in advanced automotive technologies’ global supply chain, with a focus on EVs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. This allocation indicates the directional shift towards advanced technologies across the automobile and allied sectors. 
With an exclusive focus on EVs and related components, and coupled with PLI for battery manufacturing, the scheme is likely to improve the competitiveness of EV manufacturing and take growth to the next level. At the end of its five-year tenure, the scheme is expected to facilitate the fresh investment of over INR42,500 crore, incremental production of over INR2.3 lakh crore with additional employment opportunities of over 7.5 lakh jobs.
KPMG in India published a thought leadership in October 2020, titled, “Shifting gears: the evolving electric vehicle (EV) landscape in India”. Based on the analysis, we expect that EV penetration by 2030 is likely to reach 25 to 35 per cent for 2W and 65 to 75 per cent for 3W. In case of 4W space, penetration is expected to be 10 to 15 per cent in the passenger vehicle segment and 20 to 30 per cent in the commercial vehicle segment by 2030. Additionally, about 10 to 12 per cent of the overall market for buses is expected to be electrified by 2030.
The developments related to the PLI scheme are likely to further accelerate this transition by providing a relative cost advantage and ease of availability of key components domestically. At the same time, it will also open up the market for new-age companies and innovators across the value chain, including manufacturing of battery packs, global supply chains, EVs, charging infrastructure, battery recycling and swapping infrastructure, and a host of other value-added services.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/21/grid-scale-battery-storage-and-green-hydrogen-market-shaping-up-in-india/,"ELECTROLYZER,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,LI-ION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",Grid-scale battery storage and green hydrogen market shaping up in India,"The market for battery storage and green hydrogen could scale up rapidly in India, bolstered by government policy and private company ventures, according to a new briefing note from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
“Grid-scale energy storage technologies will play a critical role in India’s decarbonization journey, helping to integrate the 450 gigawatts (GW) of variable renewable energy capacity targeted by 2030 into the grid,” says the note’s author IEEFA analyst Kashish Shah.
“The Government is giving the right push for the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) market through production-linked incentive schemes, big battery storage capacity tenders and improving the market structure to be more competitive.”
Shah adds Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd’s recent entry into the country’s clean energy scene, including plans for battery manufacturing and green hydrogen production, is providing huge impetus.
“By acquiring Norwegian solar module manufacturer REC and a 40% stake in India’s Sterling and Wilson Solar, Reliance is already showing it’s serious about delivering on its ambition to lead renewable energy investment in India,” he says.
“India’s battery market could boom quickly,” Shah adds, “just as we have seen happen in other markets such as the U.S. and Australia.” 
To date, the cost of grid-scale battery storage has been prohibitive for India as the nation lacks a domestic battery manufacturing value chain. In comparison, globally the cost of battery storage has reduced dramatically – the price for a standalone lithium-ion battery set-up is projected to drop to US$58/kWh by 2030 from US$1,100/kWh in 2011. 
The note points to positive signs that the market in India is gearing up for batteries with growing momentum from private power companies. Tata Power’s 10MW/10MWh (1-hour storage) battery in its Delhi distribution network is currently the only grid-scale battery operating in India but the company’s upcoming storage project in Ladakh – comprising 50MWh of storage capacity co-located with 50MW of solar capacity – will be India’s largest battery.
The involvement of credible government-owned counterparties is vital to enabling capital deployment for battery storage. State-owned entities, Shah says, have also now come into the fold for facilitating grid-scale battery storage development, citing the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and NTPC tenders for development of 2,000MWh and 1,000MWh of battery storage capacity, respectively. 
In another policy development, the Central Electricity Regulatory Authority (CERC) aims to bring battery storage and pumped hydro storage (PHS) into the ambit of the frequency control and ancillary services (FCAS) market. 
“Valuing the speed and accuracy of grid balancing services that batteries and PHS could provide at competitive market prices will allow a clear revenue stream for the owners of these storage assets,” says Shah.
“Domestic enterprises and global giants, attracted to India’s market potential and buoyed by government support, are assessing local battery manufacturing.” And, “further regulations will be required to guide development and underpin commercial success.”
Meanwhile, steel giant ArcelorMittal has plans to build 4.5GW of solar capacity in Rajasthan and green hydrogen production capacity backed by solar and wind in Gujarat. Also, ACME Solar, one of India’s biggest solar developers, has commissioned the world’s first commercial pilot of integrated green hydrogen and green ammonia production facility in Rajasthan. 
“As with batteries, the green hydrogen industry will require the building of a domestic hydrogen production value chain,” Shah says. “The most important part of this value chain is the electrolyzers for which the costs have come down across the globe, led by makers in the U.S., China, and Scandinavia.”
The note points out that to support this value chain, the government plans to implement a green hydrogen consumption obligation (GHCO) mechanism in fertilizer production and petroleum refining, similar to the renewable purchase obligation (RPO). To further encourage the usage of green hydrogen by industries, the fuel has been included under the RPO regulations. 
There is also interest in developing industrial clusters that pair green hydrogen production with its industrial use, such as hubs of steel, coal, fertilizer, biogas, and heavy transport.
“These are all industries that have much to gain from a transition to green hydrogen,” says Shah. “Similar clusters are under development in the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, and Australia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/21/big-modules-head-for-standardization/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",Big modules head for standardization,"From pv magazine International
According to an announcement from module manufacturer Trina Solar, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) is poised to announce a set of standard dimensions for large format modules relying on the 210mm wafer launched by Zhonghuan Semiconductor back in 2019.
The standard, according to Trina, will be set out for different cell layouts as in the table below. Having a standard set of dimensions should make thing simpler, and therefore cheaper, for project developers and component suppliers, all of whom have to deal with significant uncertainty over module sizes and electrical characteristics since the switch to larger wafer formats began to play out.

The process began in May, when the CPIA brought together industry experts and representatives from across the supply chain to agree on a set of standards for products incorporating the 210mm wafer. Cell & module manufacturers including Trina Solar, Risen Energy, Canadian Solar and Tongwei – all of which have chosen to work with the 210mm wafer rather than then smaller 182mm product being promoted by Longi and others – took part in the CPIA event and agreed to standardize various technical details of the modules including module dimensions, size & positioning of mounting system attachment holes and other details including cell spacing. Modules will also be designed to meet the latest international standards including IEC 61730, published by the Switzerland-based International Electrotechnical Commission.
“This means 210mm module manufacturers, end users and system solution providers have achieved uniformity in technical issues,” said Trina Solar in a statement. “Standardization of modules will greatly reduce BOS costs and LCOE, and deliver the convenience and maximum value of ultra-high power modules and solutions to solar applications.”
Trina says it expects the move for standardization to directly result in cost reductions for balance of systems components, and a more efficient supply chain. On top this, it expects the manufacturing industry to be able to innovate and bring new processes to scale more quickly, and to bring down manufacturing costs as well.
