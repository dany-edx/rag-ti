Techbec Green Energy will have a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility spanning 40,000 sq. ft. in Sonipat, Haryana. It will manufacture key EV charger components like power modules, CCS 2 guns, Type 2 guns, connectors, control cards, PLC modules and lithium-ion batteries.
Servotech and its subsidiary envisage an initial investment of INR 30 crore ($3.65 million) to procure testing equipment, manpower, machinery, cutting-edge technology, and support other allied activities. It plans to invest INR 300 crore additionally by March 2025 to upscale operations.
To streamline the corporate structure, Servotech is divesting its stake of 63.5% in its arm Techbec Global Solutions, which was primarily engaged in manufacturing battery storage solutions like lithium-ion batteries and other allied activities for EVs, e-rickshaws and varied solar-powered solutions.
“As part of its long-term vision, Servotech aims to focus its resources and investments on ventures that offer greater potential for scalable growth and market penetration. The divestment [of Techbec Global Solutions] allows Servotech to realign its portfolio, optimize its resources, and pursue new opportunities in line with its core business objectives,” stated Servotech.

Malaysia’s Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources says that the tariff of the Green Electricity Tariff (GET) program will be increased from MYR 0.037/kWh to MYR 0.281/kWh.
This tariff, which will go into effect on Aug. 1, is paid by domestic and industrial consumers in the country that want to buy electricity produced by renewable energy sources such as solar and hydropower.
“This new tariff is based on the benchmark of retail pricing of green electricity supply in neighboring countries,” the Malaysian government said in a statement.
It said that customers who now subscribe to the GET program will not be charged the Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT), a mechanism reflecting changes in the cost of electricity generation every six months. Local utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) will now adjust the electricity bill for the electricity users involved in the program.
The Green Electricity Tariff (GET) program went into force in January 2022 and offers 4,500 GWh of power per year. GET customers are charged the additional tariff for each kWh of renewable energy purchased. The energy is sold in 100 kWh blocks for residential customers and 1,000 kWh blocks for industrial consumers.
The Malaysian government is currently supporting distributed solar via net metering and large-scale PV through a series of tenders. At the end of 2022, the country had around 1,933 MW of installed solar generation capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

In addition, 55.90 GW is under installation, said power and new and renewable energy minister, RK Singh, in the parliament. 
Among all states and union territories, Rajasthan leads with 17.8 GW of PV installations, followed by Gujarat with 10.1 GW and Karnataka with 9 GW.
The National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) has assessed India’s solar power generation potential at about 748 GW assuming 3% of the wasteland area to be covered by solar PV modules. Rajasthan has the highest solar energy potential of 142,310 MWp, followed by Jammu & Kashmir at 111,050 MWp.

JSW Energy will set up a 3,800 tonnes per annum (tpa) green hydrogen plant using 25 MW of renewable energy. The project would be commissioned in the next 18 to 24 months.
The project is a part of JSW Steel’s strategy for decarbonization.
“We will commence use of green hydrogen in our DRI unit in Vijayanagar on a small scale to see the efficacy and usability…We will see how the trial goes and use that study to see how the hydrogen can be scaled up once the technology becomes more evolved and commercially viable,” stated JSW Steel.
JSW Steel is the flagship business of the diversified $23 billion JSW Group. It is India’s leading integrated steel company with a capacity of 29.7 mtpa in India and the USA (including capacities under joint control). Its next phase of growth in India will take its total capacity to 38.5 mtpa by FY25. The company’s manufacturing unit in Vijayanagar, Karnataka, is the largest single-location steel‐producing facility in India with a capacity of 12.5 mtpa.

Pexapark, a Swiss consultancy, said in its June monthly report that PPA prices for renewable energy continued to fall in Europe in May.
The Pexa Euro Composite Index fell by 11% from €62.30 ($69.20)/MWh at the end of April to €55.50/MWh at the end of May. Pexapark described this development as the result of an “orchestrated drop in the entirety of the energy-related commodities.”
PPA activity remained almost flat in May, with 23 announcements totaling approximately 982 MW, a 2% decrease compared to April. Germany and Spain were the largest markets in May, with deals equaling 245 MW and 317 MW, respectively.
The report also highlights the closing of Belgium’s first renewables PPA.
“Ineos Inovyn will offtake the entire output of the Helios solar park, which is expected to be 57 GWh,” said Pexapark.

Solar cells and modules are designed to be highly resistant to ‘shunts’ – which create an alternate pathway for a solar-generated charge, leading to power losses. Reduced shunt resistance is associated with multiple forms of module degradation and failure, including hotspots and potential-induced degradation.
A group of scientists led by Ireland’s University College Cork looked to further investigate the relationship between shunt resistance and other electrical characteristics of a solar cell, such as maximum power, fill-factor, open circuit voltage and short circuit current – with the aim of developing a model that can spot cell degradation before it has advanced to the point of causing major performance loss or safety issues.
The group worked with multicrystalline silicon solar cells, designing a system that allowed them to place a resistor between the p and n junction of the cell, and thus control its shunt resistance. The experimental setup is described in full in the paper “Experimentally derived models to detect onset of shunt resistance degradation in photovoltaic modules,” published in Energy Reports.
After testing five cells under various combinations of shunt resistance, illumination and other factors, the group found that maximum power, open circuit voltage, and fill factor were all directly affected by changes to the shunt resistance, while short circuit current was not affected. The work shows that once shunt resistance decreased to around 100 ohms per square centimeter, corrective action needs to be taken.
Using the figures from its experiments the group developed models to detect decreasing shunt resistance. “These models can be easily applied to detect the onset of critical PV degradation or failure caused by shunt resistance degradation and are suitable for implementation in online condition monitoring systems,” the group said.
The group also suggests that future work could move towards classifying module degradation based on the calculated shunt resistance loss.
