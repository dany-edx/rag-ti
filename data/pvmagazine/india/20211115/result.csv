The project was set up under the group captive open-access mechanism for power supply to one of the global pharma companies.
“Oriano was awarded the project with the scope of captive PPA/SHA acquisition, third-party legal land due diligence and100+ acres land acquisition, all land, development and project-related approvals, evacuation approval, bay allocation, project NOCs, CEIG, interconnection approval, turnkey EPC of the project, construction of 110 kV switchyard, 110 kV transmission line including RoW approval & bay. It’s an end-to-end project offered by Oriano, including five years of operation and maintenance,” read a release by Oriano.
The Oriano team was able to deliver the project within timelines despite Covid-prompted lockdowns across the country, development-related challenges, material uncertainty in terms of supply and commercial escalations. 
Lokendra Singh, director and co-founder, Oriano, said, “As a strategy to extend beyond utility-scale turnkey solar project EPC, it’s the first project delivered by Oriano on turnkey development and EPC mode under group captive open-access mechanism. The challenges and timelines were daunting due to covid restrictions, heavy rains, etc.”
The project site construction started in mid of July 2021 and it took four months to fully commission and charge the project.
Oriano is developing four additional solar parks in multiple states: 100 MWp in Maharashtra, 125 MWp in Karnataka), 50 MWp in Tamil Nadu and 70 MWp in Chhattisgarh. It is additionally working on a wind-solar hybrid project in Karnataka. Besides, it is constructing approx. 150+ MWp of multiple projects in Chhattisgarh under captive open access mechanism with 132 kV evacuation.

French companies Boostheat and Dualsun and have teamed up with German heating system supplier Rathiotherm to launch the operational phase of the Sun Horizon project.
The European Commission supports the ambitious project under the Horizon 2020 (H2020) program. It is designed to demonstrate different ways to pair PV and PVT solar panels with heat pump technology for heating and cooling applications across several pilot sites around Europe.
Initially, the three companies installed heat pumps with solar energy system using hybrid panels on two homes in Riga, Latvia.
“Latvia has the highest gas grid penetration in Europe and has rolled out a large number of heat pumps throughout the country,” the consortium said. “The data collected may prove to be particularly informative due to the harshness of the winters there.”
A Boostheat heat pump will provide space heating and domestic hot water for the two homes, while the Dualsun panels will produce power for heating and domestic appliances. They will also generate as much heat as possible, with excess power to be injected into the grid. A cloud-based monitoring platform will evaluate performance data and key performance indicators.
The consortium also includes France’s National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – a unit of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – and Schneider Electric. It has already developed five different designs for the coupling of heat pumps and solar panels, known as Technology Packages (TPs). Each design may include different technologies developed by the consortium’s members.
The technologies are a gas-driven HP consisting of one or more thermal compressors in parallel developed by Boostheat, and a hybrid unit connected in parallel with a thermally driven adsorption chiller, using water (R718) as a refrigerant and a vapour compression manufactured by German specialist Fahrenheit. There are also two types of reversible brine-water and air-water heat pumps from Dutch supplier BDR Thermea Group, a high vacuum flat plate solar thermal technology developed by Switzerland’s TPV Solar, Dualsun panels, and a thermal storage solution made by Germany-based Ratiotherm.
The first solution uses TVP solar collectors to cover most of the household’s space heating and domestic hot water and a gas-driven heat pump to cover non-solar periods. With the second proposal, the thermal output of the PVT panels helps the evaporator and covers preheating of demand, which improves HP performance. PV will be used to cover power demand.
Via the third solution, the household’s heating demand is covered by the PVT panels in winter. In the summer, PV output drives the adsorption chiller to meet the space cooling needs. Under the fourth approach, the heat pump benefits from the thermal and electric outputs of the PVT panels and is used as backup.
The fifth design includes solar panels, a storage tank, a hybrid chiller and a thermal heat pump. Hot water produced is produced by the solar module and is stored in the high stratification tank. The chilled water produced by the chiller is stored in a smaller tank and then delivered to the space cooling system. During the winter, the preheated water by the solar panels is delivered to the gas-driven heat pump. If necessary, it heats it up to cover space heating and domestic water demand.
The consortium is now testing all of the approaches at eight demonstration sites in Latvia, Germany, Spain, and Belgium.

IEA PVPS analysis considers all options for underperfoming PV modules,"From pv magazine International
Repairing and reusing a solar module that is not complying with its expected lifetime provides for more environmental benefits than replacing the underperforming unit with a new and more performant PV module. The reuse option, however, still has several challenges to overcome in terms of economic viability, with only a limited number of positive business cases being available under current market conditions. It may become competitive in the future, however, if PV panels achieve higher efficiencies and costs are further reduced.
These are the main conclusions of the report, “Preliminary Environmental and Financial Viability Analysis of Circular Economy Scenarios for Satisfying PV System Service Lifetime,” published by the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power System Programme (IEA-PVPS).
In the paper, the agency’s experts said the main goal of their efforts was to understand to which extent a circular economy approach could be applied to the PV industry. Their analysis was conducted through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and assuming a solar panel has a 30-year lifetime. “The functional unit metric is therefore defined as the total lifecycle environmental impact of the PV system divided by the total amount of electricity produced by the system over 30 years,” they explained. “The lower the metric value is, the more favourable it is for the environment.”
The researchers initially quantified the environmental impact of recycling, repair, and reuse of PV systems under different scenarios and found that the frequent replacement of panels with newer and more performant panels increases the environmental impact. The higher efficiencies provided by the new products do not offset the environmental footprint of additional panel production, they added. “Moreover, our sensitivity assessment shows that, even if maintaining the 30-year service life requires junction box repair and/or transporting the panel for long distances, keeping panels in use is the more environmentally favourable solution,” they emphasized. “In other words, it is better for the environment to keep a panel in use for 30 years instead of replacing it with new, more efficient panels.”
In the second part of the study, the IEA-PVPS group focused on the financial viability of the lifetime of prematurely decommissioned solar panels from a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) perspective and, for rooftop PV, it ascertained that satisfying the 30–year service lifetime of PV panels may be financially competitive with replacing the modules under certain conditions. “This is the case for relatively young panels (up to around 10 years old) with few or no defects,” it explained. “Although we do not account for testing and recertification costs, these costs could be a determining factor for the success of the reuse business case.”
As for utility-scale solar, the repairing or reusing options were not found to be financially viable due to surface–area restrictions, lower remaining power density, and the limited remaining lifetimes of prematurely decommissioned panels. “In addition, our analysis of PV as a utility-scale investment — using net present value as the key performance indicator — suggests that new panels are more attractive than prematurely decommissioned panels in this context as well, without and especially with surface-area limits.”
The experts cautioned that their analysis was limited to polycrystalline panels and that the reusing option should be further assessed under different geographical locations and solar irradiation conditions. “The financial viability of the reuse business case is influenced by additional country- and case-specific parameters, such as the grid tariffs that drive revenue and can fluctuate substantially,” they concluded.
