The investment will enable TCCL to offer loans to businesses across India that focus on e-mobility solutions and water and energy efficiency.
India is the world’s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions and is amongst the top ten water consuming countries in the world. CDC’s facility will enhance efforts to avoid greenhouse gas emissions by increasing the deployment of energy efficiency and e-mobility solution. 
Manish Chourasia, managing director, Tata Cleantech Capital Limited, said they look forward to deploying the CDC facility to fill in the market gap in the e-mobility, energy efficiency and water efficiency sectors, while pursuing a developmental agenda with sustainability at its core.
“Looking forward, CDC is keen to invest more of its long-term capital in target green sectors that will drive India’s transition to a net-zero carbon future,” announced Srini Nagarajan, managing director and head of Asia at CDC.
Geoffrey Manley, director and head of energy access and efficiency at CDC, noted: “CDC’s innovative directed green lending facility will enable TCCL to provide funds quickly and at scale, to local green businesses that are doing their part in helping India take active steps to combat climate change.”
Tata Cleantech Capital, a joint venture between Tata Power’s Tata Capital Limited and World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, is a private sector green investment bank focusing on climate finance and advisory services. Since its inception, TCCL has played an instrumental role in mainstreaming finance for new and nascent sectors. In 2019, it secured a US$ 100 million line from Green Climate Fund to develop the rooftop solar market in India. 
TCCL, having financed more than 220 projects, has contributed to the development of around 7.7 GW of renewable energy.

There were conflicting messages on the subject of solar costs in a list of predictions for 2021 issued by London-based market research company IHS Markit.
The business predicted the period to the end of March would see rising module prices as the result of production costs coming in 10-15% higher.
However, a return to price reductions in the second half of the year would drive another record period for the renewable energy technology, with IHS Markit predicting a 30% rise on the volume of solar project capacity added, compared to last year, with China still cornering 35% of the market.
The market data company also predicted a 5% annual fall in the capital expenditure cost of solar projects in 2021 thanks to “decreasing component prices,” and said conversion efficiency gains would continue to be made, with PERC mono modules passing 22.5% efficiency and hitting 24% by 2022.
Perovskites will become commercially viable “in the next five years,” said IHS Markit on Thursday.
The company also predicted renewables-powered green hydrogen costs would fall another 40% through 2025 thanks to falling renewable electricity prices and electrolyzer costs.
Electric vehicle makers will also lead a new push on recycling this year, according to IHS Markit.

The plant, located in Khera village of the Budaun District, will deliver clean energy to over 100,000 people in Northern India. 
The solar plant, operating under Talettutayi Solar Projects Five, benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement signed with the state-owned Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited. The plant is expected to generate around 120 million kilowatt-hours per year of clean energy.  
The engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) work was carried out by Noida-based Jakson. JA Solar supplied mono PERC modules for the plant, according to a previous statement by ThomasLloyd.
Nandita Sahgal Tully, managing director-infrastructure asset management at ThomasLloyd, said the plant was successfully commissioned against the challenging backdrop triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.
SolarArise was founded in 2014 by James Abraham, Anil Nayar and Tanya Singhal. Other shareholders besides ThomasLloyd are the Global Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, advised by the European Investment Bank Group, the Core Infrastructure India Fund, managed by Kotak Mahindra Bank, and the founding team.
Currently, SolarArise has a portfolio of 384 MW (DC), comprising six operational plants with a total capacity of 234 MW across four states in India. The capacity for an additional 150 MW is already funded. All plants benefit from long-term power purchase agreements with either central government or state counterparties.

The project has raised a US$165-million (around INR 1200-crore) finance with a group of three major international banks.
“The SECI III project has been successfully financed through a green limited recourse project term loan of USD 165M provided by DBS Bank Ltd, Standard Chartered Bank, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (Singapore Branch),” read a statement.  
Currently under construction in Rajasthan, Northern India, the project was awarded to Eden in a Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) auction. SECI signed the power purchase agreement (PPA) with the developer in June 2019. 
The project is expected to be commissioned within the first half of 2021. 
Sudhir Verma, chief executive officer of Eden Renewables India, said: “This is one more success for EDEN and a significant moment for the development of renewable energy in India. At Eden, we are eager to provide our expertise in high-scale solar PV farms to contribute to a low carbon environment in India, in line with the country’s objective to achieve 40% of non-fossil fuel generation by 2030.”  
Laurence Juin, Chief Financial Officer of Total Eren, added: “This successful financial close reflects the ongoing interest and trust of the lenders in the Indian renewable energy market and its promising prospects. By partnering today with such a high-quality financial consortium, we look forward to pursuing our project’s construction along with our partner EDF Renewables and through our joint-venture Eden Renewables India, which plays a key role in achieving our local ambitions and has positioned itself in the Top 3 of Indian solar tender winners during the first semester of 20202. 
“The Indian renewable energy market offers a high growth potential, and we are determined to provide electricity which is both sustainable and low carbon, in line with the Indian Government’s objective to increase the part of renewables in India.” 
Frédéric Belloy, Executive Vice President International Operations at EDF Renewables, stated: “The secured financing carried out together with the financial partners is a major step in the delivery of our 450 MWp project. We are now fully mobilized towards its completion. SECI III, as well as our recent successes representing 1,300 MWp new projects, demonstrate EDF Renewables’ willingness to support India to reach its great ambition for renewables energy.” 
For this transaction, Eden was advised by Herbert Smith Freehills and L&L Partners Law Offices as legal advisors, and Chatham Financial Europe as hedge benchmark advisor. 
Eden Renewables India was founded in 2016 as a joint venture between Total Eren and EDF Renewables to build and operate solar photovoltaic projects across India. As of 2021, the company has 207 MWp operating solar plants, 450 MWp under construction, and over 1,600 MWp under development and due to commission by 2022.
