1,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/20/indias-cumulative-solar-pv-waste-to-reach-19000-kilotonnes-by-2050/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RECYCLING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,2024-03-20,"India’s cumulative solar PV waste to reach 19,000 kilotonnes by 2050","India’s cumulative solar PV waste will reach about 19,000 kilotonnes (kt) by 2050 as all the capacity deployed until 2030 will have reached end of life, according to a new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) which estimates India-specific solar waste generation from various streams, excluding manufacturing.
The report states while the modules are designed for a 25-year life, some witness an early end of life due to factors such as damage during transportation, module handling, and project operations.
According to the report, India’s installed 66.7 GW capacity, as of FY 2023, has generated about 100 kt of waste, which will increase to 340 kt by 2030. The 340 kt of waste is estimated to contain about 10 kilotonnes of silicon, 12-18 tonnes of silver, and 16 tonnes of cadmium and tellurium—the majority of which are critical minerals for India. Around 67% of the 340 kt solar waste will be generated in five states: Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.
The cumulative solar waste from the existing and new PV capacity deployed between FY24 and FY30 will reach about 600 kt by 2030, equivalent to filling up 720 Olympic-size swimming pools.
The study authors assumed India’s installed PV capacity would reach about 292 GW by 2030. Furthermore, India would need about 1,700 GW of solar capacity by 2050 and 5,600 GW by 2070 to achieve its 2070 net-zero target.
The study authors say the mounting solar waste presents an opportunity for India to emerge as a leading hub of circular economy for the solar industry and ensure resilient solar supply chains.
India is already implementing several measures to tackle the waste. Last year, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued E-waste Management Rules 2022 that shall govern the management of solar PV cells and modules waste in India. These rules mandate the producers of solar cells and modules to manage their waste under the extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework.
Dr Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, said, “India must proactively address solar waste, not just as an environmental imperative but as a strategic necessity for ensuring energy security and building a circular economy. As we witness the remarkable growth of solar from only 4 GW in March 2015 to 73 GW in December 2023, robust recycling mechanisms become increasingly crucial. They safeguard renewable ecosystems, create green jobs, enhance mineral security, foster innovation, and build resilient, circular supply chains.”
Neeraj Kuldeep, Senior Programme Lead, CEEW, added, “India’s G20 Presidency had identified a circular economy as a thrust area for sustainable development. A circular solar industry and responsible waste management will maximise resource efficiency and make domestic supply chains resilient. The CEEW study provides robust evidence of the opportunity in solar waste management. However, solar recycling technologies and the industry are still at a nascent stage and require policy push and support.”
The CEEW study recommends that the Indian solar industry prepare for new responsibilities by arranging reverse logistics, storage, dismantling centres, and recycling facilities. The industry should also explore innovative financing mechanisms and business models for solar waste management. Further, there should be a periodically updated database of the installed solar capacity (containing details such as module technology, manufacturer, and commissioning date) to accurately map plausible waste generation centres and strategic deployment of waste management infrastructure.

It will manufacture the first lot of cylinders for joint testing and inspection by the authority. The testing of the first lot of cylinders will be completed in around six months’ time.
“We are the first company in India to have received this manufacturing approval & this milestone marks a significant step forward in our efforts towards Sustainable Green Energy Solutions. With this approval, we are poised to contribute to the advancement of Green hydrogen technology and its role in shaping a greener future,” stated Time Technoplast Ltd.
Canada and Germany have agreed to establish a “first-of-its-kind” transatlantic hydrogen corridor. The Canadian government said the deal positions the nation as a priority market for Germany to source hydrogen, granting Canadian producers a first-mover advantage and solidifying Canada’s leadership in globally supplying clean hydrogen. Germany’s H2Global Foundation will oversee coordinated auctions to connect Canadian hydrogen exporters with German buyers, aiming to secure commercially binding contracts and displace European imports of Russian oil and gas.
Germany has launched the first bidding process for the €4 billion ($4.3 billion) Climate Protection Contracts funding program. “Companies in the energy-intensive industry that successfully participated in the preparatory process in summer 2023 can apply for 15-year funding for their major transformation projects within the next four months,” said the German government. Climate protection contracts are intended to initiate climate-friendly production processes in energy-intensive industrial sectors, offsetting the additional costs compared to conventional processes in areas where climate-friendly production processes cannot compete.
Gascade and Repco have agreed to connect Germany’s Baltic Sea ports of Rostock and Lubmin and link them to the Berlin/Brandenburg and Halle/Leipzig/Leuna consumption regions. “Repco’s HyTechHafen Rostock hydrogen production project and the Rostock region as well as the industrial port of Lubmin are to be connected to the greater Berlin/Brandenburg area and the Halle/Leipzig/Leuna industrial area via Gascade’s hydrogen pipelines Rostock-Wrangelsburg and Flow – making hydrogen happen,” said the two German companies.
Lhyfe will secure a grant of up to €149 million from the French government to build a green hydrogen production plant with a 100 MW of electrolysis capacity near Le Havre, France. The company said the production site in Gonfreville-l’Orcher is scheduled to be operational by 2028.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) has announced an AUD 1.7 million ($1.1 million) grant to Aboriginal Clean Energy Partnership (Acer) to support the first phase of a feasibility study for the East Kimberley Clean Energy and Hydrogen Project. ARENA said that the first phase of the feasibility study will begin promptly and is expected to conclude within five months. If successful, the planned facility will include around 1,000 MW of solar generation combined with 850 MW of electrolysis capacity.
DNV is executing hydrogen blending feasibility studies for Enbridge and FortisBC. The two studies will determine the percentage of hydrogen that can be safely transported through existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure, including Enbridge’s transmission system and FortisBC’s distribution system, in British Columbia, Canada. According to DNV, the studies are the “largest” blending studies undertaken in North America. They “will be used to develop the codes and standards required to safely transport hydrogen as the first step in forming a sustainable commercial hydrogen market,” said the Norwegian classification society.
The US Department of Energy has announced $750 million of funding for 52 projects across 24 states to “dramatically reduce the cost of clean hydrogen and reinforce America’s global leadership in the growing clean hydrogen industry.” The government said it aims to build 14 GW of fuel cell manufacturing capacity per year and 10 GW of annual electrolyzer manufacturing capacity. Several of the selected projects are run by well-known companies, such as Ballard Power Systems, Cummins, General Motors, Nel Hydrogen, Plug Power, Robert Bosch, and thyssenkrupp nucera.
Vattenfall said it will conclude its hydrogen production project for offshore wind farms. It started the project almost two years ago. “Having tested the development phase for decentralized offshore hydrogen production, and in light of other industry advances, Vattenfall has now taken the decision to conclude the project,” it said. It claimed that the project, designed around its European offshore wind hub off the coast of Scotland, “aided the creation of a new regulatory and consenting regime by the UK government for offshore hydrogen transportation and storage.”
Heidelberg Materials UK, Stopford and Cranfield University said they are working to establish the feasibility of using ammonia as a source of hydrogen for use as a fuel in cement kilns. “We have already proved the success of using hydrogen as part of a lower carbon fuel mix, but its storage and transportation are technically challenging and, at present, costs are prohibitive,” said Heidelberg Materials UK Sustainability Director Marian Garfield. The company said the new research, which builds on a demonstration using hydrogen as part of a net zero fuel mix to power a cement kiln, “will explore the potential use of ammonia as a low-cost, low carbon hydrogen carrier, evaluating the most efficient method of ‘cracking’ the ammonia on-site to release the hydrogen for use as a fuel in the kiln.” 
Sasol and Topsoe have launched a 50:50 joint venture, Zaffra, to develop and supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Topsoe said the venture aims to build a “global presence.”
Eletrobras and Paul Wurth do Brasil have agreed to collaborate on the production of renewable hydrogen and synthetic fuels. “The partnership includes the construction and operation of a 10 MW plant for the production of renewable hydrogen (H2R) and oxygen,” said Eletrobras. “Feasibility studies are expected to be completed in around a year.”
