The modeling shows that increasing the share of renewable energy in the overall installed power capacity from 25% today to 100% before 2050 can cut the cost of meeting electricity demand by 48%, from INR 6,000/MWh (US$81/MWh) in 2020 to INR 3,120/MWh (US$42/MWh) in 2050. This cost, also referred to as overall system cost, includes the levelized cost of electricity generation, the cost of energy storage, transmission interconnections, as well as the costs of curtailing surplus renewable generation.
Renewables, when paired with flexible generation technologies (thermal balancing power plants and energy storage), can improve the affordability of electricity while ensuring the reliability of system operations, according to the study. 
Power demand in India is estimated to increase to 5,921 TWh (with 1,023 GW of peak demand), 340% up from 1,345 TWh in 2020. The modeling confirms India can affordably meet this increased load through renewable energy, aided by low-cost solar. 
However, the study states the total system capacity must be scaled up to an unprecedented degree to serve this increased load through mid-day peaks and to charge energy storage resources such as batteries to offset intermittent renewable energy generation. It projects 4,000 GW of installed capacity is needed for a 100% renewable system, a 10-fold increase in the overall power capacity in 2020. Solar would make up 76% (3,076 GW) of this total installed capacity by 2050. This would also be supported by a total wind capacity of around 410 GW by 2050, combined with hydro and carbon neutral gas.
To achieve the projected solar share, new PV installations must rise by 885%, from 7 GW a year today, to 69 GW a year by 2035, rising to 79 GW a year between 2035 and 2050, according to the study.
Wärtsilä’s modeling shows that flexibility through energy storage is key to achieve the cost-optimal renewable baseload system – to shift generation when it is surplus, during the day, to times when renewables are not available, during evening or night-time. Thermal balancing power plants, backed by battery energy storage, must also be deployed to manage sudden surges in demand or drops in renewable generation.
The modeling demonstrates that, by 2050, India would need some 99 TWh of storage capacity and a total of 187 GW of fast-start load-following gas engines to provide rapid grid balancing. Storage capacity includes storage in the form of both batteries and gas storage – mainly in the form of sustainable fuels (green hydrogen, methane, etc). Together, these technologies form the backbone of a reliable, cost-optimal power system for India.
“Increasing renewable energy could also generate major new revenues from hydrogen production, creating a technology market worth US$39.8 billion,” added the report.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/06/silicon-metal-and-aluminum-industries-hit-by-china-power-shortages/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 6, 2021",Silicon metal and aluminum industries hit by China power shortages,"From pv magazine International
The solar manufacturing supply chain is among the industries being affected by a combination of soaring power demand, coal shortages, and carbon emission reduction measures which have seen widespread electricity rationing in China.
In Yunnan province, in southwest China, producers of the silicon metal which feeds polysilicon have been operating at 10% of the output they achieved in August and will continue to do so for the rest of the year as provincial authorities try to control electricity demand with a measure that is also affecting the phosphorus industry.
Fellow solar supply chain members from the aluminum industry in Guangxi province, in the south, have been forced to operate just two days per week, alongside peers in the concrete, steel, lime, and ceramics segments, and manufacturers in neighboring Guangdong have access to normal power supplies only on Fridays and Saturdays with electricity rationed to a 15% grid security load for the rest of the time.
With reports of drastic power shortages emerging from China in recent days, the country has actually been experiencing problems since late June but rationing is not unusual during the peak summer hours.
What has changed this time is that the outages have continued and prompted rationing measures across 19 of the nation’s provinces for the rest of the year, and it is not just manufacturers who are being powered down. In China’s northernmost province of Heilongjiang, which is starting to experience cold temperatures, a family was reportedly almost killed after an unannounced blackout halted a fan in their village home which was responsible for dispersing carbon monoxide fumes from their heating system.
The problems have been caused by a combination of rising post-Covid electricity demand at a time when the politically-motivated ban on imports of Australian coal has tightened supply; and the manner in which Beijing controls power prices, with the situation further exacerbated by carbon emissions reduction policy.
Electricity demand from industry was 13.5 percentage points higher in the first eight months of the year than in the same period of 2020, at 3,585 TWh, reflecting a 13.8% year-on-year rise in total consumption, to 5.47 PWh, according to data from state energy industry trade body the China Electricity Council. Figures produced by the China General Administration of Customs tell the same story of a rebound driven by the global recovery from the pandemic, with China recording import and export trade worth RMB2.48 trillion ($385 billion) in January-to-August, up 23.7% on the same period of last year and 22.8% higher than in the first eight months of 2019.
With Beijing having enforced an unofficial ban on imports of Australian coal for the last year or so – as the result of an ongoing diplomatic spat with Canberra – that rising demand for the fuel which provided around 73% of Chinese electricity in the first half of the year, has further raised prices for the fossil fuel.
The problem for Chinese coal-fired power generators is that Beijing maintains strict controls on the price of electricity so input costs cannot be passed on to the consumer. The mismatch between a liberalized coal market and centrally-controlled end-user prices is illustrated by the current situation in Guangdong, where a coal price of RMB1,560 per ton ($242) has pushed the cost of coal-fired electricity up to RMB0.472 per kilowatt-hour ($0.073). With coal power companies facing an electricity price ceiling of around RMB0.463/kWh ($0.071), generators are losing around RMB0.12 for every kilowatt-hour they generate. In that situation, rationing electricity supplies is an obvious remedy.
The crisis has been worsened by the introduction of China’s ‘dual control’ energy policy, which aims to help meet president Xi Jinping’s climate change pledge of hitting peak carbon emissions this decade and a net zero economy by 2060. ‘Dual control’ refers to attempts to wind down greenhouse gas emissions at both a national level and in more local areas, such as provinces and cities.
With the finer details of the carbon reduction policy yet to be ironed out, government departments and provincial and city authorities have started to set their own emission-reduction targets and, in mid-August, state planning body the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) published a table of the energy control situation across the nation. With nine provinces marked red for their energy consumption, and a further 10 highlighted as yellow, officials received another motivation to introduce power rationing.
In terms of what happens next, the current approach of rolling blackouts seems unlikely to be a sustainable solution, given the damage it could inflict on industry and the resentment it would cause in parts of the huge nation already preparing for winter.
The binary choice apparently facing China’s policymakers is whether to ramp up coal supplies to force prices down, by using decommissioned domestic supplies and halting the ban on Australian imports, or to raise electricity prices sufficiently to prompt generators to get the lights back on – and the production lines humming. While the drawbacks of raising household electricity bills will be obvious, the former approach could seriously endanger the nation’s climate change commitments as the world prepares for the COP26 meeting in Glasgow next month. Sources close to the NDRC have suggested the electricity price may be set to rise soon.
What is clear, is the effect the energy crisis is having on the Chinese economy, and on the solar supply chain. Last week, leading up to Friday’s national day holiday, the coal price in northern China rose to around RMB2,000 per ton ($310), three times higher than the level seen at the beginning of the year.
Investment bank China International Capital Corporation has blamed the dual control emission reduction policy for the electricity shortages and predicted a 0.1-0.15 percentage point impact on economic growth in the last quarter and the current window. Morgan Stanley has put that figure at 1% in the current quarter, if the current industrial output restrictions continue, and Japan’s Nomura Securities has revised down its annual forecast on Chinese growth from 8.2% to 7.7%, with expected GDP gains in the third and fourth quarters reined in from 5.1% to 4.7%, and 4.4% to 3%, respectively.

Bangladesh’s Rural Power Company Limited is seeking a consultant for a 100 MW solar field planned in its northern district of Jamalpur.
The project, approved by the executive committee of the National Economic Council headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, will be majority funded with Indian credit.
Applicants for the contract must have worked on supervising the development of a solar project with a generation capacity of at least 25 MW within the last 10 years, on the basis of a single contract, and to have included supervision of construction of an electricity transmission line of at least 132 kV and 10 km. Consultants can also bid as part of a consortium as long as the lead partner has experience of preparing tender documents and design, review, and approval services.
The successful consultant will have to review a project feasibility study drawn up by Dhaka-based EQMS Consulting Limited; prepare drawing design specifications of an engineering, procurement and construction tender document for the 100 MW solar plant and 132 kV, double circuit transmission line; and supervise the transmission line and substation installation works, among other duties. The deadline for bids is on October 24.
The Indian government will reportedly supply $131 million of soft loans towards the estimated $177 million cost of the 325-acre solar project, planned chiefly on Ministry of Land-owned fallow fields near the Jamuna river.
The government of Bangladesh will directly contribute $40 million to the project with the state-owned Rural Power Company supplying a further $5.9 million.
The plant is due to come online in December 23 and government officials have stated the authorities are planning a second, Chinese-backed 100 MW solar site nearby.
Rural Power Company MD Abdus Sabur said the Jamuna river project will generate electricity for the nearby districts of Mymensingh and Dhaka.
Bangladesh has around 775.84 MW of clean power generation capacity, around 3% of its power mix, and aims to source 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2050.
