Bioenergy is regarded by some people as one of the key options to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a substitute for fossil fuels. This notion is wrong. Solar PV, wind, and other renewable energy technologies are available for large-scale electricity production with low or no direct GHG emissions. The transport sector, which is responsible for 23% of GHG emissions, is almost entirely based on fossil fuels, and has fewer alternatives.
Transportation represents some 27% of the world’s secondary energy consumption (21% of primary), grows by 1% per year on average, and is almost exclusively fueled by petroleum. Could biofuels play an important role in addressing both the GHG emissions of transport and the dependency on petroleum?
Currently marketed, first-generation biofuels represent only around 3% of global road transport fuels and therefore cannot be regarded as a transition technology. This limited penetration of first-generation biofuels is due in part to the potential competition with food crops and market prices (sugar versus ethanol prices in international markets).
Concerns that these technologies are falling short of expectations have led to the development of second-generation (cellulosic ethanol, biomass-to-liquids, pyrolysis oil, dimethyl ether) and third-generation biofuel technologies (algal-biodiesel, biofuels from third-generation processes), which still need to be scaled up in order to become cost-competitive.
With the exception of sugarcane ethanol, traditional biofuels have severe disadvantages that are related to the feedstock. The current costs of rapeseed biodiesel and ethanol from cereals or beets are much higher than the costs of gasoline and diesel, and substantial subsidies are needed to make them competitive. These high costs are a result of the low net energy yield of most annual crops (100–200 GJ/ha per year in the long term), the high-quality agricultural land required, and the intensive management requirements. For comparison, typical insolation is 50,000 GJ/ha per year and typical solar PV panel electrical output is 10,000 GJ/ha per year. The very low energy productivity per hectare of biofuels, coupled with their high requirements for fertilizers, pesticides, and water, severely limits the well-to-wheel reduction of fossil energy use, which in turn limits the environmental benefits. The net energy of perennial crops (220–550 GJ/ha per year), grasses (220–260 GJ/ha per year), and sugar cane (500–650 GJ/ha per year) is somewhat higher (but still miserable compared with solar PV).
Brazil has been a world leader in promoting biofuels for over 30 years under its Proalcool program. Mandates for large-scale blending of biofuels into vehicle fuels have appeared in several other countries in recent years, nationally driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, but probably also reflecting the desire of agricultural companies for production subsidies.
In the long term, however, it can be argued that biofuels will play a transitional role toward electric vehicles, decarbonization, and solar electricity generation. In terms of energy conversion efficiency, biofuels for transportation can be largely disregarded as a transition technology. A direct comparison between sugar cane ethanol coupled with flex-fuel cars, and sunlight-to-electricity (PV) conversion + electric cars is illustrated in the following figure.

A 1 ha (100 m x 100 m) sugar cane plantation will yield from 7,000-8,000 L of ethanol per year, allowing a medium size flex-fuel car to drive about 54,000 km/year in a best-case scenario. If the same area is covered with a dense array of low-tilt commercially available solar PV modules at 20% conversion efficiency and a moderate 1,500 kWh/kWp per year energy yield, the electricity produced over 1 year on the same 1 ha will allow the electric version of the same medium-size car to drive over 18 million km/year (about 350 times more!). The reasons for this overwhelming difference are the fact that solar PV conversion is 50-100 times more efficient than typical photosynthesis efficiency, and also the fact that the efficiency of electric motors is about three times more than internal combustion engines.
Global battery electric vehicle sales (excluding hybrids) are about 10% of light vehicle sales and growing by about 50% per year. This points to the likelihood that half of vehicle sales will be battery-electric by 2026, and that most vehicles on the road will be battery electric by 2040 as the current fossil-fueled fleet grows old and retires. Vehicles fueled by biofuels and hydrogen have a negligible market share.
In the low-moderate latitude countries of the sunbelt, where 80% of the global population lives, rooftop PV can supply most of the electricity needs of dwellings on an annual basis. Rooftop PV can also cover the additional electricity needs represented by a new fleet of electric vehicles. A kilowatt-rated rooftop PV system can drive an electric vehicle about 8,000 km per year.
Biofuels suffer from irredeemably low conversion of solar energy into useful energy, as well as competing with food production for land, water, pesticides, and fertilizers. Basic physics and economics doom the notion that bioenergy can play a significant role in global energy systems.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/25/telecom-operators-applaud-move-to-allow-load-aggregation-for-green-energy-access/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 25, 2023",Telecom operators applaud move to allow load aggregation for green energy access ,"The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has welcomed the power ministry’s notification on the Second Amendment of the Electricity Rules, 2023 (Promoting Renewable Energy Through Green Energy Open Access) that allows for aggregation of load by multiple connections served by the same electricity division of a Discom to avail the services of renewable energy under the open access route.
“This long-awaited development enables the telecom sector to actively participate in India’s commitment towards green energy and sustainable growth, while also enabling proliferation of services,” stated COAI.
Last year, the Ministry of Power reduced the green-energy open-access transactions limit from 1 MW to 100 kW to enable small consumers also to purchase renewable power through open access. However, telecom towers, which serve as the network’s backbone, have individual power energy load requirements of 10 kW each. Therefore, being treated as separate entities, telecom towers could not reap the benefits of green energy open access.
With the issuance of the second amendment by the Ministry of Power, any ‘entity’ (meaning consumer) with a contracted demand or sanctioned load of 100 kW or more, either through a single connection or multiple connections aggregating 100 kW or more within the same electricity division of a distribution licensee, shall be eligible to take power through Green Energy Open Access. This will make it cost-effective for the telecom sector to fulfil its energy needs while also contributing to the green energy aspirations and renewable energy use targets of the nation, stated COAI.
Appreciating the directions, S.P. Kochhar, Director General, COAI, stated, “We laud the Ministry of Power for introducing this much required progressive measure and also thank the Secretary, Ministry of Power; TRAI Chairman and DoT for the continuous support on this important aspect of power supply requirements for telecom infrastructure. This positive step acknowledges the importance of telecom as an essential infrastructure industry and its manifold benefits for the nation and our citizens. The telecom industry remains committed to fostering sustainability and contributing to the country’s renewable energy goals”.

This comprises 3.3 GW operational, 4.6 GW under construction, and a balance of 12.6 GW for which planning and implementation is in progress.
For the 4.6 GW under execution, power purchase agreements (PPAs) have already been signed, and construction contracts awarded. For another 12.6 GW in the pipeline, it has either won the bids, received the letter of award, signed PPA, joint venture agreement, or term sheet, or received the consent.
NTPC said this collective capacity of close to 16 GW would come up over the next three years, depending on the pace of implementation. This will include around 12 GW of ground-mounted solar, around 1 GW of floating solar, and 3 to 4 GW of wind.
NTPC targets to be a 130 GW company by 2032, with half its installed diversified fuel capacity through RE.
To diversify its RE portfolio, NTPC is entering hydrogen and energy storage solutions in a big way. To this effect, it has started work for developing a Hydrogen Hub at Pudimadaka in Andhra Pradesh. The project will involve the establishment of a manufacturing facility for hydrogen-related equipment, production and export of green hydrogen, ammonia, and green chemicals. In addition, NTPC has signed an agreement with Indian Army to set up green hydrogen projects in army establishments. It has also launched a 9 GWh storage tender.
NTPC Ltd completed the consolidation of its renewable energy (RE) portfolio under one umbrella entity, NTPC Green Energy Ltd, in February this year. The transactions comprised the transfer of 15 RE assets and the transfer of 100% equity shareholding of NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NTPC.

It has signed financial documents with 23 banks and investment firms. The facility is currently under construction in Oxagon, Saudi Arabia. NGHC ha salso finalized an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) agreement with Air Products, worth $6.7 billion. In addition, NGHC said it has secured an exclusive 30-year off-take agreement with Air Products for all the green ammonia produced at the facility. This agreement is expected to unlock the economic potential of renewable energy across the value chain. NGHC, a joint venture by ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM, expects large-scale production of green ammonia from the plant in 2026.
The US Department of Energy (DoE) has allocated $42 million to fund 22 projects in 14 states to advance clean hydrogen production, storage, and deployment technologies. These projects will focus on developing solar fuel technologies, demonstrating more efficient hydrogen storage methods, reducing costs of hydrogen fuel cells for transportation, and enhancing hydrogen emissions detection and monitoring, according to the US government. The DoE said it has also prioritized projects to address community concerns regarding hydrogen emissions and safety.
The European Energy Exchange (EEX) is set to launch HYDRIX, the world’s first market-based hydrogen index. The Leipzig-based company said that HYDRIX will provide information on traded prices for green hydrogen, ensuring price transparency for the growing market. The index will be calculated weekly from May 24, 2023, and published in euros per megawatt-hour on the EEX Transparency Platform every Wednesday at 4 p.m.
The Initiative Energien Speichern (INES) has launched an interactive map to serve as a new database for gas and hydrogen storage facilities in Germany. The online tool features 23 large underground storage facilities, with most hydrogen projects in the planning or implementation stage. Currently, Germany does not have any operational commercial hydrogen storage facility. To meet the 2030 hydrogen target, INES said that eight existing gas storage facilities must be converted from natural gas to hydrogen. The gas storage network operator noted the insufficiency of the current gas storage capacity for the envisioned hydrogen economy.
