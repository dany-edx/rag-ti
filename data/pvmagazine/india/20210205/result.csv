The report Recipe for Recovery points out that TANGEDCO’s participation in the Ujjwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY Scheme) in 2017 has failed to revive the discom. The Centre recently approved a bailout package of INR 30,230 crore for TANGEDCO, but without measures to either lower the cost of power supply or raise tariffs, energy experts fear overdues will continue to accumulate.
The report identifies cost reduction and savings opportunities available.
Retiring old coal
The report says avoiding retrofits by phasing out 3.1 GW of plants 20 years and older will save approximately INR 1,670 crore. These plants are Tuticorin, Mettur, North Chennai and NLC II Stage I. Replacing the scheduled generation from these old plants with cheaper electricity, either from renewables or through purchases on the open market, would save another INR 1459 crore annually (INR 7,300 crore over five years).
“Such plants (coal power plants that are over 20 years old) are typically less efficient, more polluting, and are now legally required to meet the 2015 air and water emission norms notified by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. The deadline for compliance with the norms is 2022, but so far, little progress has been made on equipping the plants with flue-gas desulphurization systems and Low NOx burners,” it stated.
“These old plants are not on track to meet the 2022 deadline for compliance with the air pollution norms. Rather than incurring INR 1,600 crore or more on retrofits, it is more economical to retire them. Given financial stresses, incurring additional debt is difficult, and these costs would have to eventually be recovered via higher tariffs. The power surplus situation in the state and country, as well as cheaper renewable energy, creates a potential win-win situation for Tamil Nadu’s consumers through retiring these assets”, said report author Ashish Fernandes of Climate Risk Horizons. 
Tamil Nadu’s coal fleet has been running below 60% plant load factor for the last three financial years. Moreover, over 3 GW of new coal plants are nearing completion and expected to be commissioned in the next 12 months, ensuring that the situation of surplus electricity generation capacity will persist for the foreseeable future. This makes the task of retiring older plants easier. 
Halting new coal
Apart from retiring old plants, the analysis suggests freezing expenditure on early-stage under-construction coal plants, given the state’s power surplus situation and the cost advantages now enjoyed by renewable energy.
The report identifies 3.5 GW of state-owned plants in the early stages of construction—Uppur, Udangudi and Ennore Expansion. It estimates freezing expenditure by halting construction on these plants would save over INR 26,000 crore.
Shift to renewables
The report stated gradually phasing out the most expensive power plants and replacing their generation with cheaper options, including renewables, will help reduce power purchase costs and Average Revenue Requirements. 
Replacing expensive power above INR 4/kWh with cheaper power from renewable energy or existing higher-efficiency power plants at INR 3/kWh or less could generate savings of up to INR 6,000 crore per annum. 
This can be done at the end of the current contract life. In case all parties are government entities, the contract can be terminated early upon mutual agreement, given the savings generated across the system. Contracts could also be reconfigured to reward flexible generation through a premium for peaking power supply, it stated.

The acquisition was made through the company’s Brazilian arm Kalpataru Power do Brasil Participações, which signed a definitive agreement with Fasttel for the investment.
Fasttel, founded in 1988, is engaged in EPC and maintenance of power transmission lines, substation and distribution systems across various voltage range up to 750 kV. The company earned around US$ 47-million in revenue in 2020 and has an order book of around US$ 95 million as of date. 
“The acquisition of Fasttel is in line with KPTL’s strategy to strengthen its core EPC business and have greater geographical presence in stable and growing markets. The transaction is likely to close by the end of Q1FY22,” read the KPTL statement.
Commenting on the acquisition, Sanjay Dalmia, executive director, KPTL, said, “We continue to expand our geographical reach aligned to our vision of being a local player in the global environment. This acquisition of Fasttel is of strategic fit to KPTL to capture local market opportunities in Brazil and expand business in the Latin American market. Fasttel has a track record of revenue growth of more than 25% CAGR over the last five years, along with consistent profitability. It has experienced manpower that does in-house engineering, procurement, land survey, planning, environment clearances and construction.
“Brazil is a large and well-regulated power transmission and distribution market with sizable investment planned in next ten years. .. Both the companies will leverage each other’s capabilities and look forward to creating a strong presence in Brazil and larger Latin American T&D market.”
KPTL has a strong international presence in power transmission and distribution. It is currently executing several contracts in India, Africa, Europe, Middle East, CIS, SAARC, and Far East.

The call, launched in collaboration with joint programming platform ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems and Mission Innovation, invites global trans-national projects that accelerate the implementation, adaption, and knowledge creation of digital solutions in energy systems and networks. The solutions must identify and address critical challenges in the digitalization process towards a green energy society.
DST has allocated a total funding amount of one million euros for the Indian partners.
 “Projects are strongly encouraged to involve “need-owners” and relevant stakeholders in all project phases to maximize market acceptance and uptake within the development of technologies and solutions. These shall also consider adoption by addressing market and regulation topics and are highly encouraged to identify and involve need-owners in development”—reads the RfP document.
Funded projects will benefit from being part of a global innovation network and a network of associated partners providing the ‘need-owner’ perspective and supporting projects from the proposal phase until market uptake. Further, a transnational knowledge community will enable exchange with other energy experts and bring project results to a broad audience. 
The ERA-Net SES Knowledge Management Team will provide administrative, communication and content-related support through information material, events, and feedback along the project lifetime. 
ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems is a trans-national joint programming platform of 30 national and regional funding partners co-creating energy system innovation for implementing smart energy systems. Mission Innovation is a global initiative of 24 countries and the European Commission on behalf of the European Union working to accelerate clean energy innovation. 
The deadline for submitting expressions of interest is February 17, 2021. The projects are scheduled to start before June 15, 2022.

South Korean multinational electronics company LG Electronics has launched, on the German market, the Home Energy Package, a hybrid system combining a heat pump, a PV system, and battery storage to provide residential buildings and small businesses with heat and electricity.
The system consists of photovoltaic modules from the LG Neon series, the three-phase ESS Home 8/10 battery storage system and the Therma V air-water heat pump. An energy management system is integrated to enable users to achieve maximum self-consumption.
The system can be controlled via an app developed by the South Korean manufacturer.
Customers can choose from different model variants for the PV modules, storage tanks, and heat pumps so that the system can be adapted to their respective electricity and heat requirements. “We are the only manufacturer on the German market to offer a sustainable, sector-coupled system without joints in terms of hardware and software,” said Kyuwon Heo, business development team leader at LG Electronics.
The system comes with a ten-year guarantee for the storage tank and, if the entire package is purchased, the heat pump. Furthermore, the modules are covered by a 25-year guarantee.
The company said that the system can be easily integrated with other LG products, including charging stations for electric vehicles.
