https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/29/borosil-renewables-profit-drops-47-as-margins-contract/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOLAR GLASS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 29, 2023",Borosil Renewables profit drops 47% as margins contract,"Borosil Renewables recorded a net profit (profit after tax) of INR 88.54 crore in FY 2023, a decrease of 47% over FY 2022.
Net revenue from operations was INR 688.17 crore, an increase of 6.8% over FY2022.
The company’s margins were significantly impacted as the cost of inputs went up by 60-70% in the last calendar year, and, on the other hand, selling prices declined to compete with cheap solar glass imports from China.
Specifically, Borosil Renewables attributed the contraction in margins to the expiry of anti-dumping duty on solar glass imports from China with effect from August 2022, a significant drop in international fair trades, and a considerable rise in the cost of inputs like natural gas, soda ash, packing materials, and other commodities.
Exports during FY2023, including two customers in SEZ, grew 14.2% year-on-year to INR 195.25 crore, comprising 28.4% of the INR 688.17 crore turnover. Direct exports increased to INR 181.07 crore from INR 127 crore in FY2022.
Europe and Turkey were the major export markets. The company said it will continue focusing on the export market. It is also looking to increase its presence in the domestic market, as module manufacturing in India is growing very fast.
“The overall demand situation for solar glass continues to look robust in India as the domestic module manufacturing capacities are expected to rise to almost 100 GW in the next two or three years from about 35 GW currently,” stated the company.

A major yet often underestimated issue, soiling – a gradual covering of the solar module surface by fine particles such as dust, dirt, or sand – can badly affect the performance of a PV system. A real-world study was recently conducted at the Green Energy Park research platform in Ben Guerir, Morocco, to evaluate the performance of antistatic and hydrophobic coatings for PV panels in challenging, semi-arid weather conditions.
The study, done in collaboration with Portuguese anti-soiling specialist ChemiTek Solar, involved testing various coating and cleaning strategies on five PV systems, all featuring the same technologies and electrical configurations.
The first PV system remained uncleaned and did not undergo any coating or cleaning solutions. The second PV system was periodically cleaned with just water. The third PV system employed ChemiTek’s Solar Wash Protect (SWP) cleaning and antistatic protection solution. The fourth and fifth PV systems, the company’s other solutions D-Solar Defender (DSD) and Industrial Glass Protect (IGP) respectively, employed unique combinations of two hydrophobic coatings.
After nine months of operation, the results demonstrated significant efficiency gains in the coated PV panels compared to the reference system. During the initial three-month cleaning period, the average efficiency gain of the coated PV panels was approximately 10%. In the subsequent non-cleaning period of six months, the efficiency gain remained around 5%. The cumulative energy gain of the coated systems, compared to the water-cleaned reference, reached an average of 3% after the outdoor exposure period.
The presence of the coatings on the PV modules significantly reduced the quantity of water needed to clean them. The SWP  cleaning and antistatic protection solution, for instance, required 50% less water compared to the system cleaned without a cleaning solution. The SWP detergent for solar module cleaning and protection was more successful at dust removal during the dry season (August-February) with low rain rates. However, during the rainy season (March-April), IGP outperformed SWP and DSD, with a small difference in PV performance.
“This study demonstrates the significance of using new cleaning strategies such as anti-soling coatings in dry areas to enhance the performance of photovoltaic systems, which may be useful for investors, researchers, and engineers interested in grid-connected photovoltaic and self-cleaning technology,” the researchers said in “Performance Analysis of Innovative Cleaning and Soiling Mitigation Solutions in the Semi-Arid Climate of Benguerir, Morocco,” which was recently published in Heliyon.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/29/annual-floating-solar-additions-to-top-6-gw-by-2031-says-woodmac/,"FLOATING SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 29, 2023","Annual floating solar additions to top 6 GW by 2031, says WoodMac","From pv magazine Global
The global FPV fleet is expected to grow at a steady rate as land scarcity and increasing land cost for ground-mounted PV projects continues to drive demand. By 2031, the annual FPV capacity additions are expected to top the 6 GW threshold, according to research firm Wood Mackenzie.
Fifteen countries are forecasted to exceed 500 MW of cumulative FPV installations by 2031. China, India, and Indonesia, which made up almost 70% of the total FPV demand in 2022, are forecast to stay in the lead.
WoodMac expects FPV to have a steady market share compared to overall global solar demand, with the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for FPV expected to rise 15% in the 2022-31 period.
“Despite development costs of FPVs ranging between 20-50% higher than comparable ground-mount projects, increased competitiveness in the developer and EPC landscape is helping to drive down costs in the sector,” Ting Yu, a consultant at Wood Mackenzie, said at the SNEC PV Power Expo in Shanghai this week.

The Asia-Pacific market will continue to lead demand. The region had approximately 3 GW of floating solar projects in 2022, capturing over 90% of the global FPV market. In China, cumulative FPV capacity is projected to cross 13 GW by 2031 at a 12% CAGR over the next 10 years.
“China will continue to lead in floating solar installations. The country has been able to utilize flooded coal mines that have been decommissioned to develop floating solar,” said Yu.
With almost 150 MW, Europe is the second largest region for FPV demand. The Netherlands, representing 32% of Europe’s FPV market in 2022, is the top developer of FPV projects in Europe, followed by France.
The Netherlands is home to the largest FPV project outside the Asia-Pacific region – the 41.4 MW Sellingen floating solar park, which came online in 2021. However, WoodMac predicts slow growth for the Dutch market after 2025 “as the main spots would have already been developed by this point.”
For the US, floating solar CAGR is estimated at roughly 13% by 2031, where development is being driven in regions with high demand for solar but expensive land costs, including California, Florida, and New Jersey.
“Overall, the floating solar industry has seen high costs across all market segments, due to component costs and other soft cost increases, as a result of supply chain constraints in 2022,” Yu said.
For instance, the rise in price for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was the main driver of high structural balance of system (SBOS) costs for FPV. However, WoodMac expects the cost to fall as the supply chain expands.
According to S&P Global, 3.4 GW of floating PV capacity was installed across the world by the end of 2021. The market intelligence firm predicts that global floating PV demand will reach up to 14 GW by 2026. About 92% of those installations will likely be built in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by favorable policies and installation targets, says S&P Global.
