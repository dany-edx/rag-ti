The company today announced it has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HydrogenPro as it looks to tap the emerging green hydrogen market. 
Under this agreement, L&T and HydrogenPro will set up a joint venture in India for gigawatt-scale manufacturing of alkaline water electrolyzers based on HydrogenPro technology. The gigafab will serve the Indian market and also supply to other select geographies. 
The proposed joint venture in India is in line with L& T’s strategic vision to be present across the green energy value chain and HydrogenPro’s strategy of establishing a global manufacturing footprint to maintain cost leadership and ensure local presence, read an L&T statement. 
SN Subrahmanyan, chief executive officer and managing director, L&T said, “The energy industry is undergoing a tectonic shift with Green Hydrogen emerging as a key fuel in the future energy basket…This will be a win-win partnership given our extensive relationship across the energy industry, deep EPC experience in this sector, and successful ongoing collaborations with many MNCs and HydrogenPro’s focus to stay ahead of the curve as far as technology leadership is concerned”. 
“We’re extremely pleased to enter this Memorandum of Understanding with L&T, an E&C powerhouse which is the perfect partner to establish HydrogenPro in the Indian market, a huge and growing energy market with tremendous potential for hydrogen-based solutions,” said Elling Nygaard, CEO of HydrogenPro. 
“We are looking forward to this exciting journey and making this partnership work for creating sustainable infrastructure for the future. The Green Hydrogen industry is at a nascent stage with an immense potential to offer great opportunities. This partnership is a right step in creating clean, green and sustainable future,” said Subramanian Sarma, Whole Time Director (Energy), L&T. 
Green Hydrogen demand in India is estimated to grow up to two million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA) by 2030 in line with the nation’s Green Hydrogen Mission, which would require investments upward of $60 billion. The nation, which targets 500 GW of non-fossil fuel based electricity capacity by 2030, is well suited for green hydrogen production due to the low generation costs of renewable electricity from abundantly available solar PV and wind power sources. The country aims to be among the world’s largest Green Hydrogen hubs and has a plan for using the same across the sectors. Green hydrogen can also provide India the energy security by reducing the ever-increasing energy import bill and a pathway to green alternatives for “hard-to-abate” industries, like refineries, fertilizers, steel, and transport. 
HydrogenPro designs and supplies customized hydrogen plants in cooperation with global partners and suppliers, all ISO 9001, ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 certified. Its core product is the alkaline high-pressure electrolyzer.
HydrogenPro claims “With the new electrode technology, it is able to increase the efficiency of each unit by 14% to reach 93% of the theoretical maximum.” “This is a significant step forward as the cost of electric power, depending on market prices, amounts to 70-90% of the cost of producing hydrogen. The value of such increased efficiency equals approximately the investment cost for the entire plant in a Total Cost of Operation perspective.”

A new workforce of about one million could be employed to take up these green jobs over the eight fiscal years. This would be ten times more than an estimated 1.1 lakh (110,000) of the workforce employed by the solar and wind sector in FY2020-21, according to an independent study released today by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Skill Council for Green Jobs (SCGJ).
The study ‘India’s Expanding Clean Energy Workforce’ highlighted that most of the new jobs would be generated by small-scale renewable energy projects such as rooftop solar and mini and micro-grid systems compared to utility or large-scale projects like solar parks. Jobs created are different from the workforce needed, as one worker can perform more than one job.
As per the study, rooftop solar installations (106 GW) would create 80% of the overall 3.4 million jobs, utility-scale solar (with 132 GW) 16%, and wind (101 GW) 4%.
The CEEW-NRDC-SCGJ analysis also highlighted the adverse impact of the pandemic on employment in the renewable energy sector. In comparison to 12,400 new workers employed in the sector in FY19, only 5,200 new workers were employed in FY2019-20 and 6,400 were employed in FY2020-21. In FY2020-21, a majority of the new workers were employed in the rooftop solar segment where annual capacity additions grew by 9% over FY2019-20 and accounted for 1.4 GW capacity.
The study further found that India has successfully trained 78,000 people under the Suryamitra training program, between 2015 and 2017, to improve the availability of skilled workers for clean energy projects.
Dr Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW said: “India’s ambitious renewable energy targets provide an opportunity to deliver on jobs, growth, and sustainability while transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The upcoming Union Budget must especially focus on scaling up rooftop solar, mini and microgrid systems, and domestic solar manufacturing to maximize the employment opportunities in the sector. Further, to accelerate the deployment of solar parks and increase the uptake of decentralized renewable energy applications such as solar pumps and rooftops in rural India, it would be critical to train the rural youth and make them employable in various parts of the renewables ecosystem.”
Sameer Kwatra, Director, India Program at NRDC said: “India’s unprecedented renewables journey can set a new paradigm on how countries pursue prosperity without adding carbon to the atmosphere. With nearly 700 million people under the age of 30, creating clean futuristic jobs is a priority for the country. Powering the economy through renewable energy will not only enhance energy independence, avoid carbon emissions and air pollution, but also help meet India’s employment goals. The time to invest in renewable energy technologies and skillset of the future is now.”
“Availability of a skilled workforce is critical to leveraging the employment opportunities that the renewable energy sector could generate in the coming years. The clean energy skill development programs should target rural areas and training curriculums should be periodically updated to meet the industry requirements. It’s also important to provide training on emerging technologies like batteries and green hydrogen so that a skilled workforce is available to accelerate their deployment.” said Dr Praveen Saxena, CEO of SCGJ.
The CEEW-NRDC-SCGJ study also recommended that India should focus on playing a bigger role in the global supply chain through improvement in local manufacturing of solar cells and panels. Policymakers should also focus on strengthening the grid infrastructure to accommodate the high levels of variable renewable energy. These allied sectors would create additional employment opportunities.  
At COP26 in Glasgow, India committed to installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity and generating 50% of its electricity through renewable energy sources by 2030. The 500 GW non-fossil fuel-based capacity includes RE (wind, utility-scale solar, rooftop solar, bioenergy, small hydro, and off-grid solar), nuclear and large hydro.

Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp has unveiled the NU-JC410 solar panel, a half-cut monocrystalline PERC product with a 21% efficiency rating and 410 W of power output.
The IEC61215 and IEC61730-certified panel features 108 half-cells based on M10 wafers and a 10-busbar design. It has overall dimensions of 1,722×1,134×3.5mm and weighs in at 21.8kg.
The panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V and an operating temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. It comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.341% per degree Celsius and its power tolerance reaches up to 5%, the manufacturer claims.
“The new modules are suitable for short frame side clamping, and are designed for residential, small–scale commercial and industrial rooftop installations,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The low weight and dimension make these modules easy and comfortable for transport, handling and installation.”
The module is fabricated with a white backsheet and anti-reflective, highly-transmissive, low iron tempered glass, and a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy and silver. The Japanese manufacturer said that its half-cut modules feature three small junction boxes, instead of one; all with bypass diodes. These enclosures transfer less heat to the upper cells, which helps to extend the lifetime of panels while improving overall system performance, it claimed.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/27/huge-aluminum-demand-expected-in-solar-industry-concerns-arise-on-emissions/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 27, 2022","Huge aluminum demand expected in solar industry, concerns arise on emissions","From pv magazine Global
Owing to its high conductivity, low weight and excellent corrosion resistance, aluminium is one of the key raw materials in the solar industry used in cells, module frames, mountings and inverters. While abundant and cheap, the primary production of aluminium comes at a high cost in terms of energy and associated greenhouse gas emissions, which will need to be taken into consideration if we are  to rapidly reduce emissions to ‘net zero’ and limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius.
A group of researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) have sounded the alarm bell about the climate pressure aluminium could create if we were to solely rely on primary production by 2050. They found that the growth to 60TW of PV, envisaged by the broad electrification scenarios of recent photovoltaic roadmaps, could require up to 486 MT of aluminium by 2050. This enormous manufacturing task could in turn undermine PV’s green credentials due to its large global warming potential.
“If the emissions intensity of the primary production process is not reduced, then more than 3000 Mt CO2e could be released in the atmosphere,” researcher Alison Lennon, told pv magazine. “However, if we can decarbonise the electricity used to smelt aluminium, utilize as much secondary aluminium as possible and collect and re-use aluminium from old modules, then we can significantly curtail this global warming.”
Namely, to have more than 60TW of PV installed by 2050, up from just over 700GWp at the end of 2020, we would need to produce up to 4.5TW of additional capacity each year. The researchers modelled different primary production emissions reduction scenarios to 2050 targets of 1.5 (base scenario), 3.5, 5.5 and 7.5 t CO2e t aluminium and compared this to the worst case scenario in which the emissions intensity is unchanged from the 2020 levels with a primary production emissions intensity of 14.5 tones of carbon dioxide for each tone of aluminium produced.
They considered process improvements directed at reducing direct emissions, potential alternatives to aluminium and the use of recycled content in the aluminium as the most efficient way to reducing the material’s global warming potential. They reminded that aluminium is attractive to recycle because its secondary production requires only around 5% of the energy required for primary production and generates just 3–5% of the emissions from primary production. In their analysis, the percentage of recycled content in the aluminium used for the added capacity was assumed to linearly increase from 34% in 2020 to 75% in 2050.
Finally, the researchers underlined that efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of aluminium production need to happen within the next 10 years to provide the best opportunity of keeping emissions to below 1,000 Mt of CO2 equivalent by 2050. Their research was published in the journal Nature Sustainability.
