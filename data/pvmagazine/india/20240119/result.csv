The proposed technique utilizes an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), which is a special type of artificial neural network using the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference system. The ANFIS is mainly intended to limit the disadvantages of fuzzy and neural network controllers, and in PV systems its goal is to reduce faults.
“The rules of ANFIS approximate the PV function from a nonlinear way to a linear way,” the scientists said. “Also, this network is used in energy management systems for the smooth operation of PV-fed batteries.”
The new method is also based on the use of controllers relying on the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, which mimics the social behavior of grey wolves in hunting.
“In this algorithm, there are four major parameters which are alpha, beta, delta, plus omega,” the research team noted. “The alpha (α) variable is illustrated as an optimal solution from the different possible solutions or leader wolf. Similarly, the beta (β), and delta (δ) constants are selected as the second, and third-best optimal solutions from the search space. The normal wolf solution is given by omega (ω).”
The proposed configuration, according to its creators, provides for optimized wolves’ exploration convergence ratio, while balancing their population and search for space. It also ensures that PV voltage is supplied to the power DC-DC converter for enhancing the PV source voltage to meet future microgrid voltages.
The scientists tested the performance of the MPPT technique and the associated solar system-fed converter circuit in a series of simulations conducted on a 3-diode model PV array via the Matlab-Simulink software. A source-side capacitor filtered the PV power ripples and protected the switches at rapid variations of supply voltages. A supply inductor charged the supply voltage of PV under the MOSFET forward bias condition and smoothened the supply voltage.
“The MOSFET is used because its properties are less gate-to-source voltage required for going to conduct, operates high efficiency at low rated voltages, consists of high source resistance to limit the gate current, quick working response, plus less possibility of damage,” the academics explained.
The simulation considered parameters such as oscillations across MPP, output power extraction, settling time of the MPP, dependency on the PV modeling, operating duty value of the converter, error finding accuracy of MPPT, algorithm complexity, tracking speed, periodic tuning required, and the number of sensing parameters utilized.
The research group claimed the new hybrid MPPT technique can provide “good results” when compared with other MPPT methods, with the PV source voltage rising from one level to another level. “The merits of the utilized converter are easy understanding, high reliability, plus lower price to implement,” it added.
The findings were introduced in the paper “A novel on design and implementation of hybrid MPPT controllers for solar PV systems under various partial shading conditions,” published in scientific reports.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/19/solar-corporate-funding-hits-decade-long-high-in-2023-globally/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",PATRICK JOWETT,"JANUARY 19, 2024",Solar corporate funding hits decade-long high in 2023 globally,"Solar companies raised $34.3 billion in corporate funding last year – the largest amount in a decade, according to Mercom Capital Group’s latest report on funding and merger and acquisition (M&A) activity for the sector.
The overall figure accounts for 160 deals and represents a 42% year-on-year increase from 2022, when $24.1 billion was made across 175 deals.
Funding from private marketing financing reached $7.4 billion last year, a 45% increase from last year and the second highest figure since 2013. Meanwhile, solar companies raised $20 billion in debt financing, a 67% increase from last year and the highest amount in the last decade. Mercom Capital Group said securitization activity was a key contributor, with $3.4 billion in 11 deals.
Funding from solar venture capital activity was down 1% on last year, reaching $6.9 billion across 69 deals in 2023. From that figure, $4.7 billion (68%) went to 42 solar downstream companies. Solar companies raised $1.9 billion, balance of system companies raised $311 million and service providers raised $32 million.
Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu said investments into solar continue to defy expectations.
“Driven by the Inflation Reduction Act, the global focus on energy security, and favourable policies worldwide, solar continues to attract significant investments,” he said.
While funding activity was strong, M&A activity declined 25% year-on-year, with 96 corporate transactions in 2023, compared to 128 in 2022. The largest transaction was by Brookfield Renewable, which acquired Duke Energy’s unregulated utility-scale commercial renewables business in the United States for approximately $2.8 billion.
“Higher borrowing costs have put a damper on M&A transactions, with cautious investors biding their time for more favourable valuations,” Prabhu said. “Solar projects continue to attract interest, but high valuations and a lower risk appetite, compounded by unpredictable project completion timelines due to interconnection delays, labour shortages, and scarcity of components, have all contributed to a drop-off in project M&A activity.”
There were 231 large-scale solar project acquisitions in 2023, down from 268 deals in 2022. In 2023, almost 45.4 GW of solar projects were acquired in 2023, compared to 66 GW in 2022, down 31% year on year.

France deployed around 921 MW of new PV systems in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to new figures released by French grid operator Enedis. For all of 2023, the country added 3,135 MW of new solar capacity.
The results represent a 30% increase from 2022, when around 2.6 GW of solar was installed. In 2021, the nation added 2.8 GW of new PV capacity.
Enedis said the figures for 2023 are provisional, so the total could actually be higher. The grid operator said that one-third of the capacity installed last year, or around 1,122 MW, came from PV systems under the national self-consumption scheme. It noted that self-consumption PV capacity almost doubled to reach 2,256 MW.
“The results of this year must be recognized and supported,” said Daniel Bour, president of Enerplan, the French solar association. “2024 will, logically, amplify these results, following the new regulatory provisions, with an objective that we expect to be well above 4 GW.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/19/saudi-arabia-in-prime-position-for-green-hydrogen-in-global-energy-landscape/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 19, 2024",Saudi Arabia in prime position for green hydrogen in global energy landscape,"An international research team has investigated the economic and technical green energy potential of Saudi Arabia and has found that the country should address a series of structural challenges to become a global hydrogen hub.
The group said Saudi Arabia is moving away from investigation and demonstrations and toward larger-scale development. The researchers estimated the total amount of investments made in green hydrogen thus far at around $900 million. However, they also acknowledged that oil remains the backbone of its energy industry and economy.
“Saudi Arabia’s economy is heavily dependent on the oil and gas sector, accounting for about 50% of its GDP, 70% of government revenue, and 90% of its export earnings,” they said.
The country launched its National Hydrogen Strategy in 2020, with the aim of becoming a major exporter. Its Vision 2030 strategy set a target to generate 50% of the nation’s electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030.
The researchers analyzed the potential of hydrogen in all of its possible forms in Saudi Arabia, including green, blue, grey and turquoise hydrogen technologies. They noted that the current hydrogen strategy bets on blue hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, as well as green hydrogen generated with wind and solar electricity.
“The plan aims to produce 1.2 million tons of green hydrogen and to supply 10% of the global demand for hydrogen by 2030,” they explained. “Furthermore, Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (SAPIF) has been investing in several energy projects globally, including a joint venture with Power and Air Products to develop a $5 billion green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. The facility will have a capacity of 1.2 GW and will produce 650 tons of green hydrogen per day.”
One of the key advantages of Saudi Arabia in the hydrogen race is its high solar radiation levels. This, combined with wide land availability, can ensure one of the lowest, if not the lowest, levelized costs of energy (LCOE) for PV in the world.
The scientists identified a series of structural and local challenges that need to be addressed to enable the birth of a hydrogen economy in the country. They cited high capital costs, limited economies of scale, high electrolyzer costs, limited water resources, a lack of incentives, and low demand. They also noted fossil fuel dependency, a lack of regulations and infrastructure, the limited domestic market, and political instability.
“The government needs to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for green hydrogen production and distribution and invest in the necessary infrastructure to support the industry,” the researchers said, adding that a long-term commitment would be needed to reach this goal. “The infrastructural limitations of green hydrogen production in Saudi Arabia related to transportation, storage, and distribution pose significant challenges that must be addressed for the industry to develop.”
The roadmap outlined by the scientists is structured around six main pillars: creating a stable policy framework, building an infrastructure, setting up an R&D ecosystem, building demand, creating capacity, and supporting cooperation between all players.
If all of these actions materialize, Saudi Arabia could become a hydrogen exporter between 2030 and 2035 and also maximize its green energy potential in the following five-year period.
“The focus should shift to increasing the country exports of green hydrogen, particularly to Asia and Europe,” the academics said. “The government should establish partnerships with countries that are seeking to transition to renewable energy sources, particularly those with a high demand for hydrogen.”
The scientists concluded by saying that Saudi Arabia enjoys an enviable position for green hydrogen in the global energy landscape.
“It is clear that green hydrogen production is a trend that is here to stay, and as the world moves towards decarbonization, Saudi Arabia has an opportunity to become a leader in green hydrogen production and contribute to the global effort to mitigate climate change,” they said.
They presented the roadmap in “Energy futures and green hydrogen production: Is Saudi Arabia trend?“, which was recently published in Results in Engineering. The team included academics from the University of Diyala, Al-Farahidi University, and Al-Turath University College in Iraq, as well as the AGH University of Science and Technology in Poland and Qatar University and the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia.
pv magazine and Solarabic have developed a new event in the Saudi energy landscape – SunRise Arabia Clean Energy Conference 2024 – that combines their long-term market expertise. The event will take place in Riyadh on Jan. 31. One of the event’s sessions will include a discussion about green hydrogen and large-scale electrolysis projects.
