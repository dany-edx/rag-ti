The modules are built with 144 half-cut mono PERC cells, formed using gallium (Ga)-doped wafers, and ten busbars. These are available in power outputs ranging from 535 W to 550 W, with power conversion efficiency between 20.7% and 21.33% under standard test conditions. The open-circuit voltage is 49.98 V to 50.62 V, and the short-circuit current 13.5 A to 13.86 A.
“The USP of this range is high module efficiency, shade tolerance, less hot spots, and reduced power loss. The modules are cost effective and provide maximum output from a limited space,” Arpit Aggarwal, managing director, NeoSol told pv magazine.
Each panel has dimensions of 2,278×1,134×35 mm and weighs 29 kg. It features a 3.2 mm anti-reflective tempered glass, composite film backsheet, and silver anodized aluminum frame (black frame available on request). The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V DC. The panel has a Pmax temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius, and its operating temperature ranges from -40°C to +85°C.
The panel is certified to withstand wind-induced load of 2,400 Pascal and snow load of 5,400 Pascal.
