The developer now has a cumulative operational hybrid capacity of 1,440 MW, including its newly commissioned 450 MW power plant in Jaisalmer.
The Jaisalmer plant consists of 420 MW solar and 105 MW wind capacities. It benefits from power purchase agreements with the Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) at a tariff of INR 2.67/kWh for 25 years.
AGEL’s other two operational wind-solar plants include 390 MW and 600 MW—both located in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. It commissioned these plants in May and September, respectively.
With the latest addition in Jaisalmer, AGEL now has a total operational generation capacity of 7.17 GW.

The plants are expected to be complete by 2024. Once operational, ACE estimates these recycling parks will cumulatively produce 1.6 million tons of recycled metals containing lead, lithium, nickel, and cobalt. 
ACE’s first commercial lithium battery recycling facility is set to start up this month in Ghaziabad, India, where it will recycle various battery chemistries such as lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NCM), lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) to extract valuable battery materials.
A second Indian facility in Mundra is expected to come online in Q4 2023 at the same time as ACE’s flagship plant in Texas, USA will begin operations. 
The company will be deploying its proprietary hydrometallurgical recycling process that combines an emissions-free, low-temperature process with recovery rates of over 98%. It can reclaim valuable metals like copper and aluminum, while also being able to handle a wide variety of the world’s most utilized lithium-ion battery chemistries. The process also produces zero toxic solid waste or effluent. Materials recovered also include a variety of sulfates and carbonates of cobalt, manganese, and nickel.
ACE has signed a 15-year offtake agreement with Glencore, one of the world’s largest natural resources companies, for the recycled lead as well as key battery metal-based end products from recycled lithium-ion batteries. The agreement allows Glencore to purchase up to 100% of ACE’s products from its planned battery recycling parks being built in the United States, India, and Thailand.
Once operating at a commercial scale, ACE’s recycling facilities forming part of the agreement with Glencore are estimated to have a total annual processing capacity of 250,000 tons of lead-acid batteries and 47,000 tons of lithium-ion batteries.

(PFC) arm PFC Consulting.
The project was awarded to Sterlite Power through tariff-based competitive bidding in March 2022. Through Kishtwar Transmission Ltd, the company will build, own, operate, and maintain a critical transmission project in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) for a period of 35 years.
The project will comprise a 400/132kV GIS substation at Kishtwar and a 400 kV Kishenpur-Dulhasti LILO (Line in Line out) transmission line. The transmission system will be used for the evacuation of 1 GW of power from the Pakaldul Hydro Electric Project to the Kishtwar substation.
This will be Sterlite Power’s 17th power transmission project in India under the tariff-based competitive bidding mode.
Sterlite Power has a portfolio of 30 projects covering around 14,602 circuit km of transmission lines across India and Brazil.
