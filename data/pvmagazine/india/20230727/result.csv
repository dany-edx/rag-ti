The government targets the installation of 20 lakh standalone solar agriculture pumps and the solarisation of 15 lakh grid-connected agriculture pumps under this scheme.
The minister of new & renewable energy and power, R.K. Singh, shared in the parliament this week that as of June 30, 2023, 244,373 solar pumps have been installed against the allocation of 947,991. Further, an existing 1,519 grid-connected agriculture pumps have been solarized.
The minister cited the availability of low-cost finance for farmers and states’ share of funds as a major challenge in the implementation of the PM-KUSUM Scheme. He said the pace of implementation was also significantly affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020-21 and 2021-22.
Under the PM KUSUM Scheme, individual farmers are provided financial support to install standalone solar agriculture pumps of up to 7.5 HP for replacement of existing diesel agriculture pumps/irrigation systems in off-grid areas, where grid supply is not available. Pumps of capacity higher than 7.5 HP can also be installed, however, the financial support is limited to 7.5 HP capacity.
Similarly, individual farmers having grid-connected agriculture pumps are supported to solarize their pumps. The farmer can use the generated solar power to meet the irrigation needs and sell the excess solar power to DISCOMs at a pre-fixed tariff.
In both cases, the government provides central financial assistance (CFA) of 30% of the benchmark cost or the tender cost, whichever is lower. State Government subsidy is 30% and the remaining 40% is to be borne by the farmer.
In North Eastern States, Sikkim, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Lakshadweep, and Andaman & Nicobar Islands, CFA is higher at 50% and state government subsidy 30%. The remaining 20% is to be borne by the farmer.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/27/going-beyond-renewable-non-renewable-dichotomy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 27, 2023",Going beyond renewable/non-renewable dichotomy,"Researchers at the Vellore Institute of Technology in India have proposed a new classification of energy sources that is intended to go beyond the usual dichotomy between renewable and non-renewable, or conventional, sources.
“The drawback of conventional taxonomies is that they fail to adopt and define emerging technologies, which is solved by this new classification,” the research’s lead author, Ramkumar Alajingi, told pv magazine. “What we call renewables are sources whose origin is Earth/gravitational force. Whilst for bioheat, for example, the origin is ourselves. Our classification of energy sources allows proper knowledge of each energy source’s behavior.”
In the study “Novel classification of energy sources, with implications for carbon emissions,” published in Energy Strategy Reviews, Alajingi and his colleagues described the proposed classification as a 3-tier taxonomy based on each source’s characteristics with respect to the environment.
“Selecting low carbon emissions as criteria for promotion will effectively counter the hidden strategies of individual nation/organization energy policies for self-economic growth,” they specified, claiming that current taxonomies are subjective and rely on personal definitions attributed to each source.
The proposed new classification includes three categories: Renewable energy sources, which comprise solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass, as well as wave and tidal energy; Reserve energies, including coal, gas, petroleum, nuclear, geothermal, and hydrogen produced via electrolysis; and Capture energy sources, which embrace heat losses from turbines and engineering processes, movement of air mass due to the passage of cars and trains, heat liberated from the human body, and vibration evolved due to pressure disturbance.
“Never categorized energy sources are added to the newly coined term capture energy sources,” the researchers explained, referring to the third category, noting that the old classification uses the non-renewable term for mostly brown energy such as coal, gas, and petroleum. “All man-made actions as primary causes to produce energy are grouped in this classification. The energy is in any form as heat, light, pressure and friction, etc. but unlike traditional methods, the harvesting of these sources requires modern techniques.”
This category is then divided into discharged energy sources and evolved energy sources. The latter includes all energy coming from man-made or engineered actions and the former comprises all energy forms discharged from a process as a waste or by-product.
Referring to the first of the three main categories, the Indian group said that these sources generate low carbon emissions, are location-dependent, and are proven cost-effective energy conversion solutions. “These sources never deplete from the earth,” they stressed. “It must be noted that solar, wind, tidal, and wave energies have the nature of immediate dispersion into the atmosphere if not captured.”
As for the second category, which includes conventional sources, the team said it also includes geothermal and water electrolysis of hydrogen, as these sources are based on the source reserve nature in the environment and avoids the space for conflicts.
“It is insisted that the nature of availability and present usage are vital parameters in assuring the reliability of sources for uninterrupted supply,” the academics concluded. “The terms replenish energy, reserve energy, and capture energy sources replaced the conventional 2-tier renewable and non-renewable energy sources classification.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/27/the-hydrogen-motives-understanding-the-why-of-the-hydrogen-push-in-asia-and-beyond/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,ASIA,INDIA",,"JULY 27, 2023",The hydrogen motives: understanding the ‘why’ of the hydrogen push in Asia and beyond,"Interest in hydrogen is on the rise worldwide. In Asia, the use of hydrogen and its fuel derivatives, such as ammonia and methanol, is being promoted for novel applications such as transport and power generation because burning hydrogen releases no carbon dioxide. It is timely to outline the motivating factors and industries at play in the hydrogen space to understand a landscape also shared by renewable energy and electrification.
Clean hydrogen deployment will be instrumental in the pursuit of global net-zero emissions as not all sectors can easily switch to a renewable electricity path. The International Energy Agency has forecasted a potential need for more than 500 million tonnes annually by 2050. Current global consumption stands at about 100 million tonnes a year, mainly for fertilizers, oil refining and other industries using hydrogen that is practically all made from fossil fuels.
Skeptics are less optimistic about the growth of hydrogen, considering energy-inefficient supply chains, competing alternative pathways, and an apparent lack of enthusiasm around the world to clean up existing hydrogen uses before leaping into other applications. The contrasting views form a crucial juncture that calls attention to hydrogen’s potential for being oversold by industries trying to stay relevant.
It is not all rosy, because downsides may be seen in production, transport and costs. Clean hydrogen is still very expensive. It is created by two main methods: “green hydrogen” is produced with electrolysis using clean electricity, and “blue hydrogen” through the processing of fossil fuels combined with carbon capture, the latter of which is under scrutiny for its emission performance. Then, to move the manufactured hydrogen from its point of origin to usage, energy losses of 60%-70% are often encountered. Due to these drawbacks, some industries want to secure government support.
Notable progress can be observed in major energy importers such as Japan, which has exhibited leadership in bilateral and multilateral initiatives. The country has produced less than 14% of its energy needs over the past decade, in contrast with other industrial nations, which typically show stronger energy self-sufficiency, for instance, the United States with 106% and Australia, 345%, in 2020.
It is therefore unsurprising that Japan is pursuing more importable commodities. In April, the country announced plans to quadruple its hydrogen target by investing US$107 billion in the hydrogen supply chain over the next 15 years. The substantial commitment built on Japan’s receipt in recent years of blue ammonia from Saudi Arabia and liquefied hydrogen made from Australian coal, both shipments being the world’s first.
While the emission credentials of the cargoes will likely still invite questions, Japan’s pioneering efforts toward establishing a new global supply chain are evident and may tempt other Asian countries to jump on the bandwagon, as users or as exporters.
Elsewhere in Asia, the fuel has been gaining traction in major energy-importing countries. South Korea is home to the world’s largest fleet of hydrogen-powered cars. China is pursuing the establishment of electrolyzer manufacturing, although its near-term clean hydrogen target is modest.
India is exploring green hydrogen, having an eye to reducing dependence on imported fuels and feedstocks leveraging its renewables expansion. Singapore, home to sizable refinery and petrochemical industries, is another country contemplating hydrogen.
The hydrogen trend can be further illuminated by mapping industry interests to complement the country-level targets. There can be dual paths that different sectors can take in pursuing net-zero goals. The first path is the adoption of hydrogen and its derivatives, while the second path describes clean energy and electrification. There are certainly other pathways with current and future technologies.
By way of example, contrast shipping with the gas pipeline sector. Shorter shipping routes are expected to be electrified, but on the whole, vessel electrification will probably remain limited because battery life for long journeys could be challenging and will need to be complemented, such as by using the hydrogen-based methanol or ammonia. Both hydrogen-based fuels and biofuels hold prospects for the sector.
The gas pipeline sector has distinctly different considerations. In a future where the odds are on increased electrification, applications such as heating in buildings would likely tilt toward the more efficient electric-based options, such as the electric heat pump, straining the gas business. Under the scenario of tough competition, gas pipeline owners would probably fall back on existing infrastructure by proposing the repurposing of pipelines for transporting hydrogen instead, whether in full or as a partial blend with gas.
For stakeholders, a difficult exercise is to weed out which of the hydrogen promises are driven by a real pursuit of progress, and which ones in effect serve business interests vying for relevance amid a shifting landscape.
However, many are cautious about the technical limitations and safety challenges of using gas pipelines for hydrogen. Another concern is that a partial blend yields only a modest impact on emissions. A 20% hydrogen blend will raise gas prices while reducing CO2 emissions by only 6%-7%, a reason why in some markets, lobbying for government support is rising.
Hydrogen is a costly fuel, thus competition from alternative pathways will remain a challenge across all applications. Green hydrogen costs vary widely depending on its origin, ranging from US$4 to more than US$8/kg. It is comparable to the liquefied natural gas (LNG) range of US$30-US$60 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), three to six times Asian spot LNG prices in recent months. Around the world, various goals have been outlined to make hydrogen cheaper, particularly to reduce green hydrogen prices below blue hydrogen.
Suppose hydrogen meets its target price of US$1-US$2/kg in the next couple of decades and the export chain materializes. It will cost US$7-US$15/MMBtu plus significant transport charges. Japan is accustomed to importing LNG at US$10-US$13/MMBtu, but emerging Asian markets would be wise to tread carefully if they followed the Japanese’s footsteps to burn hydrogen. Countries with excellent renewable resources could be in a position to become hydrogen exporters but are unlikely consumers when other net-zero pathways remain underexplored.
Given the high costs, challenging supply chain and alternative pathways, competition is a reality even in the most promising applications of hydrogen. For stakeholders, a difficult exercise is to weed out which of the hydrogen promises are driven by a real pursuit of progress, and which ones in effect serve business interests vying for relevance – and buying time – amid a shifting landscape.
Many industries are facing a material risk of being displaced in the road to net-zero emissions. As policy support for hydrogen builds up and the market takes shape, it is important for stakeholders to understand the industry interests at play. For some sectors, hydrogen adoption could be credible because alternative net-zero pathways are limited, while for others, their foray into the fuel just does not hold water.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/27/topcon-pv-modules-outperform-perc-by-more-than-5-in-energy-yield-tests/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 27, 2023",TOPCon PV modules outperform PERC by more than 5% in energy yield tests,"From pv magazine Global
Most PV manufacturers are now well underway with the switch to n-type technologies, and we are beginning to see these modules, primarily based on n-type TOPCon technology, rolling out to mainstream installations.
As they made the switch, manufacturers promised more electricity and longer lifetimes from the new products. And as they make their way into more projects, we can see how these claims play out in the field under various climate conditions. Many studies have been carried out already, and the signs so far are good for n-type.
One such study confirms a 5.69% gain in normalized energy yield (energy generated per unit of capacity) over a three month period. German company TÜV Nord carried out the study at a test installation in Selangor, Malaysia.
Three module types were installed at the site: A 545 W n-type TOPCon module and a 540 W p-type PERC module, both using 182 mm half cells and both manufactured by JinkoSolar. A third module, also bifacial PERC, with 210 mm cells and a 645 W power rating and from an unnamed manufacturer, was also included in the test. The test installation comprised two modules of each type, installed on fixed tilt racking 1 meter above the ground and connected via micro inverters.
Performance of each module was carefully measured over the first three months of 2023. During the period, Jinko’s TOPCon module generated 205.32 kWh, while its PERC counterpart reached 192.42 kWh, and the PERC module based on 210mm cells generated 227.89 kWh.
Thanks to its higher power rating and larger size, the 210mm module generated the most energy during the three-month period. However, when normalized based on each module power rating, the n-type module achieved a yield 5.69% higher than the 182 mm PERC module used as a baseline, while the larger module was 0.97% behind.
Jinko’s n-type module also achieved the highest performance ratio of the three. Performance ratio compares the actual energy yield to a calculation based on the power rating and weather conditions. TÜV Nord measured a 96.03% performance ratio for the n-type module, with the other two trailing slightly behind.
Separately, TÜV Nord also compared JinkoSolar’s TOPCon module with a conventional PERC product in accelerated reliability testing: two modules were subject a series of laboratory tests, going beyond the standards outlined by the IEC. Modules were subject to thermal cycling, extended damp heat, mechanical load, humidity freeze and ultraviolet light.
Additional test stages designed to detect susceptibility to light induced degradation (LID) Light-elevated temperature induced degradation (LETID), and potential-induced degradation. In all of these test stages, the n-type module showed significantly better performance.
In LID testing the n-type module lost 0.26% of its initial performance, compared to 1.92% for the PERC module. LETID testing told a similar story, with a 0.09% loss for the n-type module, and 1.17 for PERC. And in UV testing, which has emerged as an area of concern for some TOPCon modules, JinkoSolar’s n-type product lost only 0.60% performance, compared with 2.21% for the PERC product.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/27/australian-manufacturer-unveils-5-12-kwh-battery-for-residential-applications/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 27, 2023",Australian manufacturer unveils 5.12 kWh battery for residential applications,"From pv magazine Australia
Vaulta said the modular nature of the 48 V 5.12 kWh residential battery, which features lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, means it can be easily scaled up to increase capacity, and seamlessly integrates with most 48 V inverters.
The company said the battery has a nominal voltage of 48 V and can deliver 4.86 kW of continuous power. It operates in temperatures ranging from -20 C to 55 C. The battery measures 933 mm high x 357 mm wide x 251 mm deep and weighs less than 55 kilograms.
Engineered and assembled at Vaulta’s Brisbane facility, the battery features the company’s patented no-weld battery case which allows for internal cells to be removed, recycled and reused, and for new cells to be added as battery technology continues to evolve.
The launch of the residential battery follows the recent announcement that Queensland-based clean energy investment firm ReNu Energy had completed its third tranche investment in Vaulta.
Valued at AUD 250,000 ($169,157.2), the tranche follows two earlier rounds of funding in January and April that form part of an investment worth up to AUD1 million in total. Vaulta has also attracted support from international investors with Turkish-based Niocycle, which is focused on making lithium-ion batteries more circular, investing in the company.
The company said the latest investments will enable it to scale its manufacturing capability and target additional sales domestically and into the Asia Pacific and North American markets.
