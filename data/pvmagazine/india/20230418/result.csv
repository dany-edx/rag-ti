The fuelling station is expected to produce 260 kg of green hydrogen per day at a pressure of 350 bar that will be utilized to fuel up to five intercity FCEV (fuel cell electric vehicle) buses, it said.
The green hydrogen fuelling station involves the establishment of a specialized and dedicated facility that will use the green energy generated on-site by a hybrid renewable energy plant to generate, compress, store, and dispense green hydrogen, utilizing a hydrogen purification system. 
As a part of the project, Jakson Green will also incorporate a battery energy storage system (BESS) backed renewable hybrid power plant within the station, making it a completely self-sustained facility. It will deploy an advanced integrated control system using cutting-edge digital technology to supervise and monitor the fuelling station’s operations. 
The company expects the project to offset 3.7 tons of CO2 per day once operational.
Bikesh Ogra, CEO and Managing Director of Jakson Green, said, “Our project reinforces hydrogen’s crucial role as a new energy transition fuel, reducing India’s dependence on imported crude oil and minimizing pollution. This sets us apart as a pioneering player in green hydrogen, and we remain committed to building infrastructure that promotes hydrogen-fueled vehicles.”
Jakson Green recently announced its global ambitions to be a leading developer and integrator of green hydrogen and green ammonia assets across select geographies and is eyeing a play in the independent hydrogen and ammonia production and electrolyzer manufacturing space. The firm is actively developing a pipeline of renewable energy, green hydrogen, and green ammonia projects, both in India and abroad.
Promoted and led by Bikesh Ogra, a renewable sector veteran with over 10 GW of experience across 26 countries, Jakson Green has secured over 1 GW of renewable energy EPC orders across India, Africa, and the Middle East regions since its inception in July last year. It plans to deliver 10 GW renewable energy assets by 2025 and 20 GW by 2030.

Ltd (ONGC), India’s largest crude oil and natural gas company, aims to reach 10 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 with a capital expenditure of INR 1,000 billion ($12.18 billion). It had an installed RE capacity of 348 MW as of May 30, 2022, and targets 5 GW by 2025. 
The state-run company sees favorable government policies and viability gap funding for offshore wind as key enablers for the energy transition. It has already signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Rajasthan government to set up renewable energy projects of 5 GW in the state and is scouting for opportunities for another 5 GW RE capacity. 
Toward achieving its goal, ONGC has partnered with Norway’s Equinor and Indian developer Greenko. 
As per the agreement signed with Equinor, ONGC, and Equinor will collaborate in exploring renewables, low-carbon fuel, carbon capture storage (CCS) as well as carbon capture utilization and sequestration (CCUS) opportunities in India. 
ONGC has teamed up with renewable energy major Greenko to tap opportunities in renewables, green hydrogen, and its derivatives including green ammonia.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/04/18/hybrid-wind-solar-power-system-for-residential-applications/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 18, 2023",Hybrid wind-solar power system for residential applications,"From pv magazine Global
Netherlands-based startup Airturb has developed a 500 W hybrid wind-solar power system that can be used for residential or off-grid applications.
“The system consists of a vertical axis wind turbine with a modified helical Savonius shape and a base with four monocrystalline panels,” CEO Serkan Kilic told pv magazine.”It has a roof load of 131 kg/m2.”
The solar base consists of a structure made of galvanized steel and rubber. It measures 1.14 m x 1.14 m x 20 mm and weighs 35 kg. It can host four solar panels with power outputs of 30 W each. It includes four Eco Line ES30M36 modules from Germany-based Enjoy Solar.
“The base can also host other types of solar panels,” said Kilic.
The small wind turbine measures 1.8 m x 1.14 m x 1.14 m and weighs 70 kg. It has a ballast weight ranging from 70 kg to 100 kg and can operate with a temperature ranging from -25 C to 60 C. Every panel is made with glass fiber reinforced polyester, weighs 1.5 kg, and measures 1.5 m x 0.7 m x 1.5 mm. 
The wind power system also includes a 300 W axial flux PMS alternator (PMSA) that converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy
characterized as a three-phase alternating current. The hybrid system features a DualVolt Hybrid Inverter with an output of 500 W.
“It is engineered, developed, and manufactured by Airturb,” Kilic said.
The device measures 540 mm x 430 mm x 139 mm and weighs 25 kg. It must be placed separately on site, with a maximum distance to the system of 25 meters. Airturb offers the systems in two versions, with or without solar panels.
“Both models are pre–assembled by Airturb and delivered on-site by the installer,” Kilic said. “Currently, only the system including the base and solar panels are available. The system without the base and solar panels is being developed and we will offer it from the third quarter of this year.”
The complete package with the solar base and the DuoVolt wind inverter costs €4,235 ($4,626), not including installation costs, according to the company’s website.
“The system is engineered, designed, and developed in The Netherlands, manufactured in Turkey and assembled in The Netherlands,” said Kilic.
