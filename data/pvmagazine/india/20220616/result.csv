The e-rickshaws, powered by second-life batteries, are scheduled to hit Indian roads as part of a pilot project in early 2023. They will be provided to a non-profit organization.
The Nunam pilot project aims to explore how modules made with high-voltage batteries can be reused after their car lifecycles and become viable for second-life use cases. The project also aims to strengthen job opportunities for women in India, in particular, as they will be given the e-rickshaws to transport their goods to markets.
Nunam is funded by the Audi Environmental Foundation. It has developed three prototypes in collaboration with the training team at Audi’s Neckarsulm site.
“The old batteries are still extremely powerful,” says Nunam cofounder Prodip Chatterjee. “When used appropriately, second-life batteries can have a huge impact, helping people in challenging life situations earn an income and gain economic independence – everything in a sustainable way.”
The startup’s primary goal is to develop ways to use old batteries as second-life power storage systems, in order to extend their lives and use resources more efficiently.
“Car batteries are designed to last the life of the car. But even after their initial use in a vehicle, they still have a lot of their power,” Chatterjee explained. “For vehicles with lower range and power requirements, as well as the lower overall weight, they are extremely promising. In our second-life project, we reuse batteries from electric cars in electric vehicles; you might call it electric mobility lite. In this way, we’re trying to find out how much power the batteries can still provide in this demanding use case.”
Rickshaw drivers primarily charge their vehicles with public grid electricity, with much of that capacity coming from coal-fired power plants. To make the e-rickshaws completely green, Nunam has developed a solar-powered EV charging station. Throughout the day, rooftop solar panels on the local partner’s premises will charge the e-tron battery, which will act as a buffer storage unit. In the evening, the power can be passed over to the rickshaws.
Nunam will also take back batteries and recycle and repurpose them for stationary applications such as LED lighting, or to provide raw materials for new battery production.
“We want to get everything possible out of each battery before recycling,” said Chatterjee.

It plans to then scale the plant to 5 GWh per year by the 2025-26 period, as long as demand continues to soar.
“The company has acquired 4.25 acres of land for the manufacturing capacity planned initially. Civil work is underway, and line and machinery will be installed towards the end of this year,” said Hiren Pravin Shah, the executive director and CEO of Replus. “We expect the plant to be operational in the last quarter of the current [fiscal year].”
The Replus factory in Pune, Maharashtra, will cater to the domestic and international markets for energy storage and electric mobility. A strong demand outlook is driving the company’s lithium battery ambitions.
“India is poised for exponential growth in the e-mobility sector. The demand is also coming for stabilizing the grid by virtue of penetration of renewables and curtailment of thermal plants. By 2030 the battery energy storage demand will be approx. 500 GWh, out of which 350 GWh will be from the e-mobility sector and around 150 GWh stationery,” said Shah. “To meet such demand, it is inevitable to have local manufacturing and establish an early supply chain network for the raw materials.”
The Indian government has allocated 50 GWh of annual cell manufacturing capacity under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic production. But Shah said this is just the starting point to set the ball rolling.
“Since only four companies could avail and benefit from the PLI scheme, other aspiring manufacturers will go ahead with their own set of plans, thus creating the need for a further stable supply chain network,” said Shah.
One good sign is that the industry sees significant activity on the raw materials front.
“Several global companies are setting up operations in India to cater to the large demand from the domestic Indian market and overseas markets like MENA,” said Shah. “Indian companies are building capabilities and capacities through innovation and diversification of their existing business lines. Aluminum, copper, nickel, manganese, cobalt, and carbon suppliers from the existing industry are developing and investing in products suitable for lithium-ion cells in the future.”
Going forward, Replus wants to recycle end-of-use batteries. It will set up a mechanism to use second-life batteries for non-critical applications and recycle them both mechanically and chemically, as part of its commitment to sustainability and lifecycle support for its products.

The capacity is part of 1 GW of solar projects won by NHPC under the third tranche of the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Program (Phase-II). NHPC has awarded the rest of the capacity to Tata Power Solar Systems (300 MW in Rajasthan) and the SSEL-ASR joint venture (100 MW in Andhra Pradesh).
The total value of the awarded projects is INR 6,604 crore ($846 million). The project completion period is 18 months, according to NHPC.
The EPC contractors will be expected to develop the grid-connected solar projects (1 GW) and a transmission line to connect to an interstate transmission system (ISTS) substation. The winning bidders will also provide comprehensive operation and maintenance services for a period of five years.
Under the CPSU scheme, state-run power producers are provided financial support to set up solar plants for self-use or for use by other government entities, either directly or through electricity distribution companies. The scheme mandates the use of domestic solar cells and modules. It provides viability gap funding to cover the cost differences between domestic and imported solar cells and modules.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/16/high-wattage-solar-modules-increase-risk-of-thermal-runaway/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 16, 2022",High-wattage solar modules increase risk of thermal runaway,"From pv magazine Global
Due to increases in efficiency and size, high-wattage solar panels are generating higher electrical currents, and thus an increased probability of heat events. Longi Solar has taken note of this as they develop solar modules, and it has released a brief analysis of its modules and junction boxes.
Junction boxes are placed on the back of solar panels, and are the interface that connects the panels to the outside world. Longi was the world’s largest seller of solar panels in 2021, so naturally they sold more junction boxes than any other manufacturer. They also predict that global solar installations will reach 1 TW each year by 2030.
The company notes that the “hot spot durability and diode thermal performance testing” logic is designed in accordance with the IEC 61215 & 62790 standards.
Longi compares its bifacial Hi-MO5 solar modules series, which has a lower front-side short-circuit voltage value of 13.9A, to a unit with a current of 18.5A. The company said lower voltages produce long-term product stability by lowering module temperatures, and associated temperature swings. It says that higher currents increase the chance of a fire.
Glass-glass bifacial solar panels do have an opportunity to reach 50 year useful lifetimes. Longi’s analysis states that a competing 18.5A module can simply upgrade its junction box to 30A protection and meet a safety margin of 1.25 (accounting for bifacial gains). However, reducing current can limit the number of modules that can be wired on a string, due to lower voltage allowances.
Additionally, the temperature range of this high-current module would place it outside of Longi’s suggested potential thermal runaway zone. Higher temperatures carry higher risks.
Longi explains that hot spots and thermal runaway can occur when modules are shaded while operating outdoors (as opposed to highly controlled lab conditions). This shading can be caused by fallen leaves, an accumulation of dust, or anything that blocks enough light to stop and reverse current, leading to thermal runaway. These hot spots can occur under fairly normal conditions, meaning these conditions must be accounted for as a design standard.
Since higher current panels tend to produce higher temperature hot spots and increased heat build up, Longi concludes that heat dissipation gear must be improved, particularly in equipment that doesn’t meet certain standards.
When these local current leaks occur regularly over decades of expected electricity generation, they silently, and permanently, reduce system output. While manufacturers could potentially mitigate the challenges of high currents with fuses and thicker copper wiring, Longi believes that starting with lower currents is the better solution, for now.

The deals include utility-scale and distributed solar plants. The contracts are with independent power producers and customers in the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment.
The customers include Desh Energy, Sundrop Power, PDL-Greene Solar Power, Omera Solar, Walton Hi-tech PLC, Beximco Textile, and Edison Power.
Longi said Bangladesh is a typical South Asian country in that it enjoys up to 1,600 hours of sunshine per year.
“Despite the hot and humid environment in Bangladesh, Longi’s Hi-MO 5 modules can not only ensure product quality and performance in an all-round way, but also minimise land use and ensure the smooth operation of power station with the highest output to achieve maximal electricity production,” the company said.
In 2020, the company supplied PV modules for the 73 MW Mymensingh solar plant, which is about 120 km north of Dhaka. In 2021, it delivered solar panels for the 134.3 MW Mongla project.
In October 2021, Longi signed a deal with Beximco for a 280 MW ground-mounted PV array. The project is expected to be connected to the grid by the end of this year.
Qing Li, Longi’s Asia-Pacific vice president, said that the company will continue to accelerate the global energy transition with “innovative” solar products.
MM Ahsan Huda, country manager for Bangladesh at Longi Solar, claimed that the company is helping Bangladesh to achieve its green energy vision.
“We are also providing technical support to local developers, power producers, and C&I clients, alongside supplying PV modules,” said Huda.
